      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10289">In [[computer science]], an '''abstract state machine''' ('''ASM''') is a [[state machine]] operating on [[state (computer science)|states]] that are arbitrary data structures ([[mathematical structure|structure]] in the sense of [[mathematical logic]], that is a nonempty [[Set (mathematics)|set]] together with a number of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] ([[operation (mathematics)|operations]]) and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] over the set).

The '''ASM Method''' is a practical and scientifically well-founded [[systems engineering]] method that bridges the gap between the two ends of system development:
* the human understanding and formulation of real-world problems ([[requirements analysis|requirements capture]] by accurate high-level modeling at the level of abstraction determined by the given application domain)
* the deployment of their algorithmic solutions by code-executing machines on changing platforms (definition of design decisions, system and implementation details).

The method builds upon three basic concepts: 
* ''ASM'': a precise form of pseudo-code, generalizing [[Finite State Machines]] to operate over arbitrary data structures
* ''ground model'': a rigorous form of blueprints, serving as authoritative reference model for the design
* ''refinement'': a most general scheme for stepwise instantiations of model abstractions to concrete system elements, providing controllable links between the more and more detailed descriptions at the successive stages of system development.

In the original conception of ASMs, a single [[software agent|agent]] executes a program in a sequence of steps, possibly interacting with its environment. This notion was extended to capture [[distributed computing|distributed computations]], in which multiple agents execute their programs concurrently.

Since ASMs model algorithms at arbitrary levels of abstraction, they can provide high-level, low-level and mid-level views of a hardware or software design. ASM specifications often consist of a series of ASM models, starting with an abstract ''ground model'' and proceeding to greater levels of detail in successive [[Program refinement|refinements]] or coarsenings.

Due to the algorithmic and mathematical nature of these three concepts, ASM models and their properties of interest can be analyzed using any rigorous form of [[Verification and Validation (software)|verification]] (by reasoning) or [[Verification and Validation (software)|validation]] (by experimentation, testing model executions).

==History==
The concept of ASMs is due to [[Yuri Gurevich]], who first proposed it in the mid-1980s as a way of improving on [[Church–Turing thesis|Turing's thesis]] that every [[algorithm]] is [[Simulation#Computer science|simulated]] by an appropriate [[Turing machine]]. He formulated the ''ASM Thesis'': every algorithm, no matter how [[abstraction|abstract]], is step-for-step [[emulated]] by an appropriate ASM. In 2000, Gurevich [[axiomatic system|axiomatized]] the notion of sequential algorithms, and proved the ASM thesis for them. Roughly stated, the axioms are as follows: states are structures, the [[state transition]] involves only a bounded part of the state, and everything is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[isomorphisms]] of structures. (Structures can be viewed as [[universal algebra|algebras]], which explains the original name ''evolving algebras'' for ASMs.) The axiomatization and characterization of sequential algorithms have been extended to [[parallel computing|parallel]] and interactive algorithms.

In the 1990s, by a community effort, the ASM method was developed, using ASMs for the [[formal specification]] and analysis ([[Verification and Validation (software)|verification and validation]]) of [[computer hardware]] and [[software]]. Comprehensive ASM specifications of [[programming languages]] (including [[Prolog]], [[C (programming language)|C]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]) and [[design language]]s ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]]) have been developed. 
A detailed historical account can be found in the [http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/AsmBook/ AsmBook] (Chapter 9) or in

A number of software tools for ASM execution and analysis are available.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with [[abstract expressionism]] (some critics have used the terms "action painting" and "[[abstract expressionism]]" interchangeably).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[New York School (art)|The New York School]] of American Abstract Expressionism (1940s-50s) is also seen as closely linked to the movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/action-painting.htm|title=Action Painting Technique: Definition, Characteristics|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/action-painting|title=Action Painting {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actions and means for creating the painting were seen, in action painting, of a higher importance than the end result.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Rosenberg created the term "action painting" in 1952, he began creating his action theory in the 1930s as a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slifkin|first=Robert|date=June 2011|title=The Tragic Image: Action Painting Refigured|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=64112998&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Oxford Art Journal|volume=34|pages=227–246|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." Clement Greenberg was also an influential critic in action painting, intrigued by the creative struggle, which he claimed was evidenced by the surface of the painting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them. "Some of the labels that became attached to Abstract Expressionism, like "informel" and "Action Painting," definitely implied this; one was given to understand that what was involved was an utterly new kind of art that was no longer art in any accepted sense. This was, of course, absurd." &amp;ndash; Clement Greenberg, "Post Painterly Abstraction".

Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who used the term "action" at first in this sense and fostered the theory of the subjective struggle with it. In his theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space, in which the artist "acts" like in an ecstatic ritual, Paalen considers ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]]; Paalen describes a highly artistic vision of totemic art as part of a ritual "action" with psychic links to genetic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two decades, Rosenberg's redefinition of art as an act rather than an object, as a process rather than a product, was influential, and laid the foundation for a number of major art movements, from [[Happening]]s and [[Fluxus]] to [[Conceptual Art|Conceptual]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]] and [[Earth Art]].

== Historical context ==
It is essential for the understanding of action painting to place it in historical context.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The action painting movement took place in the time after World War II ended. With this came a disordered economy and culture in Europe, and in America the government took advantage of their new state of importance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Jason Edwards|date=Spring 2008|title=What the Mind's Eye Sees: Action painters were postwar exemplars of American individualism|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=31308622&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=American Scholar|volume=77|pages=113–117|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the [[post-World War II]] artistic resurgence of [[expressionism]] in [[United States|America]] and more specifically [[New York City]], action painting developed in an era where [[quantum mechanics]] and [[psychoanalysis]] were beginning to flourish and were changing people's perception of the physical and psychological world; and civilization's understanding of the world through heightened [[self-consciousness]] and awareness.

American action painters pondered the nature of art as well as the reasons for the existence of art often when questioning what the value of action painting is.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The preceding art of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] had freed itself from the portrayal of objects and instead tried to evoke, address and delineate, through the aesthetic sense, emotions and feelings within the viewer. ''Action painting'' took this a step further, using both [[Jung]] and [[Freud]]’s ideas of the [[subconscious]] as its underlying foundations. Many of the painters were interested in Carl Jung's studies of archetypal images and types, and used their own internal visions to create their paintings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Along with Jung, Sigmund Freud and Surrealism were also influential to the beginning of action painting.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The paintings of the Action painters were not meant to portray objects per se or even specific emotions. Instead they were meant to touch the observer deep in the subconscious mind, evoking a sense of the [[wikt:primeval|primeval]] and tapping the collective sense of an [[archetype|archetypal]] visual language. This was done by the artist painting "unconsciously," and spontaneously, creating a powerful arena of raw emotion and action, in the moment. Action painting was clearly influenced by the [[surrealist]] emphasis on [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] which (also) influenced by psychoanalysis claimed a more direct access to the [[subconscious|subconscious mind]]. Important exponents of this concept of art making were the painters [[Joan Miró]] and [[André Masson]]. However the action painters took everything the surrealists had done a step further.

'''''Kitāb al–Milal wa al-Nihal''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:كتاب الملل والنحل, ''The Book of Sects and Creeds''), written by the [[Islamic scholar]] [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] (d. 1153 [[Common Era|CE]]), is a non-polemical study of religious communities and philosophies that had existed up to his time, considered to be the first systematic [[religious studies|study of religion]]. It was written around 1127-1128 and divides religions between sects, which have written doctrines, and creeds which do not.

A French translation of the book by Gimaret, Monnot and Jolivet was sponsored by [[UNESCO]] (''Livre des religions et des sects.'' Leuven, Peeters: vol. I, 1986, Vol. II, 1993).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15119">'''Behavioral operations research''' ('''BOR''') examines and takes into consideration human behavior and emotions when facing complex decision problems. BOR is part of [[Operations research|Operational Research]]. BOR relates to the behavioural aspects of the use of [[operations research]] in problem solving and decision support. Specifically, it focuses on understanding behaviour in, with and beyond models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952973172|title=Behavioral operational research : theory, methodology and practice|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Kunc, Martin,, Malpass, Jonathan,, White, Leroy,|isbn=9781137535511|location=[London]|oclc=952973172}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The general purpose is to make better use and improve the use of operations research theories and practice, so that the benefits received from the potential improvements to operations research approaches in practice, that arise from recent findings in behavioural sciences, are realised .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioural Operational Research (BOR)|url = http://bor.aalto.fi/ejor.html|website = bor.aalto.fi|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; BOR approaches have heavily influenced [[supply chain management]] research&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, T., Wallenburg, C.M., &amp; Wieland, A. (2017): The human factor in SCM: Introducing a meta-theory of behavioral supply chain management, International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management, 47(4), 238-262, https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPDLM-10-2015-0268&lt;/ref&gt;, amongst others.

==Overview==
[[Operations research]] (or operational research) involves a wide range of problem–solving skills aiming to help individuals or organizations to make more rational decisions as well as improving their efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Operations Research?|url=https://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/What-is-Operations-Research|website=Informs|publisher=Informs.org|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, operations research often assumes that agents involved in the process or operating system, such as employees, consumers and suppliers, make fully rational decisions. Their decisions are not affected by their emotions as well as their surroundings and that they are able to react and distinguish between different types of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Bendoly|first1 = Elliot|title = Behavioral Operations Management|url = https://www.linkedin.com/grps/Behavioral-Operations-Management-3704620|website = Linkedin|publisher = Linkedin.com|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, this is not always true; human behavior has an important role in decision making and worker motivation, and therefore should be considered in the study of operations. This has led to the rise of behavioral operations research, which is defined as the study of impacts that human behavior has on operations, design and business interactions in different organizations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toward a Theory of Behavioral Operations|url = http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0205|journal = Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management|date = 2008-03-11|issn = 1523-4614|pages = 676–691|volume = 10|issue = 4|doi = 10.1287/msom.1070.0205|first = Francesca|last = Gino|first2 = Gary|last2 = Pisano}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral operations research aims to understand the decision making of managers and tries to make improvements to the supply chain using the insight obtained. Behavioral operations research includes knowledge from a number of fields, such as economics, behavioral science, psychology and other social sciences. Traditional operations research and behavioral operations research have a common intellectual goal, aiming to make differences in operations outcomes, such as flexibility, efficiency and productivity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioral Operations - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Behavioral_Operations|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical influence==
Humans have limitations in their ability to collect and react to relevant information. When a decision or conclusion has to be made through complex information, human decision-makers often fail to comply with normative decision theories. Moreover, a person's lifestyle, social interaction and collective behaviors has clear influence on people's decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:CognitivePsychology.svg|thumb|The breakdown of Cognitive Psychology Study which refers to the study of human mental processes and their role in thinking,feeling and behaving.|194x194px]]

===Cognitive psychology===
This is a relatively new branch of psychology which focuses on humans' ability to make decisions, solve problems, learning, attention, memory and forgetting, these are only a few of the practical applications of this science, to some extent it is also related to motivation and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cognitive Psychology: The Science of How We Think|url = http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/f/cogpsych.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychology is interested in what is happening within the mind when new information is received, how people respond to this information, and how this response affects their behavior and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Cognitive Psychology? - Definition &amp; Theories - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|url = http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-cognitive-psychology-definition-theories-quiz.html|website = Study.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychology is considered to be one of the dominant theoretical force in behavioral science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cognitive psychology and instruction|last = Alan|first = Lesgold|publisher = Plenum Press, in coordination with NATO Scientific Affairs Division|year = 1977|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology===
[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|191x191px|The Asch experiment shows that participants tend to adhere to the group norms.]]
People often react and behave differently when they are put into different social situations. The aim of social psychology is to understand the nature and causes of individual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212175704/http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-02-12 |title=Social Psychology |date=2007 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |website=SimplyPsychology |publisher=SimplyPsychology |last=McLeod |first=Saul |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It questions or provides an insight of how human behavior relies on the physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Argyle, M., Collett, P. and Furnham, A. (1995). Social psychology at work. London: Routledge, p.271.&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychology theories explain why there are competition between individuals, why it is often the case that individuals or organisations seek to protect and maintain their status, and why it has been observed that individuals and organisations are willing to sacrifice efficiency to achieve their goal of staying at a higher hierarchical position. In addition to status, social psychology also includes people's behavior towards goal setting, feedback and controls, interdependence, and reciprocity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Organizational behavior===
The use of psychology in behavioral operations research links to the idea of judging the relationship between people's mental health and wellbeing and their behavior at work. Psychology experts often set up indicators to evaluate how an employee's surroundings, such as working environment and noise, can affect their productivity at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Role of Psychology in Organizational Behavior?|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-role-of-psychology-in-organizational-behavior.htm|website = wiseGEEK|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational behavior is the study of ways people react or behave when they are organized in groups. The purpose of this study is to improve business productivity, trying to create a more efficient business organization. Organizational behavior theories are applied towards human resource trying to maximize the output from individual group members. The study of organization behavior can be broken down into different sections, including Personality, Job Satisfaction and Reward Management, Leadership, Authority, Power and Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organizational Behavior (OB) Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organizational-behavior.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main streams of research==
There are four main streams of research that can be considered a part of behavior operations research. These give us an idea of the weakness of the current operations research model and the effectiveness of behavioral operations research in predicting human decisions and reactions when facing different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-technical view of technology management===
Physical technologies can be defined as a socio-technology system, which consists of humans, human activity, spaces, artifacts, tools, and communications media. This theory suggests that social interaction at the workplace is determined by the technology and techniques used at work. Therefore, a change in technology used at work can lead to unexpected consequences. This may include differences in motivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Human factor engineering===
Human factor engineering can be applied to improve workplaces, working systems and products aiming to reduce human errors during operations as well as improving human efficiency, productivity and operational performance. It often involves improvements of large machineries to reduce accidents during work. It is believed that behavior operations research can be related to human factor engineering as systematic errors, which happens very often technology and different machineries, can affect people's decision making and their interaction with the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/454.pdf|title = Human factors engineering in projects|last = |first = |date = August 2011|journal = International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 October 2015|volume = 454}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bulwhip efect.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of Bullwhip effect|300x300px]]

===The bullwhip effect===
The bullwhip effect happens along the supply chain of an organisation. This is when agents along the supply chain fail to pass on relevant and accurate information to their superior, leading to a large variation in the demand of goods and services from the customers and the supply from the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect|url = http://www.quickmba.com/ops/bullwhip-effect/|website = www.quickmba.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human behavior is a very important aspect to be considered, as decision making and emotions in the market will make a big difference to the final result of the bullwhip effect. This is because managers who can calmly make decisions while others competitors panic and deliver inaccurate messages often perform better within the industry. When the market is in poor condition, 'fear' can be an important factor affecting managers' decisions. Therefore, human behavior is closely related to people's decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect and Your Supply Chain|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232953|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===System dynamics models in operations contexts===
System dynamics models in operations contexts focuses on the importance of how components in a system interact with each other as well as providing an overview of the processes that takes place within the system. Behavioral operations research often benefits from the development of comprehensive systems models as they are able to analyse and provide an insight of the operational system. This allows the study of behavioral operations to understand how people in these settings or work conditions think about the context in which they operate. In an operations system, it often involves levers for managers to manipulate the components involved in the system. The uses of these levers are determined by human behaviors and these behaviors include feelings of stress and fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Behavioral Operations Management: Social and Psychological Dynamics in Production and Service Settings|last = Bendoly|first = Elliot|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 25 June 2015|isbn = 0199357226|location = United States|pages = 6–8|last2 = van Wezel|first2 = Wout|last3 = Banchrach|first3 = Daniel G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related problems==

===Newsvendor problem===
The [[newsvendor model]] (or newsboy or single-period or perishable) is a mathematical model used in operations management and applied economics to determine optimal level products or services to keep in stock when the demand is unknown. This model is also known as the newsvendor problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must make on time stocking decision of how many copies of newspaper to keep in stock when facing uncertain demand. If the newspaper vendor stocks too much, these newspaper may end up worthless by the end of the day as they are no longer up-to-date. However, if the newspaper vendor stocks too little, he misses the opportunity too make more profit and suffer loss of goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Newsvendor Model|last = Adelman|first = Dan|date = 1999|journal = The Operations Quadrangle: Business Process Fundamentals|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Barnes-Schuster|first2 = Dawn|first3 = Don|last3 = Eisenstein|publisher = The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business|pages = |page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assignment problem===
The assignment problem is a complex optimization problem. The problem involves number of agents and a number of tasks. The purpose is to assign each agent with a task. All agents are expected or aimed to be allocated in a way that will maximize productivity and efficiency and minimize the total cost of the assignment.

===Secretary problem===

The secretary problem can also be called the optimal stopping theory. It focuses heavily on applied probability, statistics and decision theory. The idea behind the secretary problem is that to make the best decisions when there is a pool of different options, other options are unknown, details of other options will only be given if the currently existing option is given up. The problem comes down to the idea of optimal strategy, maximizing the probability of selecting the best option.

The '''Blackstone Canal''' was a waterway linking [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] (and Narragansett Bay) through the Blackstone Valley via a series of locks and [[canal]]s during the early 19th century.

==History==

The initiative for the canal came from Providence, where a merchant community wished to profit from trade with the farming country of the Blackstone Valley and Worcester County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachushistory.org/detocqueville-visit-united-states/articles/blackstone-canal-artery-heart-commonwealth| Teachushistory.org|Blackstone Canal-artery-heart of the Commonwealth]&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Worcester and the Blackstone Valley, eager for transport that would enable them to get better prices for their produce, welcomed the plan.  However, since the trade of central Massachusetts was at that time going overland through the port of Boston, Massachusetts commercial interests succeeded in stalling the project for several years.  Finally, in 1823, the  Blackstone Canal Company was organized through an act of the Massachusetts legislature, with a Rhode Island company soon following.&lt;ref name="Muir, Diana p.112"&gt;Muir, Diana, Reflections in Bullough's Pond, University Press of New England, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;  The canal's construction may have been motivated by competition among rival industrialists to curtail "[[water rights]]".&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanely Woolen Mill, The Story |publisher=Deaneredevelopment.com |url=http://deaneredevelopment.com/stanley-woolen-mill-story.html |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720070524/http://deaneredevelopment.com/stanley-woolen-mill-story.html |archivedate=2009-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1825 and cost $750,000 (twice its initial estimate). The canal opened on October 7, 1828 when the [[packet boat]] ''Lady Carrington'' arrived in Worcester, the first vessel to make the trip. The canal brought immediate prosperity to Worcester and the Valley; farmers' profits increased and mills were built, especially in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Muir, Diana p.112" /&gt; Using water to transport goods was a great improvement over the rough roads of the era. At the time of its construction, it represented the best available transportation technology.

It was a two-day trip for the canal boats from Worcester to Providence and another two-day trip to return to Worcester. The overnight stopping point was in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]]. Boston merchants moved to recapture the trade moving down the canal to Providence, opening a rail line to Worcester in 1835.  (Boston merchants opened three railroads in 1835, one to Lowell, one to Worcester, and one to Providence, RI. These were very new technology.) In 1847 the parallel [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] began operation, and the canal closed in 1848.

The canal was 35 feet or more in width. It ascended 451 feet, passing through an original 49 locks. The canal used "slack-water" to bypass narrow valley areas and intersected the Blackstone River 16 times over its 45-mile course. It ran in the river itself for 10% of its length. These portions proved troublesome since in summer, water was sometimes too low for navigation. In other periods, flooding was the problem. Winter added ice to the issues.

Each lock was 70 feet long by 10 feet wide and apparently 4–4.5 feet deep. All, except the wooden tide lock at Providence, were built of granite on a wooden foundation. The average lift of each lock was 9.2 feet, but there were variations.

The canal was engineered by [[Benjamin Wright]] (chief engineer of the [[Erie Canal]]) and Holmes Hutchinson (later Chief Engineer of New York's canals) as they were concluding work on the original Erie Canal. Its locks are therefore similar, although smaller, than the original Erie's.

The canal followed the course of Mill Creek from the center of Worcester, MA to the southern part of that community. It then followed the Blackstone River downstream to Ashton, RI. At Ashton, it paralleled the river's west bank, maintaining elevation until it entered Cranberry and Scotts Ponds on the divide of the watershed with the Moshassuck River. It then locked down into the Moshassuck Valley and followed that stream into Providence, RI.

==The canal today==
Since the canal's closure, parts of its watercourse were filled and other segments are now heavily overgrown with brush and trees. Other sections were converted to hydraulic canals for textile mills. Much of the lock masonry was sold for other purposes. Its remains, however, are still visible in many locations. About 85% of the canal remains. Two long sections of the canal exist in the [[Blackstone River and Canal Heritage State Park]] in Massachusetts and the [[Blackstone River State Park]] in Rhode Island. Other sections are also publicly owned.

The canal is the subject of several listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The southernmost portion of the canal, between Providence and the Ashton Dam in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island]], was listed in 1971; this list was expanded in 1991 to include the entire Rhode Island section.  A {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} section of the canal in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]] and [[Northbridge, Massachusetts]] was listed in 1973; this listing was expanded in 1995 to encompass the entire historic footprint of the canal in Massachusetts.

== Significance ==
The Blackstone Canal is historically significant as a transportation network arising from a canal-building frenzy of the early 19th-century. The canal played a key role in stimulating the industry between Providence and Worcester and the towns and villages along the Moshassuck
and Blackstone Rivers. Though its useful service life was just twenty years long, the canal and the parks incorporating the canal are "visible and tangible parts of the city's and the state's history of growth, planning, commercial ambition and prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/lincoln/linc_blackstone-canal_ronci-park.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places - Blackstone Canal | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10236">The '''Code for Sustainable Homes''' is an [[environmental assessment]] method for rating and certifying the performance of new homes in [[United Kingdom]]. First introduced in 2006, it is a national standard for use in the design and construction of new homes with a view to encouraging continuous improvement in [[sustainable home]] building.  In 2015 the Government in England has withdrawn it, consolidating some standards into [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]].

==History==
The Code was officially launched in December 2006, and was introduced as a voluntary standard in England in 2007. It complemented the system of Energy Performance Certificates for new homes introduced in 2008 under the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, and built on recent changes to Building Regulations in England and Wales.

The Government-owned scheme was a successor to the [[Building Research Establishment|BRE]] [[EcoHomes]] scheme first used in 2000. BRE managed and developed the technical contents of the [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeguide/ Code standard] for and on behalf of the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG).

In 2015 with the winding down of the Government-owned Code for Sustainable Homes in England [[Building Research Establishment|BRE]] launched the new consumer facing scheme the [http://www.homequalitymark.com Home Quality Mark] in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bre.co.uk/housing-standards-review|title=BRE Group: Housing Standards Review|author=|date=|website=www.bre.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The Code works by awarding new homes a rating from Level 1 to Level 6, based on their performance against nine sustainability criteria which are combined to assess the overall environmental impact. Level 1 was entry level above building regulations, and Level six is the highest, reflecting exemplary developments in terms of sustainability.

The sustainability criteria by which new homes are measured are:

* Energy and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Air pollution|emissions]] – Operational Energy and resulting emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (different minimum standards that must be met at each level of the Code)
* Water – Internal and external [[water saving]] measures specified (minimum standards that must be met at each level of the Code).
* Materials – The sourcing and [[environmental impact]] of materials used to build the home (minimum standards present).
*Surface water run-off – Management of surface water run-off from the development and flood risk (minimum standards present).
* Waste – Storage for recyclable waste and compost, and care taken to reduce, reuse and recycle construction materials (minimum standards present).
* Pollution – The use of insulation materials and heating systems that do not add to [[global warming]].
* Health and well-being – Provision of good daylight quality, [[sound insulation]], [[private space]], accessibility, and adaptability (minimum standards present for Code Level 6 only).
* Management – A Home User Guide, designing in security, and reducing the impact of construction.
* Ecology – Protection and enhancement of the ecology of the area and efficient use of [[building land]].

==Application==
There are simple and inexpensive methods of gaining credits, like specifying compost and recycling bins, and costly methods such as installing solar [[photovoltaics]].

Compliance with higher levels of the Code is voluntary, with a long-term view for step-change increases. Landowners and agents sell sites with stipulations to build at certain Code levels.

The extra-over cost of building to Code Level 3 was valued around £2000-3000. Additionally the Code assessment cost around £2000 for a small project. The total cost was typically under 5% of a standard build.&lt;ref&gt;Code for Sustainable Homes: A Cost Review - Planning, building and the environment - Department for Communities and Local Government, 12 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Code levels pertaining to energy required a Dwelling Emission Rate (DER) a certain percentage higher than the Target Emission Rate (TER) as set in Part L1A of the Building Regulations. The October 2010 version of the Code saw Part L 2010 TER standards rise equivalent to Code level 3. Following this change Code level 4 required 25% DER improvement over Part L1A 2010 TER standards and code level 5 required a 100% improvement i.e. thermally twice as efficient. It was also anticipated that the Building Regulations as well as the minimum mandatory Code level would continue to improve until the 2016 target of 'net zero CO2 emissions' was met. Guidance was also available via the Code's simply explained published document to clarify the technical requirements.

==Reaction==
The scheme was welcomed by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] for putting [[zero energy building|zero carbon development]] at the top of the industry agenda,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwf.org.uk/wwf_articles.cfm?unewsid=279 Foundations are laid for a more sustainable future] published 2006-12-13, accessed 2011-10-05&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Association for Environment Conscious Building]] for including 'whole house’ carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newbuilder.co.uk/news/newsFullStory.asp?ID=1744 AECB congratulates the government]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vI1mbPsX?url=http://www.newbuilder.co.uk/news/newsFullStory.asp?ID=1744 |date=December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these positive reactions, even a zero carbon building would only achieve Level 1 of the Code unless further measures are taken to comply with other requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housebuildersupdate.co.uk/2007/10/drilling-down-into-code-part-3.html Housebuilder's Update: Drilling Down into the Code: Part 3] Mark Brinkley, published 2011-10-4, accessed 2011-10-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/code_for_sust_homes.pdf|title=Planning Portal|first=Planning|last=Portal|date=|website=www.planningportal.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reactions were generally welcoming, but with some reservations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newbuilder.co.uk/news/newsFullStory.asp?ID=1737 Code for Sustainable Homes could be better]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vI1ndinr?url=http://www.newbuilder.co.uk/news/newsFullStory.asp?ID=1737 |date=December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views of the scheme were not always so positive; early drafts were heavily criticised by industry commentators, both for being unnecessary (due to it being apparently modelled on the existing EcoHomes scheme) and due to its contents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buildingforafuture.co.uk/spring06/CSB.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vI1ociaW?url=http://www.buildingforafuture.co.uk/spring06/CSB.pdf |date=December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 the WWF representative on the Steering Group resigned "in despair" due to the failure of government to accept the Steering Group's advice and recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwf.org.uk/article_search_results.cfm?uNewsID=626 Government fails to get UK’s house in order on Climate Change. &amp;#124; Article Search Results &amp;#124; WWF UK]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vI1pNs8s?url=http://www.wwf.org.uk/article_search_results.cfm?uNewsID=626 |date=December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Construction Products Association]] criticised the original proposals as being confusing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingforafuture.co.uk/spring06/1-24.pdf|title=Go Green - Building for a Future|author=|date=|website=www.buildingforafuture.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sustainable Development Commission was keen that the standard was extended to cover existing homes, and covered this and other recommendations in its report 'Stock Take'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/publications.php?id=400/Stock|title=Take: Delivering improvements in existing housing • Sustainable Development Commission|author=|date=|website=sd-commission.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the government announced plans to consolidate housing regulations and standards, including the scrapping of the Code for Sustainable Homes, with its some performance standards being integrated into the Building Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.construction-manager.co.uk/news/housing-review-scraps-code-and-merton-rule-pledges/ Housing review scraps Code but pledges space standard 'where needed'], ''Construction Manager'', 16 March 2014. Retrieved: 15 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by Government in March 2015 for new developments.  The Code continues to operate for "legacy developments" in England and in Wales and Northern Ireland &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/planning-update-march-2015|title=Planning update March 2015|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green]] and [[Marian Petre]].  The dimensions can be used to evaluate the [[usability]] of an existing ''information artifact'', or as heuristics to guide the design of a new one.

Cognitive dimensions are designed to provide a lightweight approach to analyse the quality of a design, rather than an in-depth, detailed description.  They provide a common vocabulary for discussing many factors in notation, UI or programming language design.  Also, cognitive dimensions help in exploring the space of possible designs through ''design maneuvers'', changes intended to improve the design along one dimension.

==List of the cognitive dimensions==
Thomas Green originally defined 14 cognitive dimensions:

; Abstraction gradient : What are the minimum and maximum [[Abstraction (computer science)#Levels of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] exposed by the notation? Can details be [[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulated]]?

; Closeness of mapping : How closely does the notation correspond to the [[Problem domain|problem]] world?

; Consistency : After part of the notation has been [[Learnability|learned]], how much of the rest can be successfully guessed?

; Diffuseness / terseness : How many [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]]s or how much space does the notation require to produce a certain result or express a [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]?

; Error-proneness : To what extent does the notation influence the likelihood of [[user error|the user making a mistake]]?

; Hard mental operations : How much [[mental effort|hard mental processing]] lies at the notational level, rather than at the [[semantic]] level? Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or penciled annotation to keep track of what’s happening?

; Hidden dependencies : Are [[Coupling (computer programming)|dependencies]] between entities in the notation visible or hidden? Is every dependency indicated in both directions? Does a change in one area of the notation lead to unexpected consequences?

; Juxtaposability : Can different parts of the notation be compared side-by-side at the same time?

; Premature commitment : Are there strong constraints on the order in which the user must complete the tasks to use the system?

:Are there decisions that must be made before all the necessary information is available? Can those decisions be reversed or corrected later?

; Progressive evaluation : How easy is it to evaluate and obtain [[feedback]] on an incomplete solution?

; Role-expressiveness : How obvious is the [[Role (computer science)|role]] of each component of the notation in the solution as a whole?

; Secondary notation and escape from formalism : Can the notation carry extra information [[Secondary notation|by means not related to syntax]], such as layout, color, or other cues?

; Viscosity
: Are there in the notation any inherent barriers to change? How much effort is required to make a change to a program expressed in the notation?
: This dimension can be further classified into the following types:&lt;ref&gt;[http://acm.org/sigchi/chi96/proceedings/shortpap/Wilde/wn_txt.html Using Cognitive Dimensions in the Classroom as a Discussion Tool for Visual Language Design]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* 'Knock-on viscosity' : a change in the code violates internal constraints in the program, whose resolution may violate further internal constraints.
:* 'Repetition viscosity' : a single action within the user’s conceptual model requires many, repetitive device actions.
:* 'Scope viscosity' : a change in the size of the input data set requires changes to the program structure itself.

; Visibility : How readily can required parts of the notation be identified, accessed and made visible?

===Other dimensions===
In addition to the above, new dimensions are sometimes proposed in the HCI research field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dealing with New Cognitive Dimensions | citeseerx=10.1.1.18.7947 | first1 = Alan F. | last1 = Blackwell | author-link = Alan F. Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; with different levels of adoption and refinement.

Some of these candidate dimensions include creative ambiguity (does the notation encourage interpreting several meanings of the same element?), indexing (are there elements to guide finding a specific part?), synopsis ("[[Gestalt psychology#Properties|gestalt view]]" of the whole annotated structure) or unevenness (some creation paths are easier than others, which bias the expressed ideas in a developed artifact).

== User activities ==
The authors identify four main user activities with interactive artifacts: ''incrementation'' [creation], ''transcription'', ''modification'' and ''exploratory design''. Each activity is best served by a different trade-off in the usability on each dimension. For example, a high viscosity (resistance to change) is harmful for modification and exploration activities, but less severe for the one-off tasks performed in transcription and incrementation.

== Design maneuvers ==
A '''design maneuver''' is a change made by the designer in the notation design, to alter its position within a particular dimension. Dimensions are created to be pairwise independent, so that the design can be altered in one dimension while keeping a second one constant.

But this usually results in a trade-off between dimensions. A modification increasing the usability of the notation in one dimension (while keeping a second one constant) will typically reduce its usability in a third dimension. This reflects an assumption in the framework that there is no perfect interface and that trade-offs are a fundamental part of usability design.

An example of a design maneuver is reducing the viscosity of a notation by adding abstraction mechanisms. This can be done by incorporating [[Style sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]], an abstraction that represent the common styling attributes of items in a document, to a notation where each item in a document has defined its own individual style. After this design maneuver is made, an editor that changes the style sheet will modify all items at once, eliminating the ''repetition viscosity'' present in the need to change the style of each individual item.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9764">{{short description|A portion of a continent that is submerged under an area of relatively shallow water known as a shelf sea}}
{{ocean habitat topics|image=Southeastern United States continental shelf.jpg|caption=Anatomy of a continental shelf of the south eastern coast of the United States}}

A '''continental shelf''' is a portion of a [[continent]] that is submerged under an area of relatively shallow water known as a '''shelf sea'''. Much of the shelves were exposed during [[glacial period]]s and [[Ice age|interglacial periods]].

The shelf surrounding an [[island]] is known as an '''insular shelf'''.
	
The [[continental margin]], between the continental shelf and the [[abyssal plain]], comprises a steep continental slope followed by the flatter continental rise. [[Sediment]] from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a pile of sediment at the base of the slope, called the continental rise. Extending as far as 500&amp;nbsp;km (310&amp;nbsp;mi) from the slope, it consists of thick sediments deposited by [[turbidity current]]s from the shelf and slope.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 39, Gross 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The continental rise's [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] is intermediate between the slope and the shelf. 

Under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], the name continental shelf was given a legal definition as the stretch of the [[seabed]] adjacent to the shores of a particular country to which it belongs.

==Geographical distribution==
[[File:Elevation.jpg|thumb|left|350px|{{legend|#03FCDE|The global continental shelf, highlighted in cyan}}]]

Width of the continental shelf varies considerably – it is not uncommon for an area to have virtually no shelf at all, particularly where the forward edge of an advancing [[oceanic crust|oceanic plate]] dives beneath [[continental crust]] in an offshore [[subduction zone]] such as off the coast of [[Chile]] or the west coast of [[Sumatra]]. The largest shelf – the [[Siberian Shelf]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] – stretches to {{convert|1500|km|mi|sp=us}} in width. The [[South China Sea]] lies over another extensive area of continental shelf, the [[Sunda Shelf]], which joins [[Borneo]], Sumatra, and [[Java (island)|Java]] to the Asian mainland. Other familiar bodies of water that overlie continental shelves are the [[North Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The average width of continental shelves is about {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The depth of the shelf also varies, but is generally limited to water shallower than {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The slope of the shelf is usually quite low, on the order of 0.5°; vertical relief{{clarify |date=October 2018 |reason=Define this term (vertical relief). It is not widely known with precision and it is not precisely understood directly from context. The cited source is not on line and thus not easy to refer to.}} is also minimal, at less than {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the continental shelf is treated as a [[physiography|physiographic]] province of the [[ocean]], it is not part of the deep ocean basin proper, but the flooded margins of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Passive continental margin]]s such as most of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coasts have wide and shallow shelves, made of thick sedimentary wedges derived from long erosion of a neighboring continent.  [[Active continental margin]]s have narrow, relatively steep shelves, due to frequent [[earthquake]]s that move sediment to the deep sea.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topography==
[[File:Continental shelf.png|350px|thumb]] 	
The shelf usually ends at a point of increasing slope&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/539632/shelf-break|title=shelf break – geology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called the ''shelf break''). The sea floor below the break is the ''continental slope''. Below the slope is the ''continental rise'', which finally merges into the deep ocean floor, the [[abyssal plain]]. The continental shelf and the slope are part of the [[continental margin]].
	
The shelf area is commonly subdivided into the ''inner continental shelf'', ''mid continental shelf'', and ''outer continental shelf'', each with their specific [[geomorphology]] and [[marine biology]].
	
The character of the shelf changes dramatically at the shelf break, where the continental slope begins. With a few exceptions, the shelf break is located at a remarkably uniform depth of roughly {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=on}}; this is likely a hallmark of past ice ages, when sea level was lower than it is now.&lt;ref&gt;Gross 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The continental slope is much steeper than the shelf; the average angle is 3°, but it can be as low as 1° or as high as 10°.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 36, Gross 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The slope is often cut with [[submarine canyon]]s. The physical mechanisms involved in forming these canyons were not well understood until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 98, Gross 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sediments==
The continental shelves are covered by [[terrigenous]] sediments; that is, those derived from erosion of the continents. However, little of the sediment is from current [[river]]s; some 60–70% of the sediment on the world's shelves is ''relict sediment'', deposited during the last ice age, when sea level was 100–120 m lower than it is now.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 84–86, Gross 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sediments usually become increasingly fine with distance from the coast; sand is limited to shallow, wave-agitated waters, while silt and clays are deposited in quieter, deep water far offshore.&lt;ref&gt;Gross 121-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  These accumulate 15–40&amp;nbsp;cm every millennium, much faster than deep-sea [[pelagic sediments]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biota==
Continental shelves teem with life, because of the sunlight available in shallow waters, in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans' [[abyssal plain]]. The [[pelagic]] (water column) environment of the continental shelf constitutes the [[neritic zone]], and the [[benthic]] (sea floor) province of the shelf is the [[sublittoral zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 316-17, 418–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the shelves are usually fertile, if [[Anoxic event|anoxic]] conditions prevail during sedimentation, the deposits may over [[geologic time]] become [[Source rock|sources]] for [[fossil fuel]]s.

==Economic significance==
The relatively accessible continental shelf is the best understood part of the ocean floor. Most commercial exploitation from the sea, such as metallic-ore, non-metallic ore, and [[hydrocarbon]] extraction, takes place on the continental shelf. Sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the [[Convention on the Continental Shelf]] drawn up by the UN's [[International Law Commission]] in 1958. This was partly superseded by the 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf
| title = ''Treaty Series'' – Convention on the Continental Shelf, 1958

| accessdate = 2016-01-13 | date = 1958-04-29| publisher = [[United Nations]]
}} vol. 499, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone, plus continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance.

The legal definition of a continental shelf differs significantly from the geological definition. UNCLOS states that the shelf extends to the limit of the [[continental margin]], but no less than 200 nautical miles and no more than 350 nm from the [[baseline (sea)|baseline]]. Thus inhabited volcanic islands such as the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], which have no actual continental shelf, nonetheless have a legal continental shelf, whereas uninhabitable islands have no shelf.

==Building==

The Copernicus Science Centre building has been erected on the bank of the [[Vistula River]] in the very heart of [[Warsaw]] (the corner of Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie and Zajęcza streets, above the Wisłostrada tunnel). The building design was developed by young Polish architects from the firm RAr-2 in Ruda Śląska, who won an architectural competition for the Copernicus Science Centre facility in December 2005, with engineers [[Buro Happold]].

The Centre complex comprises: 
* a two-storey building with total floor-space of 15,000 square metres housing permanent and temporary exhibitions, laboratories and workshops, a conference centre, cafes and restaurants, plus office space and a distinctive rooftop garden
* a garage and a workshop on a subterranean level
* a multimedia planetarium housed within an intriguing boulder-shaped building, including an observation deck
* a surrounding Discovery Park, including open-air experimentation stations, an outdoor art gallery, and an amphitheatre.

==Permanent Exhibition==

Permanent Exhibition in the Copernicus Science Centre consists of over 400 interactive exhibits. The exhibition is divided into six sections concerning various fields of knowledge:

* On the Move
* Humans and the Environment
* Buzzz! - gallery for preschool children
* Lightzone
* Roots of Civilization
* RE: generation - gallery for young adults

==Planetarium The Heavens of Copernicus==

The Heavens of Copernicus is a modern planetarium where you can see more than just images of the starry sky and related films. The shows concern a variety of popular science issues, including from the field of astronomy, natural science and ethnography.

The shows are displayed on a spherical screen surrounding the audience on all sides. Thanks to this solution, the audience experiences a feeling of immersion in the displayed world, which is strengthened by the high quality sound system deployed around the dome.

==The ''Experiment!'' Exhibition and other activities of the Centre==
''Experiment!'' is the first exhibition to be organized by the Copernicus Science Centre. It made its premiere appearance at the [[Warsaw]] [[Science Picnic]] in June 2006, where more than 10,000 individuals visited it in a single day. Since September 2006, it has been traveling around large cities and small towns to give their residents an opportunity to try out the hands-on experiments on their own.

The Copernicus Science Centre also organizes ''Family Workshops'', where children (5–8 years old) together with their parents or carers can carry out experiments to help them better understand everyday phenomena (e.g. ''where does the current in electrical outlets come from, how does a TV set work or why does yeast make dough rise''). The children can easily repeat the experiments themselves at home.

The Centre takes part in various events popularizing science: the ''Summer'' and ''Winter in the City'' events, ''Science Festivals'' and the ''Summer with Radio'' event. For teachers, the Copernicus Science Centre organizes trainings and competitions.

==Form of organization==
The Copernicus Science Centre is a cultural institution established and financed by the [[City of Warsaw]], the [[Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Poland)|Minister of Science and Higher Education]], and the [[Ministry of National Education (Poland)|Minister of National Education]].

'''Cyanobacteria''' {{IPAc-en|s|aɪ|ˌ|æ|n|oʊ|b|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|ə}}, also known as '''Cyanophyta''', are a [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[bacteria]] that obtain their energy through [[photosynthesis]],&lt;ref name="ucmp-cyanobacteria-lh"&gt;{{cite web |title=Life History and Ecology of Cyanobacteria |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanolh.html |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are the only photosynthetic [[prokaryote]]s able to produce [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton TL, Bryant DA, Macalady JL | title = The role of biology in planetary evolution: cyanobacterial primary production in low-oxygen Proterozoic oceans | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–40 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26549614 | pmc = 5019231 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.13118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "cyanobacteria" comes from the color of the bacteria ({{lang-el|κυανός|translit=kyanós|translation=blue}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/cyan|title=cyan {{!}} Origin and meaning of cyan by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=ku/anos|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, κύα^νος|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes, are also called '''"blue-green algae"''',&lt;ref name="ucmp-cyanobacteria-lh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi-taxonomy"&gt;{{cite web | title=Taxonomy Browser - Cyanobacteria | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&amp;id=1117&amp;lvl=3 | publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information | id=NCBI:txid1117 | accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the term "[[algae]]" in modern usage is restricted to [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="Allaby 92"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1992|title=Algae|encyclopedia=The Concise Dictionary of Botany|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|date=|editor-last=Allaby|editor-first=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[heterotroph]]ic prokaryotes, cyanobacteria have internal membranes. These are flattened sacs called [[thylakoids]] where photosynthesis is performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Cyanobacteria: Molecular Biology, Genomics, and Evolution | chapter = Chapter 10.

[[Phototroph]]ic eukaryotes perform photosynthesis by [[plastid]]s that may have their ancestry in cyanobacteria, acquired long ago via a process called [[endosymbiosis]]. These endosymbiotic cyanobacteria in eukaryotes may have evolved or differentiated into specialized [[organelle]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s, [[etioplast]]s and [[leucoplast]]s.

By producing and releasing oxygen (as a byproduct of photosynthesis), cyanobacteria are thought to have converted the early oxygen-poor, [[reducing atmosphere]] into an [[redox|oxidizing]] one, causing the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] and the "rusting of the Earth",&lt;ref name="Whitton2012"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Whitton|editor-first=Brian A.|name-list-format=vanc|title=Ecology of Cyanobacteria II: Their Diversity in Space and Time|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4oJ_vi27s18C|page=17}}|date=5 July 2012|chapter=The fossil record of cyanobacteria|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-3855-3|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dramatically changed the composition of the Earth's life forms and led to the near-extinction of [[anaerobic organism]]s.

==Description==
Cyanobacteria are a group of photosynthetic bacteria, some of which are [[nitrogen-fixing]], that live in a wide variety of moist soils and water either freely or in a symbiotic relationship with plants or [[lichen]]-forming [[Fungus|fungi]] (as in the lichen genus ''[[Peltigera]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Dodds WK, Gudder DA, Mollenhauer D | year = 1995| title= T he ecology of ''Nostoc''|journal=Journal of Phycology|volume=31|pages=2–18|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3646.1995.00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They range from [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] to [[filamentation|filamentous]] and include [[colony (biology)|colonial]] species. Colonies may form filaments, sheets, or even hollow spheres. Some filamentous species can differentiate into several different [[cell (biology)|cell]] types: '''vegetative cells''' – the normal, photosynthetic cells that are formed under favorable growing conditions; '''[[akinete]]s''' – climate-resistant spores that may form when environmental conditions become harsh; and thick-walled '''[[heterocysts]]''' – which contain the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], vital for [[nitrogen fixation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meeks JC, Elhai J, Thiel T, Potts M, Larimer F, Lamerdin J, Predki P, Atlas R | title = An overview of the genome of Nostoc punctiforme, a multicellular, symbiotic cyanobacterium | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–106 | date = 2001 | pmid = 16228364 | doi = 10.1023/A:1013840025518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Golden_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Golden JW, Yoon HS | title = Heterocyst formation in Anabaena | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 623–9 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 10066546 | doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(98)80106-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fay_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fay P | title = Oxygen relations of nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 340–73 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1620069 | pmc=372871}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an anaerobic environment due to its sensitivity to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Fay_1992" /&gt;

===Nitrogen fixation===
Some cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric [[nitrogen]] in anaerobic conditions by means of specialized cells called [[heterocyst]]s.&lt;ref name="Golden_1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fay_1992" /&gt; Heterocysts may also form under the appropriate environmental conditions (anoxic) when fixed nitrogen is scarce. Heterocyst-forming species are specialized for nitrogen fixation and are able to fix nitrogen gas into [[ammonia]] ({{Nh3}}), [[nitrites]] ({{No2-}}) or [[nitrates]] ({{No3-}}), which can be absorbed by plants and converted to protein and nucleic acids (atmospheric nitrogen is not [[bioavailable]] to plants, except for those having endosymbiotic [[nitrogen-fixing bacteria]], especially the [[Fabaceae]] family, among others).

Free-living cyanobacteria are present in the water of [[paddy field|rice paddies]], and cyanobacteria can be found growing as [[epiphyte]]s on the surfaces of the green alga, ''[[Chara (alga)|Chara]]'', where they may fix nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Sims GK, Dunigan EP |year=1984|title= Diurnal and seasonal variations in nitrogenase activity (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction) of rice roots|journal= Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume= 16|pages=15–18|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(84)90118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria such as ''[[Anabaena]]'' (a symbiont of the aquatic fern ''[[Azolla]]''), can provide rice plantations with [[biofertilizer]].&lt;ref name="Azolla-Anabaena as a Biofertilizer for Rice Paddy Fields in the Po Valley, a Temperate Rice Area in Northern Italy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Azolla-Anabaena as a Biofertilizer for Rice Paddy Fields in the Po Valley, a Temperate Rice Area in Northern Italy |url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ija/2010/152158/ |work=Azolla-Anabaena as a Biofertilizer for Rice Paddy Fields in the Po Valley, a Temperate Rice Area in Northern Italy |publisher=International Journal of Agronomy |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clyndrospermum (Cyanobacteria).JPG|thumb|left|''[[Cylindrospermum]]'' sp.|219x219px]]
Many cyanobacteria form motile filaments of cells, called [[hormogonium|hormogonia]], that travel away from the main biomass to bud and form new colonies elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Risser DD, Chew WG, Meeks JC | title = Genetic characterization of the hmp locus, a chemotaxis-like gene cluster that regulates hormogonium development and motility in Nostoc punctiforme | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 222–33 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24533832 | doi = 10.1111/mmi.12552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khayatan B, Bains DK, Cheng MH, Cho YW, Huynh J, Kim R, Omoruyi OH, Pantoja AP, Park JS, Peng JK, Splitt SD, Tian MY, Risser DD | title = A Putative O-Linked β-N-Acetylglucosamine Transferase Is Essential for Hormogonium Development and Motility in the Filamentous Cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 199 | issue = 9 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28242721 | pmc = 5388816 | doi = 10.1128/JB.00075-17 | pages=e00075-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells in a hormogonium are often thinner than in the vegetative state, and the cells on either end of the motile chain may be tapered. To break away from the parent colony, a hormogonium often must tear apart a weaker cell in a filament, called a necridium.

Each individual cell (each single cyanobacterium) typically has a thick, gelatinous [[cell wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=xNQE_89dat8C|page=72}}|title=Text Book Of Botany Diversity Of Microbes And Cryptogams|last=Singh|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=9788171338894}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lack [[flagellum|flagella]], but hormogonia of some species can move about by [[bacterial gliding|gliding]] along surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.microbiologynotes.com/differences-between-bacteria-and-cyanobacteria/|title=Differences between Bacteria and Cyanobacteria|date=2015-10-29|work=Microbiology Notes|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the multicellular filamentous forms of ''[[Oscillatoria]]'' are capable of a waving motion; the filament oscillates back and forth. In water columns, some cyanobacteria float by forming [[gas vesicle]]s, as in [[archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsby AE | title = Gas vesicles | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 94–144 | date = March 1994 | pmid = 8177173 | pmc = 372955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These vesicles are not [[organelle]]s as such. They are not bounded by [[lipid membranes]], but by a protein sheath.

==Ecology==
[[File:2010 Filamentous Cyanobacteria Bloom near Fiji.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cyanobacterial bloom near [[Fiji]]]]
Cyanobacteria can be found in almost every terrestrial and [[aquatic habitat]]—[[ocean]]s, [[fresh water]], damp soil, temporarily moistened rocks in [[desert]]s, bare rock and soil, and even [[Antarctic]] rocks. They can occur as [[planktonic]] cells or form [[phototrophic biofilms]]. They are found in almost every [[endolithic ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de los Ríos A, Grube M, Sancho LG, Ascaso C | title = Ultrastructural and genetic characteristics of endolithic cyanobacterial biofilms colonizing Antarctic granite rocks | journal = FEMS Microbiology Ecology | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 386–95 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17328119 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00256.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few are [[endosymbiont]]s in [[lichen]]s, plants, various [[protist]]s, or [[Sea sponge|sponges]] and provide energy for the [[Host (biology)|host]]. Some live in the fur of [[sloth]]s, providing a form of [[camouflage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vaughan |first=Terry | name-list-format = vanc |title=Mammalogy |year=2011 |publisher=Jones and Barlett |page=21|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=LD1nDlzXYicC|page=21}}|isbn=9780763762995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic cyanobacteria are known for their extensive and highly visible [[Algal bloom|blooms]] that can form in both [[freshwater]] and marine environments. The blooms can have the appearance of blue-green paint or scum. These blooms can be [[toxic]], and frequently lead to the closure of recreational waters when spotted. [[Marine bacteriophage]]s are significant [[parasites]] of unicellular marine cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schultz |first=Nora |date=30 August 2009 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327235.000-photosynthetic-viruses-keep-worlds-oxygen-levels-up.html |title=Photosynthetic viruses keep world's oxygen levels up |publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanobacteria growth is favoured in ponds and lakes where waters are calm and have less turbulent mixing.&lt;ref name="JOHNK"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jöhnk|first1=Klaus D.|last2=Huisman|first2=Jef|last3=Sharples|first3=Jonathan|last4=Sommeijer|first4=Ben|last5=Visser|first5=Petra M.|last6=Stroom|first6=Jasper M.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Summer heatwaves promote blooms of harmful cyanobacteria|journal=Global Change Biology|date=1 March 2008|volume=14|issue=3|pages=495–512|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01510.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01510.x/abstract|issn=1365-2486|bibcode=2008GCBio..14..495J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their life cycles are disrupted when the water naturally or artificially mixes from churning currents caused by the flowing water of streams or the churning water of fountains. For this reason blooms of cyanobacteria seldom occur in rivers unless the water is flowing slowly. Growth is also favored at higher temperatures, making increasing water temperature as a result of [[global warming]] more problematic. At higher temperatures [[Microcystis]] species are able to outcompete [[diatoms]] and [[green algae]]. This is a concern because of the production of toxins produced by Microcystis.&lt;ref name=JOHNK /&gt;

Based on environmental trends, models and observations suggest cyanobacteria will likely increase their dominance in aquatic environments. This can lead to serious consequences, particularly the contamination of sources of [[drinking water]]. Cyanobacteria can interfere with [[water treatment]] in various ways, primarily by plugging filters (often large beds of sand and similar media), and by producing [[cyanotoxin]]s which have the potential to cause serious illness if consumed. Consequences may also lie within fisheries and waste management practices. Anthropogenic [[eutrophication]], rising temperatures, vertical stratification and increased [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] are contributors to cyanobacteria increasing dominance of aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paerl HW, Paul VJ | title = Climate change: links to global expansion of harmful cyanobacteria | journal = Water Research | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 1349–63 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 21893330 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2011.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanobacteria have been found to play an important role in terrestrial habitats. It has been widely reported that cyanobacteria [[soil crust]]s help to stabilize soil to prevent [[erosion]] and retain water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas AD, Dougill AJ | title = Spatial and temporal distribution of cyanobacterial soil crusts in the Kalahari: Implications for soil surface properties|journal=Geomorphology|date=15 March 2007|volume=85|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.03.029|bibcode=2007Geomo..85...17T}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a cyanobacterial species that does so is ''Microcoleus vaginatus''. ''M. vaginatus'' stabilizes soil using a [[polysaccharide]] sheath that binds to sand particles and absorbs water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belnap|first1=Jayne|last2=Gardner|first2=John S.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Soil Microstructure in Soils of the Colorado Plateau: The Role of the Cyanobacterium Microcoleus Vaginatus | journal = The Great Basin Naturalist|date=1993|volume=53|issue=1|pages=40–47|doi=10.2307/41712756|jstor=41712756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these organisms contribute significantly to global ecology and the [[oxygen cycle]]. The tiny marine cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' was discovered in 1986 and accounts for more than half of the photosynthesis of the open ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadis S | title = The cells that rule the seas | journal = Scientific American | volume = 289 | issue = 6 | pages = 52–3 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14631732 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1203-52 | url = http://guowei.ccps.tp.edu.tw/nc/UploadDocument/255_02%20The%20Cells%20that%20Rules%20the%20Sea.pdf | bibcode = 2003SciAm.289f..52N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cyanobacteria even display the [[circadian rhythm]]s that were once thought to exist only in eukaryotic cells (see [[bacterial circadian rhythms]]).
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Cyanobacteria are arguably the most successful group of [[microorganisms]] on earth. They are the most genetically diverse; they occupy a broad range of habitats across all latitudes, widespread in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems, and they are found in the most extreme niches such as hot springs, salt works, and hypersaline bays. [[Photoautotrophic]], oxygen-producing cyanobacteria created the conditions in the planet's early atmosphere that directed the evolution of aerobic metabolism and eukaryotic photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria fulfill vital ecological functions in the world's oceans, being important contributors to global carbon and nitrogen budgets." – Stewart and Falconer&lt;ref name="WalshSmith2011"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Walsh|editor-first1=Patrick J.|editor-last2=Smith|editor-first2=Sharon|editor-last3=Fleming|editor-first3=Lora|editor-first4=Helena |editor-last4=Solo-Gabriele |editor-first5=William H.|editor-last5= Gerwick| name-list-format = vanc |title=Oceans and Human Health: Risks and Remedies from the Seas|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LMZPqW-PmFYC|page=271}}|date=2 September 2011|chapter=Cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial toxins|pp=271–296|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-087782-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Photosynthesis==
While contemporary cyanobacteria are linked to the [[plant kingdom]] as descendants of the progenitor of the endosymbiotic [[chloroplast]], there are several features which are unique to this group.

===Carbon fixation===
Cyanobacteria use the energy of [[sunlight]] to drive [[photosynthesis]], a process where the energy of light is used to synthesize [[organic compound]]s from carbon dioxide. Because they are aquatic organisms, they typically employ several strategies which are collectively known as a "carbon concentrating mechanism" to aid in the acquisition of inorganic carbon ({{CO2}} or [[bicarbonate]]). Among the more specific strategies is the widespread prevalence of the bacterial microcompartments known as [[carboxysome]]s.&lt;ref name="KerfeldHeinhorst2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerfeld CA, Heinhorst S, Cannon GC | title = Bacterial microcompartments | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 391–408 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20825353 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.112408.134211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Icosahedron|icosahedral]] structures are composed of hexameric shell proteins that assemble into cage-like structures that can be several hundreds of nanometers in diameter. It is believed that these structures tether the {{CO2}}-fixing enzyme, [[RuBisCO]], to the interior of the shell, as well as the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]], using [[metabolic channeling]] to enhance the local {{CO2}} concentrations and thus increase the efficiency of the RuBisCO enzyme.&lt;ref name="LongBadger2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Long BM, Badger MR, Whitney SM, Price GD | title = Analysis of carboxysomes from Synechococcus PCC7942 reveals multiple Rubisco complexes with carboxysomal proteins CcmM and CcaA | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 40 | pages = 29323–35 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17675289 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M703896200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electron transport ===
In contrast to [[purple bacteria]] and other bacteria performing [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]], thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria are not continuous with the plasma membrane but are separate compartments.&lt;ref name="Vothknecht&amp;Westhoff20012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vothknecht UC, Westhoff P | title = Biogenesis and origin of thylakoid membranes | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1541 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 91–101 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11750665 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-4889(01)00153-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photosynthetic machinery is embedded in the [[thylakoid]] membranes, with [[phycobilisome]]s acting as [[Light-harvesting complex|light-harvesting antennae]] attached to the membrane, giving the green pigmentation observed (with wavelengths from 450&amp;nbsp;nm to 660&amp;nbsp;nm) in most cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name="Sobiechowska-Sasim_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sobiechowska-Sasim | first1 = Monika | last2 = Stoń-Egiert | first2 = Joanna | last3 = Kosakowska | first3 = Alicja | name-list-format = vanc | date = February 2014 | title = Quantitative analysis of extracted phycobilin pigments in cyanobacteria—an assessment of spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods | journal=J Appl Phycol | volume = 26 | pages = 2065–2074 | doi=10.1007/s10811-014-0244-3| pmc = 4200375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cyanobacterium-inline.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cyanobacterium-inline.svg|right|500x500px|Diagram of a typical cyanobacterial cell]]
While most of the high-energy [[electron]]s derived from water are used by the cyanobacterial cells for their own needs, a fraction of these electrons may be donated to the external environment via [[electrogenic]] activity.&lt;ref name="Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV 2010 e108212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV | title = Light-dependent electrogenic activity of cyanobacteria | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = e10821 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20520829 | pmc = 2876029 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0010821 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...510821P | editor1-last = Yang | editor1-first = Ching-Hong | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Respiration ====
[[Cellular respiration|Respiration]] in cyanobacteria can occur in the thylakoid membrane alongside photosynthesis,&lt;ref name="Vermaas_2001"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/npg.els.0001670/abstract | title = Photosynthesis and Respiration in Cyanobacteria. eLS.| last = Vermaas | first = Wim FJ | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2001 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | isbn = 978-0-470-01590-2 | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001670 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with their photosynthetic [[Electron transport chain|electron transport]] sharing the same compartment as the components of respiratory electron transport. While the goal of photosynthesis is to store energy by building carbohydrates from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respiration is the reverse of this, with carbohydrates turned back into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accompanying energy release.

Cyanobacteria appear to separate these two processes with their plasma membrane containing only components of the respiratory chain, while the thylakoid membrane hosts an interlinked respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chain.&lt;ref name="Vermaas_2001" /&gt; Cyanobacteria use electrons from [[succinate dehydrogenase]] rather than from [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] for respiration.&lt;ref name="Vermaas_2001" /&gt;

==== Electron transport chain ====
Many cyanobacteria are able to reduce nitrogen and carbon dioxide under [[Aerobic cellular respiration|aerobic]] conditions, a fact that may be responsible for their evolutionary and ecological success. The water-oxidizing photosynthesis is accomplished by coupling the activity of [[photosystem]] (PS) II and I ([[Z-scheme]]). In contrast to [[green sulfur bacteria]] which only use one photosystem, the use of water as an electron donor is energetically demanding, requiring two photosystems.&lt;ref name="Klatt_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klatt JM, de Beer D, Häusler S, Polerecky L | title = Cyanobacteria in Sulfidic Spring Microbial Mats Can Perform Oxygenic and Anoxygenic Photosynthesis Simultaneously during an Entire Diurnal Period | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 7 | pages = 1973 | date = 2016 | pmid = 28018309 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01973 | pmc=5156726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attached to the thylakoid membrane, [[phycobilisome]]s act as [[Light-harvesting complex|light-harvesting antennae]] for the photosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman AR, Schaefer MR, Chiang GG, Collier JL | title = The phycobilisome, a light-harvesting complex responsive to environmental conditions | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 725–49 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8246846 | pmc = 372933 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phycobilisome components ([[phycobiliprotein]]s) are responsible for the blue-green pigmentation of most cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/5D.html|title=Colors from bacteria {{!}} Causes of Color|website=www.webexhibits.org|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variations on this theme are due mainly to [[carotenoid]]s and [[phycoerythrin]]s that give the cells their red-brownish coloration. In some cyanobacteria, the color of light influences the composition of the phycobilisomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00250-9 | chapter = Cyanobacteria | title = Encyclopedia of Microbiology | edition = third | pages = 107–124 | first = F. | last = Garcia-Pichel | editor-first = Moselio | editor-last = Schaechter | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-0-12-373944-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kehoe DM | title = Chromatic adaptation and the evolution of light color sensing in cyanobacteria | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 20 | pages = 902930 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20457899 | pmc = 2889117 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004510107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.9029K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In green light, the cells accumulate more phycoerythrin, whereas in red light they produce more [[phycocyanin]]. Thus, the bacteria appear green in red light and red in green light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kehoe DM, Gutu A | title = Responding to color: the regulation of complementary chromatic adaptation | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 57 | pages = 127–50 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16669758 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.57.032905.105215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of complementary chromatic adaptation is a way for the cells to maximize the use of available light for photosynthesis.

A few genera lack phycobilisomes and have [[chlorophyll b]] instead (''[[Prochloron]]'', ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', ''[[Prochlorothrix]]''). These were originally grouped together as the [[Prochlorophyta|prochlorophytes]] or chloroxybacteria, but appear to have developed in several different lines of cyanobacteria. For this reason, they are now considered as part of the cyanobacterial group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palenik B, Haselkorn R | title = Multiple evolutionary origins of prochlorophytes, the chlorophyll b-containing prokaryotes | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6357 | pages = 265–7 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1731224 | doi = 10.1038/355265a0 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/355265a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..265P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Urbach E, Robertson DL, Chisholm SW | title = Multiple evolutionary origins of prochlorophytes within the cyanobacterial radiation | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6357 | pages = 267–70 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1731225 | doi = 10.1038/355267a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..267U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Metabolism ====
In general, photosynthesis in cyanobacteria uses water as an [[Redox|electron donor]] and produces [[oxygen]] as a byproduct, though some may also use [[hydrogen sulfide]]&lt;ref name="Cohen Y, Jørgensen BB, Revsbech NP, Poplawski R 19862"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen Y, Jørgensen BB, Revsbech NP, Poplawski R | title = Adaptation to Hydrogen Sulfide of Oxygenic and Anoxygenic Photosynthesis among Cyanobacteria | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 398–407 | date = February 1986 | pmid = 16346996 | pmc = 238881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a process which occurs among other photosynthetic bacteria such as the [[purple sulfur bacteria]].

[[Carbon dioxide]] is reduced to form [[carbohydrate]]s via the [[Calvin cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis | first = Robert E. | last = Blankenship | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8975-0 | pages = 147–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere are considered to have been first created by the activities of ancient cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name="Och_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Och | first = Lawrence M. | last2 = Shields-Zhou | first2 = Graham A. | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Neoproterozoic oxygenation event: Environmental perturbations and biogeochemical cycling | journal=Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 110 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 26–57 | doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.09.004 | date = January 2012 | bibcode = 2012ESRv..110...26O }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often found as [[symbiont]]s with a number of other groups of organisms such as fungi (lichens), [[coral]]s, [[pteridophyte]]s (''[[Azolla]]''), [[angiosperm]]s (''[[Gunnera]]''), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-642-30194-0_17 | title = The Prokaryotes | last = Adams | first = David G. | last2 = Bergman | first2 = Birgitta | last3 = Nierzwicki-Bauer | first3 = Sandra A. | last4 = Duggan | first4 = Paula S. | last5 = Rai | first5 = Amar N. | last6 = Schüßler | first6 = Arthur | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2013 | publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg | isbn = 978-3-642-30193-3 | pages = 359–400 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-30194-0_17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to chloroplasts==
{{See also|Chloroplast#Chloroplast lineages and evolution}}

Primary [[chloroplast]]s are cell [[organelle]]s found in some [[Eukarya|eukaryotic]] lineages, where they are specialized in performing the [[photosynthesis]]. They are known to have evolved from cyanobacteria through [[endosymbiosis]], i.e. after the engulfment of a cell by another. In this case, a photosynthesizing cyanobacteria that was engulfed in some ancient eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keeling PJ | title = The number, speed, and impact of plastid endosymbioses in eukaryotic evolution | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 64 | issue =  | pages = 583–607 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23451781 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-arplant-050312-120144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After some years of debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howe CJ, Barbrook AC, Nisbet RE, Lockhart PJ, Larkum AW | title = The origin of plastids | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

In addition to this primary endosymbiosis, many eukaryotic lineages have been subject to [[Secondary endosymbiosis|secondary]] or even [[tertiary endosymbiotic events]], that is the "[[Matryoshka doll|Matryoshka]]-like" engulfment by a eukaryote of another plastid-bearing eukaryote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archibald JM | title = The puzzle of plastid evolution | journal = Current Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = R81-8 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19174147 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2008.11.067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Within this evolutionary context, it is noteworthy that, as far as we can tell, [[oxygenic photosynthesis]] only evolved once (in cyanobacteria), and all other photosynthetic eukaryotes (including all plants and algae) have acquired this ability from them. In other words, all the oxygen that makes the atmosphere breathable for [[aerobic organism]]s originally comes from cyanobacteria or their later descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-03-oxygen-cyanobacteria.html |title=How do plants make oxygen?

==DNA repair==

Cyanobacteria are challenged by environmental stresses and internally generated [[reactive oxygen species]] that cause [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]]s.  Cyanobacteria possess numerous ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''-like [[DNA repair]] [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid27881980"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassier-Chauvat C, Veaudor T, Chauvat F |title=Comparative Genomics of DNA Recombination and Repair in Cyanobacteria: Biotechnological Implications |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1809 |date=2016 |pmid=27881980 |pmc=5101192 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.01809 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several DNA repair genes are highly conserved in cyanobacteria, even in small [[genome]]s, suggesting that core DNA repair processes such as [[homologous recombination|recombinational repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]] and methyl-directed [[DNA mismatch repair]] are common among cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid27881980" /&gt;

==Natural genetic transformation==

For bacterial transformation to take place, the recipient bacteria must be in a state of [[natural competence|competence]], which may occur in nature as a response to conditions such as starvation, high cell density or exposure to DNA damaging agents.

[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|Tree of Life in ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'' (1866). Note the location of the genus
''[[Nostoc]]'' with algae and not with bacteria (kingdom "Monera")]]
Historically, bacteria were first classified as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, which along with the Schizophyceae (blue-green algae/Cyanobacteria) formed the phylum Schizophyta,&lt;ref name=nageli&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Von Nägeli C | veditors = Caspary R | year = 1857 | title = Bericht über die Verhandlungen der 33.

later reclassified as the ''[[Prokaryotes]]'' by [[Édouard Chatton|Chatton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chatton É | title = ''Pansporella perplexa''. Réflexions sur la biologie et la phylogénie des protozoaires | journal = Ann. Sci. Nat. Zool. | volume = 10-VII | pages = 1–84 | year = 1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cyanobacteria were traditionally classified by morphology into five sections, referred to by the numerals I–V. The first three – [[Chroococcales]], [[Pleurocapsales]], and [[Oscillatoriales]] – are not supported by phylogenetic studies. The latter two – [[Nostocales]] and [[Stigonematales]] – are monophyletic, and make up the heterocystous cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name="Gugger_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gugger MF, Hoffmann L | title = Polyphyly of true branching cyanobacteria (Stigonematales) | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 54 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 349–357 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15023942 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.02744-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howard-Azzeh M, Shamseer L, Schellhorn HE, Gupta RS | title = Phylogenetic analysis and molecular signatures defining a monophyletic clade of heterocystous cyanobacteria and identifying its closest relatives | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 122 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–185 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 24917519 | doi = 10.1007/s11120-014-0020-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of Chroococales are unicellular and usually aggregate in colonies. The classic taxonomic criterion has been the cell morphology and the plane of cell division. In Pleurocapsales, the cells have the ability to form internal spores (baeocytes). The rest of the sections include filamentous species. In Oscillatoriales, the cells are uniseriately arranged and do not form specialized cells (akinetes and heterocysts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.preslia.cz/P144Komarek.pdf | title = Taxonomic classification of cyanoprokaryotes (cyanobacterial genera) 2014, using a polyphasic approach | vauthors = Komárek J, Kaštovský J, Mareš J, Johansen JR | journal = Preslia | volume = 86 | pages = 295–335 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nostocales and Stigonematales, the cells have the ability to develop heterocysts in certain conditions. Stigonematales, unlike Nostocales, include species with truly branched trichomes.&lt;ref name="Gugger_2004" /&gt;

Most taxa included in the phylum or division Cyanobacteria have not yet been validly published{{according to whom|date=June 2016}} under the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria|Bacteriological Code]], except:
*The classes [[Chroobacteria]], [[Hormogoneae]], and [[Gloeobacteria]]
*The orders [[Chroococcales]], [[Gloeobacterales]], [[Nostocales]], [[Oscillatoriales]], [[Pleurocapsales]], and [[Stigonematales]]
*The families [[Prochloraceae]] and [[Prochlorotrichaceae]]
*The genera ''[[Halospirulina]], [[Planktothricoides]], [[Prochlorococcus]], [[Prochloron]]'', and ''[[Prochlorothrix]]''
The remainder are validly published under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]].

Formerly, some bacteria, like ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', were thought to be colorless Cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name="Pringsheim1963"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pringsheim|first=Ernst Georg | name-list-format = vanc |title=Farblose Algen: Ein Beitrag zur Evolutionsforschung|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RYnPAAAAMAAJ}}|year=1963|publisher=Gustav Fischer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earth history==
[[Stromatolites]] are layered biochemical [[accretion (geology)|accretion]]ary [[structure]]s formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding, and cementation of sedimentary grains by [[biofilm]]s ([[microbial mat]]s) of [[microorganism]]s, especially cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Riding | year = 2007 | first = R. | title = The term stromatolite: towards an essential definition | journal = Lethaia | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–330 |doi = 10.1111/j.1502-3931.1999.tb00550.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stromatolites.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Stromatolites]] left behind by cyanobacteria are the oldest known fossils of life on Earth. This one-billion-year-old fossil is from [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in Montana.]]
During the [[Precambrian]], stromatolite communities of microorganisms grew in most marine and non-marine environments in the photic zone. After the Cambrian explosion of marine animals, grazing on the stromatolite mats by herbivores greatly reduced the occurrence of the stromatolites in marine environments. Since then, they are found mostly in hypersaline conditions where grazing invertebrates cannot live (e.g. [[Shark Bay]], Western Australia). Stromatolites provide ancient records of life on Earth by fossil remains which might date from more than 3.5 [[annus#SI prefix multipliers|Ga]] ago, but this is disputed.&lt;ref name="PiP"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Patterns In Palaeontology: The first 3 billion years of evolution|first=Russell J.|last=Garwood|year=2012|journal=Palaeontology Online|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1–14|url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2012/patterns-in-palaeontology-the-first-3-billion-years-of-evolution/|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}} the oldest undisputed evidence of cyanobacteria is from 2.1 Ga ago, but there is some evidence for them as far back as 2.7 Ga ago. [[Oxygen]] concentrations in the atmosphere remained around or below 1% of today's level until 2.4 Ga ago (the [[Great Oxygenation Event]]). The rise in oxygen may have caused a fall in the concentration of [[atmospheric methane]], and triggered the [[Huronian glaciation]] from around 2.4 to 2.1 Ga ago. In this way, cyanobacteria may have killed off much of the other bacteria of the time.&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;[[Nick Lane|Lane, Nick]] (6 February 2010) [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527461-100-first-breath-earths-billion-year-struggle-for-oxygen/ "First breath: Earth's billion-year struggle for oxygen"].

[[Oncolite]]s are [[sedimentary structures]] composed of oncoids, which are layered structures formed by cyanobacterial growth. Oncolites are similar to stromatolites, but instead of forming columns, they form approximately spherical structures that were not attached to the underlying substrate as they formed.&lt;ref name=Corsetti2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corsetti FA, Awramik SM, Pierce D | title = A complex microbiota from snowball Earth times: microfossils from the Neoproterozoic Kingston Peak Formation, Death Valley, USA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 8 | pages = 4399–404 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12682298 | pmc = 153566 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0730560100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.4399C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oncoids often form around a central nucleus, such as a shell fragment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gutschick RC, Perry TG | date = 1959-11-01 | title = Sappington (Kinderhookian) sponges and their environment [Montana] | journal = Journal of Paleontology | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 977–985 | url = http://jpaleontol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/6/977 | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}

Researchers from a company called [[Algenol]] have cultured genetically modified cyanobacteria in sea water inside a clear plastic enclosure so they first make sugar (pyruvate) from {{CO2}} and the water via photosynthesis. Then, the bacteria secrete ethanol from the cell into the salt water. As the day progresses, and the solar radiation intensifies, ethanol concentrations build up and the ethanol itself evaporates onto the roof of the enclosure. As the sun recedes, evaporated ethanol and water condense into droplets, which run along the plastic walls and into ethanol collectors, from where it is extracted from the enclosure with the water and ethanol separated outside the enclosure.

==Health risks==
{{main|Cyanotoxin}}
Cyanobacteria can produce [[neurotoxins]], [[cytotoxins]], [[endotoxins]], and [[hepatotoxins]] (e.g., the [[microcystin]]-producing bacteria genus [[microcystis]]), which are collectively known as [[cyanotoxin]]s.

Specific toxins include, [[anatoxin-a]], [[anatoxin-as]], [[aplysiatoxin]], cyanopeptolin, [[cylindrospermopsin]], [[domoic acid]], [[nodularin R]] (from ''[[Nodularia]]''), [[neosaxitoxin]], and [[saxitoxin]]. Cyanobacteria reproduce explosively under certain conditions. This results in [[algal bloom]]s, which can become [[Harmful algal blooms|harmful to other species]], and pose a danger to humans and animals, if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins. Several cases of human poisoning have been documented, but a lack of knowledge prevents an accurate assessment of the risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thébault L, Lesne J, Boutin JP | title = [Cyanobacteria, their toxins and health risks] | journal = Medecine Tropicale | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–380 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8830224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hc-sc1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530024705/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/cyanobacter_e.html Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) and their Toxins].

Recent studies suggest that significant exposure to high levels of cyanobacteria producing toxins such as [[beta-Methylamino-L-alanine|BMAA]] can cause [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS).
People living within half a mile of cyanobacterially contaminated lakes have had a 2.3 times greater risk of developing ALS than the rest of the population; people around New Hampshire's [[Lake Mascoma]] had an up to 25 times greater risk of ALS than the expected incidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caller TA, Doolin JW, Haney JF, Murby AJ, West KG, Farrar HE, Ball A, Harris BT, Stommel EW | title = A cluster of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in New Hampshire: a possible role for toxic cyanobacteria blooms | journal = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | volume = 10 Suppl 2 | pages = 101–108 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19929741 | doi = 10.3109/17482960903278485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
BMAA from desert crusts found throughout Qatar might have contributed to higher rates of ALS in Gulf War veterans.&lt;ref name="hc-sc1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cox PA, Richer R, Metcalf JS, Banack SA, Codd GA, Bradley WG | title = Cyanobacteria and BMAA exposure from desert dust: a possible link to sporadic ALS among Gulf War veterans | journal = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | volume = 10 Suppl 2 | pages = 109–117 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19929742 | doi = 10.3109/17482960903286066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical control==
Several chemicals can eliminate cyanobacterial blooms from water-based systems. They include: [[calcium hypochlorite]], [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulphate]], cupricide, and [[simazine]].&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"&gt;{{cite web |last= Main |first= D.C. | name-list-format = vanc |title= Toxic Algae Blooms |work= Veterinary Pathologist, South Perth |publisher= agric.wa.gov.au |date= 2006 |url= http://archive.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/lwe/water/watq/fn052_2004.pdf |accessdate= 18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calcium hypochlorite amount needed varies depending on the cyanobacteria bloom, and treatment is needed periodically. According to the Department of Agriculture Australia, a rate of 12&amp;nbsp;g of 70% material in 1000&amp;nbsp;l of water is often effective to treat a bloom.&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"/&gt; Copper sulfate is also used commonly, but no longer recommended by the Australian Department of Agriculture, as it kills livestock, crustaceans, and fish.&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"/&gt; Cupricide is a chelated copper product that eliminates blooms with lower toxicity risks than copper sulfate. Dosage recommendations vary from 190&amp;nbsp;ml to 4.8&amp;nbsp;l per 1000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"/&gt; Ferric alum treatments at the rate of 50&amp;nbsp;mg/l will reduce algae blooms.&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = May V, Baker H |year=1978 |title=Reduction of toxic algae in farm dams by ferric alum |journal=Techn. Bull. |publisher=New South Wales Dept of Agriculture |volume=19 |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simazine, which is also a herbicide, will continue to kill blooms for several days after an application. Simazine is marketed at different strengths (25, 50, and 90%), the recommended amount needed for one cubic meter of water per product is 25% product 8&amp;nbsp;ml; 50% product 4&amp;nbsp;ml; or 90% product 2.2&amp;nbsp;ml.&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"/&gt;

==Dietary supplementation==
[[File:Spirulina tablets.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] tablets]]
Some cyanobacteria are sold as food, notably ''[[Aphanizomenon flos-aquae]]'' and ''Arthrospira platensis'' ([[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spolaore P, Joannis-Cassan C, Duran E, Isambert A | title = Commercial applications of microalgae | journal = Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering | volume = 101 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–96 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16569602 | doi = 10.1263/jbb.101.87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the associated toxins which many of the members of this phylum produce, some microalgae also contain substances of high biological value, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, proteins, pigments, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christaki E, Florou-Paneri P, Bonos E | title = Microalgae: a novel ingredient in nutrition | journal = International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition | volume = 62 | issue = 8 | pages = 794–799 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21574818 | doi = 10.3109/09637486.2011.582460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edible blue-green algae reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting NF-κB pathway in macrophages and splenocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ku CS, Pham TX, Park Y, Kim B, Shin MS, Kang I, Lee J | title = Edible blue-green algae reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting NF-κB pathway in macrophages and splenocytes | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1830 | issue = 4 | pages = 2981–2988 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23357040 | pmc = 3594481 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.01.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfate polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory, antitumor, antithrombotic, anticoagulant, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and even antiviral activity against HIV, herpes, and hepatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mišurcová L, Škrovánková S, Samek D, Ambrožová J, Machů L | title = Health benefits of algal polysaccharides in human nutrition | journal = Advances in Food and Nutrition Research | volume = 66 | pages = 75–145 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22909979 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-394597-6.00003-3 | isbn = 978-0-12-394597-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first formal Village was founded in the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood of [[Boston]] in 2001.&lt;ref name = "Gross07"&gt;Jane Gross, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/health/14aging.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1368796652-drkDpZ+iqzgT3gQJD6Dc9w A Grass-Roots Effort to Grow Old at Home]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 14, 2007; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ElNasser"&gt;Haya El Nasser, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-07-26-aging26_ST_N.htm?c.. 'Villages' let elderly grow old at home], ''USA Today'', July 26, 2010; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately one dozen residents of the historic neighborhood wanted "[[aging in place|to remain at home]]" once transportation and household chores became difficult, dangerous, or even impossible. They also wished to avoid becoming dependent on their children, but did not want to move to an old-age facility.  They founded an organization to provide these services to the organization's members, who must live in Beacon Hill or the adjacent Back Bay neighborhood.&lt;ref name = "Gross06"&gt;Jane Gross, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/garden/09care.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Aging at Home: For a Lucky Few, a Wish Come True]" ''The New York Times'', February 9, 2006; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result has been called an "[[intentional community]]"&lt;ref name = "Span"&gt;Paula Span, "[http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/roommates-of-a-certain-age/ Sharing a Table, and Much More]", ''The New York Times'', October 15, 2010; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt; or a "virtual [[retirement community]]".&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"&gt;Barbara Whitaker, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/business/yourmoney/06retire.html?_r=0 These Days, 'Retirement Living' Can Mean Many Things]", ''The New York Times'', February 6, 2005; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization grew slowly, learning from its mistakes.&lt;ref name = "Gross06" /&gt;  After four years in existence, Beacon Hill Village was the subject of an article in ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref name = "Whitaker" /&gt; and the idea spread.

Villages tend to operate on one of three models.  The first, pioneered in the 1990s by Community Without Walls in [[Princeton, N.J.]], has numerous members, each of whom belongs to one of a number of "houses". Annual dues are very low or non-existent, and much of the activity of such a group is social.  Nearly all services are provided by volunteers. Members pay additional dues for further assistance and services needed.  The second form delivers both volunteer and paid help.  Dues are higher (and often subsidized for low-income members), and the level of services (which are typically provided without additional charge) tends to be more comprehensive.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt; This has been termed the "classic village model".&lt;ref name = "Moeller" /&gt;  A third model amounts to being a service exchange.

The issue of sustainability, with the related issue of growth, has arisen in a number of Villages.  In some, the founders have been surprised at the difficulty they experience in their efforts to expand membership beyond the initial group, which can impair efforts to grow the membership to the point at which a Village can become self-sustaining.  Many people approached by a Village do not feel ready to join, while the people most in need of a Village's services are less likely to hear about them.&lt;ref name = "Mandhana" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pianin1"&gt;Alex Pianin, [http://www.currentnewspapers.com/admin/uploadfiles/NW%2002-27-2013%201.pdf Cleveland Park gym spotlights senior athletes in photo display]", ''The Northwest Current'', Feb. 27, 2013, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Villages may share ideas and experiences through the Village to Village ("VtV") network.&lt;ref name = "VtVFAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mandhana" /&gt;  VtV was established in 2010 by Beacon Hill Village and [[NCB Capital Impact|Capital Impact]] in response to requests from a number of Villages.  At the end of 2014, Capital Impact withdrew from the partnership and in March 2015, the organization, formally organized as a limited liability company, was converted to a corporation, named Village to Village Network, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Village to Village Network [http://vtvnetwork.org/ homepage]; accessed 2015.04.20.&lt;/ref&gt;  It serves as a clearinghouse for inter-Village communications, and provides information to help communities establish and operate their own Villages.&lt;ref name = "VtVFAQ" /&gt;  It further organizes an annual meeting, the National Village Gathering, at which local Village officers and staffers may meet those from other Villages to share information and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Village to Village Network, "[http://www.vtvnetwork.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=691012&amp;module_id=156268 The 2014 National Village Gathering]"; accessed 2014.09.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">'''Engineering mathematics''' is a branch of [[applied mathematics]] concerning [[mathematical models|mathematical methods and techniques]] that are typically used in [[engineering]] and [[manufacturing|industry]]. Along with fields like [[engineering physics]] and [[engineering geology]], both of which may belong in the wider category [[engineering science]], engineering mathematics is an [[interdisciplinary]] subject motivated by engineers' needs both for [[practical]], [[theoretical]] and other considerations outwith their specialization, and to deal with constraints to be effective in their work.

==Description==
Historically, engineering mathematics consisted mostly of [[Mathematical analysis|applied analysis]], most notably: [[differential equations]]; [[real analysis|real]] and [[complex analysis]] (including [[vector analysis|vector]] and [[tensor analysis]]); [[approximation theory]] (broadly construed, to include  [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]], [[Calculus of variations|variational]], and [[perturbation theory|perturbative methods]], [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]]s, [[numerical analysis]]); [[Fourier analysis]]; [[potential theory]]; as well as  [[linear algebra]] and applied [[probability]], outside of analysis.  These areas of mathematics were intimately tied to the development of [[Newtonian physics]], and the [[mathematical physics]] of that period.  This history also left a legacy: until the early 20th century subjects such as [[classical mechanics]] were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities, and [[fluid mechanics]] may still be taught in (applied) mathematics  as well as engineering departments.&lt;ref name=Stolz2002&gt;{{Citation

The success of modern numerical computer methods and software has led to the emergence of [[computational mathematics]], [[computational science]], and [[computational engineering]] (the last two are sometimes lumped together and abbreviated as '''CS&amp;E'''), which occasionally use [[high-performance computing]] for the [[simulation]] of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary fields, but are also of interest to engineering mathematics.&lt;ref&gt; T.J. Fairclough, [http://mathapps.net/compalg/compalg.pdf Engineering Mathematics and Computer Algebra.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized branches include [[engineering optimization]] and [[engineering statistics]].

Engineering mathematics in [[tertiary education]] typically consists of mathematical methods and models courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2974079?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents  Minimum Courses in Engineering Mathematics,] S. Epsteen.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="125633">'''Field electron emission''' (also known as '''field emission''' ('''FE''') and '''electron field emission''') is emission of [[electron]]s induced by an electrostatic field. The most common context is field emission from a solid surface into vacuum. However, field emission can take place from solid or liquid surfaces, into vacuum, air, a fluid, or any non-conducting or weakly conducting dielectric. The field-induced promotion of electrons from the valence to conduction band of semiconductors (the [[Zener effect]]) can also be regarded as a form of field emission. The terminology is historical because related phenomena of surface photoeffect, [[thermionic emission]] (or [[Richardson–Dushman effect]]) and "cold electronic emission", i.e. the emission of electrons in strong static (or quasi-static) electric fields, were discovered and studied independently from the 1880s to 1930s. When field emission is used without qualifiers it typically means "cold emission".

Field emission in pure metals occurs in high electric fields: the gradients are typically higher than 1 gigavolt per metre and strongly dependent upon the [[work function]]. While electron sources based on field emission have a number of applications, field emission is most commonly an undesirable primary source of [[Electrical breakdown|vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge]] phenomena, which engineers work to prevent. Examples of applications for surface field emission include construction of bright electron sources for high-resolution [[electron microscope]]s or the discharge of induced charges from [[spacecraft]]. Devices which eliminate induced charges are termed [[Electrostatics#Charge neutralization|charge-neutralizers]].

Field emission was explained by [[quantum tunneling]] of electrons in the late 1920s. This was one of the triumphs of the nascent [[quantum mechanics]]. The theory of field emission from bulk metals was proposed by [[Ralph H. Fowler]] and [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim]].&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electron Emission in Intense Electric Fields|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|date=1928-05-01|first=R.H.|last=Fowler|author2=Dr. L. Nordheim|volume=119|issue=781|pages=173–181|doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0091|url=http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/lc/wkshp/RFBreakdwn/references/fowler.pdf|accessdate=2009-10-26|bibcode = 1928RSPSA.119..173F }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A family of approximate equations, "Fowler–Nordheim equations", is named after them. Strictly, Fowler–Nordheim equations apply only to field emission from bulk metals and (with suitable modification) to other bulk [[crystalline solid]]s, but they are often used – as a rough approximation – to describe field emission from other materials.

==Terminology and conventions==
''Field electron emission'', ''field-induced electron emission'', ''field emission'' and ''electron field emission'' are general names for this experimental phenomenon and its theory. The first name is used here.

''[[#Fowler–Nordheim tunneling|Fowler–Nordheim tunneling]]'' is the wave-mechanical tunneling of electrons through a rounded triangular barrier created at the surface of an electron conductor by applying a very high electric field. Individual electrons can escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from many materials in various different circumstances.

''[[#Cold field electron emission|Cold field electron emission]]'' (CFE) is the name given to a particular statistical emission regime, in which the electrons in the emitter are initially in internal [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], and in which most emitted electrons escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from electron states close to the emitter [[Fermi level]]. (By contrast, in the [[Thermionic emission|Schottky emission]] regime, most electrons escape over the top of a field-reduced barrier, from states well above the Fermi level.) Many solid and liquid materials can emit electrons in a CFE regime if an electric field of an appropriate size is applied.

''[[#Fowler–Nordheim-type equation|Fowler–Nordheim-type equations]]'' are a family of approximate equations derived to describe CFE from the internal electron states in bulk metals. The different members of the family represent different degrees of approximation to reality. Approximate equations are necessary because, for physically realistic models of the tunneling barrier, it is mathematically impossible in principle to solve the [[Schrödinger equation]] exactly in any simple way. There is no theoretical reason to believe that Fowler-Nordheim-type equations validly describe field emission from materials other than bulk crystalline solids.

For metals, the CFE regime extends to well above room temperature. There are other electron emission regimes (such as "[[Thermionic emission|thermal electron emission]]" and "[[Thermionic emission|Schottky emission]]") that require significant external heating of the emitter. There are also emission regimes where the internal electrons are not in thermodynamic equilibrium and the emission current is, partly or completely, determined by the supply of electrons to the emitting region. A non-equilibrium emission process of this kind may be called field (electron) emission if most of the electrons escape by tunneling, but strictly it is not CFE, and is not accurately described by a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation.

Care is necessary because in some contexts (e.g. spacecraft engineering), the name "field emission" is applied to the field-induced emission of ions (field ion emission), rather than electrons, and because in some theoretical contexts "field emission" is used as a general name covering both field electron emission and field ion emission.

Historically, the phenomenon of field electron emission has been known by a variety of names, including "the aeona effect", "autoelectronic emission", "cold emission", "cold cathode emission", "field emission", "field electron emission" and "electron field emission".

Equations in this article are written using the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ). This is the modern (post-1970s) international system, based around the rationalized-meter-kilogram-second (rmks) system of equations, which is used to define SI units. Older field emission literature (and papers that directly copy equations from old literature) often write some equations using an older equation system that does not use the quantity [[Vacuum permittivity|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In this article, all such equations have been converted to modern international form. For clarity, this should always be done.

Since work function is normally given in electronvolts (eV), and it is often convenient to measure fields in volts per nanometer (V/nm), values of most universal constants are given here in units involving the eV, V and nm. Increasingly, this is normal practice in field emission research. However, all equations here are ISQ-compatible equations and remain dimensionally consistent, as is required by the modern international system. To indicate their status, numerical values of universal constants are given to seven significant figures. Values are derived using the 2006 values of the fundamental constants.

==Early history of field electron emission==
Field electron emission has a long, complicated and messy history. This section covers the early history, up to the derivation of the original Fowler–Nordheim-type equation in 1928.

In retrospect, it seems likely that the electrical discharges reported by Winkler&lt;ref name=Winkler1744&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gedanken von den Eigenschaften, Wirkungen und Ursachen der Electricität nebst Beschreibung zweiner electrischer Maschinen|year = 1744|author = Winkler, J.H.|publisher = Book Chapter Breitkopf|location = Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1744 were started by CFE from his wire electrode. However, meaningful investigations had to wait until after [[J.J. Thomson]]'s&lt;ref name=Thomson1897&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cathode Rays|date = October 1897|last = Thomson|first = J.J.|authorlink=J. J. Thomson|journal = Phil. Mag.|pages = 293–316|volume = 44|issue = 269|series = 5th series|doi = 10.1080/14786449708621070|url = https://archive.org/details/londonedinburg5441897lond}}&lt;/ref&gt; identification of the electron in 1897, and until after it was understood – from [[thermionic emission|thermal emission]]&lt;ref name=Richardson1916&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Emission of Electricity from Hot Bodies|year = 1916|last = Richardson|first = O.W.|publisher =Longmans|location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[photoemission|photo-emission]]&lt;ref name=Einstein1905&gt;{{cite journal|title = On a heuristic point of view about the creation and conversion of light|year = 1905|last = Einstein|first = A.|journal = Ann. Phys. Chem.|pages = 132–148|volume = 17|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..132E |doi = 10.1002/andp.19053220607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; work – that electrons could be emitted from inside metals (rather than from [[adsorption|surface-adsorbed gas molecules]]), and that – in the absence of applied fields – electrons escaping from metals had to overcome a work function barrier.

It was suspected at least as early as 1913 that field-induced emission was a separate physical effect.&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{cite journal|title = Thermionic phenomena and the laws which govern them|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1928/richardson-lecture.pdf|last1 = Richardson|first1 = O.W.|journal = Nobel Lectures, Physics 1922-1941|year = 1929|accessdate = 2009-10-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only after vacuum and specimen cleaning techniques had significantly improved, did this become well established. [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld|Lilienfeld]] (who was primarily interested in electron sources for medical [[X-ray]] applications) published in 1922&lt;ref name=Lilienfeld1922&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1922|last = Lilienfeld|first = J. E.|journal = Am. J. Roentgenol.|page = 192|volume = 9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first clear account in English of the experimental phenomenology of the effect he had called "autoelectronic emission". He had worked on this topic, in Leipzig, since about 1910. Kleint describes this and other early work.&lt;ref name=Kleint1993&gt;{{cite journal|title = On the early history of field emission including attempts of tunneling spectroscopy|year = 1993|author = Kleint, C.|journal = Progress in surface science|pages = 101–115|volume = 42|issue = 1–4|doi=10.1016/0079-6816(93)90064-3|bibcode = 1993PrSS...42..101K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleint2004&gt;{{cite journal|title = Comments and references relating to early work in field electron emission|year = 2004|author = Kleint, C.|journal = Surface and Interface Analysis|pages = 387–390|volume = 36|issue = 56|doi=10.1002/sia.1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1922, experimental interest increased, particularly in the groups led by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan]] at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in [[Pasadena, California]],&lt;ref name=Millikan1926&gt;{{cite journal|title = Laws governing the pulling of electrons out of metals under intense electrical fields|year = 1926|journal = Phys.

S. |last=Gossling |title=The emission of electrons under the influence of intense electric fields |journal=[[Phil. Mag.]] |issue=3 |volume=1 |series=7th series |year=1926 |pages=609–635 |doi=10.1080/14786442608633662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to understand autoelectronic emission included plotting experimental current–voltage (''i–V'') data in different ways, to look for a straight-line relationship. Current increased with voltage more rapidly than linearly, but plots of type log(''i'') vs. ''V'' were not straight.{{r|Millikan1926}} [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Über kalte und warme Elektronenentladungen|date = December 1923|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik A|pages = 63–106|volume = 14|issue = 63|last1 = Schottky |first1 = W.|authorlink1 = Walter H. Schottky |doi=10.1007/bf01340034|bibcode = 1923ZPhy...14...63S }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested in 1923 that the effect might be due to thermally induced emission over a field-reduced barrier. If so, then plots of log(''i'') vs. {{sqrt|''V''}} should be straight, but they were not.{{r|Millikan1926}} Nor is Schottky's explanation compatible with the experimental observation of only very weak temperature dependence in CFE{{r|Lilienfeld1922}} – a point initially overlooked.{{r|Richardson}}

A breakthrough came when [[Charles Christian Lauritsen|Lauritsen]]&lt;ref name=Millikan&gt;{{cite journal|title = Relations of field-currents to thermionic-currents|year = 1928|journal = [[PNAS]]|pages = 45–49|volume = 14|issue = 1|last1 = Millikan|first1 = R.A.|authorlink1 = Robert Andrews Millikan|last2 = Lauritsen|first2 = C.C.|authorlink2 = Charles Christian Lauritsen|doi = 10.1073/pnas.14.1.45|pmid = 16587302|pmc = 1085345|bibcode = 1928PNAS...14...45M|url = http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS::MILpnas28a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(and [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] independently&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer1928&gt;{{cite journal|title = Three notes on the quantum theory of aperiodic effects|year = 1928|author = Oppenheimer, J.R.|journal = Physical Review|pages = 66–81|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.31.66|bibcode = 1928PhRv...31...66O }}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that plots of log(''i'') vs. 1/''V'' yielded good straight lines. This result, published by Millikan and Lauritsen{{r|Millikan}} in early 1928, was known to [[Ralph H. Fowler|Fowler]] and [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim|Nordheim]].

[[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] had predicted{{r|Oppenheimer1928}} that the field-induced tunneling of electrons from atoms (the effect now called field ionization) would have this ''i''(''V'') dependence, had found this dependence in the published experimental field emission results of Millikan and Eyring,{{r|Millikan1926}} and proposed that CFE was due to field-induced [[quantum tunnelling|tunneling]] of electrons [[atomic orbital|from atomic-like orbitals]] in surface metal atoms. An alternative Fowler–Nordheim theory{{r|Fowler1928}} explained both the Millikan-Lauritsen finding and the very weak dependence of current on temperature. Fowler–Nordheim theory predicted both to be consequences if CFE were due to field-induced tunneling from [[free electron model|free-electron-type states]] in what we would now call a metal [[electronic band structure|conduction band]], with the electron states occupied in accordance with [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].

In fact, [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] (although right in principle about the theory of field ionization) had mathematical details of his theory seriously incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Theory of the ionization of the hydrogen atom by an external electrostatic field|year = 1977|journal = Physical Review A|pages = 877–890|volume = 16|issue = 3|last1 = Yamabe|first1 = T.|last2 = Tachibana|first2 = A.|last3 = Silverstone|first3 = H.J.|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.16.877|bibcode = 1977PhRvA..16..877Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a small numerical error in the final equation given by Fowler–Nordheim theory for CFE [[current density]]: this was corrected in the 1929 paper of {{Harv|Stern|Gossling|Fowler|1929}}.&lt;ref name=Fowler1929&gt;{{cite journal|title = Further studies in the emission of electrons from cold metals|jstor = 95240|year = 1929|journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|pages = 699–723|last1 = Stern|first1 = T.E.|last2 = Gossling|first2 = B.S. |last3 = Fowler|first3 = R.H.|volume = 124|issue = 795|doi=10.1098/rspa.1929.0147|bibcode = 1929RSPSA.124..699S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly, if the barrier field in Fowler-Nordheim 1928 theory is exactly proportional to the applied voltage, and if the emission area is independent of voltage, then the Fowler-Nordheim 1928 theory predicts that plots of the form (log(''i''/''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) vs. 1/''V'') should be exact straight lines. However, contemporary experimental techniques were not good enough to distinguish between the Fowler-Nordheim theoretical result and the Millikan-Lauritsen experimental result.

Thus, by 1928 basic physical understanding of the origin of CFE from bulk metals had been achieved, and the original Fowler-Nordheim-type equation had been derived.

The literature often presents Fowler-Nordheim work as a proof of the existence of [[quantum tunnelling|electron tunneling]], as predicted by wave-mechanics. Whilst this is correct, the validity of wave-mechanics was largely accepted by 1928. The more important role of the Fowler-Nordheim paper was that it was a convincing argument from experiment that [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] applied to the behavior of electrons in metals, as suggested by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]]&lt;ref name=Sommerfeld1927&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1927|author = Sommerfeld, A.|journal = Naturwissenschaften|page = 825|volume = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1927. The success of Fowler–Nordheim theory did much to support the correctness of Sommerfeld's ideas, and greatly helped to establish modern [[Electronic band structure|electron band theory]].&lt;ref name=som1963&gt;{{cite journal|title = Handbuch der Physik|year = 1963|journal = Julius Springer-Verlag|volume = 24|last1 = Sommerfeld|first1 = A.|last2= Beth|first2 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the original Fowler-Nordheim-type equation was one of the first to incorporate the [[Statistical mechanics|statistical-mechanical]] consequences of the existence of [[electron spin]] into the theory of an experimental condensed-matter effect. The Fowler-Nordheim paper also established the physical basis for a unified treatment of field-induced and [[Thermionic emission|thermally induced electron emission]].{{r|som1963}} Prior to 1928 it had been hypothesized that two types of electrons, "thermions" and "conduction electrons", existed in metals, and that thermally emitted electron currents were due to the emission of thermions, but that field-emitted currents were due to the emission of conduction electrons. The Fowler-Nordheim 1928 work suggested that thermions did not need to exist as a separate class of internal electrons: electrons could come from a single [[Electronic band structure|band]] occupied in accordance with Fermi–Dirac statistics, but would be emitted in statistically different ways under different conditions of temperature and applied field.

The ideas of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]], [[Ralph H. Fowler|Fowler]] and [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim|Nordheim]] were also an important stimulus to the development, by [[George Gamow|Gamow]],&lt;ref&gt;''Z. Physik'' '''5'''1, 204 (1928) G. Gamow, "Zur Quantentheorie des Atomkernes".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ronald W.

==Practical applications: past and present==

===Field electron microscopy and related basics===
As already indicated, the early experimental work on field electron emission (1910–1920) &lt;ref name="Lilienfeld1922"/&gt; was driven by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld|Lilienfeld's]] desire to develop miniaturized [[X-ray]] tubes for medical applications. However, it was too early for this technology to succeed.

After Fowler-Nordheim theoretical work in 1928, a major advance came with the development in 1937 by [[Erwin Wilhelm Mueller|Erwin W. Mueller]] of the spherical-geometry [[field emission microscope|field electron microscope]] (FEM) &lt;ref name=Mueller1937&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1937|author = Mueller, E.W.|journal = Z. Phys.|pages = 541–550|volume = 106|doi = 10.1007/BF01339895|title = Elektronenmikroskopische Beobachtungen von Feldkathoden|bibcode = 1937ZPhy..106..541M|issue = 9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the "field emission microscope"). In this instrument, the electron emitter is a sharply pointed wire, of apex radius ''r''. This is placed, in a vacuum enclosure, opposite an image detector (originally a phosphor screen), at a distance ''R'' from it. The microscope screen shows a projection image of the distribution of current-density ''J'' across the emitter apex, with magnification approximately (''R''/''r''), typically 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. In FEM studies the apex radius is typically 100&amp;nbsp;nm to 1 μm. The tip of the pointed wire, when referred to as a physical object, has been called a "field emitter", a "tip", or (recently) a "Mueller emitter".

When the emitter surface is clean, this FEM image is characteristic of: (a) the material from which the emitter is made: (b) the orientation of the material relative to the needle/wire axis; and (c) to some extent, the shape of the emitter endform. In the FEM image, dark areas correspond to regions where the local work function ''φ'' is relatively high and/or the local barrier field ''F'' is relatively low, so ''J'' is relatively low; the light areas correspond to regions where ''φ'' is relatively low and/or ''F'' is relatively high, so ''J'' is relatively high. This is as predicted by the exponent of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations [see eq. (30) below].

The [[adsorption]] of layers of gas atoms (such as oxygen) onto the emitter surface, or part of it, can create surface [[electric dipole]]s that change the local work function of this part of the surface. This affects the FEM image; also, the change of work-function can be measured using a Fowler-Nordheim plot (see below). Thus, the FEM became an early observational tool of [[surface science]].&lt;ref name=Gomer1961&gt;{{Cite book|title = Field emission and field ionization|year = 1961|author = Gomer, R.|publisher = Harvard Univ. Press|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn = 1-56396-124-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Recent advances in field electron microscopy of metals|year = 1975|journal =Advances in Electronics and Electron Physics|pages = 193–309|volume = 32|last1 = Swanson|first1 = L.W.|last2 = Bell|first2 = A.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 1960s, FEM results contributed significantly to discussions on [[heterogeneous catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;"The role of the adsorbed state in heterogeneous catalysis", Discuss. Faraday Soc., Vol. 41 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; FEM has also been used for studies of [[surface diffusion|surface-atom diffusion]]. However, FEM has now been almost completely superseded by newer surface-science techniques.

A consequence of FEM development, and subsequent experimentation, was that it became possible to identify (from FEM image inspection) when an emitter was "clean", and hence exhibiting its clean-surface work-function as established by other techniques. This was important in experiments designed to test the validity of the standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation.&lt;ref name=Dyke1953&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Field emission: Large current densities, space charge, and the vacuum arc

Agreement to within about 10% was achieved. Only very recently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Field emission from crystalline niobium|year = 2009|journal = Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams

Analysis of the resulting Fowler-Nordheim plot yields a work-function value close to the independently known work-function of the emitter.

===Field electron spectroscopy (electron energy analysis)===
Energy distribution measurements of field-emitted electrons were first reported in 1939.&lt;ref name=AH39/&gt; In 1959 it was realized theoretically by Young,&lt;ref name=Y59&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.113.110|title=Theoretical Total-Energy Distribution of Field-Emitted Electrons|year=1959|last1=Young|first1=Russell D.|journal=Physical Review|volume=113|pages=110–114|bibcode = 1959PhRv..113..110Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed experimentally by Young and Mueller&lt;ref name=YM59&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.113.115|title=Experimental Measurement of the Total-Energy Distribution of Field-Emitted Electrons|year=1959|last1=Young|first1=Russell D.|last2=Müller|first2=Erwin W.|journal=Physical Review|volume=113|pages=115–120|bibcode = 1959PhRv..113..115Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the quantity measured in spherical geometry was the distribution of the total energy of the emitted electron (its "total energy distribution"). This is because, in spherical geometry, the electrons move in such a fashion that [[angular momentum]] about a point in the emitter is very nearly conserved. Hence any [[kinetic energy]] that, at emission, is in a direction parallel to the emitter surface gets converted into energy associated with the radial direction of motion. So what gets measured in an energy analyzer is the [[total energy]] at emission.

With the development of sensitive electron energy analyzers in the 1960s, it became possible to measure fine details of the total energy distribution. These reflect fine details of the [[surface physics]], and the technique of Field Electron Spectroscopy flourished for a while, before being superseded by newer surface-science techniques.&lt;ref name=mo84&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

===Field electron emitters as electron-gun sources===
To achieve high-resolution in [[transmission electron microscope|electron microscopes]] and other electron beam instruments (such as those used for [[electron beam lithography]]), it is helpful to start with an electron source that is small, optically bright and stable. Sources based on the geometry of a Mueller emitter qualify well on the first two criteria. The first [[electron microscope]] (EM) observation of an individual atom was made by Crewe, Wall and Langmore in 1970,&lt;ref name=CWL70&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.168.3937.1338|title=Visibility of Single Atoms|year=1970|last1=Crewe|first1=A.

From the 1950s onwards, extensive effort has been devoted to the development of field emission sources for use in [[electron gun]]s.&lt;ref name=Ch95&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0169-4332(95)00517-X|title=Developing and using the field emitter as a high intensity electron source|year=1996|last1=Charbonnier|first1=F|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=94-95|pages=26–43|bibcode = 1996ApSS...94...26C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OR08&gt;{{cite book|editor=J.Orloff|title=Handbook of Charged Particle Optics|edition=2|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Swanson and A.E. Bell, Adv. Electron. Electron Phys. 32 (1973) 193&lt;/ref&gt; [e.g., DD53] Methods have been developed for generating on-axis beams, either by field-induced emitter build-up, or by selective deposition of a low-work-function [[adsorption|adsorbate]] (usually [[Zirconium oxide]] - ZrO) into the flat apex of a [[Miller index|(100) oriented]] [[Tungsten]] emitter.&lt;ref name=Sw75&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.568503|title=Comparative study of the zirconiated and built-up W thermal-field cathode|year=1975|last1=Swanson|first1=L. W.|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology|volume=12|page=1228|bibcode = 1975JVST...12.1228S|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources that operate at room temperature have the disadvantage that they rapidly become covered with adsorbate [[molecule]]s that arrive from the [[vacuum]] system walls, and the emitter has to be cleaned from time to time by "flashing" to high temperature. Nowadays, it is more common to use Mueller-emitter-based sources that are operated at elevated temperatures, either in the [[Thermionic emission|Schottky emission]] regime or in the so-called temperature-field intermediate regime. Many modern high-resolution electron microscopes and electron beam instruments use some form of Mueller-emitter-based electron source. Currently, attempts are being made to develop [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs) as electron-gun field emission sources.&lt;ref name=Milne/&gt;&lt;ref name=JB04&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.2004.1438|title=Carbon nanotube electron sources and applications|year=2004|last1=De Jonge|first1=Niels|last2=Bonard|first2=Jean-Marc|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|volume=362|pages=2239–66|pmid=15370480|issue=1823|bibcode = 2004RSPTA.362.2239D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of field emission sources in electron optical instruments has involved the development of appropriate theories of charged particle optics,&lt;ref name=OR08/&gt;&lt;ref name=HK96&gt;{{cite book|author1=P.W. Hawkes |author2=E. Kaspar |title=Principles of Electron Optics|publisher=Academic Press, London|year= 1996|chapter=44,45|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of related modeling. Various shape models have been tried for Mueller emitters; the best seems to be the "Sphere on Orthogonal Cone" (SOC) model introduced by Dyke, Trolan. Dolan and Barnes in 1953.&lt;ref name=DTDB53&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1721330|title=The Field Emitter: Fabrication, Electron Microscopy, and Electric Field Calculations|year=1953|last1=Dyke|first1=W.

The design of efficient modern field-emission electron guns requires highly specialized expertise.

===Atomically sharp emitters===
Nowadays it is possible to prepare very sharp emitters, including emitters that end in a single atom. In this case, electron emission comes from an area about twice the crystallographic size of a single atom. This was demonstrated by comparing FEM and [[field ion microscope]] (FIM) images of the emitter.&lt;ref name=Fi88&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/38/2/029|title=Point source for ions and electrons|year=1988|last1=Fink|first1=Hans-Werner|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=38|pages=260–263|bibcode = 1988PhyS...38..260F|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-atom-apex Mueller emitters also have relevance to the [[scanning probe microscopy]] and [[scanning Helium Ion Microscope|helium scanning ion microscopy]] (He SIM).&lt;ref name=WNB06&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.2357967|title=Helium ion microscope: A new tool for nanoscale microscopy and metrology|year=2006|last1=Ward|first1=B.

===Large-area field emission sources: vacuum nanoelectronics===

====Materials aspects====
Large-area field emission sources have been of interest since the 1970s. In these devices, a high density of individual field emission sites is created on a substrate (originally silicon). This research area became known, first as "vacuum microelectronics", now as "vacuum nanoelectronics".

One of the original two device types, the "[[Spindt tip|Spindt array]]",&lt;ref name=SBHW76&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.322600|title=Physical properties of thin-film field emission cathodes with molybdenum cones|year=1976|last1=Spindt|first1=C. A.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=47|pages=5248–5263|bibcode = 1976JAP....47.5248S|issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[integrated circuit|silicon-integrated-circuit (IC)]] fabrication techniques to make regular arrays in which [[molybdenum]] cones were deposited in small cylindrical voids in an oxide film, with the void covered by a counterelectrode with a central circular aperture. This overall geometry has also been used with [[carbon nanotubes]] grown in the void.

The other original device type was the "Latham emitter".&lt;ref name=la95&gt;{{cite book|editor=R.V. Latham|title=High-Voltage Vacuum Insulation: Basic Concepts and Technological Practice|publisher=Academic, London|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0038-1101(00)00208-2|title=Low-macroscopic-field electron emission from carbon films and other electrically nanostructured heterogeneous materials: hypotheses about emission mechanism|year=2001|last1=Forbes|first1=R|journal=Solid-State Electronics|volume=45|pages=779–808|bibcode=2001SSEle..45..779F|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were MIMIV (metal-insulator-metal-insulator-vacuum) – or, more generally, CDCDV (conductor-dielectric-conductor-dielectric-vacuum) – devices that contained conducting particulates in a dielectric film. The device field-emits because its microstructure/nanostructure has field-enhancing properties. This material had a potential production advantage, in that it could be deposited as an "ink", so IC fabrication techniques were not needed. However, in practice, uniformly reliable devices proved difficult to fabricate.

Research advanced to look for other materials that could be deposited/grown as thin films with suitable field-enhancing properties. In a parallel-plate arrangement, the "macroscopic" field ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; between the plates is given by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''/''W'', where ''W'' is the plate separation and ''V'' is the applied voltage. If a sharp object is created on one plate, then the local field ''F'' at its apex is greater than ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and can be related to ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt; F = \gamma F_{\mathrm{M}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''γ'' is called the "field enhancement factor" and is basically determined by the object's shape. Since field emission characteristics are determined by the local field ''F'', then the higher the ''γ''-value of the object, then the lower the value of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; at which significant emission occurs. Hence, for a given value of ''W'', the lower the applied voltage ''V'' at which significant emission occurs.

For a roughly ten year-period from the mid-1990s, there was great interest in field emission from plasma-deposited films of [[diamond like carbon|amorphous and "diamond-like" carbon]].&lt;ref name=Ro02&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0927-796X(02)00005-0|title=Diamond-like amorphous carbon|year=2002|last1=Robertson|first1=J|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports|volume=37|pages=129–281|issue=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.R.P.

Nalwa|publisher=Academic, London|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, interest subsequently lessened, partly due to the arrival of [[carbon nanotube|CNT]] emitters, and partly because evidence emerged that the emission sites might be associated with particulate carbon objects created in an unknown way during the [[chemical vapor deposition|deposition process]]: this suggested that [[quality control]] of an industrial-scale production process might be problematic.

The introduction of CNT field emitters,&lt;ref name=JB04/&gt; both in "mat" form and in "grown array" forms, was a significant step forward. Extensive research has been undertaken into both their physical characteristics and possible technological applications.&lt;ref name=Milne/&gt; For field emission, an advantage of CNTs is that, due to their shape, with its high [[aspect ratio]], they are "natural field-enhancing objects".

In recent years there has also been massive growth in interest in the development of other forms of thin-film emitter, both those based on other carbon forms (such as "carbon nanowalls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hojati-Talemi | first1 = P. | last2 = Simon | first2 = G. | year = | title = Field emission study of graphene nanowalls prepared by microwave-plasma method | url = | journal = Carbon | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 2875–2877 | doi = 10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ") and on various forms of wide-band-gap semiconductor.&lt;ref name=XH05&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.mser.2004.12.001|title=Novel cold cathode materials and applications|year=2005|last1=Xu|first1=N|last2=Huq|first2=S|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports|volume=48|pages=47–189|issue=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular aim is to develop "high-''γ''" nanostructures with a sufficiently high density of individual emission sites.

Common problems with all field emission devices, particularly those that operate in "industrial vacuum conditions" is that the emission performance can be degraded by the adsorption of gas atoms arriving from elsewhere in the system, and the emitter shape can be in principle be modified deleteriously by a variety of unwanted subsidiary processes, such as bombardment by ions created by the impact of emitted electrons onto gas-phase atoms and/or onto the surface of counter-electrodes. Thus, an important industrial requirement is "robustness in poor vacuum conditions"; this needs to be taken into account in research on new emitter materials.

At the time of writing, the most promising forms of large-area field emission source (certainly in terms of achieved average emission current density) seem to be [[Spindt tip|Spindt arrays]] and the various forms of source based on CNTs.

====Applications====
The development of large-area field emission sources was originally driven by the wish to create new, more efficient, forms of [[flat panel display|electronic information display]]. These are known as "[[field emission display]]s" or "nano-emissive displays". Although several prototypes have been demonstrated,&lt;ref name=Milne/&gt; the development of such displays into reliable commercial products has been hindered by a variety of industrial production problems not directly related to the source characteristics [En08].

Other proposed applications of large-area field emission sources&lt;ref name=Milne&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milne WI |title=E nano newsletter |date=Sep 2008 |issue=13 |url=http://www.phantomsnet.net/Foundation/Enano_newsletter13.php|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; include [[microwave]] generation, space-vehicle neutralization, [[X-ray generation]], and (for array sources) multiple [[electron beam lithography|e-beam lithography]]. There are also recent attempts to develop large-area emitters on flexible substrates, in line with wider trends towards "[[plastic electronics]]".

The development of such applications is the mission of vacuum nanoelectronics. However, field emitters work best in conditions of good ultrahigh vacuum. Their most successful applications to date (FEM, FES and EM guns) have occurred in these conditions. The sad fact remains that field emitters and industrial vacuum conditions do not go well together, and the related problems of reliably ensuring good "vacuum robustness" of field emission sources used in such conditions still await better solutions (probably cleverer materials solutions) than we currently have.

===Vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena===
As already indicated, it is now thought that the earliest manifestations of field electron emission were the electrical discharges it caused. After Fowler-Nordheim work, it was understood that CFE was one of the possible primary underlying causes of vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena. (The detailed mechanisms and pathways involved can be very complicated, and there is no single universal cause)&lt;ref name=Mil03&gt;{{cite news|url=http://isdeiv.lbl.gov/MillerBiblio/WBib2000Txt.htm |title=Bibliography: electrical discharges in vacuum: 1877-2000 |date=November 2003 |author=H. Craig Miller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113184640/http://isdeiv.lbl.gov/MillerBiblio/WBib2000Txt.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where vacuum breakdown is known to be caused by electron emission from a cathode, then the original thinking was that the mechanism was CFE from small conducting needle-like surface protrusions. Procedures were (and are) used to round and smooth the surfaces of electrodes that might generate unwanted field electron emission currents. However the work of Latham and others&lt;ref name=la95/&gt; showed that emission could also be associated with the presence of semiconducting inclusions in smooth surfaces. The physics of how the emission is generated is still not fully understood, but suspicion exists that so-called "triple-junction effects" may be involved. Further information may be found in Latham's book&lt;ref name=la95/&gt; and in the on-line bibliography.&lt;ref name=Mil03/&gt;

===Internal electron transfer in electronic devices===
In some electronic devices, electron transfer from one material to another, or (in the case of sloping bands) from one band to another ("[[Zener diode|Zener tunneling]]"), takes place by a field-induced tunneling process that can be regarded as a form of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. For example, [[Emlyn Rhoderick|Rhoderick's]] book discusses the theory relevant to [[metal-semiconductor junction|metal-semiconductor contacts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rhoderick|first1= E. H.|authorlink1= Emlyn Rhoderick|title= Metal-Semiconductor Contacts|year= 1978|publisher= [[Clarendon Press]]|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-19-859323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fowler–Nordheim tunneling==

===Introduction===
The next part of this article deals with the basic theory of cold field electron emission from bulk metals. This is best treated in four main stages, involving theory associated with: (1) derivation of a formula for "[[transmission coefficient|escape probability]]", by considering [[quantum tunnelling|electron tunneling]] through a rounded triangular barrier; (2) an integration over internal electron states to obtain the "total energy distribution"; (3) a second integration, to obtain the emission current density as a function of local barrier field and local work function; (4) conversion of this to a formula for current as a function of applied voltage. The modified equations needed for large-area emitters, and issues of experimental data analysis, are dealt with separately.

Fowler–Nordheim tunneling is the [[quantum tunnelling|wave-mechanical tunneling]] of an electron through an exact or rounded triangular barrier. Two basic situations are recognized: (1) when the electron is initially in a [[surface states|localized state]]; (2) when the electron is initially not strongly localized, and is best represented by a [[travelling wave]]. Emission from a bulk metal [[conduction band]] is a situation of the second type, and discussion here relates to this case. It is also assumed that the barrier is one-dimensional (i.e., has no lateral structure), and has no fine-scale structure that causes "[[scattering]]" or "resonance" effects. To keep this explanation of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling relatively simple, these assumptions are needed; but the atomic structure of matter is in effect being disregarded.

===Motive energy===
For an electron, the one-dimensional [[Schrödinger equation]] can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \Psi(x)}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = \left[U(x)-E_{\mathrm{n}}\right]\Psi(x) = M(x)\Psi(x), \qquad \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

where Ψ(''x'') is the electron [[wave function|wave-function]], expressed as a function of distance ''x'' measured from the emitter's electrical surface,&lt;ref name=F99&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0304-3991(99)00098-4|title=The electrical surface as centroid of the surface-induced charge|year=1999|last1=Forbes|first1=R|journal=Ultramicroscopy|volume=79|pages=25–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''m'' is the electron mass, ''U''(''x'') is the [[potential energy|electron potential energy]], ''E''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[total energy|total electron energy]] associated with motion in the ''x''-direction, and ''M''(''x'') {{nowrap| {{=}} [''U''(''x'') &amp;minus; ''E''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]}} is called the electron motive energy.&lt;ref name=HN49&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.21.185|title=Thermionic Emission|year=1949|last1=Herring|first1=Conyers|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=21|pages=185–270|last2=Nichols|first2=M.|bibcode=1949RvMP...21..185H|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M''(''x'') can be interpreted as the negative of the electron kinetic energy associated with the motion of a hypothetical classical point electron in the ''x''-direction, and is positive in the barrier.

The shape of a tunneling barrier is determined by how ''M''(''x'') varies with position in the region where ''M''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. Two models have special status in field emission theory: the ''exact triangular (ET) barrier'' and the ''Schottky&amp;ndash;Nordheim (SN) barrier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W. Schottky|journal=Phys. Z.|volume=15|year=1914|page=872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=n28b&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.W. Nordheim|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume=121|year=1928|pages=626–639|doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0222|title=The Effect of the Image Force on the Emission and Reflexion of Electrons by Metals|bibcode = 1928RSPSA.121..626N|issue=788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are given by equations (2) and (3), respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;M^{\mathrm{ET}}(x) = h - eFx \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\;\;\; (2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M^{\rm{SN}}(x) = h - eFx -e^2/(16\pi\varepsilon_0 x), \qquad\qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''h'' is the zero-field height (or ''unreduced height'') of the barrier, ''e'' is the [[elementary charge|elementary positive charge]], ''F'' is the barrier field, and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity|electric constant]]. By convention, ''F'' is taken as positive, even though the [[electric field|classical electrostatic field]] would be negative.  The SN equation uses the classical image potential energy to represent the physical effect "correlation and exchange".

===Escape probability===
For an electron approaching a given barrier from the inside, the ''probability of escape'' (or "[[transmission coefficient]]" or "penetration coefficient") is a function of ''h'' and ''F'', and is denoted by ''D''(''h'',''F''). The primary aim of tunneling theory is to calculate ''D''(''h'',''F''). For physically realistic barrier models, such as the Schottky-Nordheim barrier, the [[Schrödinger equation]] cannot be solved exactly in any simple way. The following so-called "semi-classical" approach can be used. A parameter ''G''(''h'',''F'') can be defined by the [[WKB|JWKB (Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin)]] integral:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=H. Jeffreys|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society |volume=23|year=1924|pages=428–436| doi = 10.1112/plms/s2-23.1.428|title=On Certain Approximate Solutions of Lineae Differential Equations of the Second Order}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G(h, F) = g\int M^{1/2}\mbox{d}x, \qquad\qquad (4)&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is taken across the barrier (i.e., across the region where ''M''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), and the parameter ''g'' is a universal constant given by

:&lt;math&gt; g \,= 2\sqrt{2m}/\hbar \approx 10.24624 \; {\rm{eV}}^{-1/2}\; {\rm{nm}}^{-1}. \qquad\qquad (5)&lt;/math&gt;

Forbes has re-arranged a result proved by Fröman and Fröman, to show that, formally – in a one-dimensional treatment – the exact solution for ''D'' can be written&lt;ref name=F08c&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2937077|title=On the need for a tunneling pre-factor in Fowler–Nordheim tunneling theory|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=103|page=114911|bibcode = 2008JAP...103k4911F|issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\,D = \frac{P\mathrm{e}^{-G}}{1 + P\mathrm{e}^{-G}}, \qquad\qquad (6)&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''tunneling pre-factor'' ''P'' can in principle be evaluated by complicated iterative integrations along a path in [[Complex Hilbert space|complex space]].&lt;ref name=F08c/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Fröman and P.O. Fröman, "JWKB approximation: contributions to the theory" (North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; In the CFE regime we have (by definition) ''G''&amp;nbsp;≫&amp;nbsp;1. Also, for simple models ''P''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1. So eq. (6) reduces to the so-called simple [[WKB|JWKB]] formula:

:&lt;math&gt;D\approx P \mathrm{e}^{-G} \approx \mathrm{e}^{-G}. \qquad\qquad (7)&lt;/math&gt;

For the exact triangular barrier, putting eq. (2) into eq. (4) yields {{nowrap|''G''&lt;sup&gt;ET&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''bh''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;/''F''}}, where

:&lt;math&gt; b = \frac{2g}{3e} = \frac{4\sqrt{2 m}}{3e\hbar} \approx 6.830890 \; {\mathrm{eV}}^{-3/2} \; \mathrm{V} \; {\mathrm{nm}}^{-1}. \qquad\qquad (8) &lt;/math&gt;

This parameter ''b'' is a universal constant sometimes called the ''second Fowler&amp;ndash;Nordheim constant''. For barriers of other shapes, we write

:&lt;math&gt;G(h, F) = \nu(h, F) G^{\mathrm{ET}} = \nu(h, F)b h^{3/2}/F, \qquad\qquad (9)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ν''(''h'',''F'') is a correction factor that in general has to be determined by [[numerical integration]], using eq. (4).

===Correction factor for the Schottky–Nordheim barrier===
The Schottky-Nordheim barrier, which is the barrier model used in deriving the standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation,&lt;ref name=fd07&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2007.0030|title=Reformulation of the standard theory of Fowler–Nordheim tunnelling and cold field electron emission|year=2007|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|last2=Deane|first2=Jonathan H.B.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=463|pages=2907–2927|bibcode = 2007RSPSA.463.2907F|issue=2087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special case. In this case, it is known that the correction factor &lt;math&gt; \it{\nu} &lt;/math&gt; is a function of a single variable ''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', defined by ''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''/''F&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''F&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the field necessary to reduce the height of a Schottky&amp;ndash;Nordheim barrier from ''h'' to 0. This field is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \, F_h = (4\pi \epsilon_0/e^3) h^2 = (0.6944617 \; \mathrm{V}\; {\mathrm{nm}}^{-1})(h/{\rm{eV}})^2. \qquad\qquad (10) &lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' runs from 0 to 1, and may be called the ''scaled barrier field'', for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of zero-field height ''h''.

For the Schottky&amp;ndash;Nordheim barrier, ''ν''(''h'',''F'') is given by the particular value ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'') of a function ''ν''(''ℓ&amp;prime;''). The latter is a function of mathematical physics in its own right and has been called the ''principal Schottky&amp;ndash;Nordheim barrier function''. An explicit series expansion for ''ν''(''ℓ&amp;prime;'') is derived in a 2008 paper by J. Deane.&lt;ref name=DF08&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/41/39/395301|title=The formal derivation of an exact series expansion for the principal Schottky–Nordheim barrier function, using the Gauss hypergeometric differential equation|year=2008|last1=Deane|first1=Jonathan H B|last2=Forbes|first2=Richard G|journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical|volume=41|page=395301|bibcode = 2008JPhA...41M5301D|issue=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following good simple approximation for ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'') has been found:&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v(f_h) \approx 1 - f_h + \tfrac{1}{6} f_h\ln f_h...........\rm{(11)} &lt;/math&gt;

===Decay width===
The ''decay width'' (in energy), ''d&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', measures how fast the [[transmission coefficient|escape probability]] ''D'' decreases as the barrier height ''h'' increases; ''d&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{d_h} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}(\ln D)}{\mathrm{d}h}. \qquad\qquad (12) &lt;/math&gt;

When ''h'' increases by ''d&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' then the escape probability ''D'' decreases by a factor close to e (&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;2.718282). For an elementary model, based on the exact triangular barrier, where we put ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''P''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1, we get

:&lt;math&gt;d_h^{\mathrm{(el)}} = \frac{2F}{3b\sqrt{h}} = \frac{e F}{g \sqrt{h}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The decay width ''d&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' derived from the more general expression (12) differs from this by a "decay-width correction factor" ''λ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'', so:

:&lt;math&gt;d_h=  \lambda_d d_h^{\mathrm{(el)}} = \frac{\lambda_d e F}{g \sqrt{h}}. \qquad\qquad (13)&lt;/math&gt;

Usually, the correction factor can be approximated as unity.

The decay-width ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; for a barrier with ''h'' equal to the local work-function ''φ'' is of special interest. Numerically this is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; d_{\mathrm{F}}= \frac{\lambda_d e F}{g \sqrt{\phi}}  \approx \frac{e F}{g \sqrt{\phi}} \approx 0.09759678 \; \mathrm{eV} \, \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1\ \mathrm{eV}}{\phi}} \cdot \frac{F}{1\ \mathrm{V}\ \mathrm{nm}^{-1}}. \qquad\qquad (14)&lt;/math&gt;

For metals, the value of ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is typically of order 0.2&amp;nbsp;eV, but varies with barrier-field ''F''.

===Comments===
A historical note is necessary. The idea that the Schottky-Nordheim barrier needed a correction factor, as in eq. (9), was introduced by Nordheim in 1928,&lt;ref name=n28b/&gt; but his mathematical analysis of the factor was incorrect. A new (correct) function was introduced by Burgess, [[Herbert Kroemer|Kroemer]] and Houston&lt;ref name=BKH53&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.90.515|title=Corrected Values of Fowler-Nordheim Field Emission Functions v(y) and s(y)|year=1953|last1=Burgess|first1=R. E.|last2=Houston|first2=J. M.|journal=Physical Review|volume=90|page=515|last3=Houston|first3=J.|bibcode = 1953PhRv...90..515B|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953, and its mathematics was developed further by Murphy and Good in 1956.&lt;ref name=MG56&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.1464|title=Thermionic Emission, Field Emission, and the Transition Region|year=1956|last1=Murphy|first1=E. L.|last2=Good|first2=R. H.|journal=Physical Review|volume=102|pages=1464–1473|bibcode = 1956PhRv..102.1464M|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This corrected function, sometimes known as a "special field emission elliptic function", was expressed as a function of a mathematical variable ''y'' known as the "Nordheim parameter". Only recently (2006 to 2008) has it been realized that, mathematically, it is much better to use the variable ''ℓ&amp;prime;'' {{nowrap|( {{=}} ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. And only recently has it been possible to complete the definition of ''ν''(''ℓ&amp;prime;'') by developing and proving the validity of an exact series expansion for this function (by starting from known special-case solutions of the Gauss [[hypergeometric differential equation]]). Also, approximation (11) has been found only recently. Approximation (11) outperforms, and will presumably eventually displace, all older approximations of equivalent complexity. These recent developments, and their implications, will probably have a significant impact on field emission research in due course.

The following summary brings these results together. For tunneling well below the top of a well-behaved barrier of reasonable height, the escape probability ''D''(''h'',''F'') is given formally by:

:&lt;math&gt;D(h, F) \approx P\exp\left[-\frac{\nu(h, F) bh^{3/2}}{F}\right], \qquad\qquad (15)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ν''(''h'',''F'') is a correction factor that in general has to be found by numerical integration. For the special case of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier, an analytical result exists and ''ν''(''h'',''F'') is given by ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''), as discussed above; approximation (11) for ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'') is more than sufficient for all technological purposes. The pre-factor ''P'' is also in principle a function of ''h'' and (maybe) ''F'', but for the simple physical models discussed here it is usually satisfactory to make the approximation ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The exact triangular barrier is a special case where the [[Schrödinger equation]] can be solved exactly, as was done by Fowler and Nordheim;&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"/&gt; for this physically unrealistic case, ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and an analytical approximation for ''P'' exists.

The approach described here was originally developed to describe Fowler&amp;ndash;Nordheim tunneling from smooth, classically flat, planar emitting surfaces. It is adequate for smooth, classical curved surfaces of radii down to about 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;nm. It can be adapted to surfaces of sharper radius, but quantities such as ''ν'' and ''D'' then become significant functions of the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature. When the emitter is so sharp that atomic-level detail cannot be neglected, and/or the tunneling barrier is thicker than the emitter-apex dimensions, then a more sophisticated approach is desirable.

As noted at the beginning, the effects of the atomic structure of materials are disregarded in the relatively simple treatments of field electron emission discussed here. Taking atomic structure properly into account is a very difficult problem, and only limited progress has been made.&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt; However, it seems probable that the main influences on the theory of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling will (in effect) be to change the values of ''P'' and ''ν'' in eq. (15), by amounts that cannot easily be estimated at present.

All these remarks apply in principle to Fowler&amp;nbsp;Nordheim tunneling from any conductor where (before tunneling) the electrons may be treated as in [[travelling wave|travelling-wave states]]. The approach may be adapted to apply (approximately) to situations where the electrons are initially in [[surface states|localized states]] at or very close inside the emitting surface, but this is beyond the scope of this article.

==Total-energy distribution==

The energy distribution of the emitted electrons is important both for scientific experiments that use the emitted electron energy distribution to probe aspects of the emitter [[surface physics]]&lt;ref name=GP73/&gt; and for the field emission sources used in electron beam instruments such as [[electron microscopes]].&lt;ref name=HK96/&gt; In the latter case, the "width" (in energy) of the distribution influences how finely the beam can be focused.

The theoretical explanation here follows the approach of Forbes.&lt;ref name=F04&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/sia.1900|title=Use of energy-space diagrams in free-electron models of field electron emission|year=2004|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Surface and Interface Analysis|volume=36|pages=395–401|issue=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''ε'' denotes the [[total energy|total electron energy]] relative to the emitter Fermi level, and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[kinetic energy]] of the electron parallel to the emitter surface, then the electron's ''normal energy'' ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (sometimes called its "forwards energy") is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \; \epsilon_{\mathrm{n}} = \epsilon - K_{\mathrm{p}}...........(16) &lt;/math&gt;.

Two types of theoretical energy distribution are recognized: the ''normal-energy distribution'' (NED), which shows how the energy ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is distributed immediately after emission (i.e., immediately outside the tunneling barrier); and the ''total-energy distribution'', which shows how the total energy ''ε'' is distributed. When the emitter Fermi level is used as the reference zero level, both ''ε'' and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; can be either positive or negative.

Energy analysis experiments have been made on field emitters since the 1930s. However, only in the late 1950s was it realized (by Young and Mueller&lt;ref name=Y59/&gt; [,YM58]) that these experiments always measured the total energy distribution, which is now usually denoted by ''j''(''ε''). This is also true (or nearly true) when the emission comes from a small field enhancing protrusion on an otherwise flat surface.&lt;ref name=GP73/&gt;

To see how the total energy distribution can be calculated within the framework of a [[free electron model|Sommerfeld free-electron-type model]], look at the ''P-T energy-space diagram'' (P-T="parallel-total").

This shows the "parallel [[kinetic energy]]" ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; on the horizontal axis and the [[total energy]] ''ε'' on the vertical axis. An electron inside the bulk metal usually has values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ε'' that lie within the lightly shaded area. It can be shown that each element d''ε''d''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of this energy space makes a contribution &lt;math&gt; z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} \mathrm{d}{\it{\epsilon}} \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} &lt;/math&gt; to the electron current density incident on the inside of the emitter boundary.&lt;ref name=F04/&gt; Here, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the universal constant (called here the ''[[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] supply density''):

:&lt;math&gt;z_{\mathrm{S}}=4\mathrm{\pi}em / h_{\mathrm{P}}^3 = 1.618311 \times 10^{14} \, \rm{A} \, m^{-2} \, eV^{-2}, ...........(17)&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; f_{\mathrm{FD}} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution function]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \, f_{\mathrm{FD}} (\epsilon) = 1/[1+\mathrm{exp}(\epsilon / k_{\mathrm{B}}T)],...........(18)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is [[thermodynamic temperature]] and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

This element of incident current density sees a barrier of height ''h'' given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \, h=\phi - \epsilon + K_{\mathrm{p}}...........(19a)&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding [[Transmission coefficient|escape probability]] is ''D''(''h'',''F''): this may be expanded (approximately) in the form&lt;ref name=F04/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D(h,F) \approx D_{\mathrm{F}} \; \mathrm{exp}(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \mathrm{exp}(-K_{\mathrm{p}} / d_{\mathrm{F}}) .......... (19b), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the escape probability for a barrier of unreduced height equal to the [[work function|local work-function ''φ'']]. Hence, the element d''ε''d''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; makes a contribution &lt;math&gt;z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} D \mathrm{d} {\it{\epsilon}} \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} &lt;/math&gt; to the emission current density, and the total contribution made by incident electrons with energies in the elementary range d''ε'' is thus

:&lt;math&gt; j(\epsilon) \mathrm{d} \epsilon = z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} \left[ \int D \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} \right] \mathrm{d} \epsilon =
z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} D_{\mathrm{F}} \mathrm{exp}(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \left[ \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathrm{exp}(-K_{\mathrm{p}} / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} \right] \mathrm{d} \epsilon...........(20) &lt;/math&gt;,

where the integral is in principle taken along the strip shown in the diagram, but can in practice be extended to ∞ when the decay-width ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is very much less than the [[Fermi energy]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; (which is always the case for a metal). The outcome of the integration can be written:

:&lt;math&gt; \, j(\epsilon) = z_{\mathrm{S}} d_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}} f_{\mathrm{FD}}(\epsilon) \mathrm{exp}(\epsilon/d_{\mathrm{F}}) = j_{\mathrm{F}} f_{\mathrm{FD}}(\epsilon) \mathrm{exp} (\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}), ...........(21) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; D_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt; are values appropriate to a barrier of unreduced height ''h'' equal to the local work function ''φ'', and &lt;math&gt; j_{\mathrm{F}} [ \,= z_{\mathrm{S}} d_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}} ] &lt;/math&gt; is defined by this equation.

For a given emitter, with a given field applied to it, &lt;math&gt; j_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''F'', so eq. (21) shows that the shape of the distribution (as ''ε'' increases from a negative value well below the Fermi level) is a rising exponential, multiplied by the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|FD distribution function]]. This generates the familiar distribution shape first predicted by Young.&lt;ref name=Y59/&gt; At low temperatures, &lt;math&gt; f_{\mathrm{FD}} (\epsilon) &lt;/math&gt; goes sharply from 1 to 0 in the vicinity of the Fermi level, and the [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] of the distribution is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{FWHM} \, = d_{\mathrm{F}} \mathrm{ln} (2) \approx 0.693 \, d_{\mathrm{F}}. ..........(22) &lt;/math&gt;

The fact that experimental CFE total energy distributions have this basic shape is a good experimental confirmation that electrons in metals obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].

==Cold field electron emission==

===Fowler–Nordheim-type equations===

====Introduction====
Fowler–Nordheim-type equations, in the ''J''-''F'' form, are (approximate) theoretical equations derived to describe the local current density ''J'' emitted from the internal electron states in the [[conduction band]] of a bulk metal. The ''emission current density'' (ECD) ''J'' for some small uniform region of an emitting surface is usually expressed as a function ''J''(''φ'',''F'') of the [[work function|local work-function ''φ'']] and the local barrier field ''F'' that characterize the small region. For sharply curved surfaces, ''J'' may also depend on the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature.

Owing to the physical assumptions made in the original derivation,&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"/&gt; the term ''Fowler-Nordheim-type equation'' has long been used only for equations that describe the ECD at zero temperature. However, it is better to allow this name to include the slightly modified equations (discussed below) that are valid for finite temperatures within the CFE emission regime.

====Zero-temperature form====
Current density is best measured in A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The total current density emitted from a small uniform region can be obtained by integrating the total energy distribution ''j''(''ε'') with respect to total electron energy ''ε''. At zero temperature, the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution function]] ''f''&lt;sub&gt;FD&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for ''ε''&lt;0, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;FD&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for ''ε''&gt;0. So the ECD at 0 K, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is given from eq. (18) by

:&lt;math&gt; J_0 = z_{\mathrm{S}} d_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \mathrm{exp}(\epsilon /
d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \mathrm{d} \epsilon \; = \; z_{\mathrm{S}} {d_{\mathrm{F}}}^2 D_{\mathrm{F}} \; = \; Z_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}}, ..........(23) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; Z_{\mathrm{F}} \; [=z_{\mathrm{S}} {d_{\mathrm{F}}}^2] &lt;/math&gt; is the ''effective supply for state F'', and is defined by this equation. Strictly, the lower limit of the integral should be –''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Fermi Energy]]; but if ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is very much less than ''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; (which is always the case for a metal) then no significant contribution to the integral comes from energies below ''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, and it can formally be extended to –∞.

Result (23) can be given a simple and useful physical interpretation by referring to Fig. 1. The electron state at point "F" on the diagram ("state F") is the "forwards moving state at the Fermi level" (i.e., it describes a Fermi-level electron moving normal to and towards the emitter surface). At 0 K, an electron in this state sees a barrier of unreduced height ''φ'', and has an escape probability ''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; that is higher than that for any other occupied electron state. So it is convenient to write ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, where the "effective supply" ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the current density that would have to be carried by state F inside the metal if all of the emission came out of state F.

In practice, the current density mainly comes out of a group of states close in energy to state F, most of which lie within the heavily shaded area in the energy-space diagram. Since, for a [[free electron model|free-electron model]], the contribution to the current density is directly proportional to the area in energy space (with the [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] supply density ''z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; as the constant of proportionality), it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from electron states in an area of size ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (measured in eV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the energy-space diagram. That is, it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from states in the heavily shaded area in Fig. 1. (This approximation gets slowly worse as temperature increases.)

''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; can also be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt; Z_{\mathrm{F}} =z_{\mathrm{S}} {d_{\mathrm{F}}}^2= {\lambda_d}^2 (z_{\mathrm{S}} e^2 g^{-2}) \phi^{-1} F^2 = {\lambda_d}^2 a \phi^{-1} F^2, ..........(24) &lt;/math&gt;

where the universal constant ''a'', sometimes called the ''First Fowler–Nordheim Constant'', is given by

:&lt;math&gt; a = z_{\mathrm{S}} e^2 g^{-2} = e^3 /8 \pi h_{\mathrm{P}} \approx \; 1.541434 \times 10^{-6} \; \mathrm{A \; eV} \; {\mathrm{V}}^{-2}. ..........(25) &lt;/math&gt;

This shows clearly that the pre-exponential factor ''a'' ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that appears in Fowler-Nordheim-type equations, relates to the effective supply of electrons to the emitter surface, in a free-electron model.

====Non-zero temperatures====
To obtain a result valid for non-zero temperature, we note from eq. (23) that ''z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. So when eq. (21) is integrated at non-zero temperature, then – on making this substitution, and inserting the explicit form of the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution function]] – the ECD ''J'' can be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt; J=J_0 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{exp}(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}})}{1 + \mathrm{exp} [(\epsilon/d_{\mathrm{F}})(d_{\mathrm{F}}/k_{\mathrm{B}} T)]} \mathrm{d}(\epsilon/ d_{\mathrm{F}}) = \lambda_T J_0 ,..........(26)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is a temperature correction factor given by the integral. The integral can be transformed, by writing &lt;math&gt; w = d_{\mathrm{F}}/k_{\mathrm{B}}T &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x=\epsilon/d_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt;, and then &lt;math&gt; u = \mathrm{exp}(x) &lt;/math&gt;, into the standard result:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gradshteyn and Rhyzhik|title=Tables of Integrals, Series and Products|year=1980|publisher=Academic, New York}} see formula 3.241 (2), with ''μ''=1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{ {\mathrm{e}}^x } { 1+ {\mathrm{e}}^{wx} } \mathrm{d}x = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{1+u^w} = \frac{\pi} {w\mathrm{sin}(\pi/w)}. ..........(27) &lt;/math&gt;

This is valid for ''w''&gt;1 (i.e., ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' &gt; 1). Hence – for temperatures such that ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_T = \frac{\pi k_{\mathrm{B}} T/d_{\mathrm{F}} }{ \mathrm{sin}(\pi k_{\mathrm{B}} T / d_{\mathrm{F}})} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{6} {\frac{\pi k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{ d_{\mathrm{F}}}}^2, ..........(28) &lt;/math&gt;

where the expansion is valid only if (π''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' /''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;&lt; 1. An example value (for ''φ''= 4.5 eV, ''F''= 5 V/nm, ''T''= 300 K) is ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;= 1.024. Normal thinking has been that, in the CFE regime, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is always small in comparison with other uncertainties, and that it is usually unnecessary to explicitly include it in formulae for the current density at room temperature.

The emission regimes for metals are, in practice, defined, by the ranges of barrier field ''F'' and temperature ''T'' for which a given family of emission equations is mathematically adequate. When the barrier field ''F'' is high enough for the CFE regime to be operating for metal emission at 0 K, then the condition ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; provides a formal upper bound (in temperature) to the CFE emission regime. However, it has been argued that (due to approximations made elsewhere in the derivation) the condition ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;0.7''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is a better working limit: this corresponds to a ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;-value of around 1.09, and (for the example case) an upper temperature limit on the CFE regime of around 1770 K. This limit is a function of barrier field.&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt;&lt;ref name=MG56/&gt;

Note that result (28) here applies for a barrier of any shape (though ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; will be different for different barriers).

====Physically complete Fowler–Nordheim-type equation====
Result (23) also leads to some understanding of what happens when atomic-level effects are taken into account, and the [[band structure|band-structure]] is no longer free-electron like. Due to the presence of the atomic ion-cores, the surface barrier, and also the electron [[wave function|wave-functions]] at the surface, will be different. This will affect the values of the correction factor &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, the prefactor ''P'', and (to a limited extent) the correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;. These changes will, in turn, affect the values of the parameter ''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and (to a limited extent) the parameter ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. For a real metal, the supply density will vary with position in energy space, and the value at point "F" may be different from the Sommerfeld supply density. We can take account of this effect by introducing an electronic-band-structure correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; into eq. (23). Modinos has discussed how this factor might be calculated: he estimates that it is most likely to be between 0.1 and 1; it might lie outside these limits but is most unlikely to lie outside the range 0.01&lt;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;10.&lt;ref name=Mo01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0038-1101(00)00218-5|title=Theoretical analysis of field emission data|year=2001|last1=Modinos|first1=A|journal=Solid-State Electronics|volume=45|pages=809–816|bibcode=2001SSEle..45..809M|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By defining an overall supply correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; equal to ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and combining equations above, we reach the so-called physically complete Fowler-Nordheim-type equation:&lt;ref name=F08b&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.2827505|title=Physics of generalized Fowler-Nordheim-type equations|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B|volume=26|page=788|bibcode = 2008JVSTB..26..788F|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J \;= \lambda_Z a \phi^{-1} F^2 P_{\mathrm{F}} \mathrm{exp}[- \nu_{\mathrm{F}} b \phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(29) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt; [=&lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;(''φ'',''F'')] is the exponent correction factor for a barrier of unreduced height ''φ''. This is the most general equation of the Fowler–Nordheim type. Other equations in the family are obtained by substituting specific expressions for the three correction factors &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; it contains. The so-called elementary Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, that appears in undergraduate textbook discussions of field emission, is obtained by putting ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;→1, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;→1, &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;→1; this does not yield good quantitative predictions because it makes the barrier stronger than it is in physical reality. The so-called standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, originally developed by Murphy and Good,&lt;ref name=MG56/&gt; and much used in past literature, is obtained by putting ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;→''t''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;→1, &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;→''v''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is ''v''(''f''), where ''f'' is the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; obtained by putting ''h''=''φ'', and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is a related parameter (of value close to unity).&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt;

Within the more complete theory described here, the factor ''t''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; is a component part of the correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [see,&lt;ref name=F08c/&gt; and note that ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is denoted by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; there]. There is no significant value in continuing the separate identification of ''t''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Probably, in the present state of knowledge, the best approximation for simple Fowler-Nordheim-type equation based modeling of CFE from metals is obtained by putting ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;→1, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; → 1, &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt; → ''v''(''f''). This re-generates the Fowler-Nordheim-type equation used by Dyke and Dolan in 1956, and can be called the "simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation".

====Recommended form for simple Fowler–Nordheim-type calculations====
Explicitly, this recommended ''simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation'', and associated formulae, are:

:&lt;math&gt; J = \; a {\phi^{-1}} F^2 \mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(30a) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a \approx \; 1.541434 \times 10^{-6} \; \mathrm{A \; eV} \; {\mathrm{V}}^{-2};\;\;\;\;\; b \approx 6.830890 \; {\mathrm{eV}}^{-3/2} \; \mathrm{V} \; {\mathrm{nm}}^{-1}, ..........(30b)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v(f) \approx 1 - f + (1/6) f \mathrm{ln} f.......... (30c) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f = \; F/F_{\phi} = (e^3 / 4 \pi \epsilon_0) (F/ {\phi}^2) = (1.439964 \; {\mathrm{eV}}^2 \; {\mathrm{V}}^{-1} \; \mathrm{nm}) (F/ {\phi}^2). ..........(30d) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt; here is the field needed to reduce to zero a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of unreduced height equal to the [[work function|local work-function ''φ'']], and ''f'' is the scaled barrier field for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of unreduced height ''φ''. [This quantity ''f'' could have been written more exactly as ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;SN&lt;/sup&gt;, but it makes this Fowler-Nordheim-type equation look less cluttered if the convention is adopted that simple ''f'' means the quantity denoted by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;SN&lt;/sup&gt; in,&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt; eq. (2.16).] For the example case (''φ''= 4.5 eV, ''F''= 5 V/nm), ''f''≈ 0.36 and ''v''(''f'') ≈ 0.58; practical ranges for these parameters are discussed further in.&lt;ref name=F08a&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.2834563|title=Description of field emission current/voltage characteristics in terms of scaled barrier field values (f-values)|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B|volume=26|page=209|bibcode = 2008JVSTB..26..209F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the variable ''f'' (the scaled barrier field) is not the same as the variable ''y'' (the Nordheim parameter) extensively used in past field emission literature, and that " ''v''(''f'') " does NOT have the same mathematical meaning and values as the quantity " ''v''(''y'') " that appears in field emission literature. In the context of the revised theory described here, formulae for ''v''(''y''), and tables of values for ''v''(''y'') should be disregarded, or treated as values of ''v''(''f''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;). If more exact values for ''v''(''f'') are required, then&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt; provides formulae that give values for ''v''(''f'') to an absolute mathematical accuracy of better than 8×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;. However, approximation formula (30c) above, which yields values correct to within an absolute mathematical accuracy of better 0.0025, should gives values sufficiently accurate for all technological purposes.&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt;

====Comments====
A historical note on methods of deriving Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is necessary. There are several possible approaches to deriving these equations, using [[free electron model|free-electron theory]]. The approach used here was introduced by Forbes in 2004 and may be described as "integrating via the total energy distribution, using the parallel kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; as the first variable of integration".&lt;ref name=F04/&gt; Basically, it is a free-electron equivalent of the Modinos procedure&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mo01/&gt; (in a more advanced quantum-mechanical treatment) of "integrating over the surface Brillouin zone". By contrast, the free-electron treatments of CFE by Young in 1959,&lt;ref name=Y59/&gt; Gadzuk and Plummer in 1973&lt;ref name=GP73/&gt; and Modinos in 1984,&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt; also integrate via the total energy distribution, but use the normal energy ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (or a related quantity) as the first variable of integration.

There is also an older approach, based on a seminal paper by Nordheim in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.W. Nordheim|journal=Z. Phys.|volume=46|year=1928|pages=833–855|bibcode = 1928ZPhy...46..833N |doi = 10.1007/BF01391020|title=Zur Theorie der thermischen Emission und der Reflexion von Elektronen an Metallen|issue=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that formulates the problem differently and then uses first ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and then ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (or a related quantity) as the variables of integration: this is known as "integrating via the normal-energy distribution". This approach continues to be used by some authors. Although it has some advantages, particularly when discussing resonance phenomena, it requires integration of the Fermi–Dirac distribution function in the first stage of integration: for non-free-electron-like electronic band-structures this can lead to very complex and error-prone mathematics (as in the work of Stratton on [[semiconductors]]).&lt;ref name=St62&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.125.67|title=Theory of Field Emission from Semiconductors|year=1962|last1=Stratton|first1=Robert|journal=Physical Review|volume=125|pages=67–82|bibcode = 1962PhRv..125...67S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, integrating via the normal-energy distribution does not generate experimentally measured electron energy distributions.

In general, the approach used here seems easier to understand, and leads to simpler mathematics.

It is also closer in principle to the more sophisticated approaches used when dealing with real bulk crystalline solids, where the first step is either to integrate contributions to the ECD over [[constant energy surface]]s in a [[wave vector|wave-vector]] space ('' '''k''''' -space),&lt;ref name=GP73/&gt; or to integrate contributions over the relevant surface Brillouin zone.&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt; The Forbes approach is equivalent either to integrating over a spherical surface in''' ''k''' ''-space, using the variable ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; to define a ring-like integration element that has cylindrical symmetry about an axis in a direction normal to the emitting surface, or to integrating over an (extended) surface Brillouin zone using circular-ring elements.

===CFE theoretical equations===
The preceding section explains how to derive Fowler-Nordheim-type equations. Strictly, these equations apply only to CFE from bulk metals. The ideas in the following sections apply to CFE more generally, but eq. (30) will be used to illustrate them.

For CFE, basic theoretical treatments provide a relationship between the local emission current density ''J'' and the local barrier field ''F'', at a local position on the emitting surface. Experiments measure the emission current ''i'' from some defined part of the emission surface, as a function of the voltage ''V'' applied to some counter-electrode. To relate these variables to'' J'' and ''F'', auxiliary equations are used.

The ''voltage-to-barrier-field conversion factor'' ''β'' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \; \beta V, ..........(31) &lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''F'' varies from position to position on an emitter surface, and the value of ''β'' varies correspondingly.

For a metal emitter, the ''β''−value for a given position will be constant (independent of voltage) under the following conditions: (1) the apparatus is a "diode" arrangement, where the only electrodes present are the emitter and a set of "surroundings", all parts of which are at the same voltage; (2) no significant field-emitted vacuum [[space charge|space-charge]] (FEVSC) is present (this will be true except at very high emission current densities, around 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or higher &lt;ref name="Dyke1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name=F08d&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2996005|title=Exact analysis of surface field reduction due to field-emitted vacuum space charge, in parallel-plane geometry, using simple dimensionless equations|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=104|page=084303|bibcode = 2008JAP...104h4303F|issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;); (3) no significant "patch fields" exist,&lt;ref name=HN49/&gt; as a result of non-uniformities in [[work function|local work-function]] (this is normally assumed to be true, but may not be in some circumstances). For non-metals, the physical effects called "field penetration" and "[[band bending]]" [M084] can make ''β'' a function of applied voltage, although – surprisingly – there are few studies of this effect.

The emission current density ''J'' varies from position to position across the emitter surface. The total emission current ''i'' from a defined part of the emitter is obtained by integrating ''J'' across this part. To obtain a simple equation for ''i''(''V''), the following procedure is used. A reference point "r" is selected within this part of the emitter surface (often the point at which the current density is highest), and the current density at this reference point is denoted by ''J''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. A parameter ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, called the ''notional emission area'' (with respect to point "r"), is then defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; i = A_{\mathrm{r}} J_{\mathrm{r}} = \int J \mathrm{d} A, ..........(32) &lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is taken across the part of the emitter of interest.

This parameter ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; was introduced into CFE theory by Stern, Gossling and Fowler in 1929 (who called it a "weighted mean area").&lt;ref name=sgf29&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1929.0147|title=Further Studies in the Emission of Electrons from Cold Metals|year=1929|last1=Stern|first1=T. E.|last2=Gossling|first2=B. S.|last3=Fowler|first3=R. H.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=124|pages=699–723|bibcode = 1929RSPSA.124..699S|issue=795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For practical emitters, the emission current density used in Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is always the current density at some reference point (though this is usually not stated). Long-established convention denotes this reference current density by the simple symbol ''J'', and the corresponding local field and conversion factor by the simple symbols ''F'' and ''β'', without the subscript "r" used above; in what follows, this convention is used.

The notional emission area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; will often be a function of the reference local field (and hence voltage),&lt;ref name=AH39&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.113|title=The Range and Validity of the Field Current Equation|year=1939|last1=Abbott|first1=F. R.|last2=Henderson|first2=Joseph E.|journal=Physical Review|volume=56|pages=113–118|bibcode = 1939PhRv...56..113A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some circumstances might be a significant function of temperature.

Because ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; has a mathematical definition, it does not necessarily correspond to the area from which emission is observed to occur from a single-point emitter in a [[field emission microscope|field electron (emission) microscope]]. With a large-area emitter, which contains many individual emission sites, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; will nearly always be very very{{Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=was repeated 'very' intended?}} much less than the "macroscopic" geometrical area (''A''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) of the emitter as observed visually (see below).

Incorporating these auxiliary equations into eq. (30a) yields

:&lt;math&gt; i = \; A_{\mathrm{r}} a {\phi^{-1}} {\beta}^2 V^2 \mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / \beta V ], ..........(33) &lt;/math&gt;

This is the simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, in ''i''-''V'' form. The corresponding "physically complete" equation is obtained by multiplying by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Modified equations for large-area emitters===
The equations in the preceding section apply to all field emitters operating in the CFE regime. However, further developments are useful for large-area emitters that contain many individual emission sites.

For such emitters, the notional emission area will nearly always be very very{{Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=was repeated 'very' intended?}} much less than the apparent "macroscopic" geometrical area (''A''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) of the physical emitter as observed visually. A dimensionless parameter ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, ''the area efficiency of emission'', can be defined by

:&lt;math&gt; A_{\mathrm{r}} = \; \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} A_{\mathrm{M}}. ..........(34)&lt;/math&gt;

Also, a "macroscopic" (or "mean") emission current density ''J''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; (averaged over the geometrical area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; of the emitter) can be defined, and related to the reference current density ''J''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; used above, by

:&lt;math&gt; J_{\mathrm{M}} = \; i/A_{\mathrm{M}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} (i /A_{\mathrm{r}}) = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} J_{\mathrm{r}}. ..........(35)&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the following "large-area versions" of the simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation:

:&lt;math&gt; J_{\mathrm{M}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} a {\phi^{-1}} F^2 \mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(36) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; i = \; \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} A_{\mathrm{M}} a {\phi^{-1}} {\beta}^2 V^2 \mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / \beta V ], ..........(37) &lt;/math&gt;

Both these equations contain the area efficiency of emission ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. For any given emitter this parameter has a value that is usually not well known. In general, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; varies greatly as between different emitter materials, and as between different specimens of the same material prepared and processed in different ways. Values in the range 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; appear to be likely, and values outside this range may be possible.

The presence of ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in eq. (36) accounts for the difference between the macroscopic current densities often cited in the literature (typically 10 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for many forms of large-area emitter other than [[Spindt tip|Spindt arrays]]&lt;ref name=SBHW76/&gt;) and the local current densities at the actual emission sites, which can vary widely but which are thought to be generally of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or possibly slightly less.

A significant part of the technological literature on large-area emitters fails to make clear distinctions between local and macroscopic current densities, or between notional emission area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and macroscopic area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, and/or omits the parameter ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; from cited equations. Care is necessary in order to avoid errors of interpretation.

It is also sometimes convenient to split the conversion factor ''β''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; into a "macroscopic part" that relates to the overall geometry of the emitter and its surroundings, and a "local part" that relates to the ability of the very-local structure of the emitter surface to enhance the electric field. This is usually done by defining a "macroscopic field" ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; that is the field that would be present at the emitting site in the absence of the local structure that causes enhancement. This field ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is related to the applied voltage by a "voltage-to-macroscopic-field conversion factor" ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; F_{\mathrm{M}} = \; \beta_{\mathrm{M}} V. ..........(38) &lt;/math&gt;

In the common case of a system comprising two parallel plates, separated by a distance ''W'', with emitting nanostructures created on one of them, ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''W''.

A "field enhancement factor" ''γ'' is then defined and related to the values of ''β''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \; F_{\mathrm{r}} / F_{\mathrm{M}} = \beta_{\mathrm{r}} / \beta_{\mathrm{M}}. ..........(39) &lt;/math&gt;

With eq. (31), this generates the following formulae:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \; \gamma F_{\mathrm{M}} = \beta V ..........(40); \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \beta = \; \beta_{\mathrm{M}} \gamma ..........(41);&lt;/math&gt;

where, in accordance with the usual convention, the suffix "r" has now been dropped from parameters relating to the reference point. Formulae exist for the estimation of ''γ'', using [[electrostatics|classical electrostatics]], for a variety of emitter shapes, in particular the "hemisphere on a post".&lt;ref name=FEV01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0304-3991(02)00297-8|title=Some comments on models for field enhancement|year=2003|last1=Forbes|first1=R|journal=Ultramicroscopy|volume=95|pages=57–65|pmid=12535545|last2=Edgcombe|first2=CJ|last3=Valdrè|first3=U|issue=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equation (40) implies that versions of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations can be written where either ''F'' or ''βV'' is everywhere replaced by &lt;math&gt;\gamma F_{\mathrm{M}}&lt;/math&gt;. This is often done in technological applications where the primary interest is in the field enhancing properties of the local emitter nanostructure. However in some past work, failure to make a clear distinction between barrier field ''F'' and macroscopic field ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; has caused confusion or error.

More generally, the aims in technological development of large-area field emitters are to enhance the uniformity of emission by increasing the value of the area efficiency of emission ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and to reduce the "onset" voltage at which significant emission occurs, by increasing the value of ''β''. Eq. (41) shows that this can be done in two ways: either by trying to develop "high-''γ''" nanostructures, or by changing the overall geometry of the system so that ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is increased. Various trade-offs and constraints exist.

In practice, although the definition of macroscopic field used above is the commonest one, other (differently defined) types of macroscopic field and field enhancement factor are used in the literature, particularly in connection with the use of probes to investigate the'' i''-''V'' characteristics of individual emitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1989443|title=Interpretation of enhancement factor in nonplanar field emitters|year=2005|last1=Smith|first1=R.

P.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=87|page=013111|bibcode = 2005ApPhL..87a3111S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In technological contexts field emission data are often plotted using (a particular definition of) ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; or 1/''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; as the ''x''-coordinate. However, for scientific analysis it usually better not to pre-manipulate the experimental data, but to plot the raw measured ''i''-''V'' data directly. Values of technological parameters such as (the various forms of) ''γ'' can then be obtained from the fitted parameters of the ''i''-''V'' data plot (see below), using the relevant definitions.


=== Modified equations for nanometrically sharp emitters ===

Most of the theoretical derivations in the field emission theory are done under the assumption that the barrier takes the Schottky-Nordheim form eq. (3). However, this barrier form is not valid for emitters with radii of curvature &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; comparable to the length of the tunnelling barrier. The latter depends on the work function and the field, but in cases of practical interest, the SN barrier approximation can be considered valid for emitters with radii &lt;math&gt;R &gt; 20 \text{nm}&lt;/math&gt;, as explained in the next paragraph.

The main assumption of the SN barrier approximation is that the electrostatic potential term takes the linear form &lt;math&gt;\Phi = Fx&lt;/math&gt; in the tunnelling region. The latter has been proved to hold only if &lt;math&gt;x \ll R&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=KX&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0811|title=Derivation of a generalized Fowler-Nordheim equation for nanoscopic field-emitters|year=2015|last1=Kyritsakis|first1=A.|last2=Xanthakis|first2=J. P. |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=471|page=20140811|bibcode=2015RSPSA.47140811K}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, if the tunnelling region has a length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;L&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that determines the tunnelling process; thus if &lt;math&gt;L \ll R&lt;/math&gt; eq. (1) holds and the SN barrier approximation is valid. If the tunnelling probability is high enough to produce measurable field emission, L does not exceed 1-2nm. Hence, the SN barrier is valid for emitters with radii of the order of some tens of nm.

However, modern emitters are much sharper than this, with radii that of the order of a few nm. Therefore, the standard FN equation, or any version of it that assumes the SN barrier, leads to significant errors for such sharp emitters. This has been both shown theoretically &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.106257|title=Derivation of a generalized Fowler-Nordheim equation for nanoscopic field-emitters|year=1991|last1=He|first1=J.|last2=Cutler|first2=P.

The above problem was tackled in ref. &lt;ref name=KX&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0811|title=Derivation of a generalized Fowler-Nordheim equation for nanoscopic field-emitters|year=2015|last1=Kyritsakis|first1=A.|last2=Xanthakis|first2=J. P. |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=471|page=20140811|bibcode=2015RSPSA.47140811K}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The SN barrier was generalized taking into account the curvature of the emitter. It can be proven that the electrostatic potential in the vicinity of any metal surface with radius of curvature &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be [[asymptotic expansion | asymptotically expanded ]] as 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = Fx \left[ 1+\frac{x}{R} + O \left(\frac{x}{R} \right)^2 \right] \text{, for   } x \ll R \text{.}..........(42)&lt;/math&gt; 

Furthermore, the image potential for a sharp emitter is better represented by the one corresponding to a spherical metal surface rather than a planar one. After neglecting all &lt;math&gt;O(x/R)^2&lt;/math&gt; terms, the total potential barrier takes the form found by Kyritsakis and Xanthakis &lt;ref name=KX&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0811|title=Derivation of a generalized Fowler-Nordheim equation for nanoscopic field-emitters|year=2015|last1=Kyritsakis|first1=A.|last2=Xanthakis|first2=J. P. |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=471|page=20140811|bibcode=2015RSPSA.47140811K}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; M^{KX} (x) = h - eFx\left(1+\frac{x}{R} \right) - \frac{e^2}{16\pi \epsilon_0 x (1-x/2R)} ..........(43)&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[WKB approximation | JWKB approximation]] (4) is used for this barrier, the Gamow exponent takes a form that generalizes eq. (5) 
:&lt;math&gt; G(h,F,R) = \frac{b h^{3/2}}{F} \left(v(f) + \omega(f)\frac{h}{eFR} \right)..........(44)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined by (30d), &lt;math&gt;v(f)&lt;/math&gt; is given by (30c) and &lt;math&gt;\omega(f)&lt;/math&gt; is a new function that can be approximated in a similar manner as (30c): 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(f) \approx \frac{4}{5} - \frac{7}{40} f  - \frac{1}{200} \log(f) \text{.}..........(45)&lt;/math&gt;

Given the expression for the Gamow exponent as a function of the field-free barrier height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the emitted current density for cold field emission can be obtained from eq. (23). It yields 
:&lt;math&gt; J = a \frac{F^2}{\phi} \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_d(f)} + \frac{\phi}{eFR} \psi(f) \right)^{-2} \exp\left[-\frac{b \phi^{3/2}}{F} \left(v(f) + \omega(f)\frac{\phi}{eFR} \right) \right]..........(46)&lt;/math&gt; 
where the functions &lt;math&gt;\lambda_d(f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi(f)&lt;/math&gt; are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda_d(f)} \equiv v(f) - \frac{4}{3}f \frac{\partial v}{\partial f} \approx 1 + \frac{f}{9} - \frac{f \log(f)}{22} ..........(47a)&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(f) \equiv \frac{5}{3} \omega(f) - \frac{4}{3}f\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial f} \approx \frac{4}{3} - \frac{f}{500} - \frac{f \log(f)}{30}..........(47b)&lt;/math&gt;
In equation (46), for completeness purposes, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_d&lt;/math&gt; is not approximated by unity as in (29) and (30a), although for most practical cases it is a very good approximation.
Apart from this, equations (43), (44) and (46) coincide with the corresponding ones of the standard Fowler-Nordheim theory (3), (9), and (30a), in the limit &lt;math&gt;R \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;; this is expected since the former equations generalise the latter.

Finally, note that the above analysis is asymptotic in the limit &lt;math&gt;L \ll R&lt;/math&gt;, similarly to the standard Fowler-Nordheim theory using the SN barrier. However, the addition of the quadratic terms renders it significantly more accurate for emitters with radii of curvature in the range ~5-20nm. For sharper emitters there is no general approximation for the current density. In order to obtain the current density, one has to calculate the electrostatic potential and evaluate the [[WKB approximation| JWKB integral]] numerically. For this purpose, scientific computing software-libraries have been developed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.commatsci.2016.11.010|title=A general computational method for electron emission and thermal effects in field emitting nanotips|year=2017|last1=Kyritsakis|first1=A.|last2=Djurabekova|first2=F. |journal=Computational Material Science|volume=128|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; .



===Empirical CFE ''i''–''V'' equation===
At the present stage of CFE theory development, it is important to make a distinction between theoretical CFE equations and an empirical CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An empirical CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current ''i'' on voltage ''V''.

In the 1920s, empirical equations were used to find the power of ''V'' that appeared in the exponent of a semi-logarithmic equation assumed to describe experimental CFE results. In 1928, theory and experiment were brought together to show that (except, possibly, for very sharp emitters) this power is ''V''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It has recently been suggested that CFE experiments should now be carried out to try to find the power (''κ'') of ''V'' in the pre-exponential of the following empirical CFE equation:&lt;ref name=F08e&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2918446|title=Call for experimental test of a revised mathematical form for empirical field emission current-voltage characteristics|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=92|page=193105|bibcode = 2008ApPhL..92s3105F|issue=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; i = \; C V^{\kappa} \mathrm{exp}[-B/V], ..........(48) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'', ''C'' and ''κ'' are treated as constants.

From eq. (42) it is readily shown that

:&lt;math&gt; - \mathrm{dln} i / \mathrm{d} (1/V) = \; \kappa V + B, ..........(49)&lt;/math&gt;

In the 1920s, experimental techniques could not distinguish between the results κ =0 (assumed by Millikan and Laurtisen)&lt;ref name=Millikan/&gt; and κ=2 (predicted by the original Fowler-Nordheim-type equation).&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"/&gt; However, it should now be possible to make reasonably accurate measurements of dlni/d(1/V) (if necessary by using [[lock-in amplifier]]/phase-sensitive detection techniques and computer-controlled equipment), and to derive ''κ'' from the slope of an appropriate data plot.&lt;ref name=SBHW76/&gt;

Following the discovery of approximation (30b), it is now very clear that – even for CFE from bulk metals – the value ''κ''=2 is not expected. This can be shown as follows. Using eq. (30c) above, a dimensionless parameter ''η'' may be defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \eta = b \phi^{3/2} / F_{\phi} = \; (b e^3 / 4 \pi \epsilon_0) {\phi}^{-1/2} \approx 9.836239 \;\; (\mathrm{eV} / \phi)^{1/2}. ..........(50) &lt;/math&gt;

For ''φ'' = 4.50 eV, this parameter has the value ''η'' = 4.64. Since ''f'' = ''F''/''F''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''(''f'') is given by eq (30b), the exponent in the simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation (30) can be written in an alternative form and then expanded as follows:&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{exp} [-v(f) \; b {\phi}^{3/2} / F] \; = \;\mathrm{exp}[-v(f) \; \eta /f] \; \approx \; {\mathrm{e}}^{\eta} f^{-\eta/6} \mathrm{exp}[- \eta /f] \; = \; {\mathrm{e}}^{\eta} f^{-\eta/6} \mathrm{exp}[-b {\phi}^{3/2} /F ]. ..........(51) &lt;/math&gt;

Provided that the conversion factor ''β'' is independent of voltage, the parameter ''f'' has the alternative definition ''f'' = ''V''/''V''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage needed, in a particular experimental system, to reduce the height of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier from'' φ'' to zero. Thus, it is clear that the factor ''v''(''f'') in the ''exponent'' of the theoretical equation (30) gives rise to additional ''V''-dependence in the ''pre-exponential'' of the empirical equation. Thus, (for effects due to the Schottky-Nordheim barrier, and for an emitter with ''φ''=4.5 eV) we obtain the prediction:

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa \approx 2 - \eta / 6 = 2 - 0.77 = 1.23. ..........(52) &lt;/math&gt;

Since there may also be voltage dependence in other factors in a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, in particular in the notional emission area&lt;ref name=AH39/&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and in the local work-function, it is not necessarily expected that ''κ'' for CFE from a metal of local work-function 4.5 eV should have the value ''κ'' = 1.23, but there is certainly no reason to expect that it will have the original Fowler-Nordheim value ''κ'' = 2.&lt;ref name=Je99&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.369584|title=Exchange-correlation, dipole, and image charge potentials for electron sources: Temperature and field variation of the barrier height|year=1999|last1=Jensen|first1=K.

A first experimental test of this proposal has been carried out by Kirk, who used a slightly more complex form of data analysis to find a value 1.36 for his parameter ''κ''. His parameter ''κ'' is very similar to, but not quite the same as, the parameter ''κ'' used here, but nevertheless his results do appear to confirm the potential usefulness of this form of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;T. Kirk, 21st Intern. Vacuum Nanoelectronics Conf., Wrocław, July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the empirical CFE equation (42), and the measurement of ''κ'', may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler-Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the [[conduction band]] of bulk [[crystalline]] solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification might be needed for very sharp emitters). It seems very likely that one way in which CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of ''F'' (or ''V'') in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of ''κ'' might provide some experimental indication of this.

==Fowler–Nordheim plots and Millikan–Lauritsen plots==
The original theoretical equation derived by Fowler and Nordheim&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"/&gt; has, for the last 80 years, influenced the way that experimental CFE data has been plotted and analyzed. In the very widely used Fowler-Nordheim plot, as introduced by Stern ''et al.'' in 1929,&lt;ref name=sgf29/&gt; the quantity ln{''i''/''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} is plotted against 1/''V''. The original thinking was that (as predicted by the original or the elementary Fowler-Nordheim-type equation) this would generate an exact straight line of slope ''S''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt;. ''S''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; would be related to the parameters that appear in the exponent of a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation of ''i''-''V'' form by:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{FN}} = \; - b {\phi}^{3/2} / \beta. ..........(47) &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, knowledge of ''φ'' would allow ''β'' to be determined, or vice versa.

[In principle, in system geometries where there is local field-enhancing nanostructure present, and the macroscopic conversion factor ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined, knowledge of ''β'' then allows the value of the emitter's effective field enhancement factor'' γ'' to be determined from the formula ''γ'' = ''β''/''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;. In the common case of a film emitter generated on one plate of a two-plate arrangement with plate-separation ''W'' (so ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''W'') then

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \; \beta W. ..........(48) &lt;/math&gt;

Nowadays, this is one of the most likely applications of Fowler-Nordheim plots.]

It subsequently became clear that the original thinking above is strictly correct only for the physically unrealistic situation of a flat emitter and an exact triangular barrier. For real emitters and real barriers a "slope correction factor" ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; has to be introduced, yielding the revised formula

:&lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{FN}} = \; - \sigma_{\mathrm{FN}} b {\phi}^{3/2} / \beta. ..........(49) &lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; will, in principle, be influenced by any parameter in the physically complete Fowler-Nordheim-type equation for ''i''(''V'') that has a voltage dependence.

At present, the only parameter that is considered important is the correction factor &lt;math&gt; \nu_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt; relating to the barrier shape, and the only barrier for which there is any well-established detailed theory is the Schottky-Nordheim barrier. In this case, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; is given by a mathematical function called ''s''. This function ''s'' was first tabulated correctly (as a function of the Nordheim parameter ''y'') by Burgess, [[Herbert Kroemer|Kroemer]] and Houston in 1953;&lt;ref name=BKH53/&gt; and a modern treatment that gives ''s'' as function of the scaled barrier field ''f'' for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier is given in.&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt; However, it has long been clear that, for practical emitter operation, the value of ''s'' lies in the range 0.9 to 1.

In practice, due to the extra complexity involved in taking the slope correction factor into detailed account, many authors (in effect) put ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 in eq. (49), thereby generating a systematic error in their estimated values of ''β'' and/or ''γ'', thought usually to be around 5%.

However, empirical equation (42) – which in principle is more general than Fowler-Nordheim-type equations - brings with it possible new ways of analyzing field emission ''i''-''V'' data. In general, it may be assumed that the parameter ''B'' in the empirical equation is related to the unreduced height ''H'' of some characteristic barrier seen by tunneling electrons by

:&lt;math&gt; B = \; b H^{3/2} / \beta. ..........(50) &lt;/math&gt;

(In most cases, but not necessarily all, ''H'' would be equal to the local work-function; certainly this is true for metals.) The issue is how to determine the value of ''B'' by experiment. There are two obvious ways. (1) Suppose that eq. (43) can be used to determine a reasonably accurate experimental value of ''κ'', from the slope of a plot of form [–dln{''i''}/d(1/''V'') vs. ''V'']. In this case, a second plot, of ln(''i'')/''V''&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 1/''V'', should be an exact straight line of slope –''B''. This approach should be the most accurate way of determining ''B''.

(2) Alternatively, if the value of ''κ'' is not exactly known, and cannot be accurately measured, but can be estimated or guessed, then a value for'' B'' can be derived from a plot of the form [ln{''i''} vs. 1/''V'']. This is the form of plot used by Millikan and Lauritsen in 1928. Re-arranging eq. (43) gives

:&lt;math&gt; B = \; - \mathrm{dln} (i) / \mathrm{d} (1/V) - \kappa (1/V). ..........(51) &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, ''B'' can be determined, to a good degree of approximation, by determining the mean slope of a Millikan-Lauritsen plot over some range of values of 1/''V'', and by applying a correction, using the value of 1/''V'' at the midpoint of the range and an assumed value of ''κ''.

The main advantages of using a Millikan-Lauritsen plot, and this form of correction procedure, rather than a Fowler-Nordheim plot and a slope correction factor, are seen to be the following. (1) The plotting procedure is marginally more straightforward. (2) The correction involves a physical parameter (''V'') that is a measured quantity, rather than a physical parameter (''f'') that has to be calculated [in order to then calculate a value of ''s''(''f'') or, more generally ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'')]. (3) Both the parameter ''κ'' itself, and the correction procedure, are more transparent (and more readily understood) than the Fowler-Nordheim-plot equivalents. (4) This procedure takes into account all physical effects that influence the value of ''κ'', whereas the Fowler-Nordheim-plot correction procedure (in the form in which it has been carried out for the last 50 years) takes into account only those effects associated with barrier shape – assuming, furthermore, that this shape is that of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier. (5) There is a cleaner separation of theoretical and technological concerns: theoreticians will be interested in establishing what information any measured values of ''κ'' provide about CFE theory; but experimentalists can simply use measured values of ''κ'' to make more accurate estimates (if needed) of field enhancement factors.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=February 2016}}

This correction procedure for Millikan-Lauritsen plots will become easier to apply when a sufficient number of measurements of ''κ'' have been made, and a better idea is available of what typical values actually are. At present, it seems probable that for most materials ''κ'' will lie in the range -1&lt;''κ''&lt;3.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2016}}

==Further theoretical information==
Developing the approximate theory of CFE from metals above is comparatively easy, for the following reasons. (1) [[free electron model|Sommerfeld's free-electron theory]], with its particular assumptions about the distribution of internal electron states in energy, applies adequately to many metals as a first approximation. (2) Most of the time, metals have no [[surface states]] and (in many cases) metal [[wavefunction|wave-functions]] have no significant "[[surface states|surface resonances]]". (3) Metals have a high [[density of states]] at the Fermi level, so the charge that generates/screens external electric fields lies mainly on the outside of the top atomic layer, and no meaningful "field penetration" occurs. (4) Metals have high [[electrical conductivity]]: no significant voltage drops occur inside metal emitters: this means that there are no factors obstructing the supply of electrons to the emitting surface, and that the electrons in this region can be both in effective local [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and in effective thermodynamic equilibrium with the electrons in the metal support structure on which the emitter is mounted. (5) Atomic-level effects are disregarded.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=February 2016}}

The development of "simple" theories of field electron emission, and in particular the development of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations, relies on all five of the above factors being true. For materials other than metals (and for atomically sharp metal emitters) one or more of the above factors will be untrue. For example, [[crystalline]] [[semiconductors]] do not have a free-electron-like band-structure, do have surface states, are subject to field penetration and [[band bending]], and may exhibit both internal voltage drops and statistical decoupling of the surface-state electron distribution from the electron distribution in the surface region of the bulk [[band structure|band-structure]] (this decoupling is known as "the Modinos effect").&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mo74&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0039-6028(74)90013-2|title=Field emission from surface states in semiconductors|year=1974|last1=Modinos|first1=A|journal=Surface Science|volume=42|pages=205–227|bibcode = 1974SurSc..42..205M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the theory of the actual Fowler-Nordheim tunneling process is much the same for all materials (though details of barrier shape may vary, and modified theory has to be developed for initial states that are localized rather than are [[travelling wave|travelling-wave-like]]). However, notwithstanding such differences, one expects (for [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] situations) that all CFE equations will have exponents that behave in a generally similar manner. This is why applying Fowler-Nordheim-type equations to materials outside the scope of the derivations given here often works. If interest is only in parameters (such as field enhancement factor) that relate to the slope of Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plots and to the exponent of the CFE equation, then Fowler-Nordheim-type theory will often give sensible estimates. However, attempts to derive meaningful current density values will usually or always fail.

Note that a straight line in a Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plot does ''not'' indicate that emission from the corresponding material obeys a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation: it indicates only that the emission mechanism for individual electrons is probably Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2016}}

Different materials may have radically different distributions in energy of their internal electron states, so the process of integrating current-density contributions over the internal electron states may give rise to significantly different expressions for the current-density pre-exponentials, for different classes of material. In particular, the power of barrier field appearing in the pre-exponential may be different from the original Fowler-Nordheim value "2". Investigation of effects of this kind is an active research topic. Atomic-level "resonance" and "[[scattering]]" effects, if they occur, will also modify the theory.

Where materials are subject to field penetration and band bending, a necessary preliminary is to have good theories of such effects (for each different class of material) before detailed theories of CFE can be developed. Where voltage-drop effects occur, then the theory of the emission current may, to a greater or lesser extent, become theory that involves internal transport effects, and may become very complex.

'''Figured bass''', or '''thoroughbass''', is a kind of [[musical notation]] in which numerals and symbols (often [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]) indicate [[interval (music)|intervals]], [[chord (music)|chord]]s, and [[non-chord tone]]s that a musician playing [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]] (or other instruments capable of playing chords) play in relation to the bass note that these numbers and symbols appear above or below. Figured bass is closely associated with [[#Basso continuo|basso continuo]], a historically improvised [[accompaniment]] used in almost all genres of music in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] of [[Classical music]] ({{circa}}1600–1750), though rarely in modern music.

[[Macro analysis|macro symbols]], sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]; the [[Nashville number system]]; and various [[Chord names and symbols (jazz and pop music)|chord names and symbols]] used in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]] (e.g., [[Major chord|C Major]] or simply C; [[Minor chord|D minor]] or Dm; [[Dominant seventh|G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;]], etc.).

==Basso continuo==&lt;!--[[Basso continuo]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
Basso continuo parts, almost universal in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era (1600–1750), provided the [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] structure of the music. The phrase is often shortened to ''continuo'', and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part are called the ''continuo group''.

The makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers, and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]], [[guitar]], [[Regal (instrument)|regal]], or [[harp]]. In addition, any number of instruments which play in the [[bass (music)|bass]] register may be included, such as [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[viol|bass viol]], or [[bassoon]]. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as [[opera]]s, and organ for [[sacred music]]. Typically performers match the [[Family (musical instruments)|instrument families]] used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other winds, but restricting it to cello and/or [[double bass]] if only strings are involved. [[Harp]]s, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th-century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) [[Monteverdi]] calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes with a [[bass violin]] in the pastoral scenes followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of [[Positive organ|''organo di legno'']] and ''[[chitarrone]]'', while [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] stands watch to the sound of a regal.

The keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player ''realizes'' a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices (notably the lead [[melody]] and any [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s that might be present in it) as a guide. Experienced players sometimes incorporate [[Motive (music)|motives]] found in the other instrumental parts into their improvised chordal accompaniment. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out in [[staff notation]] for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in [[historically informed performance]], however, the number of performers who are able to improvise their parts from the figures, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Basso continuo, though an essential structural and identifying element of the Baroque period, continued to be used in many works, mostly (but not limited to) sacred choral works, of the [[Classical music era|classical]] period (up to around 1800).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://thegreathistoryofarts.weebly.com/classical-era.html Classical Era (1750-1820)]", ''TheGreatHistoryofArts.Weebly.com''. Accessed: 27 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--Source emphasizes the rapid decline of continuo practice in the Classical Era, and does not say what sort of music might have proved most resistant to this discontinuance.--&gt; An example is [[C. P. E. Bach]]'s Concerto in D minor for flute, strings and basso continuo. Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: [[mass (music)|mass]]es by [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]], for example, have a basso continuo part that was for an organist.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Figured bass notation==
A part notated with figured bass consists of a [[bass line]] notated with [[Musical note|note]]s on a [[musical staff]] plus added numbers and [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s (or in some cases [[Backslash|(back)slash]]es added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what [[interval (music)|interval]]s above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which [[Inverted chord|inversions]] of which chords are to be played.

The phrase ''[[tasto solo]]'' indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period. The reason ''tasto solo'' had to be specified was because it was an accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a [[root-position]] triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B{{music|natural}} in the second measure, even if there were no figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would deduce that this was most likely a [[first inversion]] [[dominant chord]] (spelled B–D–G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).

Composers were inconsistent in the usages described below. Especially in the 17th century, the numbers were omitted whenever the composer thought the chord was obvious. Early composers such as [[Claudio Monteverdi]] often specified the octave by the use of [[interval (music)|compound intervals]] such as 10, 11, and 15.

Contemporary figured bass abbreviations for triads and seventh chords are shown in the table to the right.

The numbers indicate the number of [[Scale (music)|scale]] steps above the given bass-line that a note should be played.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/courses/MU182A/upload/Figured-Bass-Notation.pdf|title=Figured Bass Notation|last=Vigil|first=R|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 } \figures { &lt; 6 4 &gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Here, the bass note is a C, and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above it should be played, that is an F and an A. In other words, the second inversion of an F major chord can be realized as:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;a f c&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

In cases where the numbers 3 or 5 would normally be understood, these are usually left out. For example:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass &lt;&lt; { \cadenzaOn c1 b, g, } \figures { &lt; _ &gt;1 &lt; 6 &gt; &lt; 7 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

has the same meaning as

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass &lt;&lt; { \cadenzaOn c1 b, g, } \figures { &lt; 5 3 &gt;1 &lt; 6 3 &gt; &lt; 7 5 3 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

and can be realized as

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass \cadenzaOn &lt;c e g&gt;1 &lt;b, d g&gt; &lt;g, b, d f&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

although the performer may choose which octave to play the notes in and will often elaborate them in some way, such as by playing them as [[Arpeggio|arpeggios]] rather than as [[Block chord|block chords]], or by adding improvised [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]], depending on the [[tempo]] and [[texture (music)|texture of the music]].

Sometimes, other numbers are omitted: a 2 on its own or {{su|b=2|p=4}} indicates {{overset|6|{{SubSup||2|4}}}}, for example. From the figured bass-writer's perspective, this bass note is obviously a [[third inversion]] [[seventh chord]], so the [[sixth interval]] is viewed as an interval that the player should automatically infer. In many cases entire figures can be left out, usually where the chord is obvious from the [[chord progression|progression]] or the melody.

Sometimes the chord changes but the bass note itself is held. In these cases the figures for the new chord are written wherever in the bar they are meant to occur.

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 &lt;&lt; { a'2 g' } \new Staff { \clef bass { c1 } } \figures { &lt; 6 &gt;2 &lt; 5 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as  &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 &lt;&lt; { a'2 g' } \new Staff { \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;a e&gt;2 &lt;g e&gt; } \\ { c1 } &gt;&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

When the bass note changes but the notes in the chord above it are to be held, a line is drawn next to the figure or figures, for as long as the chord is to be held, to indicate this:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c2 b, } \figures { \bassFigureExtendersOn &lt; 6 &gt;2 &lt; 6&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as  &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;e a&gt;1 } \\ { c2 b, }  &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Note that when the bass moves the chord intervals have effectively changed, in this case from {{su|b=3|p=6}} to {{su|b=4|p=7}}, but no additional numbers are written.

===Accidentals===

When an [[accidental (music)|accidental]] is shown on its own without a number, it applies to the note a third above the lowest note; most commonly, this is the third of the chord.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harmony, Fifth Edition|last=Piston|first=Walter|publisher=W. W. Norton|year=1987|isbn=978-0-393-95480-7|location=New York|pages=84-86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, if a number is shown, the accidental affects the said interval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, this, showing the widespread default meaning of an accidental without number as applying to the third above the bass:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { e1 c } \figures { &lt; _+ &gt;1 &lt; 6- _- &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \clef bass &lt;e gis b&gt;1 &lt;c ees aes&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Sometimes the accidental is placed after the number rather than before it.

Alternatively, a cross placed next to a number indicates that the pitch of that note should be raised ([[augmented interval|augmented]]) by a [[semitone]] (so that if it is normally a [[flat (music)|flat]] it becomes a natural, and if it is normally a natural it becomes a [[sharp (music)|sharp]]). A different way to indicate this is to draw a [[backslash]] through the number itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The following three notations, therefore, all indicate the same thing:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 c c } \figures { &lt; 6! &gt;1 &lt; 6\+ &gt; &lt;6\\&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can all be realized as &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;c ees a&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

More rarely, a ''forward'' slash through a number indicates that a pitch is to be lowered ([[diminished interval|diminished]]) by a semitone:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 c } \figures { &lt; 5- &gt;1 &lt; 5/ &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can both be realized as  &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;c ees ges&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

When sharps or flats are used with [[key signature]]s, they may have a slightly different meaning, especially in 17th-century music. A sharp might be used to cancel a flat in the key signature, or vice versa, instead of a [[natural sign]].

== History ==

Improvised organ accompaniments for choral works were common by the late 16th century, and separate organ parts showing only a bass line date back to at least 1587.  In the mid-16th century, some Italian church composers began to write [[polychoral]] works. These pieces, for two or more [[choir]]s, were created in recognition of particularly festive occasions, or else to take advantage of certain architectural properties of the buildings in which they were performed which created natural [[reverberation]]. With eight or more [[polyphony|polyphonic]] voice parts to keep track of in performance, works in polychoral style required some sort of instrumental [[accompaniment]]. They were also known as ''cori spezzati'', since the choirs were structured in musically independent or interlocking parts, and may sometimes also have been placed in physically different locations.

The concept of allowing two or more concurrently performing choirs to be independent structurally would probably not have arisen had there not been an already existing practice of choral accompaniment in church.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Financial and administrative records indicate the presence of organs in churches dates back to the 15th century, although their precise use is not known. Many first-person accounts of church services from the 15th and 16th centuries imply organ accompaniment in some portions of the liturgy, as well as indicating that the [[a cappella|unaccompanied]] practice of the ''[[Sistine Chapel Choir|Cappella Sistina]]'' was somewhat unusual. By early in the 16th century, it seems that accompaniment by organ at least in smaller churches was commonplace, and commentators of the time lamented on occasion the declining quality of church choirs. Even more tellingly, many manuscripts, especially from the middle of the century and later, feature written-out organ accompaniments. It is this last observation which leads directly to the foundations of continuo practice, in a somewhat similar one called ''basso seguente'' or "following bass".

Written-out accompaniments are found most often in early polychoral works (those composed, obviously, before the onset of [[concertato|concerted]] style and its explicit instrumental lines), and generally consist of a complete reduction (to what would later be called the "grand staff") of one choir’s parts.  In addition to this, however, for those parts of the music during which that choir rested was presented a single line consisting of the lowest note being sung at any given time, which could be in any vocal part.  Even in early concerted works by the Gabrielis ([[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]]), [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] and others, the lowest part, that which modern performers colloquially call "continuo", is actually a "basso seguente", though slightly different, since with separate instrumental parts, the lowest note of the moment in the instrumental parts is often lower than any being sung.

The first known published instance of a basso seguente was a book of [[Introit]]s and [[Alleluia]]s by the Venetian [[Placido Falconio]] from 1575. What is known as "figured" continuo, which also features a bass line that because of its structural nature may differ from the lowest note in the upper parts, developed over the next quarter-century. The composer [[Lodovico Grossi da Viadana|Lodovico Viadana]] is often credited with the first publication of such a continuo, in a 1602 collection of motets that according to his own account had been originally written in 1594. Viadana’s continuo, however, did not include figures. The earliest extant part with sharp and flat signs above the staff is a [[motet]] by [[Giovanni Croce]], also from 1594.

Following and figured basses developed concurrently in secular music; such [[madrigal]] (a song style) composers as [[Emilio de' Cavalieri]] and [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] began in the late 16th century to write works explicitly for a soloist with accompaniment, following an already standing practice of performing multi-voice madrigals this way, and also responding to the rising influence at certain aristocratic courts of featuring popular individual singers.  This tendency toward solo-with-accompaniment texture in [[secular vocal music]] (non-religious music) culminated in the genre of [[monody]], just as in sacred vocal music it resulted in the [[sacred concerto]] for various forces including few voices and even solo voices. The use of numerals to indicate accompanying sonorities in accompaniment parts began with the earliest [[opera]]s, composed by Cavalieri and [[Giulio Caccini]].

These new genres, just as the polychoral one probably was, were indeed made possible by the existence of a semi- or fully independent bass line.  In turn, the separate bass line, with figures added above to indicate other chordal notes, shortly became "[[Functional harmony|functional]]," as the sonorities became "harmonies," (see [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]), and music came to be seen in terms of a melody supported by [[chord progression]]s ([[homophony]]), rather than interlocking, equally important lines that are used in [[polyphony]].  The figured bass, therefore, was integral to the development of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], by extension the [[Classical music era|”classical”]] style, which built on the innovations of the Baroque era, and by further extension most subsequent musical styles.

As part of the new [[Classical period (music)#The Baroque/Classical transition c. 1730–1760|galant]] style in the mid-18th century, with its emphasis on lighter and more varied textures, and singable melodies, orchestral music gradually phased out the basso continuo, and solo-with-accompaniment textures increasingly featured fully written-out accompaniments. By the second half of the 18th century, figured bass was almost entirely eliminated, except in sacred choral music, where it lingered until well after 1800: Beethoven's [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C major]] (1807), for example, has a figured bass part.

Many composers and theorists of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries wrote "how-to guides" for chord-playing musicians, to aid them in realizing figured bass notation, including [[Gregor Aichinger]], [[Filippo Bonaffino]], [[Friedrich Erhard Niedt]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]], and [[Michael Praetorius]].

==Contemporary uses==
In the 20th and 21st century, figured bass is also sometimes used by [[classical music]]ians as a shorthand way of indicating chords when a [[composer]] is sketching out ideas for a new piece or when a music student is [[Harmonic analysis|analyzing the harmony]] of a notated piece of music (e.g., a Bach chorale or a Chopin piano prelude). Figured bass is not generally used in modern musical compositions, except for neo-Baroque pieces.  A form of figured bass is used in notation of [[accordion]] music; another simplified form is used to notate [[guitar chord]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the 2000s, outside of professional [[Baroque ensemble]]s that specialize in the [[performance practice]] of the Baroque era, the most common use of figured bass notation is to indicate the [[inversion (music)|inversion]] in a harmonic analysis or composer's sketch context, however, often without the staff notation, using letter note names followed with the figure. For instance, if a piano piece had a C major triad in the right hand (C–E–G), with the bass note a G with the left hand, this would be a [[second inversion]] C major chord, which would be written C{{su|b=4|p=6}}. If this same C major triad had an E in the bass, it would be a [[first inversion]] chord, which would be written C{{su|b=3|p=6}} or C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (this is different from the [[jazz]] notation, where a C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; means the [[major sixth]] chord C–E–G–A, i.e., a C major with an added 6th degree). The symbols can also be used with Roman numerals in analyzing [[diatonic functionality|functional harmony]], a usage called ''figured Roman''; see [[chord symbol]].

As with any potentially powerful technique, gene drives can be misused in a variety of ways or induce unintended consequences. For example, a gene drive intended to affect only a local population might spread across an entire species. Many non-native species have a high likelihood of returning to their original habitats, through natural migration, environmental disruption (storms, floods, etc.), accidental human transportation, or purposeful relocation. Specimens whose reproduction/survival is compromised that somehow return to their native habitat, could unintentionally drive their species to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/this-gene-editing-tech-might-be-too-dangerous-to-unleash/ | title = This Gene-Editing Tech Might Be Too Dangerous To Unleash | work = Wired }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several molecular mechanisms can mediate a gene drive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Champer|first=Jackson|last2=Buchman|first2=Anna|last3=Akbari|first3=Omar S.|title=Cheating evolution: engineering gene drives to manipulate the fate of wild populations|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg.2015.34|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=146–159|doi=10.1038/nrg.2015.34|pmid=26875679|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally occurring mechanisms arise when [[allele]]s evolve molecular mechanisms that give them a transmission chance greater than (the normal) 50%.  {{toclimit|3}}

== Mechanism ==
In [[Sexual reproduction|sexually-reproducing]] species, most genes are present in two copies (which can be the same or different [[allele]]s), either one of which has a 50% chance of passing to a descendent. For a particular allele to spread through a large population, it must increase the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of those organisms which carry it. However, some alleles have evolved molecular mechanisms that confer on them a greater chance of transmission. This allows them to spread through a population even if they reduce fitness. By biasing the inheritance of particular altered genes, synthetic gene drives could spread alterations through a population.&lt;ref name="el14072"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rspb14072"/&gt;

=== Molecular mechanisms ===
[[File:Molecular mechanism of gene drive.svg|alt=Molecular mechanism of gene drive.|thumb|540x540px|Molecular mechanism of gene drive.]]
At the molecular level, an endonuclease gene drive works by cutting a [[chromosome]] at a specific site that does not encode the drive, inducing the cell to [[DNA repair|repair the damage]] by copying the drive sequence onto the damaged chromosome. The cell then has two copies of the drive sequence. The method derives from [[genome editing]] techniques and relies on the fact that double strand breaks are most frequently repaired by [[homologous recombination]], (in the presence of a template), rather than [[non-homologous end joining]]. To achieve this behavior, endonuclease gene drives consist of two nested elements:
* either a [[homing endonuclease]] or a RNA-guided endonuclease (e.g., [[Cas9]] or [[CRISPR/Cpf1|Cpf1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21668031-scientists-have-found-yet-another-way-edit-genomes-suggesting-such-technology-will|title=Even CRISPR|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and its [[guide RNA]], that cuts the target sequence in recipient cells
* a template sequence used by the DNA repair machinery after the target sequence is cut. To achieve the self-propagating nature of gene drives, this repair template contains at least the endonuclease sequence. Because the template must be used to repair a [[double-strand break]] at the cutting site, its sides are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the sequences that are adjacent to the cutting site in the host genome. By targeting the gene drive to a gene coding sequence, this gene will be inactivated; additional sequences can be introduced in the gene drive to encode new functions.
As a result, the gene drive insertion in the genome will re-occur in each organism that inherits one copy of the modification and one copy of the wild-type gene. If the gene drive is already present in the egg cell (e.g. when received from one parent), all the gametes of the individual will carry the gene drive (instead of 50% in the case of a normal gene).&lt;ref name="el14072"/&gt;

=== Spreading in the population ===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Since it can never more than double in frequency with each generation, a gene drive introduced in a single individual typically requires dozens of generations to affect a substantial fraction of a population. Alternatively, releasing drive-containing organisms in sufficient numbers can affect the rest within a few generations; for instance, by introducing it in every thousandth individual, it takes only 12–15 generations to be present in all individuals.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unckless|first=Robert L.|last2=Messer|first2=Philipp W.|last3=Connallon|first3=Tim|last4=Clark|first4=Andrew G.|date=2015-10-01|title=Modeling the Manipulation of Natural Populations by the Mutagenic Chain Reaction|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/201/2/425|journal=Genetics|language=en|volume=201|issue=2|pages=425–431|doi=10.1534/genetics.115.177592|issn=0016-6731|pmc=4596658|pmid=26232409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a gene drive will ultimately become fixed in a population and at which speed depends on its effect on individuals fitness, on the rate of allele conversion, and on the population structure. In a well mixed population and with realistic allele conversion frequencies (≈90%), population genetics predicts that gene drives get fixed for selection coefficient smaller than 0.3;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; in other words, gene drives can be used not only to spread modifications as long as reproductive success is not reduced by more than 30%. This is in contrast with normal genes, which can only spread across large populations if they increase fitness.

== Technical limitations ==
Because gene drives propagate by replacing other alleles that contain a cutting site and the corresponding homologies, their application is limited to sexually reproducing species (because they are [[Ploidy|diploid]] or [[Polyploid#Plants|polyploid]] and alleles are mixed at each generation). As a side effect, inbreeding could in principle be an escape mechanism, but the extent to which this can happen in practice is difficult to evaluate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Bull|first=James J.|date=2016-04-02|title=Lethal Gene Drive Selects Escape through Inbreeding|biorxiv=046847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the number of generations required for a gene drive to affect an entire population, the time to universality varies according to the reproductive cycle of each species: it may require under a year for some invertebrates, but centuries for organisms with years-long intervals between birth and [[sexual maturity]], such as humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oye|first=Kenneth A.|last2=Esvelt|first2=Kevin|last3=Appleton|first3=Evan|last4=Catteruccia|first4=Flaminia|last5=Church|first5=George|last6=Kuiken|first6=Todd|last7=Lightfoot|first7=Shlomiya Bar-Yam|last8=McNamara|first8=Julie|last9=Smidler|first9=Andrea|date=2014-08-08|title=Regulating gene drives|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6197/626|journal=Science|language=en|volume=345|issue=6197|pages=626–628|doi=10.1126/science.1254287|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25035410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence this technology is of most use in fast-reproducing species.

== Issues ==
Issues highlighted by researchers include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synbioproject.org/process/assets/files/6685/synbio_res_agenda1.pdf|title=CREATING A RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY|last2=Kuiken|first2=Todd|publisher=The Wilson Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Program on Emerging Technologies|last3=Lightfoot|first3=Shlomiya|last4=McNamara|first4=Julie|last5=Oye|first5=Kenneth|first1=Kelly|last1=Drinkwater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Mutations: A mutation could happen mid-drive, which has the potential to allow unwanted traits to "ride along".
* Escape: Cross-breeding or [[gene flow]] potentially allow a drive to move beyond its target population.
* Ecological impacts: Even when new traits' direct impact on a target is understood, the drive may have side effects on the surroundings.

The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard added gene drives to a list of uses of gene-editing technology it doesn't think companies should pursue.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609619/farmers-seek-to-deploy-powerful-gene-drive/|title=California farmers are eyeing a controversial genetic tool to eliminate fruit flies|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|date=December 12, 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioethics concerns ===
Gene drives affect all future generations and represent the possibility of a larger change in a living species than has been possible before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/evolution/crispr-gene-drives/|title=Genetically Engineering Almost Anything|date=17 July 2014|publisher=PBS}} "I don't care if it's a weed or a blight, people still are going to say this is way too massive a genetic engineering project," [bioethicist] Caplan says. "Secondly, it's altering things that are inherited, and that's always been a bright line for genetic engineering."&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, scientists of major world academies called for a moratorium on inheritable [[human genome]] edits that would affect the germline, including those related to [[Gene drive#CRISPR/Cas9|CRISPR-Cas9]] technologies,&lt;ref name="NYT-20151203-nw2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/science/crispr-cas9-human-genome-editing-moratorium.html|title=Scientists Place Moratorium on Edits to Human Genome That Could Be Inherited|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|date=3 December 2015|work=[[The New York Times]] |authorlink=Nicholas Wade|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but supported continued basic research and gene editing that would not affect future generations.&lt;ref name="NewScientist201512092"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22830514-500-geneticists-vote-to-allow-gene-editing-of-human-embryos/|title=Geneticists vote to allow gene editing of human embryos|date=9 December 2015|publisher=New Scientist|last1=Huffaker|first1=Sandy|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify [[human embryos]] by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques on condition that the embryos were destroyed in seven days.&lt;ref name="BBC-201602012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35459054|title=Scientists get 'gene editing' go-ahead|last=Gallagher|first=James|date=1 February 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-201602012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fdda5bf9f0314b748c7438c9659da83a/britain-approves-controversial-gene-editing-technique |title=Britain approves controversial gene-editing technique |last=Cheng |first=Maria |date=1 February 2016 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=1 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201114343/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fdda5bf9f0314b748c7438c9659da83a/britain-approves-controversial-gene-editing-technique |archivedate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, the US [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] released a report on their "Recommendations for Responsible Conduct" of gene drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nas-sites.org/gene-drives/|title=Gene Drive Research in Non-Human Organisms: Recommendations for Responsible Conduct|work=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models suggest that extinction-oriented gene drives will wipe out target species and that drives could reach populations beyond the target given minimal connectivity between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noble|first1=Charleston|last2=Adlam|first2=Ben|last3=Church|first3=George|last4=Esvelt|first4=Kevin|last5=Nowak|first5=Martin|title=Current CRISPR gene drive systems are likely to be highly invasive in wild populations|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/16/219022|website=biorxiv.org|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esvelt stated that an open conversation was needed around the safety of gene drives: "In our view, it is wise to assume that invasive and self-propagating gene drive systems are likely to spread to every population of the target species throughout the world. Accordingly, they should only be built to combat true plagues such as malaria, for which we have few adequate countermeasures and that offer a realistic path towards an international agreement to deploy among all affected nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esvelt|first1=Kevin|last2=Gemmell|first2=Neil|title=Conservation demands safe gene drive|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003850#sec002|website=journals.plos.org|publisher=PLOS Biology|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Esvelt later retracted his support for the idea, except for extremely hazardous populations such as malaria-carrying mosquitoes and isolated islands that would prevent the drive from spreading beyond the target area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/science/gene-drives-crispr.html|title=‘Gene Drives’ Are Too Risky for Field Trials, Scientists Say|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|date=2017-11-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Austin Burt, an [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|evolutionary geneticist]] at [[Imperial College London]], introduced the possibility of conducting gene drives based on natural "[[selfish gene theory|selfish]]" homing endonuclease genes in 2003.&lt;ref name="rspb14072"/&gt; 

Researchers had already shown that such “selfish” genes could spread rapidly over successive generations. Burt suggested that gene drives might be used to prevent a mosquito population from transmitting the [[malaria parasite]] or to crash a mosquito population. Gene drives based on homing endonucleases have been demonstrated in the laboratory in [[transgenic]] populations of mosquitoes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Menichelli|first2=M.|last3=Papathanos|first3=P.

Altering their specificity to target other sequences of interest remains a major challenge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The possible applications of gene drive remained limited until the discovery of CRISPR and associated RNA-guided endonucleases such as [[Cas9]] and [[CRISPR/Cpf1|Cpf1]].

In June 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tdr/about/en/|title=TDR &amp;#124; About us|date=|publisher=Who.int|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tdr/news/2014/framwk-eval-gm-mosquitoes/en|title=TDR &amp;#124; A new framework for evaluating genetically modified mosquitoes|date=2014-06-26|publisher=Who.int|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; for evaluating genetically modified mosquitoes. In 2013 the [[European Food Safety Authority]] issued a protocol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=EFSA - Guidance of the GMO Panel: Guidance Document on the ERA of GM animals|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3200|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=11|issue=5|pages=3200|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2013.3200|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[environmental assessment]]s of all [[genetically modified organisms]].

=== Cayman Islands ===
In the Cayman Islands Oxitec started releases in summer 2016. 

As of early 2017 8 million specimens had been released in [[West Bay, Cayman Islands|West Bay]]. Preliminary data showed that the drive males were successfully mating with local females. The fluorescent marker for the drive showed up in 94 percent of larvae collected in the targeted zone, demonstrating they had out-competed males in the wild for mates. Egg counts had been reduced by 88 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/01/26/gm-mosquitoes-making-an-impact-in-west-bay/|title=GM mosquitoes making an impact in West Bay {{!}} Cayman Compass|last=Whittaker|first=James|date=January 26, 2017|website=www.caymancompass.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a 62 percent suppression rate of the virus-carrying mosquitoes, according to data provided by officials there. About 400,000 insects are released there weekly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.flkeysnews.com/news/local/article195745094.html|title=Oxitec hopeful for GM mosquito release this year|last=ATKINS|first=KATIE|date=January 20, 2018|work=flkeysnews|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Florida Keys ===
In August 2016 the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food And Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a “[[National Environmental Policy Act|Finding of No Significant Impact]]" (FONSI) to [[Biotechnology|biotech]] company [[Oxitec]]'s plan to release genetically modified male ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' (mosquitoes) into the [[Florida Keys]]. The intent was to stop the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, including [[Zika fever|Zika]]. The modification adds a gene that kills offspring before they reach reproductive age.   The mosquitoes need the antibiotic [[tetracycline]] to survive. Oxitec must obtain approval from the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District before conducting a drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/fda-okays-oxitec-proposal-for-gmo-mosquito-release-in-florida|title=FDA Approves Genetically Modified Mosquitoes For Release In Florida|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drive did not occur because of local opposition. The company needs approval from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] to proceed. Oxitec submitted a new application to the EPA in December and the EPA had seven months to decide whether to issue an experimental-use permit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Funding ===
The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] invested $75 million in gene drive technology. The foundation originally estimated the technology to be ready for field use by 2029 somewhere in Africa. However, in 2016 Gates changed this estimate to some time within the following two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602304/bill-gates-doubles-his-bet-on-wiping-out-mosquitoes-with-gene-editing/|title=Bill Gates doubles his bet on wiping out mosquitoes with gene editing|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, documents released under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] showed that [[DARPA]] had invested $100 million in gene drive research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/04/us-military-agency-invests-100m-in-genetic-extinction-technologies|title=US military agency invests $100m in genetic extinction technologies|last=Neslen|first=Arthur|date=2017-12-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predator Free 2050 ===
In July 2016, New Zealand's prime minister [[John Key]] announced Predator Free 2050. In January 2017 it was announced that gene drives would be used in the effort.&lt;ref name="Scoop"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC1701/S00024/predator-free-nz-expert-qa.htm|title=Predator Free NZ - Expert Q&amp;A|publication-place=Scoop|publication-date=17 January 2017|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 one group in Australia and another in Texas released preliminary research into creating 'daughterless mice', using gene drives in mammals; these mice are considered particularly useful for New Zealand and other islands overrun with invasive mammals.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603533/first-gene-drive-in-mammals-could-aid-vast-new-zealand-eradication-plan/|title=First Gene Drive in Mammals Could Aid Vast New Zealand Eradication Plan|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|publication-place=MIT Tech Review|publication-date=10 February 2017|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== California ===
In 2017 scientists at the University of California, Riverside developed a gene drive to attack the [[Invasive species|invasive]] [[Drosophila suzukii|spotted-wing drosophila]], a type of fruit fly native to Asia that is costing California's cherry farms $700 million per year because of its tail's razor-edged “[[ovipositor]]” that destroys unblemished fruit. The primary alternative control strategy involves the use of [[Insecticide|insecticides]] called [[Pyrethroid|pyrethroids]] that kills almost all insects that it contacts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Control strategies ==
Scientists have designed multiple strategies to maintain control over gene drives. 

The drosophila drive requires at least thousands of insects for the drive to begin. A few individuals escaping the target region would be unlikely to spread the drive.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== CRISPR ==

[[CRISPR]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6148/833.summary?sid=03aa8081-376c-4e47-9efe-e453db28b20c|title=The CRISPR Craze|date=2013-08-23|publisher=Sciencemag.org|author=Elizabeth Pennisi|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a DNA editing method that makes genetic engineering faster, easier, and more efficient.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150511"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/science/jennifer-doudna-crispr-cas9-genetic-engineering.html|title=Jennifer Doudna, a Pioneer Who Helped Simplify Genome Editing|last=Pollack|first=Andrew|date=May 11, 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach involves expressing an [[RNA]]-guided [[endonuclease]] such as Cas9  along with guide RNAs directing it to a particular sequence to be edited. When the endonuclease cuts the target sequence, the cell repairs the damage by replacing the original sequence with homologous DNA. By introducing an additional template with appropriate homologues, an endonuclease can be used to delete, add or modify genes in an unprecedentedly simple manner. {{As of|2014}}, it had been tested in cells of 20 species, including humans.&lt;ref name="el14072"/&gt; In many of these species, the edits modified the organism's [[germline]], allowing them to be inherited.

In 2014 Esvelt and coworkers first suggested that CRISPR/Cas9 might be used to build endonuclease gene drives.&lt;ref name="el14072"/&gt; In 2015 researchers published successful engineering of CRISPR-based gene drives in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae#Model organism|Saccharomyces]]''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last2=Chavez|first2=A.|last3=Dietz|first3=S.

Because of CRISPR's targeting flexibility, gene drives could theoretically be used to engineer almost any trait. Unlike previous designs, they could be tailored to block the evolution of drive resistance in the target population by targeting multiple sequences within appropriate genes. CRISPR could permit a variety of gene drive architectures intended to control rather than crash populations.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} 

== Applications  ==
Gene drives have two main classes of application, which have implications of different significance:

* introduce a genetic modification in laboratory populations; once a strain or a line carrying the gene drive has been produced, the drive can be passed to any other line by mating. Here the gene drive is used to achieve much more easily a task that could be accomplished with other techniques.
* introduce a genetic modification in wild populations. Gene drives constitute a major development that makes possible previously unattainable changes.

Because of their unprecedented potential, safeguard mechanisms were proposed and tested.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiCarlo|first1=James|last2=Chavez|first2=Alejandro|last3=Dietz|first3=Sven|last4=Esvelt|first4=Kevin|last5=Church|first5=George|date=16 November 2015|title=Safeguarding CRISPR-Cas9 gene drives in yeast|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=33|pages=1250–1255|pmid=26571100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease vector species ===
One possible application is to genetically modify [[mosquito]]es and other disease vectors so that they cannot transmit diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[dengue fever]].  Researchers claimed that by applying the technique to 1% of the wild population of mosquitoes, they could eradicate malaria within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=OI_OhvOumT0 |title=Gene editing can now change an entire species -- forever {{pipe}} Jennifer Kahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invasive species ===
A gene drive could be used to eliminate [[invasive species]] and has, for example, been proposed as a way to eliminate [[invasive species in New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="NZ gene drive James Kalmakoff"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merlinnz.com/blog/crispr-pest-free-nz/ | title=CRISPR for pest-free NZ | date=11 October 2016 | accessdate=19 October 2016 | author=Kalmakoff, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene drives for biodiversity conservation purposes are being explored as part of The Genetic Biocontrol of Invasive Rodents (GBIRd) program because they offer the potential for reduced risk to non-target species and reduced costs when compared to traditional invasive species removal techniques. Given the risks of such an approach described below, the GBIRd partnership is committed to a deliberate, step-wise process that will only proceed with public alignment, as recommended by the world’s leading gene drive researchers from the Australian and US National Academy of
Sciences and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geneticbiocontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GBIRD-FactSheet-April-2018.pdf | title=GBIRd Fact Sheet | date=1 April 2018 | accessdate=14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wider Outreach Network for Gene Drive Research exists to raise awareness of the value of gene drive research for the public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://genedrivenetwork.org/resources/6-mission-principles-statement-july2018/file | title=Mission &amp; Principles Statement | date=1 July 2018 | accessdate=14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists are concerned about the technique, fearing it could  spread and wipe out species in native habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://theconversation.com/gene-drives-could-wipe-out-whole-populations-of-pests-in-one-fell-swoop-81681 | title = ‘Gene drives’ could wipe out whole populations of pests in one fell swoop | work = THE CONVERSATION }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene could mutate, potentially causing unforeseen problems (as could any gene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.plos.org/dnascience/2017/11/30/an-argument-against-gene-drives-to-extinguish-new-zealand-mammals-life-finds-a-way/ | title = An Argument Against Gene Drives to Extinguish New Zealand Mammals: Life Finds a Way | work = Plos blogs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-native species can hybridize with native species, such that a gene drive afflicting a non-native plant or animal that hybridizes with a native species could doom the native species. Many non-native species have naturalized into their new environment so well that crops and/or native species have adapted to depend on them. &lt;ref name="NZ gene drive risks"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.odt.co.nz/opinion/risks-may-accompany-gene-drive-technology#comment-1086 | title=Risks may accompany gene drive technology | publisher=Otago Daily Times | date=17 October 2016 | accessdate=19 October 2016 | author=Campbell, Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6540">'''Glomalin''' is a [[glycoprotein]] produced abundantly on [[hyphae]] and [[spore]]s of [[Arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscular]] [[mycorrhizal fungi|mycorrhizal]] (AM) [[Fungus|fungi]] in [[soil]] and in [[root]]s.  Glomalin was discovered in 1996 by Sara F. Wright, a scientist at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service]].&lt;ref name=usda02/&gt;  The name comes from [[Glomales]], an order of fungi.&lt;ref name=usda97/&gt;

==Discovery==
Glomalin eluded detection until 1996 because, “It requires an unusual effort to dislodge glomalin for study: a bath in citrate combined with heating at 250 F (121 C) for at least an hour.... No other soil glue found to date required anything as drastic as this.” - Sara Wright.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Description==
The specific protein glomalin has not yet been isolated and described.&lt;ref name=rill04/&gt; However, '''glomalin-related soil proteins''' ('''GRSP''') have been identified using a [[monoclonal]] [[antibody]] (Mab32B11) raised against crushed AM fungi spores. It is defined by its extraction conditions and reaction with the antibody Mab32B11. 

The discoverer of glomalin, Sara Wright, thinks the “glomalin molecule is a clump of small glycoproteins with iron and other ions attached... glomalin contains from 1 to 9% tightly bound iron.... We’ve seen glomalin on the  outside of hyphae, and we believe this is how the hyphae seal themselves so they can carry water and nutrients. It may also be what gives them the rigidity they need to span the air spaces between soil particles.” Glomalin takes 7–42 years to biodegrade. The highest levels of glomalin were found in volcanic soils of Hawaii and Japan.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Glomalin, Hiding Place for a Third of the World’s Stored Soil Carbon." Agricultural Research Journal, September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is other circumstantial evidence to show that glomalin is of AM fungal origin. When AM fungi are eliminated from soil through incubation of soil without host plants, the concentration of GRSP declines. A similar decline in GRSP has also been observed in incubated soils from forested, afforested, and agricultural land&lt;ref name=rill03/&gt; and grasslands treated with fungicide.&lt;ref name=rill04/&gt;  Concentrations of glomalin in soil are correlated with the [[Primary production|primary productivity]] of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=tres06/&gt;

The chemistry of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) is not yet fully understood, and the link between glomalin, GRSP, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is not yet clear.&lt;ref name=rill04/&gt;&lt;ref name=gill11/&gt;  The [[physiology|physiological]] function of glomalin in fungi is also a topic of current research.&lt;ref name=purin07/&gt;

==Effects==
Glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSPs), along with [[humic acid]], are a significant component of [[soil organic matter]] and act to bind mineral particles together, improving soil quality.&lt;ref name=usda02/&gt;&lt;ref name=rill04/&gt;  Glomalin has been investigated for its [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] storing properties, including as a potential method of [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref name=tres06/&gt;&lt;ref name=king11/&gt;

Glomalin is hypothesized to improve soil aggregate water stability and decrease [[soil erosion]]. A strong correlation has been found between GRSP and soil aggregate water stability in a wide variety of soils where organic material is the main binding agent, although the mechanism is not known.&lt;ref name=rill04/&gt;

'''Haldane's dilemma''' is a limit on the speed of beneficial [[evolution]], first calculated by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1957, and clarified further by later commentators. 

== Substitution cost ==

In the introduction to ''The Cost of Natural Selection'' Haldane writes that it is difficult for breeders to simultaneously select all the desired qualities, partly because the required genes may not be found together in the stock; but, writes Haldane,&lt;ref name=Haldane&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldane | first1 = J.B.S. | year = | title = The Cost of Natural Selection | url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane2.pdf| journal = J. Genet | volume = 55 | issue = 511–524| page = 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;especially in slowly breeding animals such as cattle, one cannot cull even half the females, even though only one in a hundred of them combines the various qualities desired.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, the problem for the cattle breeder is that keeping only the specimens with the desired qualities will lower the reproductive capability too much to keep a useful breeding stock.

Haldane states that this same problem arises with respect to natural selection. [[Genetic correlation|Characters that are positively correlated]] at one time may be negatively correlated at a later time, so simultaneous optimisation of more than one character is a problem also in nature. And, as Haldane writes&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]n this paper I shall try to make quantitative the fairly obvious statement that natural selection cannot occur with great intensity for a number of characters at once unless they happen to be controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In faster breeding species there is less of a problem. Haldane mentions the [[peppered moth]], ''Biston betularia'', whose variation in pigmentation is determined by several [[alleles]] at a single gene.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;ref name="majerus1998"&gt;Majerus, M.E.N. (1998) ''[[Melanism: Evolution in Action]]''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these alleles, "C", is dominant to all the others, and any '''CC''' or  '''Cx''' moths are dark (where "x" is any other allele). Another allele, "c", is recessive to all the others, and '''cc''' moths are light. Against the originally pale [[lichen]]s the darker moths were easier for birds to pick out, but in areas, where pollution has darkened the lichens, the '''cc''' moths had become rare. Haldane mentions that in a single day the frequency of '''cc''' moths might be halved.

Another potential problem is that if "ten other independently inherited characters had been subject to selection of the same intensity as that for colour, only &lt;math&gt;(1/2)^{10}&lt;/math&gt;, or one in 1024, of the original genotype would have survived." The species would most likely have become extinct; but it might well survive ten other selective periods of comparable selectivity, if they happened in different centuries.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== Selection intensity ==

Haldane proceeds to define the ''intensity of selection'' regarding "juvenile survival" (that is, survival to reproductive age) as &lt;math&gt;I = \ln (s_0/S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of those with the optimal genotype (or genotype) that survive to reproduce, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient for the entire population. The quotient of deaths &lt;math&gt;1-S&lt;/math&gt; for the entire population would have been &lt;math&gt;1-s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if all genotypes had survived as well as the optimal, hence &lt;math&gt;s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths due to selection. As Haldane mentions, if &lt;math&gt;s_0 \approx S&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;I \approx s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; – since ln(1) = 0.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== The cost ==

Haldane writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall investigate the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation. One or more genes are rare because their appearance by mutation is balanced by natural selection. A sudden change occurs in the environment, for example, pollution by smoke, a change of climate, the introduction of a new food source, predator, or pathogen, and above all migration to a new habitat. It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the new environment, and its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection. But meanwhile, a number of deaths, or their equivalents in lowered fertility, have occurred. If selection at the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus is responsible for &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; of these deaths in any generation the reproductive capacity of the species will be &lt;math&gt;\prod \left( 1- d_i \right)&lt;/math&gt; of that of the optimal genotype, or &lt;math&gt;\exp \left ( -\sum d_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; nearly, if every &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is small. Thus the intensity of selection approximates to &lt;math&gt;\sum d_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparing to the above, we have that &lt;math&gt;d_i = s_{0i} - S&lt;/math&gt;, if we say that &lt;math&gt;s_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths for the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is again the quotient of deaths for the entire population.

The problem statement is therefore that the [[allele]]s in question are ''not'' particularly beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows for more than one gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.

The total cost of substitution of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; gene is the sum &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; of all values of &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; over all generations of selection; that is, until fixation of the gene. Haldane states that he will show that &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; depends mainly on &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;, the small frequency of the gene in question, as selection begins – that is, at the time that the environmental change occurs (or begins to occur).&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== A mathematical model of the cost of diploids ==
Let '''A''' and '''a''' be two alleles with frequencies &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation. Their relative fitness is given by&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|-
| width=100 | Genotype
| width=70 | '''AA'''
| width=70 | '''Aa'''
| width=70 | '''aa'''
|-
| Frequency
| &lt;math&gt;p_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2p_nq_n&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;q_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Fitness
| 1
| &lt;math&gt;1 - \lambda K&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 - K&lt;/math&gt;
|}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

If λ = 0, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''AA''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''AA''' ('''A''' dominant), and if λ = 1, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''aa''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''aa''' ('''A''' recessive). In general λ indicates how close in fitness '''Aa''' is to '''aa'''.

The fraction of selective deaths in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation then is

: &lt;math&gt;d_n = 2\lambda Kp_nq_n + Kq_n^2 = Kq_n[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n]&lt;/math&gt;

and the total number of deaths is the population size multiplied by

: &lt;math&gt;D =  K \sum_0^\infin q_n \; [2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n].&lt;/math&gt;

== Important number 300 ==
Haldane approximates the above equation by taking the continuum limit of the above equation.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt; This is done by multiplying and dividing it by dq so that it is in integral form

:&lt;math&gt; dq_n=-Kp_n q_n[\lambda + (1-2 \lambda  )q_n ] &lt;/math&gt;
substituting q=1-p, the cost (given by the total number of deaths, 'D', required to make a substitution) is given by

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}{(1 - q)[\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}dq = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{\lambda(1 - 2\lambda)}{\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q}\right]dq.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming λ &amp;lt; 1, this gives

: &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda - (1 - 2\lambda) p_0}{\lambda}\right)\right] \approx \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda}{\lambda}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the last approximation assumes &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; to be small.

If λ = 1, then we have

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{2 - q}{(1 - q)^2} = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{1}{(1 - q)^2}\right]dq = p_0^{-1} - \mbox{ ln } p_0 + O(\lambda K).&lt;/math&gt;

In his discussion Haldane writes that the substitution cost, if it is paid by juvenile deaths, "usually involves a number of deaths equal to about 10 or 20 times the number in a generation" – the minimum being the population size (= "the number in a generation") and rarely being 100 times that number. Haldane assumes 30 to be the mean value.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

Assuming substitution of genes to take place slowly, one gene at a time over ''n'' generations, the fitness of the species will fall below the optimum (achieved when the substitution is complete) by a factor of about 30/''n'', so long as this is small – small enough to prevent extinction. Haldane doubts that high intensities – such as in the case of the peppered moth – have occurred frequently and estimates that a value of ''n'' = 300 is a probable number of generations. This gives a selection intensity of &lt;math&gt;I = 30/300 = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;.

Haldane then continues:&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of loci in a vertebrate species has been estimated at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at most of them are very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number 300 of generations is a conservative estimate for a slowly evolving species not at the brink of extinction by Haldane's calculation. For a difference of at least 1,000 genes, 300,000 generations might be needed – maybe more, if some gene runs through more than one optimisation.

== Origin of the term "Haldane's dilemma" ==
Apparently the first use of the term "Haldane's dilemma" was by palaeontologist [[Leigh Van Valen]] in his 1963 paper "Haldane's Dilemma, Evolutionary Rates, and Heterosis".

&lt;blockquote&gt;Haldane (1957 [= ''The Cost of Natural Selection'']) drew attention to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.&lt;ref name=VanValen/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, since a high number of deaths are required to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane's model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are ''N'' such genes, then the reproductive capacity of the species will be lowered to 0.9&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; times the original capacity. Therefore, if it is necessary for the population to fix more than one gene, it may not have reproductive capacity to counter the deaths.

In 1967 J. A. Sved found that the dilemma was based on wrong calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O'Donald |first=Peter |date=1969 |title=" Haldane's dilemma" and the rate of natural selection |journal=Nature |volume=221 | issue = 5183  |page=815 |pmid=5675622 |doi=10.1038/221815a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo||ひとみ|'''Hitomi'''|lead=yes}}, also known as '''ASTRO-H''' and '''New X-ray Telescope''' ('''NeXT'''), was an [[X-ray astronomy]] satellite commissioned by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) for studying extremely energetic processes in the [[Universe]]. The space observatory was designed to extend the research conducted by the [[Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics]] (ASCA) by investigating the hard X-ray band above 10 [[Electron volt|keV]]. The satellite was originally called New X-ray Telescope;&lt;ref name="AstroH_NASA" /&gt; at the time of launch it was called ASTRO-H.&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt; After it was placed in orbit and its solar panels deployed, it was renamed ''Hitomi''.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; The new name refers to the pupil of an eye, and to a legend of a painting of four dragons, two of which were given eyes and flew into the sky, and two that were left eyeless and stayed as motionless art.&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt; The spacecraft was launched on 17 February 2016 and contact was lost on 26 March 2016, due to multiple incidents with the [[attitude control]] system leading to an uncontrolled spin rate and breakup of structurally weak elements.&lt;ref name="clark-20160418"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2016/04/18/spinning-japanese-astronomy-satellite-may-be-beyond-saving/ |title=Attitude control failures led to break-up of Japanese astronomy satellite |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=18 April 2016 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
''Hitomi''{{'s}} objectives were to explore the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe, as well as the distribution of dark matter within galaxy clusters&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; and how the galaxy clusters evolve over time;&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt; how matter behaves in strong gravitational fields&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; (such as matter inspiraling into black holes&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt;), to explore the physical conditions in regions where cosmic rays are accelerated,&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; as well as observing supernovae.&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt; In order to achieve this, it was designed to be capable of:&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;
# Imaging and [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements with a hard [[X-ray telescope]];&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;
# Spectroscopic observations with an extremely high energy resolution using the micro-calorimeter;&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;
# Sensitive wideband observations over the energy range 0.3-600 [[Electronvolt|keV]].&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;

It was the sixth of a series of JAXA X-ray satellites,&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; which started in 1979,&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; and it was designed to observe sources that are an order of magnitude fainter than its predecessor, [[Suzaku (satellite)|Suzaku]].&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt; Its planned mission length was three years.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; At the time of launch, two other large X-ray satellites were carrying out observations in orbit: the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[XMM-Newton]], both of which were launched in 1999.&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt;

==Instruments==
The probe carried four instruments and six detectors to observe photons with energies ranging from soft X-rays to gamma rays, with a high energy resolution.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; ''Hitomi'' was built by an international collaboration led by JAXA with over 70 contributing institutions in Japan, the US, Canada, and Europe,&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; and over 160 scientists.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H_presentation" /&gt; With a mass of {{convert|2.7|tonne|kg}},&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; At launch, ''Hitomi'' was the heaviest Japanese X-ray mission.&lt;ref name="astroh-presskit" /&gt; The satellite is about {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt;

Two soft X-ray telescopes (SXT-S, SXT-I), with focal lengths of {{convert|5.6|m|abbr=on}}, focus light onto a soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS),&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; provided by [[NASA]],&lt;ref name="NASA_23Jun08" /&gt; with an energy range of 0.4-12 keV for high-resolution [[X-ray spectroscopy]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and a soft X-ray imager (SXI),&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; with an energy range of 0.3-12 keV.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Two hard X-ray telescopes (HXT), with a focus length of {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hard x-rays"/&gt; focus light onto two hard X-ray imagers (HXI),&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; with energy range 5-80 keV,&lt;ref name='Hard x-rays'/&gt; which are mounted on a plate placed at the end of the {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} extendable optical bench (EOB) that is deployed once the satellite is in orbit.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; The [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA) provided the Canadian ASTRO-H Metrology System (CAMS),&lt;ref name="smu-cams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csa-partner"/&gt; which is a laser alignment system that will be used to measure the distortions in the extendible optical bench.

Two soft Gamma-ray detectors (SGD), each containing three units, were mounted on two sides of the satellite, using non-focusing detectors to observe soft gamma-ray emission with energies from 60 to 600 KeV.&lt;ref name="astroh-presskit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;

The [[Netherlands Institute for Space Research]] (SRON) in collaboration with the [[University of Geneva]] provided the filter-wheel and calibration source for the [[spectrometer]].&lt;ref name="sron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unige"/&gt;

==Launch==
The launch of the satellite was planned for 2013 as of 2008,&lt;ref name="NASA_23Jun08" /&gt; later revised to 2015 as of 2013.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H_presentation" /&gt; As of early February 2016, it was planned for 12 February, but was delayed due to poor weather forecasts.&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow_11Feb16" /&gt;

''Hitomi'' launched on 17 February 2016 at 08:45&amp;nbsp;UTC&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; into a [[low Earth orbit]] of approximately {{convert|575|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; The circular orbit had a period of around 96&amp;nbsp;minutes, and an inclination of 31&amp;nbsp;degrees.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; It was launched from the [[Tanegashima Space Center]] on board an [[H-IIA]] rocket.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt; 14 minutes after launch, the satellite separated from the rocket. The solar arrays later deployed according to plan, and it began its on-orbit checkout.&lt;ref name="Space_17Feb16" /&gt;

==Loss of spacecraft==
On 27 March 2016, [[JAXA]] reported that communication with ''Hitomi'' had "failed from the start of its operation" on 26 March at 07:40&amp;nbsp;UTC.&lt;ref name="JAXA" /&gt; On the same day, the U.S. [[Joint Space Operations Center]] (JSpOC) announced on [[Twitter]] that it had observed a breakup of the satellite into 5 pieces at 08:20&amp;nbsp;UTC on 26 March 2016,&lt;ref name="jsoc_twitter" /&gt; and its orbit also suddenly changed on the same day.&lt;ref name="NatGeo_27Mar16" /&gt; Later analysis by the JSpOC found that the fragmentation likely took place around 01:42&amp;nbsp;UTC, but that there was no evidence the spacecraft had been struck by debris.&lt;ref name="spnews20160329"/&gt; Between 26 and 28 March, JAXA reported receiving three brief signals from ''Hitomi''; while the signals were offset by 200&amp;nbsp;kHz from what was expected from ''Hitomi'', their direction of origin and time of reception suggested they were legitimate.&lt;ref name="jaxa-supp20160428"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2016/04/files/20160428_hitomi.pdf |title=Supplemental Handout on the Operation Plan of the X-ray Astronomy Satellite ASTRO-H (Hitomi) |publisher=JAXA |date=28 April 2016 |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later analysis, however, determined that the signals were not from ''Hitomi'' but from an unknown radio source not registered with the [[International Telecommunication Union]].&lt;ref name="jaxa-supp20160428" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap20160429"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9e60d7cf40db4751926a9247f663e55a/japan-abandons-costly-x-ray-satellite-lost-space |title=Japan abandons costly X-ray satellite lost in space |agency=Associated Press |date=29 April 2016 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JAXA stated they were working to recover communication and control over the spacecraft,&lt;ref name="JAXA" /&gt; but that "the recovery will require months, not days."&lt;ref name="spnews20160330" /&gt; Initially suggested possibilities for the communication loss is that a helium gas leak, battery explosion, or stuck-open thruster caused the satellite to start rotating, rather than a catastrophic failure.&lt;ref name="NatGeo_27Mar16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abc_27Mar16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo20160330"/&gt; JAXA announced on 1 April that ''Hitomi'' had lost attitude control at around 19:10&amp;nbsp;UTC on 25 March. After analysing engineering data from just before the communication loss, however, no problems were noted with either the helium tank or batteries.&lt;ref name="jptimes20160402"/&gt;

The same day, JSpOC released orbital data for ten detected pieces of debris, five more than originally reported, including one piece that was large enough to initially be confused with the main body of the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="jspoc20160401"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sf101-20160402"/&gt; Amateur trackers observed what was believed to be ''Hitomi'' tumbling in orbit, with reports of the main spacecraft body (Object A) rotating once every 1.3 or 2.6 seconds, and the next largest piece (Object L) rotating every 10 seconds.&lt;ref name="sf101-20160402" /&gt;

JAXA ceased efforts to recover the satellite on 28 April 2016, switching focus to anomaly investigation.&lt;ref name="ap20160429" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jaxa20160428"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2016/04/20160428_hitomi.html |title=Operation Plan of X-ray Astronomy Satellite ASTRO-H (Hitomi) |publisher=NASA |date=28 April 2016 |accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that the chain of events that led to the spacecraft's loss began with its [[inertial reference unit]] (IRU) reporting a rotation of 21.7 degrees per hour at 19:10&amp;nbsp;UTC on 25 March, though the vehicle was actually stable. The [[attitude control]] system attempted to use ''Hitomi''{{'s}} [[reaction wheel]]s to counteract the non-existent spin, which caused the spacecraft to rotate in the opposite direction. Because the IRU continued to report faulty data, the reaction wheels began to accumulate excessive momentum, tripping the spacecraft's computer into taking the vehicle into "safe hold" mode. Attitude control then tried to use its thrusters to stabilise the spacecraft; the [[sun sensor]] was unable to lock on to the Sun's position, and continued thruster firings caused ''Hitomi'' to rotate even faster due to an incorrect software setting. Because of this excessive rotation rate, early on 26 March several parts of the spacecraft broke away, likely including both solar arrays and the extended optical bench.&lt;ref name="clark-20160418" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jaxa-supp20160428" /&gt;

==Replacement==
Reports of a ''Hitomi'' replacement mission first surfaced on 21 June 2016.&lt;ref name="kyodo20160622"/&gt; According to an article from [[Kyodo News]], JAXA was considering a launch of "Hitomi 2" in the early 2020s aboard Japan's new [[H3 (rocket)|H3 launch vehicle]].&lt;ref name="kyodo20160622"/&gt; The spacecraft would be a near-copy of ''Hitomi''.&lt;ref name="kyodo20160622"/&gt; However, a 27 June article from ''[[The Nikkei]]'' stated that some within the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] believed it was too early to grant funding for a ''Hitomi'' replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXLZO04090770W6A620C1TJM000/ |title=ＪＡＸＡ、「ひとみ」代替機の検討浮上　文科省は慎重 |work=[[The Nikkei]] |language=Japanese |date=27 June 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article also noted that [[NASA]] had expressed support for a replacement mission led by Japan.

On 14 July 2016, JAXA published a press release regarding the ongoing study of a successor.&lt;ref name="JAXA20160714"/&gt; According to the press release, the spacecraft would be a remanufacture but with countermeasures reflecting ''Hitomi''{{'s}} loss, and would be launched in 2020 on a [[H-IIA]] rocket. The scientific mission of the "ASTRO-H Successor" would be based around the [[#Instruments|SXS]] instrument.&lt;ref name="JAXA20160714"/&gt; The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, [[Hiroshi Hase]], stated during a press conference on 15 July that funding for ''Hitomi''{{'s}} successor will be allocated in the fiscal year 2017 budget request,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXLASDG15H3M_V10C16A7CR0000/ |title=衛星「ひとみ」後継機、17年度に開発着手を　文科相 |work=[[The Nikkei]] |language=Japanese |date=15 July 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he intends to accept the successor mission on the condition that the investigation of ''Hitomi''{{'s}} destruction is completed and measures to prevent recurrence are done accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2016071500405&amp;g=soc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716123228/http://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2016071500405&amp;g=soc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 July 2016 |title=「ひとみ」後継機を容認＝概算要求盛り込む－馳文科相 |agency=[[Jiji Press]] |language=Japanese |date=15 July 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission]] (XRISM) was approved by [[JAXA]] and [[NASA]] in April 2017, with launch planned after 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-and-jaxa-to-develop-replacement-x-ray-astronomy-telescope/ |title=NASA and JAXA to develop replacement X-ray astronomy telescope |work=[[SpaceNews]] |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in Wembley, Middlesex and educated at the [[Latymer Upper School]], Hammersmith and [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name = RS&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27sawyer%27%29| title = Library and Archive catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career as a Technical Officer with the Meteorological Office involved in weather forecasting for RAF stations during World War II and was then sent to India to be involved in co-ordinating the meteorological service in South-East Asia Air Command (1943). On his return he joined the staff of the Forecast Research Division, Dunstable at its inception in 1949.&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

==Work==
He was Chairman of British National Committee for Geodesy and Geophysics (1961), Assistant Director (Dynamical Research) at the Meteorological Office, Director of Research at the Meteorological Office (1965–1976) and President of the Commission for Atmospheric Sciences, World Meteorological Organisation (1968–1973). He retired in 1976.&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

==Publications==
Sawyer published the study ''Man-made Carbon Dioxide and the "Greenhouse" Effect'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5366/abs/239023a0.html|title=Man-made Carbon Dioxide and the "Greenhouse" Effect|date=1 September 1972|journal=Nature|volume=239|pages=23–26|doi=10.1038/239023a0|author=J. S. Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He summarised the knowledge of the science at the time, the anthropogenic attribution of the carbon dioxide greenhouse gas, distribution and exponential rise, findings which still hold today. Additionally he accurately predicted the rate of global warming for the period between 1972 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticalscience.com/lessons-from-past-climate-predictions-sawyer-1972.html|title=Lessons from Past Climate Predictions: J.S.

==Awards==
He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1962. His candidature citation read "''Mr. Sawyer is recognised as a leader in meteorological research, both in this country and abroad. With F.H. Bushby he devised the well-known 'baroclinic' model for numerical forecasting, using electronic computation, which is rightly regarded as a landmark in this difficult subject. His work on the characteristics of fronts is one of the few successful attempts to deal quantitatively with the dynamics (as distinct from the kinematices) of these important phenomena. He has done markedly original work on dynamical similarity in meteorology and his recent numerical calculations of air flow over mountains are believed to be the first realistic computations of their kind. In addition, he has contributed much to the detailed analysis of the salient features of large-scale atmospheric disturbances, including studies of the rainfall of depressions, the behavious of the tropopause, and the cloud systems associated with fronts. His work is characteristic of the younger school of dynamical meteorologists, and is doing much to make meteorology a more exact science than hitherto''."&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

He was also a Fellow of the Meteorological Society (FRMetS) and their president from 1963 to 1965. He was awarded their [[Symons Gold Medal]] in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1371797/John-Sawyer.html|title= John Sawyer|work= The Telegraph|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[International Meteorological Organization Prize]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/about/awards/winners_imo_en.html |title=Winners of the IMO Prize |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=2015-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122014635/http://www.wmo.int/pages/about/awards/winners_imo_en.html |archivedate=2015-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''LMS Scientific Research Laboratory'''  was set up following the formation of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] in 1923.

In 1929, the Company President, [[Josiah Stamp|Lord Stamp]] read a paper ''Scientific Research in Transport'' to the Institute of  Transport, and, in 1930 he founded the Advisory Committee on Scientific Research for Railways.

The Scientific Research Laboratory was formed by the Vice-President and Director of Scientific Research, [[Sir Harold Hartley]]. Purpose-built accommodation was provided on the west side of London Road, [[Derby]] which opened in December 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=L.M.S. Problems to be solved at Derby |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000521/19351209/030/0004 |newspaper=Derby Daily Telegraph |location=England |date=9 December 1935 |access-date=17 June 2017 |via=British Newspaper Archive |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various paint and varnish laboratories were amalgamated and brought there, joining the textile research from Calvert Street and the metallurgy and general engineering research in the locomotive works. In addition the laboratory liaised with various university departments, its remit covering all areas of railway operation.

In 1936 an aerodynamics laboratory was formed, located in the locomotive works, using 1/24 scale models. It was involved in the design work for [[William Stanier|Stanier]]'s [[LMS Princess Coronation Class|Coronation]] locomotives, and went on to assess smoke deflectors, carriage ventilation and the effect of passing trains on structures and passengers in stations. This passed to the Derby College of Technology in 1960. The [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] Testing Station was opened in 1948 as a joint venture with the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]].

Work continued into the nationalised era, when a decision was made to concentrate various headquarters functions, particularly that of the Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineer, in one national centre. This produced the [[Railway Technical Centre]] (RTC) on the opposite side of London Road, on a site which had formerly been part of the Way and Works sidings. Part of the RTC would be occupied by a new [[British Rail Research Division]], reporting directly to the [[British Railways Board|Board]], under the Chief Civil Engineer's Department. This went on, in addition to its other work into all aspects of the railway, to design the experimental version of the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT-E).  The Scientific Research Laboratory was renamed Hartley House, and formed the Scientific Services department of the Research Division.

Later, after British Rail privatisation and the sale of the Research Division to [[AEA Technology]], the Scientific Services department was separately privatised to form the company "Scientifics Ltd".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3633">'''Leen Ritmeyer''' is a Dutch-born [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[architect]] who currently lives and works in Wales, after having spent 22 years (1967–89) in Jerusalem.

==Career==
Ritmeyer holds an M.A. in Conservation Studies from the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies, [[University of York]], England, and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Manchester]], England.

Beginning in 1973, Ritmeyer served for 10 years as official architect of the archaeological dig at the [[Southern Wall]] of the [[Temple Mount]] directed by [[Benjamin Mazar]].&lt;ref name=ShanksLost&gt;"How We Lost the Temple Mount," [[Hershel Shanks]], [[Moment (magazine)]], June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritmeyer is known for the "solid scientific research" he has done on the archaeology and architecture of the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="autogenerated78"&gt;Gershom Gorenberg, ''The End of Days'' (Oxford: OUP, 2002), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered archaeological evidence for the location of [[Solomon's Temple]], the emplacement of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] on the [[Foundation Stone]],&lt;ref&gt;'[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-06/local/me-21736_1_temple-mount Architect Claims He Has Pieced Together Old Biblical Puzzle]' in [[Los Angeles Times]], Jan 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and the location of the platform as extended in the [[First Temple]] period, probably during the time of [[Hezekiah]] described as a square of 500 [[cubit]]s in ''[[Mishnah]] [[Middot (Talmud)|Middot]]'' 2.1.  He has demonstrated that one of the steps leading to the [[Dome of the Rock]] is actually the top of a remaining stone course of the pre-[[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] [[Western Wall]] of the Temple Mount platform.&lt;ref name="autogenerated78"/&gt;

Ritmeyer is known for his architectural models of the buildings of ancient Jerusalem. His [[Replicas of the Jewish Temple|models of the historical Jewish Temples]] have been exhibited at museums including the [[Yeshiva University Museum]] in New York&lt;ref&gt;[http://spider.mc.yu.edu/news/articles/article.cfm?id=101578]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501145218/http://spider.mc.yu.edu/news/articles/article.cfm?id=101578 |date=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Siegfried Horn|Siegfried H.

Horn Museum - Andrews University |publisher=Andrews.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Ritmeyer has published several books, some together with his wife, Kathleen, including:
* ''Jerusalem at the Time of Jesus''
* ''The Ritual of the Temple in the Time of Christ''
* ''Secrets of Jerusalem's Temple Mount'' (1998)

[[File:Greater Sage-Grouse at Lek (6948123054).jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|[[Greater sage-grouse]] at lek, with multiple males displaying for the less conspicuous females]]
A '''lek''' is an aggregation of male animals gathered to engage in competitive displays, '''lekking''', to entice visiting females which are surveying prospective partners for copulation.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fiske | first1=P. | last2=Rintamaki | first2=P. T. | last3=Karvonen | first3=E. | year=1998 | title=Mating success in lekking males: a meta-analysis | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=9 | pages=328–338 | doi=10.1093/beheco/9.4.328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leks are commonly formed before or during the [[breeding season]]. A lekking species is characterised by male displays, strong female [[mate choice]], and the conferring of indirect benefits to males. Although most prevalent among [[birds]] such as [[black grouse]], lekking is also found in insects including [[paper wasp]]s, crustaceans, fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.

A classical lek consists of male territories in visual and auditory range of each other. An exploded lek, as seen in the [[kakapo]] (the owl parrot), has more widely separated territories, but still in auditory range.

Lekking is associated with an apparent [[lek paradox|paradox]]: strong [[sexual selection]] by females for specific male traits ought to erode [[genetic diversity]] by [[Fisherian runaway]], but diversity is maintained and runaway does not occur. Many attempts have been made to explain it away,&lt;ref name="Foster"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thery/&gt;&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Durães/&gt; but the paradox remains.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Lek-diagram.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Sage grouse]] lek mating arena, in which each male, alpha-male (highest ranking), beta-male, gamma-male, etc., guards a territory of a few meters in size. The dominant males may each attract eight or more females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Starr | first=Cecie |author2=Taggart, Ralph | title=Biology: The Unity and Diversity of Life |edition=6th | publisher=Wadsworth | year=1992 | isbn=0-534-16566-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-ranking individuals have larger [[proxemics|personal space]] bubbles.&lt;ref name="Hall" &gt;{{cite book | last=Hall | first=Edward T. | title=The Hidden Dimension | publisher=Anchor Books | year=1966 | isbn=0-385-08476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird leks may have 25–30 individuals. A strict hierarchy accords the top-ranking males the most prestigious central territories. Females come to choose mates when the males' hierarchy is established, and preferentially mate with the dominants in the centre.]]

The term derives from the [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] ''[[-lock|lek]]'', a noun which typically denotes pleasurable and less rule-bound games and activities ("play", as by children). English use of ''lek'' dates to the 1860s. Llewelyn Lloyd's ''The Game birds and wild fowl of Sweden and Norway'' (1867) introduces it (capitalised and in single quotes, as 'Lek') explicitly as a Swedish term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Llewelyn |title=The Game Birds and Wild Fowl of Sweden and Norway |date=1867 |publisher=[[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] |location=London |pages=219ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEd-EgZE2AgC}}. Lloyd also loans 'Lek-ställe' (Swedish  ''lekställe'') for "pairing ground".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lekking species==
The term was originally used most commonly for [[black grouse]] (Swedish: "orrlek") and for [[capercaillie]] (Swedish: "tjäderlek"), and lekking behavior is quite common in [[Grouse#Sexual Size Dimorphism|birds]] of this type, such as [[sage grouse]], [[prairie chicken]], [[great bustard]] and [[sharp-tailed grouse]]. However, lekking is also found in birds of other families, such as the [[Ruff (bird)|ruff]], [[great snipe]], [[Guianan cock-of-the-rock]], [[musk duck]]s, [[Green hermit|hermit hummingbird]]s, [[manakin]]s, [[birds-of-paradise]], [[screaming piha]]s and the [[kakapo]]. Lekking is seen in some mammals such as [[fallow deer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clutton-Brock, T.

==Lekking behaviour==
[[File:Capercaillie Lomvi 2004.jpg|thumb|left|A posing [[capercaillie]]]]

There are two types of lekking arrangements: classical and exploded. In the classic lekking system, male territories are in visual and auditory range of their neighbours. In an exploded lek, males are further away from one another than they would be in a classic lek. Males in an exploded lek are outside of visual range of one another, but they stay within earshot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Trail | first1=P.

The more males present to give off the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females.

Lek mating is relatively common among [[paper wasp]] species. For example, ''[[Polistes dominula]]'' males often fight with other males in mid-air to demonstrate their superiority and attractiveness. Males that lose fly away from the lek. Females fly through leks or perch near lekking areas to observe males before making choices on mates and they use the highly conspicuous abdominal spots on males, which are highly variable in size and shape, to aid in mate choice. Males with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots are more dominant over other males and preferred by females compared to males who have larger, more irregularly shaped spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Izzo |first1=Amanda |last2=Elizabeth |first2=A. |last3=Tibbetts |first3=E. |title=Spotting the Top Male: Sexually Selected Signals in Male ''Polistes dominulus'' Wasps |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2012 |volume=83 |pages=839–845 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, ''[[Mischocyttarus flavitarsis]]'' males choose a perch site near female hibernation areas, rub their abdomens to mark their territory and wait 6–7 weeks for a female to approach. If an intruder approaches, the owner of the site lunges and grapples the other wasp. Typically, they fall off the perch site and finish the fight on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Mischocyttarus flavitarsis in Arizona: Social and Nesting Biology of a Polistine Wasp |last=Litte |first=Marcia |date=1979 |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs and benefits==
[[File:Paraclusia tigrina - lekking behaviour.ogv|thumb|Lekking behavior in the [[Clusiidae|Clusiid]] fly ''Paraclusia tigrina'']]

The main benefit for both sexes is mating success. For males, the costs stem from females’ preferences. The traits that are selected for may be energetically costly to maintain and may cause increased predation. For example, increased vocalization rate caused a decrease in the mass of male great snipe.&lt;ref name="Costs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hoglund | first1=J. | last2=Kalais | first2=J. A. | last3=Fiske | first3=P. | year=1992 | title=The costs of secondary sexual characters in the lekking great snipe (Gallinago media) | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=30 | pages=309–315 | doi=10.1007/bf00170596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cost would be male competition, as females prefer victorious males. [[Great snipe]]s, ''[[Gallinago media]]'', regularly fight to display dominance or defend their territory.&lt;ref name=Costs /&gt; Aggressive male black grouse are preferred over non-aggressive males and when the males fight they tear feathers from each other's tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alatalo | first1=R.

D. &amp; Gross, M. R. "Costs and Benefits of Female Mate Choice : Is There a Lek Paradox ?" 136, 230–243 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; However, lekking actually reduces the cost of female searching because the congregating of males makes mate selection easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wickman | first1=P. | last2=Jansson | first2=P. | year=1997 | title=An estimate of female mate searching costs in the lekking butterfly ''Coenonympha pamphilus'' | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=40 | pages=321–328 | doi=10.1007/s002650050348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females do not have to travel as far, since they are able to evaluate and compare multiple males within the same vicinity. This may also help reduce the amount of time a female may be vulnerable to predators. Female marbled reed frogs, ''[[Hyperolius marmoratus]]'', under predatory pressure consistently chose leks near their release sites, and high male calling rates reduced female search time.&lt;ref name=Grafe1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grafe|first=T.

==Female mating preferences==
A meta analysis of 27 species found that qualities such as lekking size, male display rate, and the rate of male aggression exhibit positive correlation with male success rates.&lt;ref name=Fiske /&gt; A positive correlation was also found between attendance, magnitude of exaggerated traits, age, frequency of fights, and mating success.&lt;ref name=Fiske /&gt; This female preference leads to mating skew, with some males being more successful at copulating with females. The variation in mating success is quite large in lek mating systems with 70-80 percent of matings being attributed to only 10%-20% of the males present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mackenzie | first1=A. | last2=Reynolds | first2=J.

Since sexual selection by females for specific male [[trait (biology)|trait]] values should erode [[genetic diversity]], the maintenance of genetic variation [[Lek paradox|in lekking species constitutes a paradox]] in evolutionary biology.

==Evolution==
{{primary|date=November 2018}}

===Hotshot hypothesis===
There have been several hypotheses proposed as to why males cluster into leks. The hotshot hypothesis is the only model that attributes males as the driving force behind aggregation. The hotshot model hypothesizes that attractive males, known as hotshots, garner both female and male attention.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=M. S. | last2=Beehler | first2=B. M. | year=1998 | title=Hotshots, Hotspots, and Female Preferences in the Organization of Lek Mating Systems |journal=The American Naturalist | volume=131 | pages=203–219 | doi=10.1086/284786| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1235682/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females go to the hotshots because they are attracted to these males. Other males form leks around these hotshots as a way to lure females away from the hotshot. A manipulative experiment using the little bustard, ''[[Tetrax tetrax]]'', was done to test the various lek evolution models.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt; The experiment involved varying the size and sex ratio of leks using decoys. To test whether or not the presence of a hotshot determined lek formation, a hotshot little bustard decoy was placed within a lek. After the fake hotshot was added to the lek, both male and female visitation to the lek increased.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jiguet | first1=F. | last2=Bretagnolle | first2=V. | year=2006 | title=Manipulating lek size and composition using decoys: An experimental investigation of lek evolution models | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=168 | pages=758–768 | doi=10.1086/508808 | pmid=17109318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hotspot model===
[[File:Manacus manacus.jpg|thumb|upright|In [[manakin]]s, males aggregate near hotspots with plentiful fruit, where females tend to go.]]

The hotspot model considers the female density to be the catalyst for the clustering of males. This model predicts that leks will form where females tend to reside as a way to increase female interaction.&lt;ref name=Thery&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Théry | first1=M | year=1992 | title=The evolution of leks through female choice: Differential clustering and space utilization in six sympatric manakins | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=30 | pages=227–237 | doi=10.1007/bf00166707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female [[manakin]] traffic has been observed to be concentrated around leks, bathing sites, and fruiting areas, with males aggregated near the most visited fruiting resources.&lt;ref name=Thery/&gt; The hotspot model also predicts that lek size is dependent upon the number of females inhabiting a patch of land.&lt;ref name=Foster/&gt; To test if the number of females affects lek formation, a group of female little bustard decoys were added to a lek. The presence of these female decoys did not have an effect on lek size.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt;

===Blackhole model===
The blackhole model proposes that females have a preference for neither size nor type of male, but rather that females tend to be mobile and mate wherever leks may be located.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt; This model predicts that female mobility is a response to male harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Clutton-Brock | first1=T. H. | author1link=Tim Clutton-Brock | last2=Price | first2=O. F. | last3=Maccou | first3=A. D. C. | year=1991 | title=Mate retention, harassment, and the evolution of ungulate leks |  journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=3 | pages=234–242 | doi=10.1093/beheco/3.3.234}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction is difficult to test, but there was a negative correlation found between male aggressiveness and female visitation in the little bustard population.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size" /&gt; Evidence supporting the black hole model is mainly found in [[ungulates]].&lt;ref name=Isvaran /&gt;

===Kin selection===
[[File:Lekadvert.JPG|thumb|In [[black grouse]], leks are composed of brothers and half-brothers, suggesting a [[kin selection]] mechanism.]]
An alternative hypothesis for lekking is [[kin selection]], which assumes that males within a lek are related to one another. As females rarely mate outside of leks, it is advantageous for males to form leks.&lt;ref name=Durães&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Durães | first1=R. | last2=Loiselle | first2=B. A. | last3=Blake | first3=J. G. | year=2008 | title=Spatial and temporal dynamics at manakin leks: Reconciling lek traditionality with male turnover | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=62 | pages=1947–1957 | doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0626-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all males within a lek mate with a female, the unmated males still receive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] benefits. Kin selection explains that related males congregate to form leks, as a way to attract females and increase [[inclusive fitness]].&lt;ref name=Duval /&gt; In some species, the males at the leks show a high degree of relatedness, but this does not apply as a rule to lek-forming species in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Loiselle, B.

The lower-ranking males gain some fitness benefit by passing their genes on through attracting mates for their brothers (larger leks attract more females). [[Peacock]]s recognize and will lek with their brothers, even if they have never met before.&lt;ref name="Petrie et al 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petrie |first=Marion |author2=Krupa, Andrew |author3=Burke, Terry |title=Peacocks lek with relatives even in the absence of social and environmental cues |journal=Nature |year=1999 |volume=401 |issue=6749 |pages=155–157 |doi=10.1038/43651 |bibcode=1999Natur.401..155P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predation protection ===
Another hypothesis is predator protection, or the idea that there is a reduction in individual predation risk in a larger group.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt; This could work both for the males in within the group as well as any female who visits the lek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kin selection may contribute to lek evolution and trait introgression across an avian hybrid zone|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05474.x/abstract |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=2012 |issn=1365-294X |pages=1477–1486 |volume=21 |issue=6 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05474.x |first=Moira R. |last=Concannon |first2=Adam C. |last2=Stein |first3=J. Albert C. |last3=Uy |pmid=22320709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protection also explains the presence of mixed leks, when a male of one species joins a lek of another species for protection from a common set of predators. This occurs with manakins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Comparison of Species Tree Methods for Reconstructing the Phylogeny of Bearded Manakins (Aves: Pipridae, Manacus) from Multilocus Sequence Data |url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/5/719 |journal=Systematic Biology |date=2008-10-01|issn=1063-5157 |pmid=18853359 |pages=719–731 |volume=57 |issue=5 |doi=10.1080/10635150802422290 |first=Robb T. |last=Brumfield |first2=Liang |last2=Liu |first3=David E. |last3=Lum |first4=Scott V. |last4=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other birds such as [[grouse]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Active formation of mixed–species grouse leks: a role for predation in lek evolution? |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/269/1509/2503|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |date=2002 |issn=0962-8452 |pmc=1691199 |pmid=12573063 |pages=2503–2507 |volume=269 |issue=1509 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2187 |first=Robert M. |last=Gibson |first2=Andrea S.|last2=Aspbury |first3=Leonard L. |last3=McDaniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media ethics''' is the subdivision of [[applied ethics]] dealing with the specific ethical principles and standards of [[mass media|media]], including [[broadcast media]], [[film]], [[theatre]], the [[arts]], [[print media]] and the internet. The field covers many varied and highly controversial topics, ranging from [[War correspondent|war journalism]] to [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] ad campaigns.

Media ethics involves promoting and defending values such as a universal respect for life and  the rule of law and legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moldovan|first=Gratian|date=|title=Media Ethics in the Ideological Context of the Twentieth Century|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=13&amp;sid=b975b2a4-ca3c-4480-9425-5f5ed6a3ec10%40sessionmgr4006|journal=Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice|volume=6|pages=589–593|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature regarding the ways in which specifically the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online is scarce, thereby complicating the idea for a universal code of media ethics.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deuze I, Yeshua II|first=Mark I, Daphna II|date=December 2001|title=Online Journalists Face New Ethical Dilemmas: Lessons From The Netherlands|url=|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|volume=16|pages=273–292|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Media Ethics ==
Research and publications in the field of information ethics has been produced since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Froehlich|first=Thomas|date=December 2004|title=A Brief History of Information Ethics|url=http://bid.ub.edu/13froel2.htm|journal=Universitat de Barcelona. Facultat de Biblioteconomia i Documentació|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable figures include and Robert Hauptman (who focused his work specifically on censorship, privacy, access to information, balance in collection development, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics), [[Rafael Capurro]], Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim (who wrote the article "''“Ethics in Information Science”'' , discussing issues as confidentiality of information, bias in information provided to clients or consumers, the quality of data supplied by online vendors, etc).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1990s, the term "information ethics" began to be explored by various Computer Science and Information departments in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the late 1990s, textbooks such as Richard Severson's ''The Principles of Information Ethics'' and Marsha Cook Woodbury's ''Computer and Information Ethics'', and Deborah G. Johnson's ''Computer Ethics'' were published.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Areas of Media Ethics ==

Media ethics:  Issues of moral principles and values as applied to the conduct, roles, and *content of the mass media, in particular [[journalism ethics and standards]] and [[marketing ethics]];  also the field of study concerned with this topic. In relation to news coverage it includes issues such as [[impartiality]], [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], [[wikt:balance|balance]], [[bias]], privacy, and the [[public interest]]. More generally, it also includes [[stereotyping]], taste and decency, [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], advertising practices such as [[product placement]], and legal issues such as [[defamation]]. On an institutional level it includes debates over [[media ownership]] and control, [[commercialization]], accountability, the relation of the media to the political system, issues arising from regulation (e.g. [[censorship]]) and [[deregulation]].

=== Ethics of journalism ===
{{main|Journalism ethics and standards}}
[[Image:Starlette.jpg|thumb|Photographers crowd around a starlet at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].]]

The ethics of journalism is one of the most well-defined branches of media ethics, primarily because it is frequently taught in
[[journalism schools|schools of journalism]]. Journalistic ethics tend to dominate media ethics, sometimes almost to the exclusion of other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515000000*/http://smi.curtin.edu.au/netstudies/docs/allen/AllenNCW2001.doc|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topics covered by journalism ethics include:
* News manipulation. News can manipulate and be manipulated. Governments and corporations may attempt to manipulate news media; governments, for example, by [[censorship]], and corporations by share ownership. The methods of manipulation are subtle and many. Manipulation may be voluntary or involuntary. Those being manipulated may not be aware of this. See: [[news propaganda]].
* [[Truth]]. Truth may conflict with many other values.
** Public interest. Revelation of military secrets and other sensitive government information may be contrary to the [[public interest]], even if it is true. However, [[public interest]] is not a term which is easy to define.
** Privacy. Salacious details of the lives of public figures is a central content element in many media. Publication is not necessarily justified simply because the information is true. [[Privacy]] is also a [[rights|right]], and one which conflicts with [[free speech]]. See: [[paparazzi]].
** Fantasy. Fantasy is an element of entertainment, which is a legitimate goal of media content. Journalism may mix fantasy and truth, with resulting ethical dilemmas. See: [[National Enquirer]], [[Jayson Blair]] scandal, [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy]].
** Taste. Photo journalists who cover war and disasters confront situations which may shock the sensitivities of their audiences. For example, human remains are rarely screened. The ethical issue is how far should one risk shocking an audience's sensitivities in order to correctly and fully report the truth. See [[photojournalism]].
* Conflict with the law. Journalistic ethics may conflict with the law over issues such as the protection of confidential [[news source]]s. There is also the question of the extent to which it is ethically acceptable to break the law in order to obtain news. For example, undercover reporters may be engaging in [[deception]], [[trespass]] and similar [[torts]] and crimes. See [[undercover journalism]], [[investigative journalism]].

=== Online Journalism ===
The Internet has shaped and redefined various ethical and moral issues for both online journalists and journalists  utilizing online resources.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

While some journalists continue to adhere to ethical principles of traditional journalism, many journalists believe that with the absence of a mutually agreed upon code of ethics specifically pertaining to internet ethics, and lack of literature dealing specifically with the ways in which the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online, the online environment poses new threats to the profession.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Core Issues of Media Ethics in Online Journalism ====
Some of the core issues of media ethics in online journalism include commercial pressures, accuracy and credibility (which include he issues dealing with hyperlinks), verification of facts, regulation, privacy, and news-gathering methods.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethics of entertainment media ===
Issues in the ethics of entertainment media include:
* The depiction of violence and sex, and the presence of [[strong language]]. Ethical guidelines and legislation in this area are common and many media (e.g. film, computer games) are subject to ratings systems and supervision by agencies. An extensive guide to international systems of enforcement can be found under [[motion picture rating system]].
* “Fluff or “Celebrity News”: Over the years, print media has been dying out so journalists began to report on what is referred to as “Celebrity News”, or “Fluff.” As more outlets adopt this topic to report on, people become dependent on them. According to Alden Weight, most people know not to completely trust these outlets due to ethical discrepancies, but the issue arises when people who are not as mature or educated find these reports to be completely true.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weight|first=Alden|date=Spring 2011|title=Making A Monkey Look Good: The Case For Consumer Ethics of Entertainment Media|url=|journal=Teaching Ethics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV check inline}}
* [[Product placement]]. An increasingly common [[marketing]] tactic is the placement of products in entertainment media. The producers of such media may be paid high sums to display branded products. The practice is controversial and largely unregulated. Detailed article: [[product placement]].
* Advertising: Attraction and persuasion are currently found in modern journalism. It is found that these methods of advertising may alter an audience’s point of view of what is realistic and falsified information.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* [[Stereotypes]]. Both advertising and entertainment media make heavy use of [[stereotypes]]. Stereotypes may negatively affect people's perceptions of themselves or promote socially undesirable behavior. The stereotypical portrayals of [[men]], [[affluence]] and [[ethnic groups]] are examples of major areas of debate
***Women in Media: Entertainment media often exploits female bodies by objectifying and de-humanizing them. By doing so, the concept of female bodies being bought and sold becomes common.
***Media outlets usually use either images or imagery of female bodies to counter negative news that is provided throughout the day.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* Taste and [[taboos]]. Entertainment media often questions of our [[values]] for artistic and entertainment purposes. [[Normative ethics]] is often about moral values, and what kinds should be enforced and protected. In media ethics, these two sides come into conflict. In the name of art, media may deliberately attempt to break with existing norms and shock the audience. That poses ethical problems when the norms abandoned are closely associated with certain relevant moral values or obligations.  The extent to which this is acceptable is always a hotbed of ethical controversy. See: [[Turner Prize]], [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], [[aesthetics]].

=== Media and democracy ===
In democratic countries, a special relationship exists between media and government. Although the freedom of the media may be [[constitution]]ally enshrined and have precise legal definition and enforcement, the exercise of that freedom by individual journalists is a matter of personal choice and ethics.
Modern democratic government subsists in [[Representation (politics)|representation]] of millions by hundreds. For the representatives to be [[accountability|accountable]], and for the process of government to be [[transparency (humanities)|transparent]], effective communication paths must exist to their [[Electoral district|constituents]]. Today these paths consist primarily of the mass media, to the extent that if [[press freedom]] disappeared, so would most political [[accountability]].
In this area, media ethics merges with issues of [[civil rights]] and [[politics]]. Issues include: 
* Subversion of [[media independence]] by financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Moyers]], [http://www.thenation.com/article/media-and-democracy Media and Democracy], [[The Nation]] (Editorial), December 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* Government monitoring of media for intelligence gathering against its own people. See, for example, [[NSA call database]].
See: [[freedom of information]], [[media transparency]] [[Right to Information]].

=== Media integrity ===
Media integrity refers to the ability of a media outlet to serve the [[public interest]] and [[democratic process]], making it resilient to institutional [[corruption]] within the media system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.lessig.org/Institutional_Corruption|title = Institutional Corruption|last = Lessig|first = Lawrence|website = wiki.lessig.org|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism. Media integrity encompasses following qualities of a media outlet: 
* [[Editorial independence|independence]] from private or political interests
* [[Media transparency|transparency]] about own financial interests
* commitment to [[journalism ethics and standards]]
* responsiveness to citizens

The concept was devised particularly for the media systems in the region of [[Southeast Europe|South East Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_FINAL.pdf|title = Media Integrity Matters: Reclaiming Public Service Values in Media and Journalism: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia|last =|first =|publisher = Peace Institute|year = 2014|isbn =|editor-last = Petković|editor-first = Brankica|location = Ljubljana|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the project [http://mediaobservatory.net/about South East European Media Observatory], gathering organisations which are part of the [http://seenpm.org/about-us/ South East European Network for Professionalization of Media (SEENPM)].

== Attempts to Develop a Universal Code of Media Ethics ==
Within the last two decades, numerous regional discussions have taken place in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia in order to create a universal code of ethics for the information society.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capurro; Britz|first=Rafael; Johannes B.|date=2010|title=In Search of a Code of Global Information Ethics: The Road Travelled and New Horizons|url=http://www.communicationethics.net/journal/v7n2-3/v7n2-3_feat2.pdf|journal=Ethical Space: The International Journal of Communication Ethics|volume=7|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the core issues in developing a universal code for media ethics is the difficulty of finding a common ground between ethical principles from one culture to another.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Also, such codes may be interpreted differently according to various moral and legal standards.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== UNESCO INFOethics Congresses ===
The ethical facet of the global information society has been on the [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) agenda since 1997, when the organization initiated their first INFOethics Congress.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The objective of this summit was to spark debate on the ethical dimension of the global information society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The UNESCO INFOethics Congresses then met in 1998 and 2000, where specialists coming from a wide range of educational, scientific, and cultural environments addressed the ethical dimensions of global media and information.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== International Symposium on Information Ethics, Karlsuhe, 2004 ===
In 2004, the ICIE, or International Center for Information Ethics, organized the firs international symposium on information ethics in [[Karlsruhe|Karlsuhe, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Experts with varying scientific backgrounds such as computer science, [[information science]], [[media studies]], and economics, gathered from all over the world to discuss the internet from both an ethical and intercultural perspective.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Contexts of media ethics ==

=== Media ethics and the laws ===

=== Media ethics and media economics ===
Media economics where things such as -- [[deregulation]] of media, [[concentration of media ownership]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations in the U.S, media [[trade unions]] and labor issues, and other such worldwide regulating bodies, [[Citizen journalism|citizen media]] ([[Low-power broadcasting|low power FM]], [[community radio]]) -- have ethical implications......

=== Media ethics and public officials ===
The [[mass media|media]] has manipulated the way public officials conduct themselves through the advancement of technology. Constant television coverage displays the legislative proceedings; exposing faster than ever before, unjust rulings throughout the government process. [[Truth]] telling is crucial in media ethics as any opposition of [[truth]] telling is considered [[deception]]. Anything shown by the media whether print or video is considered to be original. When a statement is written in an article or a video is shown of a public official, it is the original “truthful” words of the individual official themselves.

=== Intercultural dimensions of media ethics ===
If values differ interculturally, the issue arises of the extent to which behaviour should be modified in the light of the values of specific cultures. Two examples of controversy from the field of media ethics:
* [[Google China|Google's self-censorship in China]].
* The [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark, and subsequently worldwide.

== Meta-issues in media ethics ==
One theoretical question for media ethics is the extent to which media ethics is just another topical subdivision of [[applied ethics]], differing only in terms of case applications and raising no theoretical issues peculiar to itself. The oldest subdivisions of applied ethics are [[medical ethics]] and [[business ethics]]. Does media ethics have anything new to add other than interesting cases?

===Similarities between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===

[[Privacy]] and [[honesty]] are issues extensively covered in medical ethical literature, as is
the principle of harm-avoidance. The trade-offs between economic goals and social values has been
covered extensively in [[business ethics]] (as well as medical and [[environmental ethics]]).

===Differences between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===
The issues of [[freedom of speech]] and aesthetic values (taste) are primarily at home in media ethics. However a number of further issues distinguish media ethics as a field in its own right.

A theoretical issue peculiar to media ethics is the identity of ''observer'' and ''observed''. The press is one of the primary guardians in a democratic society of many of the freedoms, rights and duties discussed by other fields of applied ethics. In media ethics the ethical obligations of the guardians themselves comes more strongly into the foreground. Who guards the guardians? This question also arises in the field of [[legal ethics]].

A further self-referentiality or circular characteristic in media ethics is the questioning of its own values. Meta-issues can become identical with the subject matter of media ethics. This is most strongly seen when artistic elements are considered. [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] advertisements and [[Turner prize]] candidates are both examples of ethically questionable media uses which question their own
questioner.

Another characteristic of media ethics is the disparate nature of its goals. Ethical dilemmas emerge when goals conflict. The goals of media usage diverge sharply. Expressed in a consequentialist manner, media usage may be subject to pressures to maximize: economic profits, entertainment value, information provision, the upholding of democratic freedoms, the development of art and culture, fame and vanity.

'''Neuropsychiatry''' is a branch of [[medicine]] that deals with [[mental disorders]] attributable to diseases of the [[nervous system]]. It preceded the current disciplines of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]], which had common training,&lt;ref name=YH2002&gt;

Nevertheless, neuropsychiatry has become a growing subspecialty of [[psychiatry]] and it is also closely related to the fields of [[neuropsychology]] and [[behavioral neurology]].

==The case for the rapprochement of neurology and psychiatry==
Given the considerable overlap between these subspecialities, there has been a resurgence of interest and debate relating to neuropsychiatry in academia over the last decade.&lt;ref name=YH2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=M2002&gt;{{cite journal

Most of this work argues for a rapprochement of neurology and psychiatry, forming a specialty above and beyond a subspecialty of psychiatry. For example, Professor [[Joseph B. Martin]], former Dean of [[Harvard Medical School]] and a [[neurologist]] by training, has summarized the argument for reunion: "the separation of the two categories is arbitrary, often influenced by beliefs rather than proven scientific observations. And the fact that the brain and mind are one makes the separation artificial anyway."&lt;ref name="M2002"/&gt; These points and some of the other major arguments are detailed below.

===Mind/brain monism===
Neurologists have focused objectively on [[organic (model)|organic]] nervous system [[pathology]], especially of the [[brain]], whereas psychiatrists have laid claim to illnesses of the [[mind]]. This [[:wikt:antipodal|antipodal]] distinction between brain and mind as two different entities has characterized many of the differences between the two specialties. However, it has been argued that this division is fictional; evidence from the last century of research has shown that our mental life has its roots in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=M2002/&gt; Brain and mind have been argued not to be discrete entities but just different ways of looking at the same system (Marr, 1982). It has been argued that embracing this mind/brain [[monism]] may be useful for several reasons. First, rejecting dualism implies that all mentation is biological, which provides a common research framework in which understanding and treatment of mental disorders can be advanced. Second, it mitigates widespread confusion about the legitimacy of mental illness by suggesting that all disorders should have a footprint in the brain.

In sum, a reason for the division between [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] was the distinction between mind or first-person experience and the brain. That this difference is taken to be artificial by proponents of mind/brain monism supports a merge between these specialties.

===Causal pluralism===
One of the reasons for the divide is that [[neurology]] traditionally looks at the causes of disorders from an "inside-the-skin" perspective ([[neuropathology]], [[genetics]]) whereas [[psychiatry]] looks at "outside-the-skin" [[Causality|causation]] (personal, interpersonal, cultural).&lt;ref name=K2005/&gt; This dichotomy is argued not to be instructive and authors have argued that it is better conceptualized as two ends of a causal continuum.&lt;ref name=K2005/&gt; The benefits of this position are: firstly, understanding of [[etiology]] will be enriched, in particular between [[brain]] and [[social environment|environment]]. One example is [[eating disorders]], which have been found to have some neuropathology (Uher and Treasure, 2005) but also show increased incidence in rural Fijian school girls after exposure to [[television]] (Becker, 2004). Another example is [[schizophrenia]], the risk for which may be considerably reduced in a healthy family environment (Tienari et al., 2004).

It is also argued that this augmented understanding of etiology will lead to better remediation and rehabilitation strategies through an understanding of the different levels in the causal process where one can intervene. It may be that non-organic interventions, like [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), better attenuate disorders alone or in conjunction with drugs. Linden's (2006) demonstration of how [[psychotherapy]] has neurobiological commonalities with [[pharmacotherapy]] is a pertinent example of this and is encouraging from a patient perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.

In sum, the argument is that an understanding of the mental disorders must not only have a specific knowledge of brain constituents and genetics (inside-the-skin) but also the context (outside-the-skin) in which these parts operate (Koch and Laurent, 1999). Only by joining neurology and psychiatry, it is argued, can this nexus be used to reduce human suffering.

===Organic basis===
To further sketch psychiatry's history shows a departure from structural neuropathology, relying more upon [[ideology]] (Sabshin, 1990). A good example of this is [[Tourette syndrome]], which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of [[masturbation]] caused by sexual repression. However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in attenuating symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained pathophysiological support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000). This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting [[neurology]] and [[psychiatry]] because both are dealing with disorders of the same system.

===Improved patient care===
Further, it is argued that this nexus will allow a more refined [[nosology]] of mental illness to emerge thus helping to improve [[therapy|remediation]] and [[psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] strategies beyond current ones that lump together ranges of symptoms. However, it cuts both ways: traditionally neurological disorders, like [[Parkinson's disease]], are being recognized for their high incidence of traditionally psychiatric symptoms, like [[psychosis]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]] (Lerner and Whitehouse, 2002). These symptoms, which are largely ignored in [[neurology]],&lt;ref name="YH2002"/&gt; can be addressed by neuropsychiatry and lead to improved patient care. In sum, it is argued that patients from both traditional psychiatry and neurology departments will see their care improved following a reuniting of the specialties.

===Better management model===
Schiffer et al. (2004) argue that there are good management and financial reasons for rapprochement.

==US institutions==
"Behavioral Neurology &amp; Neuropsychiatry" fellowships are accredited by the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS; [http://www.ucns.org www.ucns.org]), in a manner analogous to the accreditation of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] residencies in the United States by the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]] (ABPN).

The [[American Neuropsychiatric Association]] (ANPA) was established in 1988 and is the American medical subspecialty society for neuropsychiatrists. ANPA holds an annual meeting and offers other forums for education and professional networking amongst subspecialists in behavioral neurology &amp; neuropsychiatry as well as clinicians, scientists, and educators in related fields. American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. publishes the peer-reviewed ''[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]]'', which is the official journal of ANPA.

==International organizations==
The International Neuropsychiatric Association was established in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Neuropsychiatric Association|url=http://www.inawebsite.org/|website=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; INA holds congresses biennially in countries around the world and partners with regional neuropsychiatric associations around the world to support regional neuropsychiatric conferences and to facilitate the development of neuropsychiatry in the countries/regions where those conferences are held. Prof. Robert  Haim Belmaker &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://haimbelmaker.co.il/en/|title=אתר הבית של פרופ' חיים בלמקר|website=haimbelmaker.co.il|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current President of the organization whereas [[Ennapadam Srinivas Krishnamoorthy|Prof. Ennapadam S Krishnamoorthy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neurokrish  - The Neuropsychiatry Center|url=http://neurokrish.com/founder-team/our-founder/}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as President-Elect with Dr. Gilberto Brofman as Secretary-Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Neuropsychiatric Association|url=http://www.inawebsite.org/#!committees-/ieaoy/|website=Committee Members }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British NeuroPsychiatry Association (BNPA) was founded in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/pbrcpsych/12/5/174.2.full.pdf|title=Bulletin Of The Royal College Of Psychiatrists|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the leading academic and professional body for medical practitioners and professionals allied to medicine in the UK working at the interface of the clinical and cognitive neurosciences and psychiatry.

Recently, a new non-profit professional society named [[Neuropsychiatric Forum|Neuropsychiatric Forum (NPF)]] was founded. NPF aims to support effective communication and interdisciplinary collaboration, develop education schemes and research projects, organize neuropsychiatric conferences and seminars.

{{Books of the New Testament}}
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

The '''New Testament''' ({{lang-gr|Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη}}, [[Transliteration|trans.]] ''Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē''; {{lang-la|Novum Testamentum}}) is the second part of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], the first part being the [[Old Testament]], based on the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], as well as events in [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christianity]]. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as [[Religious text|sacred scripture]]. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the [[Early centers of Christianity|spread of Christianity around the world]]. It reflects and serves as a source for [[Christian theology]] and [[Christian ethics|morality]]. Extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]]. The New Testament has influenced religious, [[Philosophical movement|philosophical]], and [[Political movement|political]] [[Social movement|movements]] in [[Christendom]] and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.

The New Testament is a collection of Christian works written in the [[Koine Greek|common (Koine) Greek]] language of the first century, at different times by various writers, and the modern consensus is that it provides important evidence regarding [[Christianity and Judaism|Judaism]] in the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Barton (theologian)|Barton, John]] (3 February 2012). "Before the parting of the ways". ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all Christian traditions today, the New Testament consists of 27 books. 
The [[Biblical canon|canon]] or list of the books of the New Testament is not found anywhere in any book of the Bible. It was the united Catholic Church which defined the 27-book canon. The first time we find the complete list of the 27 books of the NT is in Athanasius, eastern Catholic bishop of the IV Century. The first time that church councils gave us this same list was in the councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397) in north Africa and the pope Innocent I ratified the same canon in 405, but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under pope Damasus gave the same list first. These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament, which included the so-called apocryphal books &lt;ref&gt; Introduction to the New Testament. Werner Georg Kummel, pages 500f. Abingdon Press. Nashville. 1993. &lt;/ref&gt;.

The original texts were written in the first century of the [[Christian Era]], in Greek, which was the [[Lingua franca|common language]] of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] from the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests of Alexander the Great]] (335–323 BC) until the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century AD. All the works that eventually became incorporated into the New Testament are believed to have been written no later than around 120 AD.&lt;ref name = seeStandard&gt;See the books listed under "Further reading", below, by Goodspeed, Kümmel, Duling and Perrin, Koester, Conzelmann and Lindemann, Brown, and Ehrman. E.g. {{cite book |author=Bart D. Ehrman |title=The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpoNAQAAMAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-508481-8 |page=8 |quote=The New Testament contains twenty-seven books, written in Greek, by fifteen or sixteen different authors, who were addressing other Christian individuals or communities between the years 50 and 120 C.E.

Collections of related texts such as [[Pauline epistles|letters]] of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] (a major collection of which must have been made already by the early 2nd century)&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Clabeaux, J. J. (1989). ''A Lost Edition of the Letters of Paul: A Reassessment of the Text of the Pauline Corpus Attested by [[Marcion]]''. Catholic Biblical Quarterly Monograph Series, 21. Washington, D.C.: Catholic Biblical Association.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Canonical Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (asserted by [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyon]] in the late-2nd century as ''the'' Four Gospels) gradually were joined to other collections and single works in different combinations to [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|form various Christian canons of Scripture]]. Over time, some [[Antilegomena|disputed books]], such as the [[Book of Revelation]] and the [[Catholic epistles|Minor Catholic (General) Epistles]] were introduced into [[Biblical canon|canons]] in which they were originally absent. Other works earlier held to be Scripture, such as [[1 Clement]], the [[Shepherd of Hermas]], and the [[Diatessaron]], were excluded from the New Testament. The Old Testament canon is not completely uniform among all major Christian groups including [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Slavic Orthodox|Slavic Orthodox Churches]], and the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]]. However, the [[Development of the New Testament canon|twenty-seven-book canon]] of the New Testament, at least since [[Late Antiquity]], has been almost universally recognized within [[Christianity]] (see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]).

The New Testament consists of:
*Four narratives of the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus called "gospel" or the good news.
*A narrative of the [[Apostles|Apostle]] ministries in the [[Early Christianity|early church]], called the "Acts of the Apostles", and probably written by the same writer as the [[Gospel of Luke]], which it continues;
*Twenty-one letters, often called "[[epistles]]" from Greek "epistole", written by various authors, and consisting of Christian doctrine, counsel, instruction, and conflict resolution; and
*An [[Apocalypse]], the [[Book of Revelation]], which is a [[Prophecy|book of prophecy]], containing some instructions to [[Seven churches of Asia|seven local congregations of Asia Minor]], but mostly containing prophetical [[semiotics|symbology]], about the [[end time]]s.

The term "new testament" ([[Koine Greek]]: Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη, ''Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_post01/NT/nte_intr.html|title=bibliotheca Augustana|author=|date=|work=hs-augsburg.de|accessdate=17 February 2016}}{{primary source inline|date=February 2016}}{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}} or "[[new covenant]]" (Hebrew בְּרִית חֲדָשָׁה ''bərîṯ ḥăḏāšâ''){{citation needed|date=February 2016}} first occurs in {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|31:31}} (Greek [[Septuagint]] καινὴ διαθήκη ''kainḕ diathḗkē'', cited in {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|8:8}}).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The same Greek phrase for "new covenant" is found elsewhere in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Luke|22:20}}, {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:25||1 Corinthians 11:25}}, {{Bibleref2|2cor|3:6||2 Corinthians 3:6}}, {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|8:8}}, and {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|9:15}}; cf. {{Bibleref2|2Cor|3:14||2 Corinthians 3:14}}).{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In early [[Bible translations into Latin]], the phrase was rendered ''foedus'', "federation", in {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|31:31}},{{according to whom|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and was rendered ''testamentum'' in {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|8:8}} and other instances from which comes the English term "New Testament."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Modern English, like Latin, distinguishes [[wikt:testament|testament]] and [[wikt:covenant|covenant]] as alternative translations, and consequently the treatment of the term διαθήκη ''diathḗkē'' varies in [[Bible translations into English]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[John Wycliffe]]'s 1395 version is a translation of the [[Latin Vulgate]] and so follows different terms in Jeremiah and Hebrews:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Lo! days shall come, saith the Lord, and I shall make a new covenant (from Latin ''foedus'') with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah|31:31}}

:For he reproving him saith, Lo! days come, saith the Lord, when I shall establish a new testament (from Latin ''testamentum'') on the house of Israel, and on the house of Judah.{{Bibleref2c|Hebrews|8:8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Use of the term ''New Testament'' to describe a collection of first and second-century Christian Greek Scriptures can be traced back to [[Tertullian]] (in ''Against [[Praxeas]]'' 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Allen, Clifton J. | date = 1969 | title = The Broadman Bible Commentary: Volume 8, General Articles, Matthew-Mark | location = London, England, and Nashville, Tennessee, USA | publisher = Broadman Press | asin = B000BUN8GM | quote = Tertullian was apparently the first to use the term New Testament in the sense of a collection of books (Against Praxeas XV). }}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Against [[Marcion]]'', written ''circa'' 208 AD, he writes of
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Divine Word, who is doubly edged with the two testaments of the [[Torah|law]] and the [[gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. "Chapter XIV". [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian123.html ''Against Marcion, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And Tertullian continues later in the book, writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
it is certain that the whole aim at which he [Marcion] has strenuously laboured, even in the drawing up of his [[Antitheses]], centres in this, that he may establish a diversity between the Old and the New Testaments, so that his own [[Christ]] may be separate from the [[Creator God|Creator]], as belonging to this rival god, and as alien from the law and the [[Neviim|prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. "Chapter VI". [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian124.html ''Against Marcion, Book IV''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also Tertullian, [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian124.html ''Against Marcion, Book IV''], chapters I, II, XIV. However, his meaning in chapter XX is less clear, and in chapters IX and XL he uses the term to mean "new covenant".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], the existence—even if not the exact contents—of both an Old and New Testament had been established. [[Lactantius]], a 3rd–4th century Christian author wrote in his early-4th-century Latin ''Institutiones Divinae'' (''Divine Institutes''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But all scripture is divided into two Testaments. That which preceded the advent and passion of Christ—that is, the [[Torah|law]] and the [[Neviim|prophets]]—is called the Old; but those things which were written after His resurrection are named the New Testament. The Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited. As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such things: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord."{{Bibleref2c|Jer|31:31–32}}  ... For that which He said above, that He would make a new testament to the house of Judah, shows that the old testament which was given by Moses was not perfect; but that which was to be given by Christ would be complete.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius. "Chapter XX". [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.iii.ii.iv.xx.html "The Divine Institutes, Book IV"].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Books==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
{{See also|Christian biblical canons|Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament apocrypha|Template:Books of the New Testament}}
The [[canon of the New Testament]] is the collection of books that most [[Christians]] regard as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]] and constituting the New Testament of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]].&lt;ref name="mcdowell2006_canon"&gt;McDowell, Josh. Evidence for Christianity. Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, Inc. 2006. pp. 42–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period extending roughly from 50 to 150 AD, a number of documents began to circulate among the churches, including epistles, gospel accounts, memoirs, prophecies, homilies, and collections of teachings.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} While some of these documents were [[Apostolic Age|apostolic in origin]], others drew upon the tradition the apostles and ministers of the word had utilized in their individual missions, and still others represented a summation of the teaching entrusted to a particular church center.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Several of these writings sought to extend, interpret, and apply apostolic teaching to meet the needs of Christians in a given locality.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In general, among [[Christian denominations]] the New Testament canon came to be agreed-upon as a list of 27 books, although the order of the books can vary from one version of the printed scriptures to the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The book order is the same in the Greek Orthodox,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Roman Catholic,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and Protestant traditions.&lt;ref name="Luther"&gt;Bouman, Herbert J.

===The Gospels===
{{Main article|Canonical gospels}}
Each of the four [[gospels]] in the New Testament narrates the life, death, and resurrection of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]. The word "gospel" derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''gōd-spell''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Gospel |title=Gospel |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rarely ''godspel''), meaning "good news" or "glad tidings". The gospel was considered the "good news" of the coming [[Messiah#Christianity|Kingdom of Messiah]], and the redemption through the life and death of Jesus, the central Christian message.&lt;ref name="ODCC self Gospel"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed (2005). "Gospel". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Gospel is a [[calque]] (word-for-word translation) of the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|εὐαγγέλιον}}, ''euangelion'' (''eu-'' "good", ''-angelion'' "message").

Since the 2nd century, the four narrative accounts of the life and work of Jesus Christ have been referred to as "The Gospel of ..." or "The Gospel according to ..." followed by the name of the supposed author. Whatever these admittedly early ascriptions may imply about the sources behind or the perception of these gospels, they are anonymous compositions.&lt;ref name = seeStandard/&gt;
* The [[Gospel of Matthew]], ascribed to the [[Matthew the Evangelist|Apostle Matthew]]. This gospel begins with a [[genealogy of Jesus]] and a story of his birth that includes a visit from [[Biblical Magi|magi]] and a [[flight into Egypt]], and it ends with the [[Great Commission|commissioning of the disciples]] by the resurrected Jesus.
* The [[Gospel of Mark]], ascribed to [[Mark the Evangelist]]. This gospel begins with the preaching of [[John the Baptist]] and the [[baptism of Jesus]]. Two different secondary endings were affixed to this gospel in the 2nd century.
* The [[Gospel of Luke]], ascribed to [[Luke the Evangelist]], who was not one of [[Twelve Disciples#The Twelve Apostles|the Twelve Apostles]], but was mentioned as a companion of the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] and as a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, Joseph A. (1985). ''The Gospel according to Luke, Vol. 1''. Anchor Bible Commentary series. New York: Doubleday. pp. 35–53.&lt;/ref&gt; This gospel begins with parallel stories of the birth and childhood of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]] and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus and his ascension into heaven.
* The [[Gospel of John]], ascribed to [[John the Apostle]]. This gospel begins with a philosophical prologue and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus. It is about Jesus's miracles.

The first three gospels listed above are classified as the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. They contain similar accounts of the events in Jesus' life and his teaching, due to their literary interdependence. The Gospel of John is structured differently and includes stories of several miracles of Jesus and sayings not found in the other three.

These four gospels that were eventually included in the New Testament were only a few among many other early Christian gospels. The existence of such texts is even mentioned at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke.{{Bibleref2c|Luke|1:1–4}} Other early Christian gospels such as the so-called "[[Jewish-Christian Gospels]]" or the [[Gospel of Thomas]], also offer both a window into the context of [[early Christianity]] and may provide some assistance in the reconstruction of the [[historical Jesus]].

===Acts of the Apostles===
The [[Acts of the Apostles]] is a narrative of the apostles' ministry and activity after [[Christ's death]] and resurrection, from which point it resumes and functions as a sequel to the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Examining style, phraseology, and other evidence, modern scholarship generally concludes that Acts and the Gospel of Luke share the same author, referred to as [[Luke–Acts]]. Luke-Acts does not name its author.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=196}} Church tradition identified him as [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, but the majority of scholars reject this due to the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=235}} The most probable date of composition is around 80–100 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250–53}}

===Epistles===
The epistles of the New Testament are considered by Christians to be divinely inspired and holy letters, written by the apostles and disciples of Christ, to either local congregations with specific needs, or to New Covenant Christians in general, scattered about; or "Catholic Epistles."

====Pauline Letters to Churches====
{{Main article|Pauline epistles}}
The Pauline epistles are the thirteen New Testament books that present [[Paul the Apostle]] as their author.{{refn|group=note|[[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] in his ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians'' writes: "At this point [{{Bibleref2|Gal|6:11}}] the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleref2|2 Thess|2:2||2 Thess. 3:17}}; {{bibleref2-nb|2 Thess|3:17||2 Thess. 3:17}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries.... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. ''pelikois grammasin''), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lightfoot |first=Joseph Barber |year=1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8ECAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 |title=St Paul's Epistle to the Galatians |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Six of the letters are disputed. Four are thought by most modern scholars to be [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]], i.e., not actually written by Paul even if attributed to him within the letters themselves.  Opinion is more divided on the other two disputed letters (2 Thessalonians and Colossians).&lt;ref&gt;Bassler, Jouette M. (2010). "Paul and his Letters". In Aune, David E. ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 388. {{ISBN|9781444318944}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These letters were written to Christian communities in specific cities or geographical regions, often to address issues faced by that particular community. Prominent themes include the relationship both to broader "[[Gentile|pagan]]" society, to Judaism, and to other Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Roetzel, Calvin J. (2009). ''The Letters of Paul: Conversations in Context'' (5th ed.). Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox. {{ISBN|9780664233921}}.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Epistle to the Romans]]
*[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]
*[[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]]
*[[Epistle to the Galatians]]
*[[Epistle to the Ephesians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*[[Epistle to the Philippians]]
*[[Epistle to the Colossians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*[[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]]
*[[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]

====Pauline Letters to Persons====
The last four Pauline letters in the New Testament are addressed to individual persons. They include the following:
* [[First Epistle to Timothy]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Second Epistle to Timothy]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Epistle to Titus]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Epistle to Philemon]]
[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]

All of the above except for Philemon are known as the [[Pastoral epistles]]. They are addressed to individuals charged with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. They often address different concerns to those of the preceding epistles. These letters are believed by many to be pseudepigraphic. Some scholars (e.g., Bill Mounce, Ben Witherington) will argue that the letters are genuinely Pauline, or at least written under Paul's supervision.

====Hebrews====
The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] addresses a Jewish audience who had come to believe that Jesus was the [[Messiah#Judaism|anointed one]] (Hebrew: מָשִׁיחַ—transliterated in English as "Moshiach", or "Messiah"; Greek: Χριστός—transliterated in English as "Christos", for "[[Christ]]") who was predicted in the writings of the Hebrew Bible. The author discusses the "better-ness" of the new covenant and the ministry of Jesus, over the Mosaic covenant {{Bibleref2c|Heb.|1:1–10:18}} and urges the readers in the practical implications of this conviction through the end of the epistle.{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|10:19–13:25}}

The book has been widely accepted by the Christian church as inspired by God and thus authoritative, despite the acknowledgment of uncertainties about who its human author was. Regarding authorship, although the Epistle to the Hebrews does not internally claim to have been written by the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], some similarities in wordings to some of the Pauline Epistles have been noted and inferred. In antiquity, some began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold W. Attridge|Attridge, Harold W.]] (1989). ''Hebrews''. Hermeneia. Philadelphia: Fortress. pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century, [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] supported [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|Paul's authorship]]. The Church largely agreed to include Hebrews as the fourteenth letter of Paul, and affirmed this authorship until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The letter to the Hebrews had difficulty in being accepted as part of the Christian canon because of its anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Lane|Lane, William L.]] (1991). ''Hebrews 1–8''. Word Biblical Commentary series, Vol. 47A. Dallas, Texas: Word Books. p. cliv.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 3rd century, [[Origen]] wrote of the letter, "Men of old have handed it down as Paul's, but who wrote the Epistle God only knows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm |author=Eusebius |title=Church History, Book VI |chapter=Chapter 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholars often reject Pauline authorship for the epistle to the Hebrews,&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2004:411"&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (1997). ''The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings''. Oxford University Press. p. 323. "Scholars in the ancient world went about detecting forgeries in much the same way that modern scholars do. They looked to see whether the ideas and writing style of a piece conformed with those used by the author in other writings, and they examined the text for any blatant anachronisms, that is, statements about things that could not have existed at the time the alleged author was writing (like the letter reputedly from an early seventeenth-century American colonist that mentions "the United States")- Arguments of this kind were used by some Christian scholars of the third century to show that Hebrews was not written by Paul or the Book of Revelation by John the son of Zebedee. Modern scholars, as we will see, concur with these judgments. To be sure, neither of these books can be considered a forgery. Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul (it is anonymous), and the John who wrote Revelation does not claim to be the son of Zebedee (it is therefore homonymous). Are there other books in the New Testament, though, that can be considered forgeries?"&lt;/ref&gt; based on its distinctive style and theology, which are considered to set it apart from Paul's writings.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark A. |year=2009 |title=Introducing the New Testament: A Historical, Literary, and Theological Survey |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=Baker Academic |pages=431–32 |isbn=9780801028687 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholic epistles====
The [[Catholic epistles]] (or "general epistles") consist of both letters and treatises in the form of letters written to the church at large. The term "[[catholic]]" ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]: καθολική, ''katholikē''), used to describe these letters in the oldest manuscripts containing them, here simply means "general" or "universal". The authorship of a number of these is disputed.
* [[Epistle of James]], written by an author named "James", often identified with [[James the Just|James, the brother of Jesus]].
* [[First Epistle of Peter]], ascribed to the [[Saint Peter|Apostle Peter]].
* [[Second Epistle of Peter]], ascribed to the Apostle Peter, though widely considered not to have been written by him.&lt;ref&gt;Fornberg, Tord (1977). ''An Early Church in a Pluralistic Society: A Study of 2 Peter''. Coniectanea Biblica, New Testament Series 9. Lund: Gleerup.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First Epistle of John]], ascribed to [[John the Apostle]].
* [[Second Epistle of John]], ascribed to John the Apostle.
* [[Third Epistle of John]], ascribed to John the Apostle.
* [[Epistle of Jude]], written under the name of [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Jude, the brother of Jesus and James]].

===Book of Revelation===
{{Further information|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The final book of the New Testament is the [[Book of Revelation]], also known as the Apocalypse of John. In the New Testament canon, it is considered [[Bible prophecy|prophetical]] or [[apocalyptic literature]]. Its authorship has been attributed either to John the Apostle (in which case it is often thought that John the Apostle is [[John the Evangelist]], i.e. author of the [[Gospel of John]]) or to another John designated "[[John of Patmos]]" after the island where the text says the revelation was received (1:9). Some ascribe the writership date as circa 81–96 AD, and others at around 68 AD.&lt;ref name=Mounce&gt;[[Robert Mounce|Mounce, Robert]] (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=06VR1JzzLNsC&amp;pg=PA15 ''The Book of Revelation''] (revised ed.). The New International Commentary on the New Testament Series. Cambridge, UK: Eerdmans. pp. 15–16. {{ISBN|0802825370}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work opens with letters to [[Seven churches of Asia|seven churches]] and thereafter takes the form of an [[apocalypse]], a literary genre popular in ancient Judaism and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed study of the Apocalypse of John, see Aune, David E.

&lt;references group=N /&gt;

==Book order==
The order in which the books of the New Testament appear differs between some collections and ecclesiastical traditions. In the Latin West, prior to the [[Vulgate]] (an early 5th-century Latin version of the Bible), the four Gospels were arranged in the following order: Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark.{{refn|group=note|The Gospels are in this order in many Old Latin manuscripts, as well as in the Greek manuscripts [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Washingtonianus]].}} The Syriac [[Peshitta]] places the major Catholic epistles (James, 1 Peter, and 1 John) immediately after Acts and before the Pauline epistles.

The order of an early edition of the letters of Paul is based on the size of the letters: longest to shortest, though keeping 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians together. The Pastoral epistles were apparently not part of the ''Corpus Paulinum'' in which this order originated and were later inserted after 2 Thessalonians and before Philemon. Hebrews was variously incorporated into the ''Corpus Paulinum'' either after 2 Thessalonians, after Philemon (i.e. at the very end), or after Romans.

The New Testament of the 16th-century [[Luther Bible]] continues, to this day, to place Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Apocalypse last. This reflects the thoughts of the Reformer Martin Luther [[Luther's canon|on the canonicity of these books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html|title=Web Directory: German Bible Versions|publisher=Bible Research|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also the article on the [[Antilegomena]].}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Apocrypha==
{{Main article|New Testament apocrypha}}
The books that eventually found a permanent place in the New Testament were not the only works of Christian literature produced in the earliest Christian centuries. The long process of [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonization]] began early, sometimes with tacit reception of traditional texts, sometimes with explicit selection or rejection of particular texts as either acceptable or unacceptable for use in a given context (e.g., not all texts that were acceptable for private use were considered appropriate for use in the [[liturgy]]).

Over the course of history, those works of early Christian literature that survived but that did not become part of the New Testament have been variously grouped by theologians and scholars. Drawing upon, though redefining, an older term used in [[early Christianity]] and among Protestants when referring to those books found in the Christian [[Old Testament]] although not in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]], modern scholars began to refer to these works of early Christian literature not included in the New Testament as "apocryphal", by which was meant non-canonical.

Collected editions of these works were then referred to as the "[[New Testament apocrypha]]". Typically excluded from such published collections are the following groups of works: [[Apostolic Fathers|The Apostolic Fathers]], the 2nd-century Christian apologists, [[Alexandrian school|the Alexandrians]], [[Tertullian]], [[Methodius of Olympus]], [[Novatian]], [[Cyprian]], martyrdoms, and [[Desert Fathers|the Desert Fathers]]. Almost all other Christian literature from the period, and sometimes including works composed well into [[Late Antiquity]], are relegated to the so-called New Testament apocrypha.

Although not considered to be inspired by God,  these "apocryphal" works may be helpful in the study of the New Testament in that they were produced in the same ancient context and often using the same language as those books that would eventually form the New Testament. Some of these later works are dependent (either directly or indirectly) upon books that would later come to be in the New Testament or upon the ideas expressed in them. There is even an example of a [[pseudepigraph]]ical letter composed under the guise of a presumably lost letter of the Apostle Paul, the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]].

==Authors==
{{Main article|Authorship of the Bible}}
The books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by [[Jewish Christians]]—that is, Jewish disciples of Christ, who lived in the [[Roman Empire]], and under [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Powell|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, is frequently thought of as an exception; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jew]].&lt;ref name="Strelan2013"&gt;Strelan, Rick (2013).

===Gospels===
{{Main article|Synoptic Gospels}}
Authorship is an area of longstanding and current research and debate, with different works posing different problems for identification. While the various works have traditional ascriptions of authorship, these ascriptions are in some cases defended by scholars, and in other cases disputed or rejected.&lt;ref&gt;For overviews of the scholarship on authorship of the various New Testament works, see the relevant entries in Aune, David E., ed. (2010). ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''.

There is a tradition that the Apostle John was the author of the Gospel of John. Traditionalists (such as biblical commentators Albert Barnes and Matthew Henry) seem to support the idea that the writer of the Gospel of John himself claimed to be an eyewitness in their commentaries of John 21:24 and therefore the gospel was written by an eyewitness;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barnes |first=Albert |title=Barnes' Notes on the New Testament |year=1962 |orig-year=1832 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvXCoSQ1y0EC&amp;pg=PA360 |publisher=Kregel Publications |page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henry |first=Matthew |title=Matthew Henry Complete Commentary on the Whole Bible |orig-year=1706 |url=http://www.studylight.org/commentaries/mhm/john-21.html |publisher=StudyLight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this idea is rejected by the majority of modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Johannine Literature|last1=Lindars|first1=Barnabas|authorlink1 = Barnabas Lindars |last2=Edwards|first2=Ruth B.|last3=Court|first3=John M.|year=2000|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVOD0PhayhsC&amp;pg=PA41|ref=harv|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of [[Richard Bauckham]]'s book ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony'' states "The common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing."&lt;ref name="HahnScott2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Scott W.|editor-last1=Hahn|editor-first2=David|editor-last2=Scott|title=Letter &amp; Spirit, Volume 3: The Hermeneutic of Continuity: Christ, Kingdom, and Creation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ-fd4hQQJ0C&amp;pg=PA225|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Emmaus Road Publishing|isbn=978-1-931018-46-3|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars hold to the [[two-source hypothesis]], which claims that the [[Marcan priority|Gospel of Mark was written first]]. According to the hypothesis, the authors of the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke then used the Gospel of Mark and the hypothetical [[Q document]], in addition to some other sources, to write their individual gospel accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/mark.html |title=Gospel of Mark |publisher=Early Christian Writings |accessdate=15 January 2008 |last=Kirby |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Achtemeier |first=Paul J. |encyclopedia=The Anchor Bible Dictionary |title=The Gospel of Mark |year=1992 |publisher=Doubleday |volume=4 |location=New York |isbn=0-385-19362-9 |page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Easton, M.

Scholars agree that the Gospel of John was written last, by using a different tradition and body of testimony. In addition, most scholars agree that the author of Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles. Scholars hold that these books constituted two halves of a single work, [[Luke-Acts]].

===Pauline epistles===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Pauline epistles}}
[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 17th-century painting. Most scholars think Paul actually dictated his letters to a secretary.]]
The Pauline epistles are the thirteen books in the New Testament traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus]]. The anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews is, despite unlikely Pauline authorship, often functionally grouped with these thirteen to form a corpus of fourteen "Pauline" epistles.{{refn|group=note|Although Hebrews was almost certainly not written by Paul, it has been a part of the Pauline corpus "from the beginning of extant MS production".&lt;ref name=hebot01&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel B. |url=https://bible.org/seriespage/19-hebrews-introduction-argument-and-outline |title=Hebrews: Introduction, Argument, and Outline |publisher=Bible.org |date=28 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seven letters are generally classified as "undisputed", expressing contemporary scholarly near consensus that they are the work of Paul: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philemon. Six additional letters bearing Paul's name do not currently enjoy the same academic consensus: Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.{{refn|group=note|name="Lock, Meinertz p.622"|Guthrie lists: ohlenberg, Lock, Meinertz, Thornell, Schlatter, Spicq, [[Jeremais|Jeremias]], Simpson, Kelly, and Fee"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Guthrie|1990|p=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While many scholars uphold the traditional view, some question whether the first three, called the "Deutero-Pauline Epistles", are authentic letters of Paul. As for the latter three, the "Pastoral epistles", some scholars uphold the traditional view of these as the genuine writings of the Apostle Paul;&lt;ref group="note" name="Lock, Meinertz p.622"/&gt; most, however, regard them as [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigrapha]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman (2004), p. 385.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might refer to the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]] and the [[Third Epistle to the Corinthians]] as examples of works identified as pseudonymous. Since the early centuries of the church, there has been debate concerning the authorship of the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews, and contemporary scholars generally reject Pauline authorship.&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2004:411"/&gt;

The epistles all share common themes, emphasis, vocabulary and style; they exhibit a uniformity of doctrine concerning the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], Jesus, faith, and various other issues. All of these letters easily fit into the chronology of Paul's journeys depicted in Acts of the Apostles.

===Other epistles===
The author of the [[Epistle of James]] identifies himself in the opening verse as "James, a servant of [[God]] and of the Lord [[Jesus]] Christ". From the middle of the 3rd century, [[patristic]] authors cited the ''Epistle'' as written by [[James the Just]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/j/james,epistle_of_st.html "Epistle of St. James"]. ''1914 Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and modern scholars have always been divided on the issue of authorship. Many consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/james.html |title=Epistle of James |publisher=Early Christian Writings |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the [[First Epistle of Peter]] identifies himself in the opening verse as "Peter, an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] of Jesus Christ", and the view that the epistle was written by St. Peter is attested to by a number of [[Church Fathers]]: [[Irenaeus]] (140–203), [[Tertullian]] (150–222), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (155–215) and [[Origen of Alexandria]] (185–253). Unlike [[The Second Epistle of Peter]], the authorship of which was debated in antiquity, there was little debate about Peter's authorship of this first epistle until the 18th century. Although 2 Peter internally purports to be a work of the apostle, many biblical scholars have concluded that Peter is not the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What Are They Saying About the Catholic Epistles? |first=Philip B. |last=Harner |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xenz0ZMWDNsC&amp;pg=PA49 |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2004|isbn=9780809141883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an early date and (usually) for a defense of the Apostle Peter's authorship see Kruger,&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, M.J.

The Epistle of Jude title is written as follows: "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James" ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]). The debate has continued over the author's identity as the apostle, the brother of Jesus, both, or neither.&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham, R. J. (1986). ''Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 50''. Word (UK) Ltd. p. 14f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johannine works===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The [[First Epistle of John]] is traditionally held to have been composed by [[John the Apostle]] (the author of the [[Gospel of John]]) when the writer was in advanced age. The epistle's content, language and conceptual style indicate that it may have had the same author as the Gospel of John, 2 John and 3 John.&lt;ref name="Harris 1John"&gt;{{harvp|Harris|1985|loc="1 John"|pp=355–356}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] claimed that the author of 2nd and 3rd John was not [[John the Apostle]], but an "elder John" which refers either to the apostle at an advanced age or a hypothetical second individual ("[[John the Elder]]").&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. "Chapter 39". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''The Church History, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars today are divided on the issue.

===Revelation===
The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] identifies himself several times as "John".{{Bibleref2c|Rev.|1:1,4,9;22:8||Rev.&amp;nbsp;1:1,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;9;&amp;nbsp;22:8}} and states that he was on [[Patmos]] when he received his first vision.{{Bibleref2c|Rev.|1:9;4:1-2||Rev.&amp;nbsp;1:9;&amp;nbsp;4:1-2}} As a result, the author is sometimes referred to as [[John of Patmos]]. The author has traditionally been identified with [[John the Apostle]] to whom the [[Gospel of John|Gospel]] and the [[epistles of John]] were attributed. It was believed that he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]], and there wrote Revelation. [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100–165 AD) who was acquainted with [[Polycarp]], who had been mentored by John, makes a possible allusion to this book, and credits John as the source.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr. ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. Chapter LXXXI.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] (c. 115–202) assumes it as a conceded point. According to the ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible'', modern scholars are divided between the apostolic view and several alternative hypotheses put forth in the last hundred years or so.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney, Merrill C., gen. ed. (2009). "Revelation, Book of the". ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, Vol. 5 (Q-Z)''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Witherington]] points out that linguistic evidence makes it unlikely that the books were written by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben (2003). ''Revelation''. Cambridge University Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates of composition==
:''See individual book articles for more detail.''
The earliest works that became part of the New Testament are the letters of the Apostle Paul. The earliest of the books of the New Testament was [[First Thessalonians]], an epistle of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], written probably in 51, or possibly [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] in 49 according to one of two theories of its writing.

In the 1830s German scholars of the [[Tübingen school]] tried to date the books as late as the 3rd century, but the discovery of some [[Biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]] and fragments from the 2nd and 3rd centuries, one of which dates as early as 125 ([[Papyrus 52]]), disproves a 3rd-century date of composition for any book now in the New Testament. Additionally, a [[First Epistle of Clement|letter to the church at Corinth]] in the name of [[Clement I|Clement of Rome]] in 95 quotes from 10 of the 27 books of the New Testament, and a [[Polycarp's letter to the Philippians|letter to the church at Philippi in the name of Polycarp]] in 120 quotes from 16 books.  Therefore, some of the books of the New Testament must have been in circulation by the end of the first century.

Scholars hold a wide spectrum of views on exactly when the books of the new testament were written, with non-fundamentalist scholars tending to argue for later dates, and more conservative scholars arguing for an earlier one.  Most contemporary scholars regard [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] as a source used by Luke (see [[Marcan priority]]).&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Helmut (1999). ''Ancient Christian Gospels''. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Trinity Press International. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is true that Mark was written around the destruction of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], around 70,&lt;ref name = "TM1998 Mark"&gt;Theissen, Gerd; Merz, Annette (1996). ''The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide''. Fortress Press. (1996 edition). p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; they theorize that Luke would not have been written before 70. Some who take this view believe that Luke's prediction of the destruction of the temple could not be a result of Jesus predicting the future but with the benefit of hindsight regarding specific details. They believe that the [[Olivet Discourse]] in {{Bibleref2|Luke|21:5–30}} is specific enough (more specific than Mark's or Matthew's) that a date after 70 seems likely.&lt;ref name="ODCC self Matthew"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. (2005). "Matthew, Gospel according to St". ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|S. Brown agrees that the references to the Jerusalem temple's destruction are seen as evidence of a post-70 date.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler. (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}} These scholars have suggested dates for Luke from 75 to 100.

Support for a later date comes from a number of reasons. Differences of chronology, "style", and theology suggest that the author of Luke-Acts was not familiar with [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's distinctive theology]] but instead was writing a decade or more after his death, by which point significant harmonization between different traditions within [[Early Christianity]] had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Luke-Acts has views on [[christology|Jesus' divine nature]], [[eschatology|the end times]], and [[soteriology|salvation]] that are similar to those found in [[Pastoral epistles]], which are often seen as [[pseudonym]]ous and of a later date than [[Authorship of the Pauline Epistles|the undisputed]] [[Pauline Epistles]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most conservative scholars however, argue that both [[internal evidence|internal]] and [[external evidence|external]] evidence strongly points to dates prior to 70 AD for the [[Synoptic Gospels]], [[Book of Acts|Acts]], and the [[Pauline Epistles]].  They note that there is no mention of the deaths of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[James the Just|James]], all of which happened between 60–65 AD, in any book of the New Testament.  These were all extremely important figures in the [[Early Christianity|early church]], writers would have mentioned their deaths if the New Testament had been written later.&lt;ref name ="Robinson" /&gt;  Furthermore, the Gospels contain numerous attacks on the [[Sadducees]], a sect of Judaism that was wiped out with the destruction of the temple.  Why, they ask, would later writers devote so much narrative space to attacking a group that no longer existed?&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite web

[[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John Robinson]] also notes that each book of the New Testament had to be written prior to the destruction of The Temple.  Robinson notes that most scholars interpret the [[Olivet Discourse]] as a post 70 AD account of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|destruction of The Temple]], couched in language to make it appear to be a prophecy, culminating in the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus to end the world.  Robinson notes that the Second Coming did not occur after the destruction of The Temple, leading him to ask, why would a writer in the 80s or 90s forge a prophecy of an event that is proven not to have occurred 20 years earlier?&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book| first = John Arthur Thomas | last = Robinson|title= Redating the New Testament|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CSMFAAAACAAJ|date= 1 October 2000| origyear = 1976 | publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock |isbn=978-1-57910-527-3 | author-mask = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{main article|Language of the New Testament}}
The major languages spoken by both Jews and Greeks in the [[Holy Land]] at the [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|time of Jesus]] were [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]], and also a colloquial dialect of [[Mishnaic Hebrew]]. It is generally agreed by most scholars that the [[historical Jesus]] primarily spoke [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary|title=Aramaic|quote=It is generally agreed that Aramaic was the common language of Israel in the 1st century AD. Jesus and his disciples spoke the Galilean dialect, which was distinguished from that of Jerusalem (Matt. 26:73).|page=72|isbn=0-8028-2402-1|editor=Myers, Allen C. |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=William B. Eerdmans|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps also some [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek]]. The majority view is that all of the books that would eventually form the New Testament were written in the Koine Greek language.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce M.; Ehrman, Bart D. (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aland, K.; Aland, B. (1995). ''The Text of the New Testament''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|9780802840981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early centers of Christianity|As Christianity spread]], these books were later translated into other languages, most notably, [[Latin]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Coptic language|Egyptian Coptic]]. However, some of the [[Church Fathers]]&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Helmut (1982). ''Introduction to the New Testament, Volume 2''. Philadelphia. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; imply or claim that Matthew was originally written in [[Hebrew Gospel of Matthew|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic Matthew|Aramaic]], and then soon after was written in Koine Greek. Nevertheless, the Gospel of Matthew known today was composed in Greek and is neither directly dependent upon nor a translation of a text in a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. D.; Allison, Dale C. (1988). ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on The Gospel according to Saint Matthew, Vol. 1''. Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark. pp. 33–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the New Testament canon==
{{Main article|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The process of canonization of the New Testament was complex and lengthy. In the initial centuries of [[early Christianity]], there were many books widely considered by the church to be inspired, but there was no single formally recognized New Testament canon.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. "Chapter 25". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''Church History, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt; The process was characterized by a compilation of books that [[Sacred tradition|apostolic tradition]] considered authoritative in worship and teaching, relevant to the historical situations in which they lived, and consonant with the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Harry Y. (1985). ''The New Testament Canon: Its Making and Meaning''. Guides to Biblical Scholarship. Philadelphia: Fortress.&lt;/ref&gt; Writings attributed to the apostles circulated among the [[Early centers of Christianity|earliest Christian communities]] and the Pauline epistles were circulating, perhaps in collected forms, by the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Three forms are postulated, from ''The Canon Debate'', chapter 18, page 300, note 21, attributed to Harry Y. Gamble: "(1) Marcion's collection that begins with Galatians and ends with Philemon; (2) Papyrus 46, dated about 200, that follows the order that became established except for reversing Ephesians and Galatians; and (3) the letters to seven churches, treating those to the same church as one letter and basing the order on length, so that Corinthians is first and Colossians (perhaps including Philemon) is last."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest attempts at solidifying a canon was made by [[Marcion]], ''circa'' 140 AD, who accepted only a modified version of Luke (the [[Gospel of Marcion]]) and ten of Paul's letters, while rejecting the Old Testament entirely. His canon was increasingly rejected by other groups of Christians, notably the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox Christians]], as was his theology, [[Marcionism]]. [[Adolf Harnack]] in ''Origin of the New Testament'' (1914) observed that the church gradually formulated its New Testament canon in response to the challenge posed by Marcion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harnack |first=Adolf |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html |title=Origin of the New Testament |chapter=Appendix VI |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and [[Tertullian]] held the letters of Paul to be on par with the Hebrew Scriptures as being divinely inspired, yet others rejected him. Other books were held in high esteem but were gradually relegated to the status of [[New Testament apocrypha]]. Justin Martyr, in the mid [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], mentions "memoirs of the apostles" as being read on Sunday alongside the [[Nevi'im|"writings of the prophets"]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Justin Martyr. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm ''First Apology'']. Chapter 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Muratorian fragment]], dated at between 170 and as late as the end of the 4th century (according to the [[Anchor Bible Series#Anchor Bible Dictionary|Anchor Bible Dictionary]]), may be the earliest known New Testament canon attributed to mainstream Christianity. It is similar, but not identical, to the modern New Testament canon.

The oldest clear endorsement of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John being the only legitimate gospels was written ''circa'' 180 AD. A four gospel canon (the ''Tetramorph'') was asserted by Irenaeus, who refers to it directly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Everett |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxW-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT345 |chapter=Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon |editor-last1=McDonald |editor-first1=L.

[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xii.html "Chapter XI"]. ''Against Heresies, Book III''. Section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; in his [[polemic]] ''Against the Heresies'', "It is not possible that the gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the church is scattered throughout all the world, and the "pillar and ground" of the church is the gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh."&lt;ref name=AHIII8/&gt; The books considered to be authoritative by Irenaeus included the four gospels and many of the letters of Paul, although, based on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the fourfold Gospel must have still been a novelty in Irenaeus's time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=McDonald |editor-first1=L. M |editor-last2=Sanders |editor-first2=J. A. |year=2002 |title=The Canon Debate |publisher=Hendrickson |page=277 |ref={{harvid|McDonald|Sanders|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origen (3rd century)===
By the early 200s, [[Origen]] may have been using the same twenty-seven books as in the Catholic New Testament canon, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of the Letter to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, II Peter, II John and III John and the Book of Revelation,&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Mark A. (1997). ''Turning Points''. Baker Academic. pp 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Antilegomena]]. Likewise, the [[Muratorian fragment]] is evidence that, perhaps as early as 200, there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to the twenty-seven book NT canon, which included four gospels and argued against objections to them.&lt;ref&gt;de Jonge, H. J. (2003). "The New Testament Canon". In de Jonge, H. J.; Auwers, J. M (eds.). ''The Biblical Canons''. Leuven University Press. p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while there was a good measure of debate in the [[Early Church]] over the New Testament canon, the major writings are claimed to have been accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of the Bible, Vol. 1 |author=Ackroyd, P. R.; Evans, C. F. (eds.) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1970 |page=308 |ref={{harvid|Ackroyd|Evans|1970}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information regarding the texts that became the New Testament. The information used to create the late-4th-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the ''Ecclesiastical History'' [HE] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen's list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were then accepted and what were then [[Antilegomena|disputed]], by the [[Early centers of Christianity|third-century churches throughout the known world]], a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, C. G. (2010). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1653073 "Origen’s Role in the Formation of the New Testament Canon"]. Social Science Research Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Origen would have possibly included in his list of "inspired writings" other texts kept out by the likes of Eusebius—including the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Shepherd of Hermas]], and [[1 Clement]]. Notwithstanding these facts, "Origen is not the originator of the idea of biblical canon, but he certainly gives the philosophical and literary-interpretative underpinnings for the whole notion."&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, John A. (2003). "Origen as Literary Critic in the Alexandrian Tradition". In Perrone, L. (ed.). ''Origeniana Octava: Origen and the Alexandrian Tradition, Vol. 1''. Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium 164. Leuven: Leuven University Press. pp. 121–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History===
[[Eusebius]], ''circa'' 300, gave a detailed list of New Testament writings in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-08.htm#P1497_696002 Book 3], Chapter XXV:
: "1... First then must be put the holy quaternion of the gospels; following them the Acts of the Apostles... the epistles of Paul... the epistle of John... the epistle of Peter... After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Book of Revelation, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. These then belong among the accepted writings."

: "3 Among the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James and that of Jude, also the second epistle of Peter, and those that are called the second and third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name. Among the rejected [Kirsopp Lake translation: "not genuine"] writings must be reckoned also the [[Acts of Paul]], and the so-called [[Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd]], and the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and in addition to these the extant [[epistle of Barnabas]], and the so-called [[Didache|Teachings of the Apostles]]; and besides, as I said, the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]], if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject, but which others class with the accepted books. And among these some have placed also the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]]... And all these may be reckoned among the disputed books."

: "6... such books as the [[Gospel of Peter|Gospels of Peter]], of [[Gospel of Thomas|Thomas]], of [[Gospel of Matthias|Matthias]], or of any others besides them, and the [[Acts of Andrew]] and [[Acts of John|John]] and the other apostles... they clearly show themselves to be the fictions of heretics. Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings, but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious."

The Book of Revelation is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp Lake translation: "Recognized") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. From other writings of the church fathers, it was disputed with several canon lists rejecting its canonicity. EH 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: "Paul's fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul." EH 4.29.6 mentions the [[Diatessaron]]: "But their original founder, Tatian, formed a certain combination and collection of the gospels, I know not how, to which he gave the title Diatessaron, and which is still in the hands of some. But they say that he ventured to paraphrase certain words of the apostle Paul, in order to improve their style."

===4th century and later===
In his Easter letter of 367, [[Athanasius]], Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon,&lt;ref name="LindbergCarter"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Christianity |first=Carter |last=Lindberg |page=15|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=1-4051-1078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the word "canonized" (''kanonizomena'') in regards to them.&lt;ref&gt;Brakke, David (Oct 1994). "Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandria's Thirty Ninth Festal Letter". ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''87''' (4): 395–419.&lt;/ref&gt; The first council that accepted the present canon of the New Testament may have been the [[Synod of Hippo|Synod of Hippo Regius]] in North Africa (393 AD); the acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] and the [[Council of Carthage (419)]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldD2&gt;{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|loc=Appendix D-2, note 19}} "Revelation was added later in 419 at the subsequent synod of Carthage."&lt;/ref&gt; These councils were under the authority of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], who regarded the canon as already closed.&lt;ref name=Ferguson320&gt;{{harvp|Ferguson|2002|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F. F. |year=1988 |title=The Canon of Scripture |publisher=Intervarsity Press |page=230 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine. ''De Civitate Dei''. 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Damasus I]]'s [[Council of Rome]] in 382, if the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above,&lt;ref name="LindbergCarter" /&gt; or, if not, the list is at least a 6th-century compilation.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1988 234"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Damasus' commissioning of the Latin [[Vulgate]] edition of the Bible, c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1988 225"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''c.'' 405, [[Pope Innocent I]] sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, [[Exuperius|Exsuperius of Toulouse]]. Christian scholars assert that, when these [[bishops]] and councils spoke on the matter, however, they were not defining something new but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church."&lt;ref name=Ferguson320/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger 1987 237–238"&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Metzger |title=The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origins, Development, and Significance |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |year=1987 |pages=237–238 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament canon as it is now was first listed by [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria]], in 367, in a letter written to his churches in Egypt, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-93.htm Festal Letter 39]. Also cited is the [[Council of Rome]], but not without controversy. That canon gained wider and wider recognition until it was accepted at the [[Third Council of Carthage]] in 397 and 419.{{refn|group=note|The [[Book of Revelation]] wasn't added till the [[Council of Carthage (419)]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldD2/&gt;}}

Even this council did not settle the matter, however. Certain books, referred to as [[Antilegomena]], continued to be questioned, especially [[Epistle of James|James]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. Even as late as the 16th century, the Reformer [[Martin Luther]] questioned (but in the end did not reject) the [[Epistle of James]], the [[Epistle of Jude]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. To this day, German-language [[Luther Bible]]s are printed with these four books at the end of the canon, rather than in their traditional order as in other editions of the Bible.

In light of this questioning of the canon of Scripture by Protestants in the 16th century, the (Roman Catholic) [[Council of Trent]] reaffirmed the traditional western canon (i.e., the canon accepted at the 4th-century [[Council of Rome]] and [[Council of Carthage]]), thus making the [[Canon of Trent]] and the [[Vulgate]] Bible [[Roman Catholic Dogma|dogma]] in the Catholic Church. Later, [[Pope Pius XI]] on 2 June 1927 decreed the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute and [[Pope Pius XII]] on 3 September 1943 issued the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', which allowed translations based on other versions than just the Latin [[Vulgate]], notably in English the [[New American Bible]].

Thus, some claim that, from the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th century]], there existed unanimity in the [[Western Church|West]] concerning the New Testament canon (as it is today),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], the [[Eastern Church]], with a few exceptions, had come to accept the [[Book of Revelation]] and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.&lt;ref name="P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans, eds. 1970 305"&gt;{{harvp|Ackroyd|Evans|1970|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, full dogmatic articulations of the canon were not made until the [[Canon of Trent]] of 1546 for [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]].

On the question of NT Canon formation generally, New Testament scholar Lee Martin McDonald has written that:&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lee M. (1995). ''The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon''. Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Although a number of Christians have thought that [[church council]]s determined what books were to be included in the biblical canons, a more accurate reflection of the matter is that the councils recognized or acknowledged those books that had already obtained prominence from usage among the various early Christian communities.}}

Christian scholars assert that when these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, they were not defining something new, but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church".&lt;ref name="Metzger 1987 237–238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce" /&gt;

Some synods of the 4th century published lists of canonical books (e.g. [[Synod of Hippo|Hippo]] and [[Council of Carthage|Carthage]]). The existing 27-book canon of the New Testament was reconfirmed (for [[Roman Catholicism]]) in the 16th century with the [[Council of Trent]] (also called the Tridentine Council) of 1546,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Metzger|1987|p=246}} "Finally on 8 April 1546, by a vote of 24 to 15, with 16 abstensions, the Council issued a decree (''De Canonicis Scripturis'') in which, for the first time in the history of the church, the question of the contents of the Bible was made an absolute article of faith and confirmed by an anathema."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Although these councils did include statements about the canon, when it came to the New Testament they were only reaffirming the existing canon, including the [[Antilegomena]].

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on the Canon of the New Testament: "The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Council]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=George |year=1908 |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm |chapter=Canon of the New Testament |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 331, [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I]] commissioned Eusebius to deliver [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|fifty Bibles]] for the [[Church of Constantinople]]. [[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]] may be examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|pp=414–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence among the [[First Council of Nicaea#The biblical canon|canons of the First Council of Nicaea of any determination on the canon]].

{{Main article|New Testament manuscripts}}

Like other literature from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], the text of the New Testament was (prior to the advent of the [[printing press]]) preserved and transmitted in [[manuscripts]]. Manuscripts containing at least a part of the New Testament number in the thousands. The earliest of these (like manuscripts containing other literature) are often very fragmentarily preserved. Some of these fragments have even been thought to date as early as the 2nd century (i.e., [[Papyrus 90]], [[Papyrus 98]], [[Papyrus 104]], and famously [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], though the early date of the latter has recently been called into question).&lt;ref&gt;For the initial dating of P52, see Roberts, C. H. (ed.) (1935). ''An Unpublished Fragment of the Fourth Gospel in the John Rylands Library''. Manchester: Manchester University Press; and Bell, H. Idris; Skeat, T. C. (1935). ''Fragments of an Unknown Gospel and Other Early Christian Papyri''. London: Trustees of the British Museum. Though see now Nongbri, Brent (2005). "The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel". ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''98''': 23–52; and Martinez, David G. (2009). "The Papyri and Early Christianity". In Bagnall, Roger S. (ed.). ''The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 590–623.&lt;/ref&gt;

For each subsequent century, more and more manuscripts survive that contain a portion or all of the books that were held to be part of the New Testament at that time (for example, the New Testament of the 4th-century [[Codex Sinaiticus]], once a complete Bible, contains the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]]), though occasionally these manuscripts contain other works as well (e.g., [[Papyrus 72]] and the Crosby-Schøyen Codex). The date when a manuscript was written, however, does not necessarily reflect the date of the form of text it contains. That is, later manuscripts can, and occasionally do, contain older forms of text or older readings.

Some of the more important manuscripts containing an early text of books of the New Testament are:

*The [[Chester Beatty Papyri]] (Greek; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd century)
*The [[Bodmer Papyri]] (Greek and Coptic; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd and 4th centuries)
*[[Codex Bobiensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century, but containing at least a 3rd-century form of text)
*[[Uncial 0171|Uncial '''0171''']] (Greek; copied in the late-third or early 4th century)
*[[Syriac Sinaiticus]] (Syriac; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Manuscript]] 2560 (Coptic; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Vaticanus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Sinaiticus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Vercellensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Curetonian Gospels]] (Syriac; copied in the 5th century)
*[[Garima Gospels]] ( [[Ge'ez language]], produced in the 5th through 6th century)

==Textual variation==
{{Main article|Textual variants in the New Testament|Textual criticism of the New Testament}}
[[Textual criticism]] deals with the identification and removal of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] errors in the [[Writing|texts]] of [[manuscripts]]. Ancient [[scribes]] made errors or alterations (such as including non-authentic [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|additions]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ehrman|2005|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament has been preserved in more than 5,800 [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Ethiopic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Even if the [[Greek New Testament|original Greek]] versions were lost, the entire New Testament could still be assembled from the translations.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"&gt;Strobel, Lee (1998). ''The Case for Christ''. Chapter Three, when quoting biblical scholar [[Bruce Metzger]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are so many quotes from the New Testament in early church documents and commentaries that the entire New Testament could also be assembled from these alone.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt; Not all biblical manuscripts come from orthodox Christian writers. For example, the [[Gnostic]] writings of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] come from the 2nd century AD, and these Christians were regarded as heretics by the mainstream church.&lt;ref name="Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F.F. |year=1981 |title=The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? |publisher=InterVarsity Press |page=14 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, but it also gives scholars a better idea of how close modern Bibles are to the original versions.&lt;ref name="Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14"/&gt;

On noting the large number of surviving ancient manuscripts, [[Bruce Metzger]] sums up the view on the issue by saying "The more often you have copies that agree with each other, especially if they emerge from different geographical areas, the more you can cross-check them to figure out what the original document was like. The only way they'd agree would be where they went back genealogically in a family tree that represents the descent of the manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt;

===Interpolations===
In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as additions of material, centuries after the gospel was written. These are called [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]], "These scribal additions are often found in late medieval manuscripts of the New Testament, but not in the manuscripts of the earlier centuries."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |authorlink=Bart D. Ehrman |year=2005 |title=Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why |titlelink=Misquoting Jesus |publisher=HarperCollins |page=265 |isbn=978-0-06-073817-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate passages that have disputed source documents. Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail. While many variations have been discovered between early copies of biblical texts, almost all have no importance, as they are variations in spelling, punctuation, or grammar. Also, many of these variants are so particular to the Greek language that they would not appear in translations into other languages. For example, order of words (i.e. "man bites dog" versus "dog bites man") often does not matter in Greek, so textual variants that flip the order of words often have no consequences.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt;

Outside of these unimportant variants, there are a couple variants of some importance. The two most commonly cited examples are the [[Mark 16|last verses]] of the ''Gospel of Mark''&lt;ref&gt;Nave, Guy D. ''The Role and Function of Repentance in Luke-Acts''. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John Shelby (26 September 1979).

[[File:RossanoGospelsChristBeforePilate.jpg|thumb|The [[Rossano Gospels]], 6th century, a representative of [[Byzantine]] text.]]

The often referred to Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, a book written to prove the validity of the New Testament, says: " A study of 150 Greek [manuscripts] of the Gospel of Luke has revealed more than 30,000 different readings... It is safe to say that there is not one sentence in the New Testament in which the [manuscript] is wholly uniform."&lt;ref&gt;Parvis, M. M. Vol. 4. pp. 594–595.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the variation took place within the first three Christian centuries.

===Text-types===
By the 4th century, textual "families" or types of text become discernible among [[biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]]. A "text-type" is the name given to a family of texts with similar readings due to common ancestors and mutual correction. Many early manuscripts, however, contain individual readings from several different earlier forms of text. Modern texual critics have identified the following text-types among textual witnesses to the New Testament: The [[Alexandrian text-type]] is usually considered to generally preserve many early readings. It is represented, e.g., by [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and the [[Bodmer Papyri]].

The [[Western text-type]] is generally longer and can be paraphrastic, but can also preserve early readings. The [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of the Acts of the Apostles]] is, notably, 8.5% longer than the Alexandrian form of the text. Examples of the Western text are found in [[Codex Bezae]], [[Codex Claromontanus]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]], the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] (i.e., Latin translations made prior to the [[Vulgate]]), as well as in quotations by [[Marcion]], [[Tatian]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Cyprian]].

A text-type referred to as the "[[Caesarean text-type]]" and thought to have included witnesses such as [[Codex Koridethi]] and minuscule 565, can today be described neither as "Caesarean" nor as a text-type as was previously thought. However, the Gospel of Mark in [[Papyrus 45]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]] and in [[Family 13]] does indeed reflect a distinct type of text.

Increasing standardization of distinct (and once local) text-types eventually gave rise to the [[Byzantine text-type]]. Since most manuscripts of the New Testament do not derive from the first several centuries, that is, they were copied after the rise of the Byzantine text-type, this form of text is found the majority of extant manuscripts and is therefore often called the "Majority Text." As with all of the other (earlier) text-types, the Byzantine can also occasionally preserve early readings.

===Biblical criticism===
{{Main article|Biblical criticism}}
[[Biblical criticism]] is the scholarly "study and investigation of [[Biblical manuscript|biblical writings]] that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings." Viewing biblical texts as having human rather than supernatural origins, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey.

It will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the [[Old Testament]], the letters of the New Testament, or the [[Canonical Gospels]]. It also plays an important role in the quest for the [[historical Jesus]]. It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history, and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[folklore]], [[linguistics]], [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition studies]], history, and [[religious studies]].

===Establishing a critical text===
{{Main article|New Testament manuscripts}}
The [[#Textual variation|textual variation]] among manuscript copies of books in the New Testament prompted attempts to discern the earliest form of text already in antiquity (e.g., by the 3rd-century Christian author [[Origen]]). The efforts began in earnest again during the [[Renaissance]], which saw a revival of the study of ancient Greek texts. During this period, modern [[textual criticism]] was born. In this context, [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] such as [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Erasmus]] promoted a return to the original Greek of the New Testament. This was the beginning of modern [[New Testament textual criticism]], which over subsequent centuries would increasingly incorporate more and more manuscripts, in more languages (i.e., versions of the New Testament), as well as citations of the New Testament by ancient authors and the New Testament text in [[lectionary|lectionaries]] in order to reconstruct the earliest recoverable form of the New Testament text and the history of changes to it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger|Metzger, Bruce M.]]; [[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]] (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to earlier and contemporaneous literature==
{{Further information|Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible}}
Books that later formed the New Testament, like other Christian literature of the period, originated in a literary context that reveals relationships not only to other Christian writings, but also to [[Classics|Graeco-Roman]] and [[Judaism#Antiquity|Jewish]] works. Of singular importance is the extensive use of and interaction with the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] and what would become the [[Old Testament|Christian Old Testament]]. Both implicit and explicit citations, as well as countless allusions, appear throughout the books of the New Testament, from the Gospels and Acts, to the Epistles, to the Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Stendahl, Krister (1954). ''The School of St. Matthew and Its Use of the Old Testament''. Uppsala and Lund; Marcus, Joel (1993). ''The Way of the Lord: Christological Exegesis of the Old Testament in the Gospel of Mark''. Edinburgh; Smith, D. Moody (1972). "The Use of the Old Testament in the New". In ''The Use of the Old Testament in the New and Other Essays: Studies in Honor of William Franklin Stinespring''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press. pp. 3–65; [[Donald Juel|Juel, Donald]] (1988). ''Messianic Exegesis: Christological Interpretation of the Old Testament in Early Christianity''. Philadelphia: Fortress; and Barr, James (1966). ''Old and New in Interpretation: A Study of the Two Testaments''. London: SCM.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early versions==
The first translations (usually called "versions") of the New Testament were made beginning already at the end of 2nd century. The earliest versions of the New Testament are the translations into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Võõbus|Võõbus, Arthur]] (1954). ''Early Versions of the New Testament''. Stockholm. pp. 1–128, 211–240.&lt;/ref&gt; These three versions were made directly from the Greek, and are frequently cited in the apparatuses of modern critical editions.

===Syriac===
{{Main article|Syriac versions of the Bible}}
[[File:RabulaGospelsFolio04vCanonTable.jpg|thumb|The [[Rabbula Gospels]], [[Eusebian Canons]].]]
Syriac was spoken in [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], and with dialect in [[Syria Palaestina|Roman]] and [[Palaestina Secunda|Byzantine Palestine]] where it was known as [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]]. Several Syriac translations were made and have come to us. Most of the Old Syriac, however, as well as the Philoxonian version have been lost.

[[Tatian]], the Assyrian, created the [[Diatessaron]], a [[gospel harmony]] written in Syriac around 170 AD and the earliest form of the gospel not only in Syriac but probably also in Armenian.

In the 19th century, manuscript evidence was discovered for an "Old Syriac" version of the four distinct (i.e., not harmonized) gospels. These "separated" (Syriac: ''da-Mepharreshe'') gospels, though old, have been shown to be later than the Diatessaron. The Old Syriac gospels are fragmentarily preserved in two manuscripts: the 5th-century [[Curetonian Gospels|Curetonian Syriac]] and the [[Syriac Sinaiticus|Sinaitic Syriac]] from the 4th or 5th century.

No Old Syriac manuscripts of other portions of the New Testament survive, though Old Syriac readings, e.g. from the [[Pauline Epistles]], can be discerned in citations made by Eastern fathers and in later Syriac versions. The Old Syriac version is a representative of the [[Western text-type]]. The [[Peshitta]] version was prepared in the beginning of the 5th century. It contains only 22 books (neither the [[General epistles|Minor Catholic Epistles]] of 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude, nor the [[Book of Revelation]] were part of this translation).

The [[Philoxenian]] probably was produced in 508 for [[Philoxenus, Bishop of Mabung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |year=1977 |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=3–98 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
{{Main article|Vetus Latina|Vulgate}}
The Gospels were likely translated into Latin as early as the last quarter of the 2nd century in North Africa (''Afra''). Not much later, there were also European Latin translations (''Itala''). There are about 80 Old Latin mansucripts. The [[Vetus Latina]] ("Old Latin") versions often contain readings with a Western type of text. (For the avoidance of confusion, these texts were written in [[Late Latin]], not the early version of the Latin language known as [[Old Latin]], pre 75 BC.)

The bewildering diversity of the Old Latin versions prompted [[Jerome]] to prepare another translation into Latin&amp;nbsp;— the [[Vulgate]]. In many respects it was merely a revision of the Old Latin. There are currently around 8,000 manuscripts of the Vulgate.

===Coptic===
{{Main article|Coptic versions of the Bible}}
There are several dialects of the Coptic language: [[Bohairic]] (northern dialect), [[Fayyumic]], [[Sahidic]] (southern dialect), [[Akhmimic]], and others. The first translation was made by at least the 3rd century into the Sahidic dialect (cop&lt;sup&gt;sa&lt;/sup&gt;). This translation represents a mixed text, mostly [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]], though also with [[Western text-type|Western]] readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vööbus |first=Arthur |year=1954 |title=Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Stockholm |pages=216–229 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bohairic translation was made later, but existed already in the 4th century. Though the translation makes less use of Greek words than the Sahidic, it does employ some Greek grammar (e.g., in word-order and the use of particles such as the syntactic construction μεν&amp;nbsp;— δε). For this reason, the Bohairic translation can be helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vööbus|1954|pp=229–237}}; {{harvp|Metzger|1977|pp=99–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ancient translations===
[[File:Matthew's Gospel - British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|BL Add. MS 59874 with [[Ethiopic]] [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]
The continued spread of Christianity, and the foundation of national churches, led to the translation of the Bible—often beginning with books from the New Testament—into a variety of other languages at a relatively early date: [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Ethiopic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Soghdian]], and eventually [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Church Slavonic language|Old Church Slavonic]], [[Arabic]], and [[Nubian languages|Nubian]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Gothic, see {{harvp|Vööbus|1954|loc=pp. 133–210, 243–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern translations==
{{Main article|Bible translations}}
[[Modern Literal Version]] is the most recent literal translation of the books of the new testament, with the largest number of translation experts being involved in the final translation.

Historically, throughout the [[Christendom|Christian world]] and in the context of [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary activity]], the New Testament (or portions thereof) has been that part of the Christian Bible first translated into the [[vernacular]]. The production of such translations grew out of the insertion of [[vernacular]] [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] in biblical texts, as well as out of the production of [[biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]).

The 16th century saw the rise of [[Protestantism]] and an explosion of translations of the New (and Old) Testament into the [[vernacular]]. Notable are those of [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther]] (1522), [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] (1523), the [[Zürich Bible|Froschau Bible]] (1525–1529, revised in 1574), [[Tyndale Bible|William Tyndale]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536), the [[Brest Bible]] (1563), and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] (also called the "King James Version") (1611).

Most of these translations relied (though not always exclusively) upon one of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament edited by [[Erasmus]], a form of this Greek text emerged as the standard and is known as the [[Textus Receptus]]. This text, based on the majority of manuscripts is also used in the majority of translations that were made in the years 100 to 400 AD.

Translations of the New Testament made since the appearance of critical editions of the Greek text (notably those of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], and [[Von Soden catalogue|von Soden]]) have largely used them as their [[Source text|base text]]. Unlike the [[Textus Receptus]], these have a pronounced Alexandrian character. Standard critical editions are those of [[Alexander Souter|Souter]], Vogels, Bover, Merk, and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestlé-Aland]] (the text, though not the full critical apparatus of which is reproduced in the [[United Bible Societies]]' "Greek New Testament").

Notable translations of the New Testament based on these most recent critical editions include the [[Revised Standard Version]] (1946, revised in 1971), [[:fr:La Bible de Jérusalem|La Bible de Jérusalem]] (1961, revised in 1973 and 2000), the [[Einheitsübersetzung]] (1970, final edition 1979), the [[New American Bible]] (1970, revised in 1986), the [[Traduction Oecuménique de la Bible]] (1988, revised in 2004), and the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989).

==Theological interpretation in Christian churches==
{{Main article|Biblical authority}}
Though all Christian churches accept the New Testament as scripture, they differ in their understanding of the nature, extent, and relevance of its authority. Views of the authoritativeness of the New Testament often depend on the concept of ''[[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]]'', which relates to the role of God in the formation of the New Testament. Generally, the greater the role of God in one's doctrine of inspiration, the more one accepts the [[doctrine]] of [[biblical inerrancy]] or authoritativeness of the Bible. One possible source of confusion is that these terms are difficult to define, because many people use them interchangeably or with very different meanings. This article will use the terms in the following manner:
*''Infallibility'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in matters of doctrine.
*''Inerrancy'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in factual assertions (including historical and scientific assertions).
*''Authoritativeness'' relates to the correctness of the Bible in questions of practice in morality.

{{Quotation|The self-witness of the Bible to its inspiration demands a commitment to its unity. The ultimate basis for unity is contained in the claim of divine inspiration in {{Bibleref2|2tim|3:16||2&amp;nbsp;Timothy 3:16}} that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (KJV). The term "inspiration" renders the Greek word ''theopneustos''. This term only occurs here in the New Testament and literally means "God-breathed" (the chosen translation of the NIV).&lt;ref name=Elwell&gt;Meadors, Gary T. (1997). [http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/scripture-unity-and-diversity-of.html "Scripture, Unity and Diversity of"]. In Elwell, Walter A. (ed.). ''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.'' Grand Rapids: Baker Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

All of these concepts depend for their meaning on the supposition that the text of Bible has been properly interpreted, with consideration for the intention of the text, whether [[literal and figurative language|literal]] history, [[allegory]] or poetry, etc. Especially the doctrine of inerrancy is variously understood according to the weight given by the interpreter to scientific investigations of the world.

===Unity in diversity===
The notion of unity in diversity of Scripture claims that the Bible presents a noncontradictory and consistent message concerning God and redemptive history. The fact of diversity is observed in comparing the diversity of time, culture, authors' perspectives, literary genre, and the theological themes.&lt;ref name=Elwell/&gt;

Studies from many theologians considering the "unity in diversity" to be found in the New Testament (and the Bible as a whole) have been collected and summarized by New Testament theologian [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]]. He describes them as some basic presuppositions, tenets, and concerns common among the New Testament writers, giving to the New Testament its "unity in diversity":
#The reality of God is never argued but is always assumed and affirmed
#Jesus Christ is absolutely central: he is Lord and Savior, the foretold Prophet, the Messianic King, the Chosen, the way, the truth, and the light, the One through whom God the Father not only acted but through whom He came
#The Holy Spirit came anew with Jesus Christ.
#The Christian faith and life are a calling, rooted in divine election.
#The plight of everyone as sinner means that each person is completely dependent upon the mercy and grace of God
#Salvation is both God's gift and his demand through Jesus Christ, to be received by faith
#The death and resurrection of Jesus are at the heart of the total event of which he was the center
#God creates a people of his own, designated and described by varied terminology and analogies
#History must be understood eschatologically, being brought along toward its ultimate goal when the kingdom of God, already present in Christ, is brought to its complete triumph
#In Christ, all of God's work of creation, revelation, and redemption is brought to fulfillment&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank (1962). ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Classical Anglicanism===
For the [[Roman Catholic Church]], there are two modes of Revelation: Scripture and [[Apostolic Tradition|Tradition]]. Both of them are interpreted by the teachings of the Church. The Roman Catholic view is expressed clearly in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (1997):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
§ 82: As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.
&lt;br /&gt;
§ 107: The inspired books teach the truth. Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Catholic terminology the teaching office is called the [[Magisterium]].  The Catholic view should not be confused with the two-source theory.  As the Catechism states in §§ 80 and 81, Revelation has "one common source ... two distinct modes of transmission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a2.htm "The Transmission of Divine Revelation"]. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. 2nd ed. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] writers distinguish between Scripture and Tradition, Bishop Kallistos Ware says that for the Orthodox there is only one source of the Christian faith, Holy Tradition, within which Scripture exists.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Kallistos (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2Z8bVDVMLEC&amp;pg=PT243 "Holy Tradition: The Source of the Orthodox Faith"].''The Orthodox Church''. Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] believe that "Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation", (Article VI), but also that the Catholic Creeds "ought thoroughly to be received and believed" (Article VIII), and that the Church "hath authority in Controversies of Faith" and is "a witness and keeper of Holy Writ" (Article XX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=Articles of Religion |publisher=Anglicans Online |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Anglicanism, therefore, like Orthodoxy, holds that Holy Tradition is the only safe guardian against perversion and innovation in the interpretation of Scripture.

In the famous words of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells: "As for my religion, I dye in the holy catholic and apostolic faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West, more particularly in the communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from all Papal and Puritan innovations, and as it adheres to the doctrine of the Cross."

===Protestantism===
Following the doctrine of [[sola scriptura]], Protestants believe that their traditions of faith, practice and interpretations carry forward what the scriptures teach, and so tradition is not a source of authority in itself. Their traditions derive authority from the Bible, and are therefore always open to reëvaluation. This openness to doctrinal revision has extended in [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal]] Protestant traditions even to the reevaluation of the doctrine of Scripture upon which the Reformation was founded, and members of these traditions may even question whether the Bible is infallible in doctrine, inerrant in historical and other factual statements, and whether it has uniquely divine authority. However, the adjustments made by modern [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to their doctrine of scripture vary widely.

====American evangelical and fundamentalist Protestantism====
Within the US, the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]] (1978) is a statement, articulating evangelical views on this issue. Paragraph four of its summary states: "Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching, no less in what it states about God's acts in creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under God, than in its witness to God's saving grace in individual lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html |title=The Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy |publisher=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American mainline and liberal Protestantism====
[[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]] American [[Protestant]] denominations, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]], and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], do not teach the doctrine of inerrancy as set forth in the Chicago Statement. All of these churches have more ancient doctrinal statements asserting the authority of scripture, but may interpret these statements in such a way as to allow for a very broad range of teaching—from evangelicalism to skepticism. It is not an impediment to ordination in these denominations to teach that the scriptures contain errors, or that the authors follow a more or less unenlightened ethics that, however appropriate it may have seemed in the authors' time, moderns would be very wrong to follow blindly.

For example, [[ordination of women]] is universally accepted in the mainline churches, [[abortion]] is condemned as a grievous social tragedy but not always a personal [[sin]] or a crime against an unborn person, and [[homosexuality]] is sometimes recognized as a genetic propensity or morally neutral preference that should be neither encouraged nor condemned. In North America, the most contentious of these issues among these churches at the present time is how far the ordination of gay men and lesbians should be accepted.

Officials of the Presbyterian Church USA report: "We acknowledge the role of scriptural authority in the Presbyterian Church, but Presbyterians generally do not believe in biblical inerrancy. Presbyterians do not insist that every detail of chronology or sequence or prescientific description in scripture be true in literal form. Our confessions do teach biblical infallibility. Infallibility affirms the entire truthfulness of scripture without depending on every exact detail."&lt;ref&gt;"Homosexual ordination vote widens gap between Presbyterian factions". ''ReligionToday''. 20 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who hold a more liberal view of the Bible as a human witness to the glory of God, the work of fallible humans who wrote from a limited experience unusual only for the insight they have gained through their inspired struggle to know God in the midst of a troubled world. Therefore, they tend not to accept such doctrines as inerrancy. These churches also tend to retain the social activism of their evangelical forebears of the 19th century, placing particular emphasis on those teachings of scripture that teach compassion for the poor and concern for [[social justice]].

The message of personal [[salvation]] is, generally speaking, of the good that comes to oneself and the world through following the New Testament's [[ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] admonition to love others without hypocrisy or prejudice. Toward these ends, the "spirit" of the New Testament, more than the letter, is infallible and authoritative.

There are some movements that believe the Bible contains the teachings of Jesus but who reject the churches that were formed following its publication. These people believe all individuals can communicate directly with God and therefore do not need guidance or doctrines from a church. These people are known as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].

===Messianic Judaism===
[[Messianic Judaism]] generally holds the same view of New Testament authority as evangelical Protestants.&lt;ref name = "Beit Simcha"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; According to the view of some Messianic Jewish congregations, Jesus did not annul the Torah, but that its interpretation is revised and ultimately explained through the Apostolic Scriptures.&lt;ref name="KehilatTNuvahSOF1"&gt;{{cite web

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] accept the New Testament as divinely inspired Scripture, and as infallible in every detail, with equal authority as the Hebrew Scriptures. They view it as the written revelation and good news of the [[Messiah]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|ransom sacrifice of Jesus]], and the [[Kingdom of God]], explaining and expounding the Hebrew Bible, not replacing but vitally supplementing it. They also view the New Testament as the primary instruction guide for Christian living, and [[church discipline]]. They generally call the New Testament the "Christian Greek Scriptures", and see only the "covenants" as "old" or "new", but not any part of the actual Scriptures themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Equipped For Every Good Work". Brooklyn, New York: Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. International Bible Students Association. 1946. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Pentecostals===
[[Oneness Pentecostalism]] subscribes to the common Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''. They view the Bible as the inspired Word of God, and as absolutely [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] in its contents (though not necessarily in every translation).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |last=Raddatz |first=Tom |url=http://www.1lord1faith.org/wm/Oneness/1TrinDebate.htm |title=A Response to the Oneness-Trinity Debate |publisher=1Lord1Faith.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320000616/http://www.1lord1faith.org/wm/Oneness/1TrinDebate.htm |archivedate=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dulle, Jason. [http://www.onenesspentecostal.com/howgetbible.htm "How We Get Our Bible"]. Institute for Biblical Studies. Retrieved 15 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  They regard the New Testament as perfect and inerrant in every way, revealing the Lord Jesus Christ in the Flesh, and his Atonement, and which also explains and illuminates the Old Testament perfectly, and is part of the Bible canon, not because church councils or decrees claimed it so, but by witness of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Dulle, Jason.

===Seventh-Day Adventists===
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] holds the New Testament as the inspired Word of God, with God influencing the "thoughts" of the Apostles in the writing, not necessarily every word though.  The first fundamental belief of the Seventh-Day Adventist church stated that "The Holy Scriptures are the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] revelation of [God's] will." [[Seventh-day Adventist theology|Adventist theologians]] generally reject the "verbal inspiration" position on Scripture held by many conservative [[evangelical Christians]]. They believe instead that God inspired the thoughts of the biblical authors and apostles, and that the writers then expressed these thoughts in their own words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe|author=Ministerial Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists |year=2005 |publisher=Pacific Press Publishing Association |edition=2nd |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is popularly known as "thought inspiration", and most Adventist members hold to that view. According to Ed Christian, former ''[[Journal of the Adventist Theological Society|JATS]]'' editor, "few if any [[Adventist Theological Society|ATS]] members believe in verbal inerrancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLarty |first=John |url=http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2001/11/adventist-theological-society-0 |title=The Adventist Theological Society |work=Adventist Today |date=15 November 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225063148/http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2001/11/adventist-theological-society-0 |archivedate=25 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the teachings of the New Testament compared to the Old, and the application in the New Covenant, Adventists have traditionally taught that the [[Ethical Decalogue|Decalogue]] is part of the moral law of God, which was not abrogated by the ministry and death of [[Jesus Christ]]. Therefore, the fourth commandment concerning the Sabbath is as applicable to Christian believers as the other nine. Adventists have often taught a distinction between "moral law" and "ceremonial law". According to Adventist beliefs, the moral law continues into the "New Testament era", but the ceremonial law was done away with by Jesus.

How the [[Mosaic law]] should be applied came up at Adventist conferences in the past, and Adventist theologians such as [[A. T. Jones]] and [[E. J. Waggoner]] looked at the problem addressed by Paul in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] as not the ceremonial law, but rather the wrong use of the law ([[legalism (theology)|legalism]]). They were opposed by [[Uriah Smith]] and [[George Ide Butler|George Butler]] at the 1888 Conference. Smith in particular thought the Galatians issue had been settled by Ellen White already, yet in 1890 she claimed justification by faith is "the [[Three Angels' Messages|third angel's message]] in verity."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Ellen White interpreted {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:14|NIV}} as saying that the ceremonial law was nailed to the cross.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ellen (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yKqXCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT409 ''Patriarchs and Prophets'']. Start Publishing LLC. p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter-day Saints===
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) believe that the New Testament, as part of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], is accurate "as far as it is translated correctly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith |title=Articles of Faith |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe the Bible as originally revealed is the word of God, but that the processes of transcription and translation have introduced errors into the texts as currently available, and therefore they cannot be regarded as completely inerrant.&lt;ref name="Givens2015"&gt;{{cite book|first=Terry L.|last=Givens|title=The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0fCgAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-977836-2|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LDSInerrancy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/bible-inerrancy-of?lang=eng|title=Bible, Inerrancy of|date=2016|publisher=The Church of the Latter Day Saints|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Old and New Testaments, the [[Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ|Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] are considered part of their scriptural canon.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Macmillan 1992, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PaulsenMusser2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Lamont Paulsen|author2=Donald W.

==In the liturgy==
[[File:Codex Harcleianus.PNG|thumb|right|A Byzantine lectionary, ''[[Lectionary 150|Codex Harleianus]]'' (''l''&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;), 995 AD, text of John 1:18.]] Despite the wide variety among [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]], texts from the New Testament play a role in almost all forms of [[Christian worship]]. In addition to some language derived from the New Testament in the [[liturgy]] itself (e.g., the [[Trisagion]] may be based on Apocalypse 4:8, and the beginning of the "Hymn of Praise" draws upon Luke 2:14), the reading of extended passages from the New Testament is a practice common to almost all [[Christian worship]], liturgical or not.

These [[Lection|readings]] are most often part of an established [[lectionary]] (i.e., [[Lection|selected texts]] to be read at church services on specific days), and (together with an Old Testament reading and a [[Psalms (Christian)|Psalm]]) include a non-gospel reading from the New Testament and culminate with a [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel reading]]. No readings from the [[Book of Revelation]], however, are included in the standard [[lectionary]] of the [[Orthodox church|Eastern Orthodox churches]].

Central to the [[Christian liturgy]] is the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] or "Holy Communion". The [[Words of Institution]] that begin this rite are drawn directly from 1 Corinthians 11:23–26. In addition, the communal recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] (in the form found in the Gospel of Matthew 6:9–13) is also a standard feature of [[Christian worship]].

==In the arts==

The [[Early Christian art|earliest Christian art]] would often depict scenes from the New Testament such as the [[raising of Lazarus]], the [[baptism of Jesus]] or the motif of the [[Good Shepherd]].

[[Biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]) became popular in the [[Middle Ages]], as did the portrayal of the [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest]], [[Trial of Jesus|trial]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|execution]] of Jesus in [[Passion play]]s. Indeed, the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] became a central theme in Christian [[Crucifixion in the arts|art]] and [[Passion (music)|music]]. The [[:Category:Portrayals of Jesus in film|ministry]] and [[Passion (Christianity)#Film|Passion]] of Jesus, as portrayed in one or more of the [[:Category:Films based on the Gospels|New Testament Gospels]], has also been a theme in film, almost since the inception of the medium (e.g., "La Passion", France, 1903).

'''New musicology''' is a wide body of [[musicology]] since the 1980s with a focus upon the cultural study, aesthetics, criticism, and hermeneutics of music. It began in part a reaction against the traditional [[Positivism|positivist]] musicology (focused on primary research) of the early 20th century and [[postwar era]].  Many of the procedures of new musicology are now (2016) considered standard, although the name more often refers to the historical turn rather than to any single set of ideas or principles.  Indeed, although it was notably influenced by [[feminism]], [[gender studies]], [[queer theory]], [[postcolonial studies]], and [[critical theory]], new musicology has primarily been characterized by a wide-ranging eclecticism.

==Definitions and history==
New musicology seeks to question the research methods of traditional musicology by displacing [[positivism]], working in partnership with outside [[discipline]]s, including the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], and by questioning accepted musical knowledge. New musicologists seek ways to employ [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[gender studies]], [[feminism]], [[history]], and [[philosophy]] in the study of music. 

In 1980 [[Joseph Kerman]] published the article "How We Got into Analysis, and How to Get Out," calling for a change in musicology. He asked for "a new breadth and flexibility in academic music criticism [musicology]"  (Kerman, 1994, 30) that would extend to musical discourse, [[critical theory]] and [[analysis]]. In the words of [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]]: "For me...the notion of an intimate relationship between music and society functions not as a distant goal but as a starting point of great immediacy...the goal of which is to articulate something essential about why any particular music is the way it is in particular, that is, to achieve insight into the character of its identity."{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Susan McClary suggests that new musicology defines music as "a medium that participates in social formation by influencing the ways we perceive our feelings, our bodies, our desires, our very subjectivities—even if it does so surreptitiously, without most of us knowing how" (Brett, 1994).  For [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]], music has meanings "definite enough to support critical interpretations comparable in depth, exactness, and density of connection to interpretations of literary texts and cultural practices" (Kramer, 1990).

New musicology combines cultural studies with the analysis and criticism of music, and it accords more weight to the sociology of musicians and institutions and to non-canonical genres of music, including jazz and popular music, than traditional musicology did. (A similar perspective became common for American ethnomusicologists during the 1950s.) This has caused many musicologists to question previously held views of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] and to make assessments based on critical methods "concerned with finding some kind of [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] between [musical] analysis and a consideration of social meaning" (Beard and Gloag, 2005, 38).

New musicologists question the processes of canonization. Gary Tomlinson suggests that meaning be searched out in a "series of interrelated historical narratives that surround the musical subject" (Beard and Gloag, 2005, 123) – a "web of culture" (Tomlinson, 1984). For example, the work of Beethoven has been examined from new perspectives by studying his reception and influence in terms of masculine hegemony, the development of the modern concert, and the politics of his era, among other concerns.  The traditional contrast between Beethoven and Schubert has been revised in the light of these studies, especially with reference to Schubert's possible homosexuality (McClary in Brett, 1994; Kramer 2003; Mathew, 2012).

==Relationship to music sociology==
New musicology is distinct from German [[sociomusicology|music sociology]] in the work of Adorno, [[Max Weber]] and [[Ernst Bloch]]. Although some new musicologists claim some allegiance to [[Theodor Adorno]], their work has little in common with the wider field of Adorno studies, especially in [[Germany]]. New musicologists frequently exhibit strong resistance to German intellectual traditions, especially in regard to nineteenth-century German music theorists including [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] and [[Eduard Hanslick]], and also the twentieth-century figures [[Heinrich Schenker]] and [[Carl Dahlhaus]].

A fundamental distinction has to do with attitudes towards [[modernism]] and [[popular culture]]. Influential, oft-cited essays such as McClary 1989 and McClary 2006 are highly dismissive of modernist music. German music sociologists tend to be more favorable towards modernism (though by no means uncritically) and severely critical of popular music as inextricably tied to the aesthetics of distraction as demanded by the [[culture industry]]. Metzger describes "a fascistic element" in the music of the Rolling Stones. New musicology, on the other hand, often overlaps with [[postmodern]] aesthetics; various new musicologists are highly sympathetic towards musical [[minimalism]] (see McClary 1990 and 2000 and Fink 2005).

==Criticisms of new musicology==
[[Vincent Duckles]] writes, "As musicology has grown more [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]], its practitioners have increasingly adopted methods and theories deemed by observers to mark the academy as irrelevant, out of touch with 'mainstream values', unwelcoming of [[Western canon]]ic traditions or simply incomprehensible. Paradoxically, such approaches have distanced music scholarship from a broad public at the very moment they have encouraged scholars to scrutinize the popular musics that form the backbone of modern mass musical culture."

Critics of new musicology include [[Pieter van den Toorn]] and to a lesser extent [[Charles Rosen]]. In response to an early essay of McClary (McClary 1987), Rosen says that "she sets up, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a straw man to knock down, the dogma that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance. (I doubt that anyone, except perhaps the nineteenth-century critic Hanslick, has ever really believed that, although some musicians have been goaded into proclaiming it by the sillier interpretations of music with which we are often assailed.)" (Rosen 2000).  For David Beard and Kenneth Gloag, however, writing at two later moments (2005, 2016), the methods of new musicology have been fully incorporated into mainstream musicological practice.

A convenient '''notation for theoretic scheduling problems''' was introduced by [[Ronald Graham]], [[Eugene Lawler]], [[Jan Karel Lenstra]] and [[Alexander Rinnooy Kan]] in.&lt;ref name="initial specification" /&gt; It consists of three fields: [[Alpha (letter)|α]], [[Beta (letter)|β]] and [[Gamma|γ]].

Each field may be a comma separated list of words. The α field describes the machine environment, β the job characteristics and constraints, and γ the objective function.

Since its introduction in the late 70's the notation has been constantly extended, sometimes inconsistently.   As a result today there are some problems that appear with distinct notations in several papers.   

== Machine environment ==

=== Single stage problems ===
Each job comes with a given processing time.

; 1
: there is a single machine
; P
: there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; parallel identical machines
; Q
: there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; parallel machines with different given speeds, length of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the processing time &lt;math&gt;p_{j}&lt;/math&gt; divided by speed &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt;.
; R
: there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; parallel unrelated machines, there are given processing times &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;

These letters might be followed by the number of machines which is then fixed, here &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; stands then for a fixed number.  For example &lt;math&gt;P2||C_{\max}&lt;/math&gt; is the problem of assigning each of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; given jobs to one of the 2 given machines so to minimize the maximum total processing time over the machines.

=== Multi-stage problem ===
; O 
: [[Open Shop Scheduling|Open shop problem]]. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; operations &lt;math&gt;O_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,m&lt;/math&gt;.  The operations can be scheduled in any order. Operation &lt;math&gt;O_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; must be processed for &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; units on machine &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
; F : [[Flow Shop Scheduling Problem|Flow shop problem]]. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; operations &lt;math&gt;O_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=1,\ldots,m&lt;/math&gt;, to be scheduled in that order.  Operation &lt;math&gt;O_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; must be processed for &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; units on machine &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
; J : [[Job Shop Scheduling|Job shop problem]]. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; operations &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=1,\ldots,n_j&lt;/math&gt;, to be scheduled in that order.  Operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; must be processed for &lt;math&gt;p_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; units on a dedicated machine &lt;math&gt;\mu_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mu_{kj}\neq \mu_{k'j}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k\neq k'&lt;/math&gt;.

== Job characteristics ==

The processing time may be equal for all jobs (&lt;math&gt;p_i=p&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}=p&lt;/math&gt;) or even of unit length (&lt;math&gt;p_i=1&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt;). All processing times are assumed to be integers. In some older research papers however they are assumed to be rationals.

; &lt;math&gt;r_j&lt;/math&gt;
: for each job a release time is given before which it cannot be scheduled, default is 0.
; &lt;math&gt;online-r_j&lt;/math&gt;
: This is an online problem. Jobs are revealed at their release times.  In this context the performance of an algorithm is measured by its [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitive ratio]].
; &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;
: for each job a due date is given.   The idea is that every job should complete before its due date and there is some penalty for jobs that complete late.  This penalty is denoted in the objective value.  The presence of the job characteristic &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt; is implicitly assumed and not denoted in the problem name, unless there are some restrictions as for example &lt;math&gt;d_j=d&lt;/math&gt;, assuming that all due dates are equal to some given date.
; &lt;math&gt;\bar d_j&lt;/math&gt;
: for each job a strict deadline is given.  Every job must complete before its deadline.
; pmtn
: Jobs can be preempted and resumed possibly on another machine. Sometimes also denoted by 'prmp'.
; &lt;math&gt;size_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Each job comes with a number of machines on which it must be scheduled at the same time, default is 1.

=== Precedence relations ===

Precedence relations might be given for the jobs, in form of a partial order, meaning that if i is a predecessor of i' in that order, i' can start only when i is completed.

; prec
: Given general precedence relation.  If &lt;math&gt;i\prec j&lt;/math&gt; then starting time of &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; should be not earlier than completion time of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
; chains
: Given precedence relation in form of chains (indegrees and outdegrees are at most 1).
; tree
: Given general precedence relation in form of a tree, either intree or outtree.
; intree
: Given general precedence relation in form of an intree (outdegrees are at most 1).
; outtree
: Given general precedence relation in form of an outtree (indegrees are at most 1).
; opposing forest
: Given general precedence relation in form of a collection of intrees and outtrees.
; sp-graph
: Given precedence relation in form of a series parallel graph.
; bounded height
: Given precedence relation where the longest directed path is bounded by a constant.
; level order
: Given precedence relation where each vertex of a given level l (i.e. the length of the longest directed path starting from this vertex is l) is a predecessor of all the vertices of level l-1.
; interval order
: Given precedence relation for which one can associate to each vertex an interval in the real line, and there is a precedence between x and y if and only if the half open intervals x=[s_x,e_x) and y=[s_y,e_y) are such that e_x is smaller than or equal to s_y.
; quasi-interval order
: Quasi-interval orders are a superclass of interval orders defined in Moukrim: Optimal scheduling on parallel machines for a new order class, Operations Research Letters, 24(1):91-95, 1999.
; over-interval order
: Over-interval orders are a superclass of quasi-interval orders defined in Chardon and Moukrim: The Coffman-Graham algorithm optimally solves UET task systems with overinterval orders, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 19(1):109-121, 2005.
; Am-order
: Am orders are a superclass of over-interval orders defined in Moukrim and Quilliot: A relation between multiprocessor scheduling and linear programming. Order, 14(3):269-278, 1997.
; DC-graph
: A divide-and-conquer graph is a subclass of series-parallel graphs defined in Kubiak et al.: Optimality of HLF for scheduling divide-and-conquer UET task graphs on identical parallel processors. Discrete Optimization, 6:79-91, 2009.
; 2-dim partial order
: A 2-dimensional partial order is a k-dimensional partial order for k=2.
; k-dim partial order
: A poset is a k-dimensional partial order iff it can be embedded into the k-dimensional Euclidian space in such a way that each node is represented by a k-dimensional point and there is a precedence between two nodes i and j iff for any dimension the coordinate of i is smaller than or equal to the one of j.


In the presence of a precedence relation one might in addition assume ''time lags''.  Let &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt; denote the start time of a job and &lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt; its completion time.  Then the precedence relation &lt;math&gt;i \prec j&lt;/math&gt; implies the constraint &lt;math&gt;C_i + l_{ij} \leq S_j &lt;/math&gt;.  If no time lag &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is specified then it is assumed to be zero.  Time lags can be positive or negative numbers.

; l
: job independent time lags. In other words &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}=l&lt;/math&gt;  for all job pairs i, j and a given number l.
; &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
: job pair dependent arbitrary time lags.

=== Transportation delays ===

; &lt;math&gt;t_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; 
: Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{k+1,j}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;units.
; &lt;math&gt;t_{jkl}&lt;/math&gt; 
: Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{l,j}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{jkl}&lt;/math&gt; units.
; &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; 
: Machine dependent transportation delay. Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{k+1,j}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{k}&lt;/math&gt; units.
; &lt;math&gt;t_{kl}&lt;/math&gt; 
: Machine pair dependent transportation delay. Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{l,j}&lt;/math&gt;o f job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{kl}&lt;/math&gt; units.
; &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; 
: Job dependent transportation delay. Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{l,j}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{j}&lt;/math&gt; units.


=== Various constraints ===

; rcrc
: Recirculation, also called Flexible job shop. The promise on &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is lifted and for some pairs &lt;math&gt;k\neq k'&lt;/math&gt; we might have &lt;math&gt;\mu_{kj}= \mu_{k'j}&lt;/math&gt;.
; no-wait
: The operation &lt;math&gt;O_{k+1,i}&lt;/math&gt;must start exactly when operation &lt;math&gt;O_{k,i}&lt;/math&gt; completes.  Sometimes also denoted as 'nwt'.
; no-idle
: No machine is ever idle between two executions.
; &lt;math&gt;size_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Multiprocessor tasks on identical parallel machines. The execution of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is done simultaneously on &lt;math&gt;size_j&lt;/math&gt;parallel machines.
; &lt;math&gt;fix_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Multiprocessor tasks. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;is given with a set of machines &lt;math&gt;fix_j\subseteq\{1,\ldots,m\}&lt;/math&gt;, and needs simultaneously all these machines for execution. Sometimes also denoted by 'MPT'.
; &lt;math&gt;M_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Multipurpose machines. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;needs to be scheduled on one machine out of a given set &lt;math&gt;M_j\subseteq\{1,\ldots,m\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes also denoted by 'M_j'.


== Objective functions ==

Usually the goal is to minimize some objective value. One difference is the notation &lt;math&gt;\sum U_j&lt;/math&gt; where the goal is to maximize the number of jobs that complete before their deadline. This is also called the ''throughput''.  The objective value can be sum, possibly weighted by some given priority weights &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt; per job.

; -
: The absence of an objective value is denoted by a single dash. This means that the problem consists simply in producing a feasible scheduling, satisfying all given constraints.
; &lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt;
: This denotes the ''completion time'' of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.
; &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt;
: The ''flow time'' of a job is difference between its completion time and its release time, i.e. &lt;math&gt;F_j=C_j-r_j&lt;/math&gt;. 
; &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Lateness. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is given a due date &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;. The lateness of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;C_j-d_j&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes &lt;math&gt;L_{\max}&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote feasibility for a problem with deadlines. Indeed using binary search, the complexity of the feasibility version is equivalent to the minimization of &lt;math&gt;L_{\max}&lt;/math&gt;.
; &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Throughput. Every job is given a due date &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;.  There is a unit profit for jobs that complete one time, i.e. &lt;math&gt;U_j=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;C_j\leq d_j&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;U_j=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.  Sometimes the meaning of &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; is inverted in the literature, which is equivalent when considering the decision version of the problem, but which makes a huge difference for approximations.
; &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Tardiness. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is given a due date &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;. The tardiness of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;T_j =  \max\{0, C_j-d_j\}&lt;/math&gt;.
; &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Earliness. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is given a due date &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;. The earliness of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;E_j = \max\{0, d_j-C_j\}&lt;/math&gt;.  This objective is important for ''just-in-time' scheduling.

'''Paleoseismology''' looks at [[geologic]] [[sediment]]s and [[rock (geology)|rocks]], for signs of ancient [[earthquake]]s. It is used to supplement [[seismology|seismic monitoring]], for the calculation of [[seismic hazard]].  Paleoseismology is usually restricted to geologic regimes that have undergone continuous sediment creation for the last few thousand years, such as [[swamp]]s, [[lake]]s, [[river]] beds and shorelines.

In this typical example, a trench is dug in an active sedimentation regime.  Evidence of [[thrust fault]]ing can be seen in the walls of the trench.  It becomes a matter of deducting the relative age of each fault, by cross-cutting patterns.  The faults can be dated in absolute terms, if there is [[radiocarbon dating|dateable carbon]], or human artifacts.

Many notable discoveries have been made using the techniques of paleoseismology.  For example, there is a common misconception that having many smaller earthquakes can somehow 'relieve' a major fault such as the San Andreas, and reduce the chance of a major earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12558.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now known (using paleoseismology) that nearly all the movement of the fault takes place with extremely large earthquakes.  All of these seismic events (with a [[Moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of over 8), leave some sort of trace in the sedimentation record.

Another famous example involves the [[megathrust earthquake]]s of the Pacific Northwest.  It was thought for some time that there was low seismic hazard in region because relatively few modern earthquakes are being recorded.  There was a concept that the subduction zone was merely sliding in a benign manner.

All of these comforting notions were shattered by paleoseismology studies showing evidence of extremely large earthquakes (the most recent being in [[1700 Cascadia earthquake|1700]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/pacnw/paleo/greateq/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511022454/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/pacnw/paleo/greateq/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with historical [[tsunami]] records.  In effect, the [[subduction]] zone under British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and far northern California, is perfectly normal, being extremely hazardous in the long term, with the capability of generating coastal tsunamis of several hundred feet in height at the coast. These are caused by the interface between the subducted sea floor stressing the overlaying coastal soils in compression. Periodically a slip will occur which causes the coastal portion to reduce in elevation and thrust toward the west, leading to tsunamis in the central and eastern north Pacific Ocean (with several hours of warning) and a reflux of water toward the coastal shore, with little time for residents to escape.

==Paleoseismic trenching==
Paleoseismic investigations are commonly performed through trenching studies in which a trench is dug and a geologist logs the geological attributes of the rock layers. Trenching studies are especially relevant to seismically active regions, such as many parts of California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5597">'''Phloem loading''' is the process of loading [[carbon]] into the [[phloem]] for transport to different '[[Sink (biology)|sinks]]' in a plant. Sinks include [[metabolism]], growth, storage, and other processes or organs that need carbon [[Solution|solutes]] to persist. It can be a passive process, relying on a pressure gradient to generate diffusion of solutes through the [[symplast]], or an active process, requiring energy to create membrane-bound [[transporter protein]]s that move solutes through the [[apoplast]] against a gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gamalei|first=Yuri|year=1991|title=Phloem loading and its development related to plant evolution from trees to herbs|url=|journal=Trees|volume=5|pages=50–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive phloem loading transports solutes freely through [[plasmodesma]] in the symplast of the minor veins of leaves. [[Active transport]] occurs [[apoplast]]ically and does not use plasmodesmata. An intermediate type of loading exists that uses symplastic transport but utilizes a size-exclusion mechanism to ensure diffusion is a one-way process between the mesophyll and phloem cells. This process is referred to as polymer-trapping, in which simple solutes such as sucrose are synthesized into larger molecules such as [[stachyose]] or [[raffinose]] in intermediary cells. The larger molecules cannot diffuse back to the mesophyll but can move into the phloem's [[sieve cells]]. Therefore, the synthesis of larger compounds uses energy and is thus 'active' but this strategy does not require specialized proteins and can still move [[symplast]]ically.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turgeon|first=Robert|last2=Medville|first2=Richard|last3=Nixon|first3=Kevin|year=2001|title=The evolution of minor vein phloem and phloem loading|url=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=88|pages=1331–1339|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Yuri Gamalei first described the different types of phloem-loading mechanisms in 1989, correlating loading strategy with the [[Leaf anatomy|leaf's anatomy]]. He found that plasmodesmatal abundance in the minor veins of leaves was correlated with a plant's loading strategy. Plasmodesmata allow solutes to diffuse through the symplast. Thus, plants with a lot of plasmodesmata are generally passive loaders. Plants with few or absent plasmodesmata are usually active loaders since they do not have a way for solutes to pass through the symplast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gamalei|first=Yuri|year=1989|title=Structure and function of leaf minor veins in trees and herbs - A taxonomic review|url=|journal=Trees|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=96–110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Robert Turgeon and colleagues found that plasmodesmatal frequency is not the sole indicator of a plant's phloem-loading strategy. While the presence of abundant plasmodesmata does allow for passive, symplastic transport, it does not exclude the possibility of active, apoplastic transport. The amount of plasmodesmata in a leaf is an aspect of a species' [[Leaf anatomy|anatomy]] and not necessarily a determinant of phloem-loading strategy. Plants with a polymer-trapping mechanism may have an abundance of plasmodesmata, but this trait alone does not indicate this loading strategy. Therefore, to accurately determine phloem-loading mechanisms, the type and amount of transport solute must also be identified. A plant's phloem-loading strategy can be accurately determined by combining data on solute type, solute concentration and plasmodesmatal abundance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Phloem loading and growth form ==
Active phloem loading requires less carbon, allowing carbon allocation to other sinks in the plant, such as growth. Active phloem loading allows for higher growth potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turgeon|first=Robert|year=2010|title=The role of phloem loading reconsidered|url=|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=152 |issue=4|pages=1817–1823|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbaceous plants have a relatively high growth rate and many are active phloem loaders. Active loaders tend to have a high [[hydraulic conductivity]] and low solute concentrations, while passive loaders have high solute concentrations and a low hydraulic conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Qiushi|last2=Cheng|first2=Lailiang|last3=Guo|first3=Yangdong|last4=Turgeon|first4=Robert|year=2011|title=Phloem loading strategies and water relations in trees and herbaceous plants|url=|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=157 |issue=3|pages=1518–1527|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees also exhibit high solute concentrations and low hydraulic conductivity and thus are thought to be passive loaders. Based on early research, scientists correlated herbaceous species with active loading and trees and other woody species with passive loading. However, in 2011, Davidson et al. examined the correlation between growth from and phloem-loading strategy. They found that a loose association exists but not a definitive correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Anna|last2=Keller|first2=Felix|last3=Turgeon|first3=Robert|year=2011|title=Phloem loading, plant growth form, and climate|url=|journal=Protoplasma|volume=248 |issue=1|pages=153–163|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trees exhibit active loading, while some herbs exhibit passive loading, and many species have mechanisms of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oner-Sieben|first=Soner|last2=Lohaus|first2=Gertrud|year=2014|title=Apoplastic and symplastic phloem loading in Quercus robur and Fraxinus excelsior|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=65 |issue=7|pages=1905–1916|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Privacy may be lessened by [[surveillance]] – in this case through [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]].]]
'''Privacy''' is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps with [[security]] (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Herring, ''Medical Law and Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. All countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally requires the sharing of information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures. This was a major concern in the United States, with the Supreme Court passage of [[Citizens United]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. For example, people may be ready to reveal their name, if that allows them to promote trust by others and thus build meaningful social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudeul|first=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The effect of privacy concerns on social network formation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167268117301853|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=141|pages=233–253|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2017.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oulasvirta |first=Antti |last2=Suomalainen |first2=Tiia |last3=Hamari |first3=Juho |last4=Lampinen |first4=Airi |last5=Karvonen |first5=Kristiina |date=2014 |title=Transparency of Intentions Decreases Privacy Concerns in Ubiquitous Surveillance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264638054_Transparency_of_Intentions_Decreases_Privacy_Concerns_in_Ubiquitous_Surveillance |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=633–38 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize. A person may also disclose personal information as part of being an executive for a publicly traded company in the USA pursuant to federal securities law.&lt;ref&gt;Undressing the CEO: Disclosing Private, Material Matters of Public Company Executives, 11 Penn. Journal of Bus. Law 383 (2009), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040940&lt;/ref&gt; Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to [[identity theft]].

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with [[Western culture]], British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zemskaya|first=E. A.|title=Особенности русской речи эмигрантов четвертой волны (Features of the Russian language of fourth wave immigrants)|url=http://www.gramota.ru/biblio/magazines/gramota/28_520|publisher=Gramota.ru|accessdate=24 February 2009|language=Russian|date=9 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society—closing the door to one's home, for example.

The distinction or overlap between [[secrecy]] and privacy is [[ontology|ontologically]] subtle, which is why the word "privacy" is an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] [[lexeme]],&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"/&gt; and many languages do not have a specific word for "privacy". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение''—solitude, ''секретность''—secrecy, and ''частная жизнь''—private life) or borrow from English "privacy" (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''privasi'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''la privacy'').&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |author2=Rogers, Margaret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy&amp;f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012|isbn=9781853596186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction hinges on the discreteness of [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]] of parties (persons or groups), which can have [[emic and etic|emic]] variation depending on cultural mores of [[individualism]], [[collectivism]], and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]]. The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as, "when ''I'' withhold information, it is privacy; when ''you'' withhold information, it is secrecy."

==Concepts==
A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}} One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}}

# the right to be let alone
# the option to limit the access others have to one's personal information
# [[secrecy]], or the option to conceal any information from others
# control over others' use of information about oneself
# states of privacy
# [[personhood]] and autonomy
# self-identity and personal growth
# protection of [[intimate relationships]]

===Right to be let alone===
In 1890 the United States [[jurists]] [[Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'', an article in which they argued for the "right to be let alone", using that phrase as a definition of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being "let alone", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose [[seclusion]] from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}}

===Limited access===
Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}

Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}} [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] wrote in the late 19th century that "nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godkin|first1=E.L.|authorlink1=Edwin Lawrence Godkin|title=Libel and its Legal Remedy|journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|date=December 1880|volume=46|issue=278|pages=729–39|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0046-6;didno=atla0046-6;view=image;seq=0735;node=atla0046-6%3A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison&lt;ref name="transparency" /&gt; 9 years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavison|first1=Ruth|authorlink1=Ruth Gavison|title=Privacy and the Limits of Law|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1980|pages=421–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sissela Bok]] said that privacy is "the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bok|first1=Sissela|authorlink1=Sissela Bok|title=Secrets : on the ethics of concealment and revelation|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724735|pages=10–11|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control over information===
Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Alan Westin.{{cite book|last1=Westin|first1=Alan F.|last2=Blom-Cooper|first2=Louis|authorlink1=Alan Westin|authorlink2=Louis Blom-Cooper|title=Privacy and freedom|date=1970|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-0370013251|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fried]] said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves. Nevertheless, in the era of [[big data]], control over information is under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/46935|title=Predicting Data that People Refuse to Disclose; How Data Mining Predictions Challenge Informational Self-Determination|last=B.H.M.|first=Custers,|last2=Metajuridica|first2=Instituut voor|website=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== States of privacy ===
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privacy and Freedom|last = Westin|first = Alan|publisher = Atheneum|year = 1967|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anonymity is the "desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Behavioural Understanding of Privacy and Its Implications for Privacy Law|last = Hughes|first = Kirsty|date = 2012|journal = The Modern Law Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this sense, "accessing" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Secrecy===
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to "conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage".{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|authorlink1=Richard Posner|title=The economics of justice|date=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674235267|page=271|edition=5. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}} When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}}

===Personhood and autonomy===
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Intimacy, and Personhood|last = Reiman|first = Jeffrey|date = 1976|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the "social ritual" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philosophical Dimensions of Privacy: An Anthology|last = Benn|first = Stanley|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = |editor-first = Ferdinand|chapter = Privacy, freedom, and respect for persons|editor-last = Schoeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy is required to exercise choice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a "determinate character" and "limited probabilities."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a "purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Autonomy, and Self-Concept|last = Kufer|first = Joseph|date = 1987|journal = American Philosophical Quarterly|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of "total institutions" such as prisons and mental institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates|last = Goffman|first = Erving|publisher = Doubleday|year = 1968|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Self-identity and personal growth ===
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers "define and limit the boundaries of the self" and thus "serve to help define [the self]."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Environment and Social Behavior: Privacy, Personal Space, Territory, and Crowding|last = Altman|first = Irwin|publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|year = 1975|isbn = |location = Monterey|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Control over the "permeability" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Intimacy===
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or [[intimate relationships]] with other humans.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}} Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose some information, but withholding other information, there is a concept of privacy as a part of the process by means of which humans establish relationships with each other.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}

[[James Rachels]] advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because "there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rachels|first1=James|authorlink1=James Rachels|title=Why Privacy is Important|journal=[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]|date=Summer 1975|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–33|jstor=2265077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts in popular media===
Privacy can mean different things in different contexts; different people, cultures, and nations have different expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an [[invasion of privacy]].

====Personal privacy====
Most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.

Physical privacy could be defined as preventing "intrusions into one's physical space or solitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=physical+privacy&amp;sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I|title=Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America|first=H. Jeff|last=Smith|date=14 April 1994|publisher=UNC Press Books|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This would include concerns such as:
* Preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies
* Video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts
* Preventing searching of one's personal possessions
* Preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle
* [[Medical privacy]], the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception

An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310024937/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-10 |work=Georgetown Law Journal |title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.

Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111081006/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |archive-date=2012-01-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

====Informational====
{{Main|Information privacy}}

Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self. Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.

Various types of [[personal information]] are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it. For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.

[[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that [[Bank secrecy|does not share this information with other countries]] can help countries in fighting [[tax avoidance]].

[[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used. For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

[[Medical privacy]] Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity. A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.

[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).

Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations. Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.

====Organizational====

Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ – Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or declare certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

====Spiritual and intellectual====

The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected "only the physical interference of life and property." Its development from then on became "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law."&lt;ref name=Solove&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a "recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect."&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone", and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession—intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in a "right to privacy" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Privacy laws of the United States}}
Privacy has historical roots in philosophical discussions, the most well-known being Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the ''polis'', associated with political life, and the private sphere of the ''oikos'', associated with domestic life.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2015|title = Privacy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/privacy/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Judith|last = DeCew|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; More systematic treatises of privacy in the United States did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Technology===
[[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]]. A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was "secret", in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 ''Harvard Law Review'' 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.&amp;nbsp;P. [https://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'' (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.

There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a "right to privacy." Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.

===Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: "where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever", writes law professor and author [[Jeffrey Rosen]].&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology "The Web Means the End of Forgetting"] ''New York Times'', July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This currently has an effect on employment. [[Microsoft]] reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and [[Twitter]]. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 1,490 million members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. Over 83.09 million accounts were fake. [[Twitter]] has more than 316 million registered users and over 20 million are fake users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=110|issue=15|pages=5802–05|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110|pmid=23479631|pmc=3625324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Bachrach, Y. |author3=Stillwell, D.J. |author4=Kohli, P. |author5=Graepel, T. |title=Manifestations Of User Personality In Website Choice And Behaviour On Online Social Networks|journal=Machine Learning Journal|date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).

According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users. Senator [[Al Franken]] has noted the seriousness of [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]] having the ability to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files,&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Helen A.&amp;nbsp;S., [https://archive.is/20120714202126/http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/21/6508416-govt-officials-want-answers-to-secret-iphone-tracking "Gov't officials want answers to secret iPhone tracking"] ''MSNBC'', "Technology", April 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although Apple denied doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216210/Apple_denies_tracking_iPhone_users_but_promises_changes?taxonomyId=84 "Apple denies tracking iPhone users, but promises changes"], ''Computerworld'', April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Grove]], co-founder and former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]], offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview published in May 2000:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/learned-andy-grove-0500 "What I've Learned: Andy Grove"], ''Esquire'' magazine, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age. At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you. And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a very valuable asset, and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset. This wasn't the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age.}}

==Actions which take away privacy==
As with other concepts about privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prosser|first1=William|authorlink1=William Prosser (academic)|title=Privacy|journal=[[California Law Review]]|date=1960|volume=48|issue=383|page=389|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol48/iss3/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intrusion into a person’s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Encroaching someone’s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}

Building from this and other historical precedents, [[Daniel J. Solove]] presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}

===Collecting information===
In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Examples of information collection agencies include the [[NSA]] and the participants in the [[Five Eyes]] program.

===Aggregating information===
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* [[data aggregation]], which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* identification, which can mean breaking the [[de-identification]] of items of data by putting it through a [[de-anonymization]] process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* insecurity, such as lack of [[data security]], which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a [[data breach]] which harms the people whose data it held{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ [[informed consent]]{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* exclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Information dissemination===
{{quote|''Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.''|[[Publilius Syrus]]}}
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

There are various examples of this.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Appropriation is an attack on the [[personhood]] of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Invasions===
Invasion of privacy, a subset of [[expectation of privacy]], is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} "Decisional interference" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

==Right to privacy==
{{main|Right to privacy}}

Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone" (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals. This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]].&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right To Privacy"], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===

In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a "right to privacy." Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''], Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment", suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===

[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
— Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = R. A. | year = 1981 | title = The economics of privacy | url = | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 405–09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective "value" and a "human right"===

There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–42|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). Are new technologies the enemy of privacy? Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20, 115–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid). He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy. Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf Privacy Merchants]," stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder. And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni |first=Amitai |title=The Privacy Merchants: What is to be done? |journal=The Journal of Constitutional Law |date=March 2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=950 |url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from {{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection==
[[File:Privacy International 2007 privacy ranking map.png|thumb|300px|[[Privacy International]] 2007 privacy ranking&lt;br /&gt;green: Protections and safeguards&lt;br /&gt;red: Endemic surveillance societies]]

Most countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Representative examples of this include the ''[[Constitution of Brazil]]'', which says "the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable"; the ''[[Constitution of South Africa]]'' says that "everyone has a right to privacy"; and the ''[[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]'' says "the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia’s [[Privacy Act 1988]], Argentina’s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada’s 2000 [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and Japan’s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3}} The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The [[European Union]]'s 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] guides privacy protection in Europe.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The 2004 Privacy Framework by the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} [[Vance Packard]]’s ''[[The Naked Society]]'' was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

===Free market versus consumer protection approaches===
Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age | author=Quinn, Michael J. | year=2009 | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices. Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.

In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.

===Privacy law===
{{Main|Privacy law}}

Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals. While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries. For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:

:''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''

====Australia====
{{main |Privacy in Australian law}}

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' is administered by the [https://www.oaic.gov.au Office of the Australian Information Commissioner].

Privacy law has been evolving in Australia for a number of years. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the ''Telecommunications Act 1997''), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/|title=Privacy Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' was then extended to include the private sector in 2000 with the introduction of the National Privacy Principles. These took effect in 2001. Small businesses with an annual turnover of $3m were excluded from meeting the obligations specified in the National Privacy Principles with some exceptions such as those whose primary business was dealing in personal information.

In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian Privacy Law. The resulting report [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/report-108 For Your Information] was one of the largest reports ever released by the ALRC. Amongst its many recommendations were the consolidation of both the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles to form what is now known as the Australian Privacy Principles.

This recommendation, and many others, were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00197 Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012].

The Australian Privacy Principles, along with other key changes to the overall Act, took effect on 12 March 2014. The new structure of the privacy principles follow the information cycle and incorporate key emerging privacy concepts including privacy by design.

There are currently 14 Australian Privacy Principles:

# open and transparent management of personal information
# anonymity and pseudonymity
# collection of solicited personal information
# dealing with unsolicited personal information
# notification of the collection of personal information
# use or disclosure of personal information
# direct marketing
# cross-border disclosure of personal information
# adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers
# quality of personal information
# security of personal information
# access to personal information
# correction of personal information

As of 22 February 2018, the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 will introduce a mandatory data breach notification obligations for all organisations that are subject to Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This includes all Australian-registered companies and foreign-registered companies that carry on business in Australia or that interact with Australian data subjects.

===== Other Australian privacy laws =====

There are a range of other laws that provide privacy protection in Australia. These include, but are not limited to, the ''Telecommunications Act 1997'', ''Spam Act 2006'', the ''Do Not Call Register Act 2009'', general confidentiality obligations arising from certain professional relationships including with doctors, lawyers and other health providers, state based legislation including NSW [[Employee monitoring|workplace surveillance]] laws, state based laws that apply in NSW, Queensland and other states for the handling of health information and the handling of information by state government agencies.

====Brazil====
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.

====China====

Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China

Article 245 Whoever unlawfully subjects another person to a body search or a search of his residence or unlawfully intrudes into another person's residence shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. Any judicial officer who abuses his power and commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be given a heavier punishment.

Article 246 Whoever, by violence or other methods, publicly humiliates another person or invent stories to defame him, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be handled only upon complaint, except where serious harm is done to public order or to the interests of the State.

Article 252 Whoever conceals, destroys or unlawfully opens another person's letter, thereby infringing upon the citizen's right to freedom of correspondence, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than one year or criminal detention.

Article 253 Any postal worker who opens without authorization or conceals or destroys mail or telegrams shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years or criminal detention. Whoever steals money or property by committing the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be convicted and given a heavier punishment in accordance with the provisions of Article 264 of this Law.

====Canada====
{{main |Canadian privacy law}}

[[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]]. Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. [[Data privacy]] was first addressed with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.

====European Union====
For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before it can be enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based
interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.&lt;ref&gt;Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis ''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/french-official-campaigns-to-make-right-to-be-forgotten-global/|title=French Official Campaigns to Make 'Right to be Forgotten' Global|first=Mark|last=Scott|date=3 December 2014|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India'''

Due to the introduction of the Aadhaar project inhabitants of India were afraid that their privacy could be invaded. The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masiero|first=Silvia|date=2018-09-24|title=Explaining Trust in Large Biometric Infrastructures: A Critical Realist Case Study of India's Aadhaar Project|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/isd2.12053|journal=The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|language=en|pages=e12053|doi=10.1002/isd2.12053|issn=1681-4835}}&lt;/ref&gt; To tackle the fear amongst the people, India’s supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemalto.com/govt/customer-cases/aadhaar|title=Aadhaar: 7 changes transforming India in 2018 {{!}} Gemalto|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gemalto.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24th of August 2017 this new law was established.

====Italy====
In [[Italy]] the [[right to privacy]] is enshrined in Article 15 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law."

====United Kingdom====
{{main |Privacy in English law}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a "Personal Information Toolkit" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf "Personal Information Toolkit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103165639/http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf |date=2009-01-03 }} prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main |Privacy laws of the United States}}

Although the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy are implicitly granted by the Constitution under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have "penumbras" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the US by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to Federal agencies in the executive branch of the Federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://foia.state.gov/Learn/PrivacyAct.aspx|title = The Privacy Act|date = 2015-05-22|accessdate = 2015-11-19|website = Freedom of Information Act|publisher = US Department of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),&lt;ref&gt;Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).

===Privacy Index===
The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2). On the bottom of the list are the United States and United Kingdom (around 1.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/by8|title=International Privacy Index |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy on the Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}
{{see also|Right to be forgotten}}
There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet. For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name="FederalTrade"&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2010), "Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers," Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the "elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies."&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), "Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage," ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 23 (Spring), 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to [[behavioral advertising]].&lt;ref name="FederalTrade" /&gt;
Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: "first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short".&lt;ref&gt;Hugl, Ulrike (2011), "Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking," ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=1926600&amp;show=abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805" /&gt;

===Privacy and location-based services===

Increasingly, mobile devices facilitate location tracking.  This creates user privacy problems.  A user's location and preferences constitute personal information.  Their improper use violates that user's privacy.  A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013 |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study
further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

Several methods to protect user privacy in [[location-based service]]s have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasios S. Voulodimos and Charalampos Z. Patrikakis, "Quantifying Privacy in Terms of Entropy for Context Aware Services", special issue of the Identity in the Information Society journal, "Identity Management in Grid and SOA", Springer, vol. 2, no 2, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e. "In the City" or "Philadelphia" or "Work") to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.

In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and paired with the ''[[National Do Not Call Registry]]'', telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.&lt;ref name = "Telemarketers and Mobiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sneaky-tactics-used-by-telemarketers-and-debt-collectors-to-get-your-cell-phone-number-2011-6 |title=Sneaky tactics used by telemarketers and debt collectors to get your cell phone number |publisher=Businessinsider.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both ''[[Federal Trade Commission]]'' and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.

===Privacy by design===

The principle of [[privacy by design]] states that privacy and [[data protection]] are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of [[technologies]], from the early [[design]] stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.

===Privacy engineering===

The practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as [[Privacy engineering]]

===Privacy self-synchronization===

Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, C., et. all., "Managing Personal Information: Insights on Corporate Risk and Opportunity for Privacy-Savvy Leaders", Carswell (2012), Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy paradox ==
The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"&gt;Swartz, J., "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox", The Washington Post, 03 Sep 2000, H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; While this term was coined as early as 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Bedrick, B., Lerner, B., Whitehead, B."The privacy paradox: Introduction", "News Media and the Law", Washington, D.C., Volume 22, Issue 2, Spring 1998, pp. P1-P3.&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn't used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sweat, J. "Privacy paradox: Customers want control—and coupons", InformationWeek, Manhasset Iss, 781, April 10, 2000, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"/&gt; In his article titled "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox," John Schwartz wrote that "It's one of the more puzzling conundrums of online life. While companies that capitalize on the Internet's powerful potential to invade privacy are denounced as villains of the information age, millions of people type out highly personal data and send it off to Web sites they've barely heard of, with no strong legal protection against misuse of the information. …The paradox helps illustrate the complexity of the debate over privacy."

Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, S., "A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States", 
First Monday, volume 11, number 9 (September 2006), URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_9/barnes/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.

Privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Although several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taddicken | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = The 'Privacy Paradox'in the Social Web: The Impact of Privacy Concerns, Individual Characteristics, and the Perceived Social Relevance on Different Forms of Self-Disclosure | url = | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 248–73 | doi=10.1111/jcc4.12052}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main explanation for the privacy paradox is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. (2006, June). Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook. In ''Privacy enhancing technologies'' (pp. 36–58).

On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = S | year = 2008 | title = Taking risky opportunities in youthful content creation: teenagers' use of social networking sites for intimacy, privacy and self-expression | url = | journal = New media &amp; society | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 393–411 |
doi=10.1177/1461444808089415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy.  Psychologists particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox occurs because users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.&lt;ref&gt;Utz, S., &amp; Kramer, N. (2009). The privacy paradox on social network sites revisited: The role of individual characteristics and group norms. ''Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace,'' ''3''(2), article 1.

&lt;/ref&gt; Other individual factors such as gender, age, trust and personality, may also account for the paradox.

== The right to privacy in popular culture ==

The 1993 film ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', based on the [[The Pelican Brief|novel of the same name]], touches on privacy.  In one scene, a law professor discusses the Constitutional right to privacy. One of his students, played by [[Julia Roberts]], argues that the majority opinion in [[Bowers v. Hardwick|Bowers v Hardwick]] was wrongly decided.

In the TV series [[West Wing]], in the 1999 episode ''Short List'', the right to privacy arises during the appointment of a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] judge.  [[Sam Seabourne]] ventures the opinion that [[Internet]] privacy will be a major social issue in the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westwingtranscripts.com/search.php?flag=getTranscript&amp;id=9|title=Search or Browse The West Wing Transcripts -- View or Search transcripts and summaries|author=|date=|website=westwingtranscripts.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selfie culture ===
[[Selfies]] are popular today; a search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and "a whopping 51 million with the hashtag #me"  However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|date=2015-05-04|title=Selfie Culture in the Age of Corporate and State Surveillance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|journal=Third Text|volume=29|issue=3|pages=155–164|doi=10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|issn=0952-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a research which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for selfies, females generally have greater concerns than male social media users. Users who have greater concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhir|first=Amandeep|last2=Torsheim|first2=Torbjørn|last3=Pallesen|first3=Ståle|last4=Andreassen|first4=Cecilie S.|date=2017|title=Do Online Privacy Concerns Predict Selfie Behavior among Adolescents, Young Adults and Adults?|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14043">'''Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score''' ('''PDCAAS''') is a method of evaluating the [[protein quality|quality of a protein]] based on both the [[amino acid]] requirements of humans and their ability to digest it.

The PDCAAS rating was adopted by the [[US FDA]] and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/[[World Health Organization]] (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as "the preferred 'best'" method to determine [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] quality.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U5900t/u5900t07.htm Boutrif, E., Food Quality and Consumer Protection Group, Food Policy and Nutrition Division, FAO, Rome: "Recent Developments in Protein Quality Evaluation" ''Food, Nutrition and Agriculture'', Issue 2/3, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].

==Methodology==
Using the PDCAAS method, the protein quality rankings are determined by comparing the amino acid profile of the specific food protein against a standard amino acid profile with the highest possible score being a 1.0. This score means, after [[digestion]] of the protein, it provides per unit of protein 100% or more of the [[Essential amino acid|indispensable amino acids]] required.

The formula for calculating the PDCAAS percentage is: (mg of [[limiting amino acid]] in 1 g of test protein / mg of same amino acid in 1 g of reference protein) x fecal true digestibility percentage.&lt;ref name=pmid10867064/&gt;

The PDCAAS value is different from measuring the quality of protein from the [[Protein efficiency ratio|protein efficiency ratio (PER)]] and the [[biological value]] (BV) methods.&lt;ref name="Best"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Jay R.|last2=Falvo|first2=Michael J.|year=2004|title=Protein – Which is Best|url=http://www.jssm.org/vol3/n3/2/v3n3-2pdf.pdf|journal=Journal of Sports Science and Medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=118–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PER was based upon the amino acid requirements of growing rats, which noticeably differ from those of humans. The PDCAAS allows evaluation of food protein quality based on the needs of humans as it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements (adjusted for digestibility) of a 2- to 5-year-old child (considered the most nutritionally demanding age group). The BV method uses nitrogen absorption as a basis. However, it does not take into account certain factors influencing the digestion of the protein and is of limited use for application to human protein requirements because what is measured is maximal potential of quality and not a true estimate of quality at requirement level. Nevertheless, BV can be used to assess requirements of protein derived from foods with known quality differences and measure the proportion of absorbed nitrogen which is retained and presumably used for protein synthesis as an accurate indicator for protein measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM Srikantia, S. G., University of Mysore, Mysore:  "The Use Of Biological Value Of A Protein In Evaluating Its Quality For Human Requirements", ''Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements EPR 81 29'', Rome, Aug 1981.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA gave two reasons for adopting the PDCAAS in 1993: 1) PDCAAS is based on human amino acid requirements, which makes it more appropriate for humans than a method based on the amino acid needs of animals. 2) The Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) had previously recommended PDCAAS for regulatory purposes.

==Limitations==
===Digestion===
Amino acids that move beyond the terminal [[ileum]] in the body are less likely to be absorbed for use in [[protein synthesis]]. They may pass out of the body, or may be absorbed by [[bacteria]], thus will not be present in the feces, and will appear to have been digested. The PDCAAS takes no account of where the proteins have been digested.

Similarly, amino acids that are lost due to [[antinutritional factor]]s present in many foods are assumed to be digested according to the PDCAAS.

Due to this in 2013 the FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org/food-technology/daily-news/2013/march/07/fao-proposes-new-protein-quality-measurement.aspx FAO proposes new protein quality measurement. March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus on single proteins===
The PDCAAS method may also still be considered incomplete, since human diets, except in times of [[famine]], almost never contain only one kind of [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]. However, calculating the PDCAAS of a diet solely based on the PDCAAS of the individual constituents is impossible, because one food may provide an abundance of an amino acid that the other is missing, in which case the PDCAAS of the diet is higher than that of any one of the constituents. To arrive at the final result, all individual amino acids would have to be taken into account, though, so the PDCAAS of each constituent is largely useless.

For example, grain protein has a PDCAAS of about 0.4 to 0.5, limited by [[lysine]]. On the other hand, it contains more than enough [[methionine]]. [[Bean|White bean]] protein (and that of many other [[pulses]]) has a PDCAAS of 0.6 to 0.7, limited by methionine, and contains more than enough lysine. When both are eaten in roughly equal quantities in a diet, the PDCAAS of the [[protein combining|combined constituent]] is 1.0, because each constituent's protein is complemented by the other.

A more extreme example would be the combination of [[gelatine]] (which contains virtually no [[tryptophan]] and thus has a PDCAAS of 0) with isolated tryptophan (which, lacking all other essential amino acids, also has a PDCAAS of 0). Despite individual scores of 0, the combination of both in adequate amounts has a positive PDCAAS, with the limiting amino acids [[isoleucine]], [[threonine]], and [[methionine]]. Further, according to a 2000 study by Gerjan Schaafsma, "The questions about the validity of the amino acid scoring pattern and the application of the true fecal rather than the true ileal&lt;!-- not an error, adj of ileum --&gt; digestibility correction, as well as the truncation of PDCAAS values warrant a critical evaluation of PDCAAS in its current form as a measure of protein quality in human diets."&lt;ref name=pmid10867064/&gt; Also, the scientific community has raised critical questions about the validity of PDCAAS (the validity of the preschool-age child amino acid scoring pattern, the validity of the true fecal digestibility correction and the truncation of PDCAAS values to 100%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=Impact of amino acid availability on the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score|journal=Bulletin|publisher=International Dairy Federation|volume=336|pages=46–50|issn=0259-8434|vauthors=Darragh AJ, Schaafsma G, Moughan PJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Dairy Foundation on Nutrition and Health Proceedings of the International Workshop on Nutritional Aspects of Milk Proteins in Comparison with Other Proteins, organized by the Dutch Foundation on Nutrition and Health, Utrecht, the Netherlands, March 13–14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capped score===
In addition, the fact that four proteins, all with different amino acid profiles, receive identical scores of 1.0 limits its usefulness as a comparative tool. Since they have different compositions, it is natural to assume that they perform differently in the human body and should have different scores. In short, this method, however, gives no distinction of their performance relative to each other, because after they pass a certain point, they are all capped at 1.0 and receive an identical rating.&lt;ref name="Best" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sarwar G|date=May 1997|title=The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method overestimates quality of proteins containing antinutritional factors and of poorly digestible proteins supplemented with limiting amino acids in rats|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9164998|journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=127|issue=5|pages=758–64 |pmid=9164998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schaafsma G|year=2005 |title=The Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)--a concept for describing protein quality in foods and food ingredients: a critical review|journal=Journal of AOAC International |volume=88|issue=3|pages=988–94|pmid=16001875}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in 1990 at a FAO/WHO meeting, it was decided that proteins having values higher than 1.0 would be rounded or "leveled down" to 1.0 as scores above 1.0 are considered to indicate the protein contains essential amino acids in excess of the human requirements.&lt;ref name="FAOWHO1990"&gt;FAO/WHO [1990].

==Reference pattern==

This reference pattern is based on the essential amino acid requirements for preschool children aged 1-3 years as published in [https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12 Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (2005)]. Adults aged 18+ will have [https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12#687 slightly lower requirements].

'''Rasterisation''' (or '''rasterization''') is the task of taking an image described in a [[vector graphics]] format (shapes) and converting it into a [[raster image]] ([[pixel]]s or dots).&lt;ref name="Worboys1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael F. Worboys|title=GIS: A Computer Science Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=duT2fcnQeJMC&amp;pg=PA232|date=30 October 1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7484-0065-2|pages=232–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kang-Tsung Chang|title=Programming ArcObjects with VBA: A Task-Oriented Approach, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DOY9xuxcosC&amp;pg=PA91|date=27 August 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-0918-7|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rasterised image may then be  displayed on a [[computer display|video display]] or [[computer printer|printer]], or stored in a [[bitmap]] file format. Rasterisation may refer to either the conversion of [[3D model (computer graphics)|model]]s into raster files, or the conversion of 2D [[rendering primitive]]s such as [[polygon]]s or [[line segment]]s into a rasterized format. 


==Rasterisation of 3D images==
Compared with other rendering techniques such as [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], rasterisation is extremely fast. However, rasterization is simply the process of computing the mapping from scene geometry to pixels and does not prescribe a particular way to compute the color of those pixels. [[Shading]], including [[Shading language|programmable shading]], may be based on physical light transport, or artistic intent.

The process of rasterising 3D models onto a 2D plane for display on a [[computer screen]] ("[[screen space]]") is often carried out by fixed function hardware within the [[graphics pipeline]]. This is because there is no motivation for modifying the techniques for rasterisation used at render time{{clarification needed|date=August 2016}} and a special-purpose system allows for high efficiency.

'''Renaissance architecture''' is the European architecture of the period between the early 14th and early 17th centuries in different&lt;!---leave this word---&gt; regions, demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] thought and material culture. Stylistically, Renaissance architecture followed [[Gothic architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Baroque architecture]].  Developed first in [[Florence]], with [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to France, Germany, England, Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact.

Renaissance style places emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]], [[geometry]] and the regularity of parts, as they are demonstrated in the architecture of [[classical antiquity]] and in particular ancient [[Roman architecture]], of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s and [[Lintel|lintels]], as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical [[dome]]s, [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and [[aedicula]] replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of [[Gothic architecture|medieval]] buildings.

==Historiography==
The word "Renaissance" derived from the term ''"la rinascita"'', which means rebirth, first appeared in Giorgio Vasari's ''Vite de' più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani'' The Lives of the Artists, 1550–60.

Although the term Renaissance was used first by the French historian Jules Michelet, it was given its more lasting definition from the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt, whose book, ''Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien'' 1860, The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, 1860, English translation, by SGC Middlemore, in 2 vols., London, 1878) was influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. The folio of measured drawings ''Édifices de Rome moderne; ou, Recueil des palais, maisons, églises, couvents et autres monuments'' (The Buildings of Modern Rome), first published in 1840 by Paul Letarouilly, also played an important part in the revival of interest in this period.Erwin Panofsky, ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', (New York: Harper and Row, 1960) The Renaissance style was recognized by contemporaries in the term ''"all'antica"'', or "in the ancient manner" (of the Romans).

==Development in Italy – influences==
{{Main|Italian Renaissance}}
Italy of the 15th century, and the city of Florence 
in particular, was home to the Renaissance. It is in Florence that the new architectural style had its beginning, not slowly evolving in the way that [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] grew out of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], but consciously brought to being by particular architects who sought to revive the order of a past "[[Golden Age]]". The scholarly approach to the architecture of the ancient coincided with the general revival of learning. A number of factors were influential in bringing this about.

[[File:Baptisteriumganz.jpg|thumb|left|The Romanesque Baptistery of Florence was the object of Brunelleschi's studies of perspective]]

===Architectural===

Italian architects had always preferred forms that were clearly defined and structural members that expressed their purpose.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; Many Tuscan Romanesque buildings demonstrate these characteristics, as seen in the Florence Baptistery and Pisa Cathedral.

Italy had never fully adopted the Gothic style of architecture. Apart from the [[Cathedral of Milan]], (influenced by French Rayonnant Gothic), few Italian churches show the emphasis on vertical, the clustered shafts, ornate tracery and complex ribbed vaulting that characterise Gothic in other parts of Europe.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

The presence, particularly in Rome, of ancient architectural remains showing the ordered [[Classical style]] provided an inspiration to artists at a time when philosophy was also turning towards the Classical.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Political===

In the 15th century, [[Florence]], [[Venice]] and [[Naples]] extended their power through much of the area that surrounded them, making the movement of artists possible. This enabled Florence to have significant artistic influence in [[Milan]], and through Milan, [[France]].

In 1377, the return of the Pope from the [[Avignon Papacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Joëlle Rollo-Koster, ''Raiding Saint Peter: Empty Sees, Violence, and the Initiation of the Great Western Schism (1378)'', (Brill, 2008), 182.&lt;/ref&gt; and the re-establishment of the [[Papal court]] in Rome, brought wealth and importance to that city, as well as a renewal in the importance of the Pope in Italy, which was further strengthened by the [[Council of Constance]] in 1417. Successive Popes, especially [[Julius II]], 1503–13, sought to extend the Pope’s [[Papal states|temporal power]] throughout Italy.&lt;ref name=A.M&gt;Andrew Martindale, ''Man and the Renaissance'', 1966, Paul Hamlyn, ISBN unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===

In the early Renaissance, [[Venice]] controlled sea trade over goods from the East. The large towns of [[Northern Italy]] were prosperous through trade with the rest of Europe, [[Genoa]] providing a seaport for the goods of France and Spain; [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] being centers of overland trade, and maintaining substantial metalworking industries.
Trade brought wool from England to Florence, ideally located on the river for the production of fine cloth, the industry on which its wealth was founded. By dominating [[Pisa]], Florence gained a seaport, and also maintained dominance of Genoa.
In this commercial climate, one family in particular turned their attention from trade to the lucrative business of money-lending. The [[House of Medici|Medici]] became the chief bankers to the princes of Europe, becoming virtually princes themselves as they did so, by reason of both wealth and influence.
Along the trade routes, and thus offered some protection by commercial interest, moved not only goods but also artists, scientists and philosophers.&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;

[[File:Melozzo da Forlì 001.jpg|thumb|Pope Sixtus IV, 1477, builder of the Sistine Chapel. Fresco by [[Melozzo da Forlì]] in the [[Vatican Palace]].]]

===Religious===

The return of the [[Pope Gregory XI]] from [[Avignon]] in September 1377 and the resultant new emphasis on [[Rome]] as the center of [[Christianity|Christian]] spirituality, brought about a boom in the building of churches in Rome such as had not taken place for nearly a thousand years. This commenced in the mid 15th century and gained momentum in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] period. The construction of the [[Sistine Chapel]] with its uniquely important decorations and the entire rebuilding of St Peter's, one of Christendom's most significant churches, were part of this process.&lt;ref name= I.R.&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', 1979, Octopus, {{ISBN|0-7064-0857-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In wealthy republican Florence, the impetus for church-building was more civic than spiritual. The unfinished state of the enormous cathedral dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] did no honour to the city under her patronage. However, as the technology and finance were found to complete it, the rising dome did credit not only to the Blessed Virgin, its architect and the Church but also the Signoria, the Guilds and the sectors of the city from which the manpower to construct it was drawn. The dome inspired further religious works in Florence.

===Philosophic===

The development of printed books, the rediscovery of ancient writings, the expanding of political and trade contacts and the exploration of the world all increased knowledge and the desire for education.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

The reading of philosophies that were not based on Christian theology led to the development of [[Humanism]] through which it was clear that while God had established and maintained order in the Universe, it was the role of Man to establish and maintain order in Society.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.Hale, ''Renaissance Europe, 1480–1520'', 1971, Fontana {{ISBN|0-00-632435-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacopo Pontormo 055.jpg|thumb|[[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder]], head of the Medici Bank, sponsored civic building programs. Posthumous portrait by [[Pontormo]].]]

===Civil===

Through [[Humanism]], civic pride and the promotion of civil peace and order were seen as the marks of citizenship. This led to the building of structures such as Brunelleschi's [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]] with its elegant colonnade forming a link between the charitable building and the public square, and the [[Laurentian Library]] where the collection of books established by the Medici family could be consulted by scholars.&lt;ref name= Gardner&gt;[[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]], ''Art Through the Ages'', 5th edition, Harcourt, Brace and World.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major ecclesiastical building works were also commissioned, not by the church, but by guilds representing the wealth and power of the city. Brunelleschi’s dome at [[Florence Cathedral]], more than any other building, belonged to the populace because the construction of each of the eight segments was achieved by a different sector of the city.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

===Patronage===

As in the [[Plato|Platonic academy]] of [[Athens]], it was seen by those of Humanist understanding that those people who had the benefit of wealth and education ought to promote the pursuit of learning and the creation of that which was beautiful. To this end, wealthy families—the [[Medici]] of Florence, the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] of Mantua, the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] in Rome, the [[House of Sforza|Sforzas]] in Milan—gathered around them people of learning and ability, promoting the skills and creating employment for the most talented artists and architects of their day.&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

===Architectural theory===
{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}

During the Renaissance, architecture became not only a question of practice, but also a matter for theoretical discussion. [[Printing]] played a large role in the dissemination of ideas.
* The first treatise on architecture was ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' ("On the Subject of Building") by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1450. It was to some degree dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', a manuscript of which was discovered in 1414 in a library in Switzerland. ''De re aedificatoria'' in 1485 became the first printed book on architecture.
* [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475 – c. 1554) produced the next important text, the first volume of which appeared in Venice in 1537; it was entitled ''Regole generali d'architettura'' ("General Rules of Architecture"). It is known as Serlio's "Fourth Book" since it was the fourth in Serlio's original plan of a treatise in seven books. In all, five books were published.
* In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580) published ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' ("The Four Books of Architecture") in [[Venice]]. This book was widely printed and responsible to a great degree for spreading the ideas of the Renaissance through Europe. All these books were intended to be read and studied not only by architects, but also by patrons.

==Principal phases==
[[File:PalladioBramanteTempietto1570.jpg|thumb|upright|Palladio's engraving of Bramante's Tempietto]]
[[File:Tempietto - Houtsnede door Palladio 2.jpeg|thumb|upright|Plan of Bramante's Tempietto in Montorio]]

Historians often divide the Renaissance in Italy into three phases.&lt;ref&gt;Some architectural histories e.g. Sir [[Banister Fletcher]], include Baroque as a phase of Renaissance architecture. Because of its extent, diversity and deviation from the Classical it is not included here and is the subject of a main article.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas art historians might talk of an "Early Renaissance" period, in which they include developments in 14th-century painting and sculpture, this is usually not the case in architectural history. The bleak economic conditions of the late 14th century did not produce buildings that are considered to be part of the Renaissance. As a result, the word "Renaissance" among architectural historians usually applies to the period 1400 to ca. 1525, or later in the case of non-Italian Renaissances.

Historians often use the following designations:
* Renaissance (ca. 1400–1500); also known as the [[Quattrocento]]&lt;ref&gt;The Italian translates literally to "fourteen-hundred" and coincides with the English "fifteenth century".&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes Early Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;The ''Early Renaissance'' in architecture is most applicable to developments in Venice, where there was a more fluid development between medieval and Renaissance styles than in Florence. See: John McAndrew ''Venetian Architecture of the Early Renaissance'' (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[High Renaissance]] (ca.1500–1525)
* [[Mannerism]] (ca. 1520–1600)

===Quattrocento===

In the ''Quattrocento'', concepts of architectural order were explored and rules were formulated. (See- Characteristics of Renaissance Architecture, below.) The study of classical antiquity led in particular to the adoption of Classical detail and ornamentation.

Space, as an element of architecture, was used differently from the way it had been in the [[Middle Ages]]. Space was organised by proportional logic, its form and rhythm subject to geometry, rather than being created by intuition as in Medieval buildings. The prime example of this is the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|Basilica di San Lorenzo]] in [[Florence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Howard Saalman. ''Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings''. (London: Zwemmer, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Renaissance===

During the ''[[High Renaissance]]'', concepts derived from classical antiquity were developed and used with greater confidence. The most representative architect is [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] (1444–1514) who expanded the applicability of classical architecture to contemporary buildings. His [[San Pietro in Montorio]] (1503) was directly inspired by circular [[Roman temple]]s. He was, however, hardly a slave to the classical forms and it was his style that was to dominate Italian architecture in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Bruschi. ''Bramante'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CampidoglioEng.jpg|thumb|left|The Campidoglio]]

===Mannerism===
{{main|Mannerism#Mannerist architecture}}

During the [[Mannerist]] period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564), who frequently used the [[giant order]] in his architecture, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgemental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Renaissance to Baroque===

{{main|Baroque architecture}}
As the new style of architecture spread out from Italy, most other European countries developed a sort of Proto-Renaissance style, before the construction of fully formulated Renaissance buildings. Each country in turn then grafted its own architectural traditions to the new style, so that Renaissance buildings across Europe are diversified by region.

Within Italy the evolution of Renaissance architecture into Mannerism, with widely diverging tendencies in the work of Michelangelo and Giulio Romano and Andrea Palladio, led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.

Outside Italy, Baroque architecture was more widespread and fully developed than the Renaissance style, with significant buildings as far afield as [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Cathedral of Chihuahua]], 1725–1826&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Basilica Minore del Santo Niño]], present structure 1735–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:SaintPierreRaphael.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Raphael's unused plan for St. Peter's Basilica]]
The obvious distinguishing features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects. However, the forms and purposes of buildings had changed over time, as had the structure of cities. Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were churches of a type that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models for the type of large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The list of characteristics below is expanded from a list based on [[Banister Fletcher]]. See below&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan===

The plans of Renaissance buildings have a square, symmetrical appearance in which proportions are usually based on a module. Within a church, the module is often the width of an aisle. The need to integrate the design of the plan with the façade was introduced as an issue in the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], but he was never able to carry this aspect of his work into fruition. The first building to demonstrate this was [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua by [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]. The development of the plan in secular architecture was to take place in the 16th century and culminated with the work of [[Palladio]].
[[File:Sant agostino.JPG|thumb|Sant'Agostino, Rome, Giacomo di Pietrasanta, 1483]]

====Façade====
[[Façade]]s are symmetrical around their vertical axis. Church façades are generally surmounted by a [[pediment]] and organised by a system of [[pilaster]]s, arches and [[entablature]]s. The columns and windows show a progression towards the centre. One of the first true Renaissance façades was the [[Pienza Cathedral|Cathedral of Pienza]] (1459–62), which has been attributed to the Florentine architect Bernardo Gambarelli (known as [[Rossellino]]) with [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] perhaps having some responsibility in its design as well.

Domestic buildings are often surmounted by a [[cornice]]. There is a regular repetition of openings on each floor, and the centrally placed door is marked by a feature such as a balcony, or rusticated surround. An early and much copied prototype was the façade for the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] (1446 and 1451) in Florence with its three registers of [[pilasters]]
[[File:Classical orders from the Encyclopedie.png|thumb|left|Classical Orders, engraving from the ''Encyclopédie vol. 18.'' 18th century.]]

===Columns and pilasters===

The Greek and Roman orders of columns are used:- [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and [[Composite order|Composite]]. The orders can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and [[entablatures]] as an integrated system. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the [[Sagrestia Vecchia|Old Sacristy]] (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.

===Arches===

Arches are semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental scale at the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua.

===Vaults===

Vaults do not have ribs. They are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault which is frequently rectangular. The [[barrel vault]] is returned to architectural vocabulary as at the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua.

===Domes===
{{main|History of Italian Renaissance domes}}
[[File:StPetersDomePD.jpg|thumb|The Dome of St Peter's Basilica, Rome.&lt;!---this is an image that speaks for itself! The rest of the info is further down the page---&gt;]]
The dome is used frequently, both as a very large structural feature that is visible from the exterior, and also as a means of roofing smaller spaces where they are only visible internally. After the success of the dome in Brunelleschi’s design for the [[Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore]] and its use in Bramante’s plan for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1506) in Rome, the dome became an indispensable element in church architecture and later even for secular architecture, such as Palladio's [[Villa Rotonda]].&lt;ref&gt;A major use of this feature is great dome of the [[US Capitol Building]] (begun 1856) in [[Washington DC]] and all the subsequent State Capitals buildings in the [[Renaissance Revival]] style.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceilings===

Roofs are fitted with flat or [[coffered]] ceilings. They are not left open as in Medieval architecture. They are frequently painted or decorated.

===Doors===

Doors usually have square lintels. They may be set within an arch or surmounted by a triangular or segmental pediment.
Openings that do not have doors are usually arched and frequently have a large or decorative keystone.

===Windows===

Windows may be paired and set within a semi-circular arch. They may have square lintels and triangular or segmental pediments, which are often used alternately. Emblematic in this respect is the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in Rome, begun in 1517.
[[File:Palazzo Strozzi cortile.JPG|thumb|left|Courtyard of Palazzo Strozzi, Florence]]
In the Mannerist period the “Palladian” arch was employed, using a motif of a high semi-circular topped opening flanked with two lower square-topped openings. Windows are used to bring light into the building and in domestic architecture, to give views. Stained glass, although sometimes present, is not a feature.

===Walls===

External walls are generally constructed of brick, rendered, or faced with stone in highly finished [[ashlar]] masonry, laid in straight courses.  The corners of buildings are often emphasised by rusticated [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]]. Basements and ground floors were often rusticated, as at the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] (1444–1460) in Florence. Internal walls are smoothly plastered and surfaced with [[lime wash]]. For more formal spaces, internal surfaces are decorated with [[fresco]]es.

===Details===

Courses, mouldings and all decorative details are carved with great precision. Studying and mastering the details of the ancient Romans was one of the important aspects of Renaissance theory. The different orders each required different sets of details. Some architects were stricter in their use of classical details than others, but there was also a good deal of innovation in solving problems, especially at corners. Mouldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic Architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths. They are not integral to the building as in Medieval architecture.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;[[Banister Fletcher]], ''History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''(first published 1896, current edition 2001, Elsevier Science &amp; Technology {{ISBN|0-7506-2267-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development in Italy – Early Renaissance==
The leading architects of the Early Renaissance or Quattrocento were [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Michelozzo]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]].

===Brunelleschi===
The person generally credited with bringing about the Renaissance view of architecture is [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Cropplestone, Trewin, ''World Architecture'', 1963, Hamlyn. Page 243&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying feature of the work of Brunelleschi was "order".
[[File:Piazza SS Annunziata Firenze Apr 2008 (3).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] in Florence.]]
In the early 15th century, Brunelleschi began to look at the world to see what the rules were that governed one's way of seeing. He observed that the way one sees regular structures such as the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery of Florence]] and the tiled pavement surrounding it follows a mathematical order—[[linear perspective]].

The buildings remaining among the ruins of ancient Rome appeared to respect a simple mathematical order in the way that Gothic buildings did not. One incontrovertible rule governed all [[Ancient Roman architecture]]—a semi-circular arch is exactly twice as wide as it is high. A fixed proportion with implications of such magnitude occurred nowhere in [[Gothic architecture]]. A Gothic pointed arch could be extended upwards or flattened to any proportion that suited the location. Arches of differing angles frequently occurred within the same structure. No set rules of proportion applied.

From the observation of the architecture of Rome came a desire for symmetry and careful proportion in which the form and composition of the building as a whole and all its subsidiary details have fixed relationships, each section in proportion to the next, and the architectural features serving to define exactly what those rules of proportion are.&lt;ref name= W&amp;M&gt;Robert Erich Wolf and Ronald Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', 1968, Harry N. Abrams.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi gained the support of a number of wealthy Florentine patrons, including the Silk Guild and [[Cosimo de' Medici]].

[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore cupola (1622842169).jpg|thumb|left|The dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] (the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore)]]

====Florence Cathedral====
Brunelleschi's first major architectural commission was for the enormous brick dome which covers the central space of [[Duomo of Florence|Florence's cathedral]], designed by [[Arnolfo di Cambio]] in the 14th century but left unroofed. While often described as the first building of the Renaissance, Brunelleschi's daring design uses the pointed Gothic arch and Gothic ribs that were apparently planned by Arnolfio. It seems certain, however, that while stylistically Gothic, in keeping with the building it surmounts, the dome is in fact structurally influenced by the great dome of Ancient Rome, which Brunelleschi could hardly have ignored in seeking a solution. This is the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], a circular temple, now a church.

Inside the Pantheon's single-shell concrete dome is coffering which greatly decreases the weight. The vertical partitions of the coffering effectively serve as ribs, although this feature does not dominate visually. At the apex of the Pantheon's dome is an opening, 8 meters across. Brunelleschi was aware that a dome of enormous proportion could in fact be engineered without a keystone. The dome in Florence is supported by the eight large ribs and sixteen more internal ones holding a brick shell, with the bricks arranged in a herringbone manner. Although the techniques employed are different, in practice both domes comprise a thick network of ribs supporting very much lighter and thinner infilling. And both have a large opening at the top.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Einblick LH2 San Lorenzo Florenz.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The church of San Lorenzo]]

====San Lorenzo====
The new architectural philosophy of the Renaissance is best demonstrated in the churches of [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|San Lorenzo]], and [[Santo Spirito di Firenze|Santo Spirito]] in Florence. Designed by Brunelleschi in about 1425 and 1428 respectively, both have the shape of the [[Latin cross]]. Each has a modular plan, each portion being a multiple of the square bay of the aisle. This same formula controlled also the vertical dimensions. In the case of Santo Spirito, which is entirely regular in plan, transepts and chancel are identical, while the nave is an extended version of these. In 1434 Brunelleschi designed the first Renaissance centrally planned building, [[Santa Maria degli Angeli di Firenze|Santa Maria degli Angeli]] of Florence. It is composed of a central [[octagon]] surrounded by a circuit of eight smaller chapels. From this date onwards numerous churches were built in variations of these designs.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Fanelli, ''Brunelleschi'', 1980, Becocci editore Firenze&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelozzo===
[[Michelozzo Michelozzi]] (1396–1472), was another architect under patronage of the [[Medici]] family, his most famous work being the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], which he was commissioned to design for [[Medici|Cosimo de' Medici]] in 1444. A decade later he built the Villa Medici at [[Fiesole]]. Among his other works for Cosimo are the library at the Convent of San Marco, Florence. He went into exile in Venice for a time with his patron. He was one of the first architects to work in the Renaissance style outside Italy, building a palace at [[Dubrovnik]].&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Palazzo medici riccardi 33 Sailko adj.JPG|thumb|left|Palazzo Medici Riccardi by Michelozzo. Florence, 1444]]
The Palazzo Medici Riccardi is Classical in the details of its pedimented windows and recessed doors, but, unlike the works of Brunelleschi and Alberti, there are no ''[[Classical orders|orders]]'' of columns in evidence. Instead, Michelozzo has respected the Florentine liking for rusticated stone. He has seemingly created three orders out of the three defined rusticated levels, the whole being surmounted by an enormous Roman-style cornice which juts out over the street by 2.5 meters.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Alberti===
[[Leon Battista Alberti]], born in Genoa (1402–1472), was an important Humanist theoretician and designer whose book on architecture ''De re Aedificatoria'' was to have lasting effect. An aspect of [[Humanism]] was an emphasis of the anatomy of nature, in particular the human form, a science first studied by the Ancient Greeks. Humanism made man the measure of things. Alberti perceived the architect as a person with great social responsibilities.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

[[File:Sant Andrea straight.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sant'Andrea, Mantua]], the façade]]
He designed a number of buildings, but unlike Brunelleschi, he did not see himself as a builder in a practical sense and so left the supervision of the work to others. Miraculously, one of his greatest designs, that of the Church of [[Sant'Andrea in Mantua]], was brought to completion with its character essentially intact. Not so the church of [[San Francesco, Rimini|San Francesco]] in [[Rimini]], a rebuilding of a Gothic structure, which, like Sant'Andrea, was to have a façade reminiscent of a Roman triumphal arch. This was left sadly incomplete.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

Sant'Andrea is an extremely dynamic building both without and within. Its triumphal façade is marked by extreme contrasts. The projection of the order of pilasters that define the architectural elements, but are essentially non-functional, is very shallow. This contrasts with the gaping deeply recessed arch which makes a huge portico before the main door. The size of this arch is in direct contrast to the two low square-topped openings that frame it. The light and shade play dramatically over the surface of the building because of the shallowness of its mouldings and the depth of its porch. In the interior Alberti has dispensed with the traditional nave and aisles. Instead there is a slow and majestic progression of alternating tall arches and low square doorways, repeating the "[[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]]" motif of the façade.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''Leonis Baptiste Alberti'', Architectural Design, Vol 49 No 5–6, Holland St, London&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], 1456–70]]
Two of Alberti’s best known buildings are in Florence, the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] and at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. For the palace, Alberti applied the classical orders of columns to the façade on the three levels, 1446–51. At Santa Maria Novella he was commissioned to finish the decoration of the façade. He completed the design in 1456 but the work was not finished until 1470.

The lower section of the building had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large ocular window in the end of the nave which had to be taken into account. Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the [[Baptistery of Florence|Baptistery of San Giovanni]], the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the round window.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.&lt;ref name= Pevs&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Pelican, 1964, ISBN unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of the Renaissance in Italy==
[[File:748CertosaPaviaChiesa.JPG|thumb|The Church of the [[Certosa di Pavia]],  Lombardy]]
In the 15th century the courts of certain other Italian states became centres for spreading of Renaissance philosophy, art and architecture.

In [[Mantua]] at the court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], Alberti designed two churches, the [[Sant'Andrea, Mantua|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]] and [[San Sebastiano (Mantua)|San Sebastiano]].

[[Urbino]] was an important centre with the ancient [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino|ducal palace]] being extended for [[Federico da Montefeltro]] in the mid 15th century. The duke employed [[Luciano Laurana]] from [[Dalmatia]], renowned for his expertise at fortification. The design incorporates much of the earlier medieval building and includes an unusual turreted three-storeyed façade. Laurana was assisted by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. Later parts of the building are clearly Florentine in style, particularly the inner courtyard, but it is not known who the designer was.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/828 Historic Centre of Urbino]'', (retrieved 10-12-20123)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferrara]], under the [[House of Este|Este]], was expanded in the late fifteenth century, with several new palaces being built such as the [[Palazzo dei Diamanti]] and [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] for [[Borso d'Este]]. In Milan, under the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]], the [[Certosa di Pavia]] was completed, and then later under the [[Sforza]], the Castello Sforzesco was built.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Venezia - Ospedale - Foto G. Dall'Orto, 2 lug 2006 - 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scuola Grande di San Marco]], [[Venice]]]]

In Venice, [[San Zaccaria]] received its Renaissance façade at the hands of [[Antonio Gambello]] and [[Mauro Codussi]], begun in the 1480s.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Kaminski, ''Art and Architecture of Venice'', 1999, Könemann, {{ISBN|3-8290-2657-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Maria Falconetto]], the Veronese architect-sculptor, introduced Renaissance architecture to Padua with the Loggia Cornaro in the garden of [[Alvise Cornaro]].

In southern Italy, Renaissance masters were called to Naples by [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] after his conquest of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in that city are the [[Cappella Caracciolo]], attributed to Bramante, and the [[Palazzo Orsini di Gravina]], built by [[Gabriele d'Angelo]] between 1513 and 1549.

==High Renaissance==
[[File:Milan Santa Maria della Crazie Bramante.jpg|thumb|left|The crossing of Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan, Bramante (1490)]]
In the late 15th century and early 16th century, architects such as [[Bramante]], [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] and others showed a mastery of the revived style and ability to apply it to buildings such as churches and city palazzo which were quite different from the structures of ancient times. The style became more decorated and ornamental, statuary, domes and [[cupola]]s becoming very evident.
The architectural period is known as the "High Renaissance" and coincides with the age of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].

===Bramante===
[[Donato Bramante]], (1444–1514), was born in [[Urbino]] and turned from painting to architecture, finding his first important patronage under [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of Milan, for whom he produced a number of buildings over 20 years. After the fall of [[Milan]] to the French in 1499, Bramante travelled to Rome where he achieved great success under papal patronage.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Santa maria delle grazie altar.jpg|thumb|The apse of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan.]]
Bramante’s finest architectural achievement in Milan is his addition of crossing and choir to the abbey church of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)]]. This is a brick structure, the form of which owes much to the Northern Italian tradition of square domed [[Baptistery|baptisteries]]. The new building is almost centrally planned, except that, because of the site, the chancel extends further than the transept arms. The hemispherical dome, of approximately 20 metres across, rises up hidden inside an octagonal [[drum (architecture)|drum]] pierced at the upper level with arched classical openings. The whole exterior has delineated details decorated with the local [[terracotta]] ornamentation.

In Rome Bramante created what has been described as "a perfect architectural gem",&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; the [[Tempietto]] in the Cloister of [[San Pietro in Montorio]]. This small circular temple marks the spot where St Peter was martyred and is thus the most sacred site in Rome. The building adapts the style apparent in the remains of the [[Temple of Vesta]], the most sacred site of Ancient Rome. It is enclosed by and in spatial contrast with the cloister which surrounds it. As approached from the cloister, as in the picture above, it is seen framed by an arch and columns, the shape of which are echoed in its free-standing form.

Bramante went on to work at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] where he designed the impressive Cortili of St. Damaso and of the [[Cortile del Belvedere|Belvedere]]. In 1506 Bramante’s design for [[Pope Julius II]]’s rebuilding of [[St. Peter’s Basilica]] was selected, and the foundation stone laid. After Bramante’s death and many changes of plan, [[Michelangelo]], as chief architect, reverted to something closer to Bramante’s original proposal. &lt;sup&gt;See below- Michelangelo.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Palais Farnese.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Farnese]], [[Rome]] (1534–1545). Designed by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Sangallo]] and [[Michelangelo]].]]

===Sangallo===
[[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], (1485–1546), was one of a family of [[Military engineering|military engineers]]. His uncle, [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] was one of those who submitted a plan for the rebuilding of St Peter’s and was briefly a co-director of the project, with [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

Antonio da Sangallo also submitted a plan for St Peter’s and became the chief architect after the death of Raphael, to be succeeded himself by Michelangelo.

His fame does not rest upon his association with St Peter’s but in his building of the [[Farnese Palace]], “the grandest palace of this period”, started in 1530.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; The impression of grandness lies in part in its sheer size, (56&amp;nbsp;m long by 29.5 meters high) and in its lofty location overlooking a broad piazza. It is also a building of beautiful proportion, unusual for such a large and luxurious house of the date in having been built principally of stuccoed brick, rather than of stone. Against the smooth pink-washed walls the stone quoins of the corners, the massive rusticated portal and the stately repetition of finely detailed windows give a powerful effect, setting a new standard of elegance in palace-building. The upper of the three equally sized floors was added by Michelangelo. It is probably just as well that this impressive building is of brick; the travertine for its architectural details came not from a quarry, but from the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Pandolfini, view 02 crop.JPG|thumb|left|Palazzo Pandolfini, Florence, by Raphael]]

===Raphael===
[[Raphael]], (1483–1520), [[Urbino]], trained under [[Perugino]] in [[Perugia]] before moving to Florence, was for a time the chief architect for [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter’s]], working in conjunction with Antonio Sangallo. He also designed a number of buildings, most of which were finished by others. His single most influential work is the Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence with its two stories of strongly articulated windows of a "[[Aedicula|tabernacle]]" type, each set around with ordered pilasters, cornice and alternate arched and triangular pediments.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Mannerism==
{{main|Mannerism}}
'''Mannerism''' in architecture was marked by widely diverging tendencies in the work of [[Michelangelo]], [[Giulio Romano]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], that led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.
[[File:Palazzo Massimo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]].]]

===Peruzzi===
[[Baldassare Peruzzi]], (1481–1536), was an architect born in [[Siena]], but working in Rome, whose work bridges the High Renaissance and the Mannerist.
His [[Villa Farnesina]] of 1509 is a very regular monumental cube of two equal stories, the bays being strongly articulated by orders of pilasters. The building is unusual for its frescoed walls.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

Peruzzi’s most famous work is the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]] in Rome. The unusual features of this building are that its façade curves gently around a curving street. It has in its ground floor a dark central portico running parallel to the street, but as a semi enclosed space, rather than an open loggia. Above this rise three undifferentiated floors, the upper two with identical small horizontal windows in thin flat frames which contrast strangely with the deep porch, which has served, from the time of its construction, as a refuge to the city’s poor.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Te Mantova 1.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Te]], Mantua]]

===Giulio Romano===
[[Giulio Romano]] (1499–1546), was a pupil of Raphael, assisting him on various works for the Vatican. Romano was also a highly inventive designer, working for [[Frederick II, Duke of Mantua|Federico II Gonzaga]] at Mantua on the [[Palazzo Te]], (1524–1534), a project which combined his skills as architect, sculptor and painter. In this work, incorporating garden [[grotto]]es and extensive frescoes, he uses [[illusion|illusionistic effects]], surprising combinations of architectural form and texture, and the frequent use of features that seem somewhat disproportionate or out of alignment. The total effect is eerie and disturbing. Ilan Rachum cites Romano as ''“one of the first promoters of Mannerism”''.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] (1475–1564) was one of the creative giants whose achievements mark the High Renaissance. He excelled in each of the fields of painting, sculpture and architecture and his achievements brought about significant changes in each area. His architectural fame lies chiefly in two buildings: the interiors of the [[Laurentian Library]] and its lobby at the monastery of San Lorenzo in Florence, and [[St Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.

St Peter's was ''"the greatest creation of the Renaissance"'',&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; and a great number of architects contributed their skills to it. But at its completion, there was more of Michelangelo’s design than of any other architect, before or after him.

[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|St Peter's Basilica]]

====St Peter's====
The plan that was accepted at the laying of the foundation stone in 1506 was that by Bramante. Various changes in plan occurred in the series of architects that succeeded him, but Michelangelo, when he took over the project in 1546, reverted to Bramante’s Greek-cross plan and redesigned the piers, the walls and the dome, giving the lower weight-bearing members massive proportions and eliminating the encircling aisles from the chancel and identical transept arms. [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] says: "Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen, converted its snowflake complexity into a massive, cohesive unity."&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

Michelangelo’s dome was a masterpiece of design using two masonry shells, one within the other and crowned by a massive lantern supported, as at Florence, on ribs. For the exterior of the building he designed a giant order which defines every external bay, the whole lot being held together by a wide cornice which runs unbroken like a rippling ribbon around the entire building.

There is a wooden model of the dome, showing its outer shell as hemispherical. When Michelangelo died in 1564, the building had reached the height of the drum. The architect who succeeded Michelangelo was [[Giacomo della Porta]]. The dome, as built, has a much steeper projection than the dome of the model. It is generally presumed that it was della Porta who made this change to the design, to lessen the outward thrust. But, in fact it is unknown who it was that made this change, and it is equally possible and a stylistic likelihood that the person who decided upon the more dynamic outline was Michelangelo himself at some time during the years that he supervised the project.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner and Gardener suggest that Michelangelo began with the idea of a pointed dome, as in Florence, then in his old age reverted to the lower silhouette, and that della Porta stuck to Michelangelo's original concept. Mignacca, on the other hand, suggests that the pointed dome was Michelangelo's final, and brilliant, solution to the apparent visual tension within the building.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurentian Library vestibule.jpg|thumb|left|The vestibule of the Laurentian Library]]

====Laurentian Library====
Michelangelo was at his most Mannerist in the design of the vestibule of the [[Laurentian Library]], also built by him to house the [[Cosimo de' Medici|Medici]] collection of books at the convent of [[San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] in Florence, the same San Lorenzo’s at which [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] had recast church architecture into a Classical mold and established clear formula for the use of [[Classical orders]] and their various components.

Michelangelo takes all Brunelleschi’s components and bends them to his will. The Library is upstairs. It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, made all the more so because the rise of the stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.

The space is crowded and it is to be expected that the wall spaces would be divided by pilasters of low projection. But Michelangelo has chosen to use paired columns, which, instead of standing out boldly from the wall, he has sunk deep into recesses within the wall itself. In San Lorenzo's church nearby, Brunelleschi used little scrolling console brackets to break the strongly horizontal line of the course above the arcade. Michelangelo has borrowed Brunelleschi’s motifs and stood each pair of sunken columns on a pair of twin console [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] says the ''“Laurenziana... reveals Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form”''.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldscheider, ''Michelangelo'', 1964, Phaidon.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Church of the Gesù, Rome crop.jpg|thumb|left|Il Gesù, designed by Giacomo della Porta.]]

===Giacomo della Porta===
[[Giacomo della Porta]], (c.1533–1602), was famous as the architect who made the dome of St Peter’s Basilica a reality. The change in outline between the dome as it appears in the model and the dome as it was built, has brought about speculation as to whether the changes originated with della Porta or with Michelangelo himself.

Della Porta spent nearly all his working life in Rome, designing villas, palazzi and churches in the Mannerist style. One of his most famous works is the façade of the [[Church of the Gesù]], a project that he inherited from his teacher [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]]. Most characteristics of the original design are maintained, subtly transformed to give more weight to the central section, where della Porta uses, among other motifs, a low triangular pediment overlaid on a segmental one above the main door. The upper storey and its pediment give the impression of compressing the lower one. The center section, like that of Sant'Andrea at Mantua, is based on the Triumphal Arch, but has two clear horizontal divisions like [[Santa Maria Novella]]. &lt;sup&gt;See Alberti above.&lt;/sup&gt; The problem of linking the aisles to the nave is solved using Alberti’s scrolls, in contrast to Vignola’s solution which provided much smaller brackets and four statues to stand above the paired pilasters, visually weighing down the corners of the building. The influence of the design may be seen in Baroque churches throughout Europe.

===Andrea Palladio===
[[Andrea Palladio]], (1508–80), "the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance"',&lt;ref name= BF /&gt; was, as a stonemason, introduced to Humanism by the poet [[Giangiorgio Trissino]]. His first major architectural commission was the rebuilding of the [[Basilica Palladiana]] at [[Vicenza]], in the [[Veneto]] where he was to work most of his life.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:La Rotonda.png|thumb|[[Villa Capra La Rotonda]]]]
Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Arch of Constantine]] to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form. When he used the “[[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]]” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif&lt;ref&gt;described by the architectural writer [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) in ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetivaref''&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as the ''Palladian Arch''.

The best known of Palladio’s domestic buildings is [[Villa Capra]], otherwise known as "la Rotonda", a centrally planned house with a domed central hall and four identical façades, each with a temple-like portico like that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundram, Thomas Pape, Paolo Marton, ''Andrea Palladio'', Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-0271-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Villa Cornaro]], the projecting portico of the north façade and recessed loggia of the garden façade are of two [[Classical order|ordered]] stories, the upper forming a [[balcony]].&lt;ref&gt;Branco Mitrovic and Stephen R. Wassell, ''Andrea Palladio: Villa Cornaro in Piombino Dese'' (New York: Acanthus Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-926494-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Alberti, della Porta and others, in the designing of a church façade, Palladio was confronted by the problem of visually linking the aisles to the nave while maintaining and defining the structure of the building. Palladio’s solution was entirely different from that employed by della Porta. At the [[church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] in Venice he overlays a tall temple, its columns raised on high plinths, over another low wide temple façade, its columns rising from the basements and its narrow lintel and pilasters appearing behind the giant order of the central nave.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

==Progression from Early Renaissance through to Baroque==
[[File:1993-1994-Giardino Giusti (Verona)-testo e photo Paolo Villa-nA2-tesi Accademia Belle Arti Bologna-portone di Palazzo Giusti.jpg|thumb|[[Keystone (architecture)|Keystone]] with profile of man, [[Palazzo Giusti]], Verona, Italy]]
In Italy, there appears to be a seamless progression from Early Renaissance architecture through the High Renaissance and Mannerist to the Baroque style. Pevsner comments about the vestibule of the Laurentian Library that it "has often been said that the motifs of the walls show Michelangelo as the father of the Baroque".

While continuity may be the case in Italy, it was not necessarily the case elsewhere. The adoption of the Renaissance style of architecture was slower in some areas than in others, as may be seen in England, for example. Indeed, as [[Pope Julius II]] was having the ancient Basilica of St. Peter’s demolished to make way for the new, [[Henry VII of England]] was adding a glorious new chapel in the [[English Gothic architecture|Perpendicular Gothic]] style to [[Westminster Abbey]].

Likewise, the style that was to become known as Baroque evolved in Italy in the early 17th century, at about the time that the first fully Renaissance buildings were constructed at Greenwich and Whitehall in England,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] and the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]]&lt;/ref&gt; after a prolonged period of experimentation with Classical motifs applied to local architectural forms, or conversely, the adoption of Renaissance structural forms in the broadest sense with an absence of the formulae that governed their use. While the English were just discovering what the rules of Classicism were, the Italians were experimenting with methods of breaking them. In England, following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the Monarchy in 1660, the architectural climate changed, and taste moved in the direction of the Baroque. Rather than evolving, as it did in Italy, it arrived fully fledged.

In a similar way, in many parts of Europe that had few purely classical and ordered buildings like Brunelleschi’s Santo Spirito and Michelozzo’s Medici Riccardi Palace, Baroque architecture appeared almost unheralded, on the heels of a sort of Proto-Renaissance local style.&lt;ref name= Jan&gt;Janson, H.W., Anthony F. Janson (1997). ''History of Art'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.. {{ISBN|0-8109-3442-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the Baroque and its replacement of traditional and more conservative Renaissance architecture was particularly apparent in the building of churches as part of the [[Counter Reformation]].&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;

{{main|Northern Renaissance}}
The 16th century saw the economic and political ascendancy of France and Spain, and then later of Holland, England, Germany and Russia. The result was that these places began to import the Renaissance style as indicators of their new cultural position. This also meant that it was not until about 1500 and later that signs of Renaissance architectural style began to appear outside Italy.

Though Italian architects were highly sought after, such as [[Sebastiano Serlio]] in France, [[Aristotile Fioravanti]] in [[Russia]], and [[Francesco Fiorentino]] in [[Poland]], soon, non-Italians were studying Italian architecture and translating it into their own idiom. These included [[Philibert de l'Orme]] (1510–1570) in France, [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] (died: 1567) in Spain, [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652) in England and [[Elias Holl]] (1573–1646) in Germany.&lt;ref name= Jan /&gt;

Books or ornament prints with [[engraving|engraved]] illustrations demonstrating plans and ornament were very important in spreading Renaissance styles in Northern Europe, with among the most important authors being [[Androuet du Cerceau]] in France, and [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] in the Netherlands, and [[Wendel Dietterlin]], author of ''Architectura'' (1593–94) in Germany.

===Croatia===
[[File:St. Jacobuskathedraal ; Sibenik.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of St. James, Šibenik]]]]
{{main|Architecture of Croatia}}
In the 15th century, [[Croatia]] was divided into three states – the northern and central part of Croatia and [[Slavonia]] were in union with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], while [[Dalmatia]], with the exception of independent [[Dubrovnik]], was under the rule of the [[Venetian Republic]]. The [[Cathedral of St. James, Šibenik|Cathedral of St.James]] in [[Šibenik]], was begun in 1441 in the Gothic style by [[Giorgio da Sebenico]] ''(Juraj Dalmatinac)''. Its unusual construction does not use mortar, the stone blocks, [[pilaster]]s and [[ribs]] being bonded with [[joints]] and [[Groove (engineering)|slots]] in the way that was usual in wooden constructions. In 1477 the work was unfinished, and continued under [[Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino]] who respected the mode of construction and the plan of the former architect, but continued the work which includes the upper windows, the vaults and the dome, in the Renaissance style. The combination of a high barrel vault with lower half-barrel vaults over the aisles the gives the façade its distinctive [[trefoil]] shape, the first of this type in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506013344/http://www.sibenik.hr/vodic-eng/sibenik/kulturno_povijesna_bastina2.asp |archivedate=6 May 2009 |url=http://www.sibenik.hr/vodic-eng/sibenik/kulturno_povijesna_bastina2.asp |title=St James’s Cathedral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in 2001.

{{main|Renaissance architecture in Central Europe}}

One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The style appeared following the marriage of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and [[masonry|masons]] arrived at [[Buda]] with the new queen. Important remains of the Early Renaissance summer palace of King Matthias can be found in [[Visegrád]]. The Ottoman conquest of Hungary after 1526 cut short the development of Renaissance architecture in the country and destroyed its most famous examples. Today, the only completely preserved work of Hungarian Renaissance architecture is the Bakócz Chapel (commissioned by the Hungarian cardinal [[Tamás Bakócz]]), now part of the [[Esztergom Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hung-art.hu/kep/zmisc/faragvan/162_sz/bakocz01.jpg Image of Bakócz Chapel] (1506–08)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Russian architecture|Renaissance architecture in Eastern Europe}}
Prince [[Ivan III]] introduced Renaissance architecture to [[Russia]] by inviting a number of architects from [[Italy]], who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of the [[Russian architecture]]. In 1475 the Bolognese architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] came to rebuild the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Vladimir Cathedral]] as a model, and produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

In 1485 Ivan III commissioned the building of a royal [[Terem Palace]] within the Kremlin, with [[Aloisio da Milano]] being the architect of the first three floors. Aloisio da Milano, as well as the other Italian architects, also greatly contributed to the construction of the [[Kremlin wall]]s [[Kremlin towers|and towers]]. The small banqueting hall of the [[Russian Tsar]]s, called the [[Palace of Facets]] because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, [[Marco Ruffo]] and [[Pietro Solario]], and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as [[Aleviz Novyi]] built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]], a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style.

===Poland===
{{main|Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance architecture in Central Europe|Mannerist architecture and sculpture in Poland}}
[[Polish Renaissance]] architecture is divided into three periods:
The First period (1500–50), is the so-called "Italian". Most of Renaissance buildings were building of this time were by Italian architects, mainly from [[Florence]] including [[Francesco Fiorentino]] and [[Bartolomeo Berrecci]] ([[Wawel]] Courtyard, [[Sigismund's Chapel]]).

In the Second period (1550–1600), Renaissance architecture became more common, with the beginnings of [[Mannerist]] and under the influence of the Netherlands, particularly in [[Pomerania]]. Buildings include the New [[Sukiennice|Cloth Hall]] in Kraków and city halls in [[Tarnów]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Chełm]] (demolished) and most famously in [[Poznań]].

In the Third period (1600–50), the rising power of [[Jesuits]] and [[Counter Reformation]] gave impetus to the development of Mannerist architecture and Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Busch, Bernd Lohse, Hans Weigert, ''Baukunst der Renaissance in Europa.

===Crown of Bohemia===
{{main|Czech Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Letohrádek královny Anny by Crazyspeak (2).jpg|thumb|right|Royal Summer Palace in Prague considered the purest Renaissance architecture outside Italy&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite book|title=Prague : City Guidebook|date=2000|publisher=Kartografie|location=Prague|isbn=80-7011-597-1|page=40|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Renaissance style first appeared in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]] in the 1490s. Bohemia together with its incorporated lands, especially Moravia, thus ranked among the areas of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with the earliest known examples of the Renaissance architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamlin|first1=Alfred D.|title=History of architecture|date=2010|publisher=Salzwasser-Verlag|location=Bremen|isbn=9783861952503|page=338|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=g89phgpRZOEC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lands of the Bohemian Crown were never part of the ancient [[Roman Empire]], thus they missed their own ancient classical heritage and had to be dependent on the primarily Italian models. As well as in other Central European countries the Gothic style kept its position especially in the church architecture. The traditional [[Gothic architecture]] was considered timeless and therefore able to express the sacredness. The Renaissance architecture coexisted with the Gothic style in Bohemia and Moravia until the late 16th century (e. g. the residential part of a palace was built in the modern Renaissance style but its chapel was designed with Gothic elements). The façades of Czech Renaissance buildings were often decorated with [[sgraffito]] (figural or ornamental).

During the reign of Holy Roman Emperor and Bohemian King [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], the city of Prague became one of the most important European centers of the late Renaissance art (so-called [[Northern Mannerism|Mannerism]]). Nevertheless, not many architecturally significant buildings have been preserved from that time.

===France===
[[File:Chambord-wide-2004.jpg|thumb|French Renaissance: [[Château de Chambord]] (1519–39)]]
{{main|French Renaissance architecture}}
During the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in northern Italy, bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war [[Looting|booty]], but also stylistic ideas. In the [[Loire Valley]] a wave of building was carried and many Renaissance châteaux appeared at this time, the earliest example being the [[Château d'Amboise]] (c. 1495) in which [[Leonardo da Vinci]] spent his last years. The style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (See [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]).&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

[[File:Antwerp town hall, 25 april 2007 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antwerp City Hall]] (finished in 1564)]]

===Netherlands/Flanders===
{{main|Renaissance in the Netherlands}}
As in painting, Renaissance architecture took some time to reach the Netherlands and did not entirely supplant the Gothic elements. An architect directly influenced by the Italian masters was [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt]], who designed the [[Antwerp City Hall|city hall of Antwerpen]], finished in 1564. The style sometimes known as "Antwerp Mannerism", keeping a similar overall structure to late-Gothic buildings, but with larger windows and much florid decoration and detailing in Renaissance styles, was widely influential across Northern Europe, for example in [[Elizabethan architecture]], and is part of the wider movement of [[Northern Mannerism]].

In the early 17th century [[Dutch Republic]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]] played an important role in developing the '''Amsterdam Renaissance''' style, which has local characteristics including the prevalence of tall narrow town-houses, the "trapgevel" or [[Crow-stepped gable|Dutch gable]] and the employment of decorative triangular pediments over doors and windows in which the apex rises much more steeply than in most other Renaissance architecture, but in keeping with the profile of the gable. Carved stone details are often of low profile, in [[strapwork]] resembling leatherwork, a stylistic feature originating in the [[School of Fontainebleau]]. This feature was exported to England.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:Juleum Helmstedt.jpg|thumb|[[University of Helmstedt|Juleum]] in [[Helmstedt]], Germany (example of [[Weser Renaissance]])]]
{{main|German Renaissance}}
The Renaissance in Germany was inspired first by German philosophers and artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]] who visited Italy. Important early examples of this period are especially the [[Landshut Residence]], the [[Heidelberg Castle|Castle]] in [[Heidelberg]], [[Schloss Johannisburg|Johannisburg Palace]] in [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Schloss Weilburg]], the [[Augsburg Town Hall|City Hall]] and [[Fuggerhäuser|Fugger Houses]] in [[Augsburg]] and [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|St. Michael]] in [[Munich]]. A particular form of Renaissance architecture in Germany is the [[Weser Renaissance]], with prominent examples such as the [[Town Hall of Bremen|City Hall]] of [[Bremen]] and the [[University of Helmstedt|Juleum]] in [[Helmstedt]].

In July 1567 the city council of [[Cologne]] approved a design in the Renaissance style by Wilhelm Vernukken for a two storied loggia for [[Cologne City Hall]]. [[Michaelskirche (München)|St Michael]] in [[Munich]] is the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. It was built by [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke William V]] of [[Bavaria]] between 1583 and 1597 as a spiritual center for the [[Counter Reformation]] and was inspired by the Church of [[il Gesù]] in Rome. The architect is unknown.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt; Many examples of [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance buildings]] can be found in [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] old towns, such as [[Stralsund]], [[Wismar]], [[Lübeck]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Friedrichstadt]] and [[Stade]].

{{main|Elizabethan architecture|Palladian architecture}}
Renaissance architecture arrived in England during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], having first spread through the [[Low countries]] where among other features it acquired versions of the [[Crow-stepped gable|Dutch gable]], and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[strapwork]] in geometric designs adorning the walls. The new style tended to manifest itself in large square tall houses such as [[Longleat House]].

The first great exponent of Italian Renaissance architecture in England was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of Palladio was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at [[Greenwich]] in 1616 and the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works, with their clean lines, and symmetry were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Summerson, ''Architecture in Britain 1530–1830'', 1977 ed., Pelican, {{ISBN|0-14-056003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ventana2.jpg|thumb|[[El Escorial|The Escorial]] (1563–1584), [[Madrid]].]]
In Spain, Renaissance began to be grafted to Gothic forms in the last decades of the 15th century. The new style is called [[Plateresque]], because of the extremely decorated façade, that brought to the mind the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of [[silversmith]]s, the ''Plateros''. Classical orders and candelabra motifs (''a candelieri'') combined freely into symmetrical wholes.

From the mid-sixteenth century, under such architects as Pedro Machuca, [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] and [[Juan de Herrera]] there was a closer adherence to the art of ancient Rome, sometimes anticipating [[Mannerism]], examples of which include the [[palace of Charles V]] in [[Granada]] and the [[Escorial]].&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

{{main|Renaissance architecture in Portugal|Portuguese Renaissance}}
As in Spain, the adoption of the Renaissance style in Portugal was gradual. The so-called [[Manueline]] style (c. 1490–1535) married Renaissance elements to Gothic structures with the superficial application of exuberant ornament similar to the [[Isabelline Gothic]] of Spain. Examples of Manueline include the [[Belém Tower]], a defensive building of Gothic form decorated with Renaissance-style [[loggia]]s, and the [[Jerónimos Monastery]], with Renaissance ornaments decorating portals, columns and cloisters.

The first "pure" Renaissance structures appear under [[John III of Portugal|King John III]], like the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Tomar (1532–40), the ''Porta Especiosa'' of [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra Cathedral]] and the Graça Church at [[Évora]] (c. 1530–1540), as well as the cloisters of the Cathedral of [[Viseu]] (c. 1528–1534) and [[Convent of Christ]] in Tomar (John III Cloisters, 1557–1591). The [[Lisbon]] buildings of [[Igreja de São Roque (Lisbon)|São Roque Church]] (1565–87) and the Mannerist [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora]] (1582–1629), strongly influenced religious architecture in both Portugal and its colonies in the next centuries.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Frederiksborg Castle and boat crop.jpg|thumb|left|Nordic Renaissance: [[Frederiksborg Palace]] (1602–20)]]

===Scandinavia===
{{main|Architecture of Denmark|Architecture}}
The Renaissance architecture that found its way to Scandinavia was influenced by the Flemish architecture, and included high gables and a castle air as demonstrated in the architecture of Frederiksborg Palace. Consequently, much of the Neo-Renaissance to be found in the Scandinavian countries is derived from this source.

In Denmark, Renaissance architecture thrived during the reigns of [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] and especially [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]. Inspired by the French castles of the times, Flemish architects designed masterpieces such as Kronborg Castle in Helsingør and Frederiksborg Palace in Hillerød. Frederiksborg Palace (1602–1620) in Hillerod is the largest Renaissance palace in Scandinavia.

Elsewhere, in Sweden, with [[Gustav Vasa]]'s seizure of power and the onset of the Protestant reformation, church construction and aristocratic building projects came to a near standstill. During this time period, several magnificent so-called Vasa castles appeared. They were erected at strategic locations to control the country as well as to accommodate the travelling royal court. [[Gripsholm Castle]], [[Kalmar Castle]] and [[Vadstena Castle]] are known for their fusion of medieval elements with Renaissance architecture.

The architecture of [[Norway]] was influenced partly by the occurrence of the plague during the Renaissance era. After the Black Death, monumental construction in Norway came to a standstill. There are few examples of Renaissance architecture in Norway, the most prominent being renovations to the medieval [[Rosenkrantz Tower]] in Bergen, [[Barony Rosendal]] in Hardanger, and the contemporary [[Austrått|Austrat manor]] near Trondheim, and parts of [[Akershus Fortress]].

There is little evidence of Renaissance influence in Finnish architecture.

===Baltic States===
[[File:House of Blackheads - Riga.jpg|thumb|right|The [[House of the Blackheads]] in [[Riga]], Latvia]]
{{main|Renaissance in Poland|Architecture of Estonia}}
The Renaissance arrived late in what is today [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], the so-called [[Baltic States]], and did not make a great imprint architecturally. It was a politically tumultuous time, marked by the decline of the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] and the [[Livonian War]].

In Estonia, artistic influences came from Dutch, Swedish and Polish sources.&lt;ref name=toivo&gt;{{cite book |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810865716 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of the [[House of the Blackheads (Tallinn)|Brotherhood of the Blackheads in Tallinn]] with a façade designed by [[Arent Passer]], is the only truly Renaissance building in the country that has survived more or less intact.&lt;ref name= "Viirand"&gt;{{cite book | last = Viirand| first = Tiiu| authorlink = | title = Estonia.

Latvian Renaissance architecture was influenced by Polish-Lithuanian and Dutch style, with [[Mannerism]] following from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] without intermediaries. [[St. John's Church, Riga|St. John's Church]] in the Latvian capital of [[Riga]] is example of an earlier Gothic church which was reconstructed in 1587–89 by the Dutch architect Gert Freze (Joris Phraeze). The prime example of Renaissance architecture in Latvia is the heavily decorated [[House of the Blackheads]], rebuilt from an earlier Medieval structure into its present Mannerist forms as late as 1619–25 by the architects A. and L. Jansen. It was destroyed during World War II and rebuilt during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=2|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania meanwhile formed one half of the large Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. Renaissance influences grew stronger during the reign of the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] [[Sigismund I the Old]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]]. The [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] (destroyed in 1801, a copy built in 2002–2009) show Italian influences. Several architects of Italian origin were active in the country, including [[Bernardino Zanobi de Gianotis]], [[Giovanni Cini]] and [[Giovanni Maria Mosca]].&lt;ref name="grove2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=2|pages=486–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Renaissance Revival architecture}}
[[File:Cathédrale Marie-Reine du Monde, intérieur.jpg|thumb|[[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]], [[Montreal]] (19th century)]]
During the 19th century there was a conscious revival of the style in [[Renaissance Revival architecture]], that paralleled the [[Gothic Revival]]. Whereas the Gothic style was perceived by architectural theorists&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ruskin]]&lt;br&gt;[[Cambridge Camden Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; as being the most appropriate style for Church building, the Renaissance palazzo was a good model for urban secular buildings requiring an appearance of dignity and reliability such as banks, gentlemen's clubs and apartment blocks.&lt;ref&gt;An influential example, The [[Reform Club]] in London (1841) by [[Charles Barry]] was closely inspired by the [[Palazzo Farnese]], discussed above [http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/england/london/barry/reform.html Photos and commentary]&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings that sought to impress, such as the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], were often of a more Mannerist or Baroque style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]&lt;/ref&gt; Architects of factories, office blocks and department stores continued to use the Renaissance palazzo form into the 20th century, in [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture]] with an Italian Renaissance emphasis.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Sullivan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the concepts and forms of Renaissance architecture can be traced through subsequent architectural movements—from Renaissance to High-Renaissance, to Mannerism, to Baroque (or [[Rococo]]), to [[Neo-Classicism]], and to [[Eclecticism]].  While Renaissance style and motifs were largely purged from [[Modernism]], they have been reasserted in some [[Postmodern architecture]]. The influence of Renaissance architecture can still be seen in many of the modern styles and rules of architecture today.

The '''Saint Louis Science Center''', founded as a planetarium in 1963, is a collection of buildings including a [[science museum]] and [[planetarium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on the southeastern corner of [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]]. With over 750 exhibits in a complex of over {{convert|300000|sqft|sqm}}, it is among the largest of its type in the United States.&lt;ref name=scala&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Park, Saint Louis|author=Craske, Oliver|author2=Peacock, Sarah|author3=Shoolbred, Andrew|publisher=Scala Publishers|isbn=978-1-85759-340-2|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:McDonnellPlanetarium.jpg|thumb|320px|The James S. McDonnell Planetarium, built in 1963 and featuring a [[thin-shell structure|thin-shell]] and [[hyperboloid structure]] by [[Gyo Obata]]. This building is one of the most distinctive components of the Saint Louis Science Center campus]]
Funding for the first structure of the current campus began in 1955, with $1 million of a $110 million city bond issue specified for the construction of a planetarium. Two years were spent surveying locations. The first proposed site, on the northern side of Forest Park near the [[Missouri History Museum|Jefferson Memorial Building]] at Lindell and DeBaliviere, was scrapped because of restrictions on subdivisions. The location was changed to the southern part of the park, on the site of the old [[mounted police]] station, which was demolished in 1960. The plan was to build a planetarium, science museum, and natural history museum.&lt;ref name=fp/&gt;

The Planetarium was designed by [[Gyo Obata]] of [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]] with a unique shape (Obata was later tasked in the 1970s with designing the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]). ''[[Architectural Forum]]'' magazine described it as, "Looking like some strange craft spun down to earth from outer space... St. Louis's new planetarium perches gracefully on a rise in ... Forest Park".&lt;ref name=fp/&gt; [[James Smith McDonnell]] (1899&amp;ndash;1980), an aviation pioneer and co-founder of St. Louis-based [[McDonnell Douglas]], an [[aerospace manufacturer]], donated $200,000 for equipment such as the star projector. The facility was named after him in 1964.&lt;ref name=fp&gt;{{cite book|date=1986|isbn=0-9638298-0-7|author=Loughlin, Caroline|author2=Anderson, Catherine|title=Forest Park|publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]|location=[[Columbia, Missouri]]|page=207&amp;ndash;209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 1978, the Planetarium reopened as the Saint Louis Science Center.&lt;ref name=jewel/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} On November 2, 1991, as part of a $34 million expansion, a new building opened across from the Planetarium south of I-64, on Oakland Avenue, increasing the size of the Science Center by a factor of seven. The new building was constructed on land that had previously been the site of the [[Falstaff Brewing Corporation]] headquarters.&lt;ref name=jewel/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} New exhibits in the main building were devoted to [[Earth science]], [[emerging technology]], [[life sciences]], [[physical science]], and [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name=jewel&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jewel of St. Louis: Forest Park|last=Altman |first=Sally |author2=Weiss, Richard |date=2007|isbn=978-0-9796054-1-3|publisher=Walsworth Publishing Co.|location=[[Marceline, Missouri]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite book|title=Bringing Science to Life: A Guide from the Saint Louis Science Center|date=2007|author=Corrigan, Patricia|isbn=978-1-933370-16-3|publisher=Virginia Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Within two months, the newly remodeled Saint Louis Science Center became the most visited science center in the world.&lt;ref name=jewel/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

On February 8, 1997, an air-supported building was added to the main building, the Exploradome. With an additional {{convert|18000|sqft|sqm}}, it was intended as a temporary facility for traveling exhibitions, additional classrooms, and to host large group events.

The '''Science.ie''' portal provides all sorts of information about careers in [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]] (STEM).

== Overview ==

Science.ie is an initiative of the Irish Government’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme in [[Ireland]].  DSE is managed by [[Forfás]] on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]].

The careers-related information on Science.ie has been moved to a new DSE website - [http://www.mysciencecareer.ie My Science Career] - which was launched in early October 2009. On MyScienceCareer.ie is:

*Profiles of people currently working in STEM in [[Ireland]] 
*Information on famous Irish scientists 
*Links to many other career resources

A redeveloped Science.ie was also launched in October 2009. The site has been redesigned and includes social media bookmarking and RSS feeds.

Science.ie provides more general information on science in [[Ireland]]. This includes listings of science links, news and events. Its "Resources" section gives information on activities and visitor centres where you can learn about [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/education/2000/1212/00121200185.html Received "Site of the Week" from The Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/going-to-college-75789.html Science.ie featured in the Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also provides a free newsletter relating to Irish science, technology and innovation news, events, research and facts which is issued monthly by email.

In November 2009 Science.ie launched a Twitter channel. [https://twitter.com/irelandscience Follow Science.ie on Twitter.]

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[My Science Career]], [[Project Blogger]], [[Science Week Ireland]] and [[Discover Primary Science]].

'''Science North''' ({{lang-fr|Science Nord}}) is an interactive [[science museum]] in [[Greater Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

The science centre, which is [[Northern Ontario]]'s most popular tourist attraction, consists of two [[snowflake]]-shaped buildings on the southwestern shore of [[Ramsey Lake]], just south of the city's downtown core, and a former [[ice hockey]] arena which includes the complex's entrance and an [[IMAX]] theatre. The snowflake buildings are connected by a rock tunnel, which passes through a billion-year-old [[geologic fault]]. This fault line was not known to be under the complex during the construction of the building in the early 1980s. Where the walkway reaches the larger snowflake, the Vale Cavern [[auditorium]] is frequently used for temporary exhibits, [[press conference]]s, and other gala events by Science North and the wider community.

Inside the main building, a 20-metre [[fin whale]] skeleton recovered from [[Anticosti Island]] hangs from the ceiling.

The complex also features a boat tour, the ''William Ramsey'', which offers touring cruises of the scenic Ramsey Lake. The [[Jim Gordon (politician)|Jim Gordon]] [[Boardwalk]] also extends from the facility to the city's [[Bell Park (Sudbury)|Bell Park]] along the western shore of the lake.

The facility was designed by architect [[Raymond Moriyama]], one of the founding partners of Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects, based in Toronto.

An agency of the provincial government of Ontario, Science North is overseen by the provincial [[Ministry of Culture (Ontario)|Ministry of Culture]].

* '''IMAX With Laser''' - Science North has a 3D [[IMAX with Laser]] theatre. The theatre opened in 1994, and was converted to 3D in February 2009.
* '''Planetarium''' - In June 2009 Science North added a planetarium. It has an 8-metre dome and 36 seats.
* '''Vale Cavern''' - Wildfires! A Firefighting Adventure in 3D
* '''TD Canada Trust Toddler's Treehouse''' - a children's educational play area

===Second level===

* '''[[Nature Exchange]]''' - visitors collect and research natural items from the wild and are swapped for points in a database. The points can be used to "purchase" other natural artifacts from around the world (i.e.: Rocks, sea shells, fossils, etc.)
* '''Lapidary Lab''' - Visitors learn how to cut, grind and polish rocks to turn them from ordinary stones into works of art.
* '''F. Jean MacLeod Butterfly Gallery''' - A glass-enclosed [[butterfly house]] home to more than 400 butterflies from 30 different tropical species.

===Third level===

The exhibits on the third floor are divided into four main areas:
* '''Northern Forests''' - This area focuses on animals who live in northern forests. Some of the animals ambassadors for the Northern Forest include Drifter and Kashkuanashku (Kash) the beavers, Maple the porcupine and Saunders the skunk. Other notable animals include the Northern Flying Squirrels, the Grey Rat Snake and the Big Brown bats. One of the biggest improvements to the third floor include a nocturnal room, allowing people to see active nocturnal animals during the day  and better equipment habitats for the animals and for visitors. Also, there is an intricate [[bee]] hive, behind a plate glass window, which allows visitors to see into the hive. 

* '''Lakes and Rivers''' - In this area, animals that live in rivers and lakes are featured. The animals ambassadors on this floor include Kash the Beaver, the Common Snapping Turtle, the Northern Water Snakes and local fish found in Northern Ontario Lakes. This sections allow people to get a better understanding of the aquatics systems that surround Northern Ontario and the difficulties and challenges these systems are currently facing. As well, the stream table (also known as the sand table) shows people what is erosion and how erosion can shape the landscape around us.
* '''Wetlands'''  - The wetlands area teaches about the complex wetlands ecosystems. With Lilly creek situated right beside Science North, people are able to go on Lilly Creek tours (weather permitting) and get a personal look of what makes wetland such an important landmass for our ecosystems. Some of the animal ambassadors include Northern Ontario frogs (including Green Frogs, Wood Frogs, Tree Frogs and Bullfrogs), American Toads, The Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake and the [[painted turtle]]. This section also houses the SO2 monitor, which measures the sulphur dioxide levels in Sudbury. There is also an interactive computer that displays the current reading of other sulphur dioxide monitors located throughout the Greater Sudbury region.
* '''Discovery Theatre''' - The discovery theatre is located in the centre of the third and fourth levels of Science North. Here, live science shows cover topics ranging from fire to sound. A daily schedule, located in front of the theatre and on the LCD screens around the Science Centre, is kept up to date and people can schedule their day around the shows they want to see. Usually, upbeat music will be played two minutes before the show starts to allow people to know the show is about to begin. Wheelchair accessibly is offered on the first, and third level of the discovery theater.
* '''The Northern Garden''' - The Northern Garden is located outside of the science centre. This gives people the opportunity to learn about native plant species in Northern Ontario, plant growth and general garden maintenance.

===Fourth level===
* '''BodyZone''' - BodyZone teaches about DNA and how it makes people unique, and how bodies work. There are also many exhibits allowing visitors to measure their performance, such as the race track. The Club Genome object theatre entrance is also in BodyZone.
* '''Racetrack''' - Build a race car and run it on the figure 8 track. This area also features a [[K'Nex]] table, a [[Lego]] play area, and the ball wall.
* '''[[FedNor]] CyberZone''' - The focus of CyberZone is on computer and communications technology. Visitors can mix music at the DJ station, play with green screen technology, and create stop-motion animation movies.
* '''Space Place''' - This lab focuses on astronomy and space exploration. Exhibits include a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} gravity well, a microgravity drop tower, exhibits on [[SNOLAB]], and information on Canadian space exploration. The entrance to the "Between the Stars" object theatre is also found in Space Place. This show explores the topic of dark matter - why we know it exists, and how we are trying to detect it. Between the Stars opened in June 2010 and is designed to appeal to all age ranges with a cartoon character named String Man narrating the story of a topic that is quite complex.
*''' TechLab''' - Technology and engineering area where visitors can create circuits, take apart old electronics, and play with pulleys and gears.

===Object theatres===

Special film and video exhibits which change over time; current exhibits include
* '''The [[Global warming]] Changing Climate Show''' -- narrated by [[Rick Mercer]] and talks about the change in climate. This show was updated and reopened in March 2011.
* '''Club Genome''' -- talks about DNA
* '''Legends of the Great Lakes''' -- This 16-minute show focuses on the bald eagle, the sturgeon, and the woodland caribou. The information is presented as a story that a father tells his daughter before they go to sleep while camping on the shores of Lake Superior.
* '''Between the Stars''' -- This show is on the science of dark matter. It lasts 16 minutes and features holographic technology, creating a 3-D effect. The main themes on the show are an exploration of the evidence for dark matter, what it might be, and how scientists are trying to detect it at [[SNOLAB]].
* ''' Ready, Set, Move!''' -- This fully immersive, active and interactive theatre will take you on a journey into the world of healthy living. Movement-sensing technology allows your own activity to contribute to the story. You will jump, dodge, twist and play throughout the show, your actions helping our heroine Anna and her quest to save her family from an ominous, dark fog.


===Outdoor grounds===

* '''Polaris Boulevard''' - is a line which reaches from a large sundial right up the side of the building which points directly at Polaris (the north star).
* '''Terra''' - Visited stand on this one-millionth scale world model, outdoors near Science North’s main entrance. At sunset and sunrise, the Earth's shadow moves across Canada. The benchmark at the centre of Terra is:  46° 28' 12.00" N and 80° 59' 45.70" W.
*''' a sculpture''' honouring local [[bush plane]] pilot [[Rusty Blakey]].
* '''Lily Creek''' - a marsh located opposite to the centre, Lily Creek is home to many species of creatures.
* '''The Northern Forest''' - This outdoor exhibit features many of the tree species grown in northern Ontario that Domtar relies on for its sawmills and for the manufacture of pulp and paper at the Espanola mill.

'''Sexual repression''' is a state in which a person is prevented from expressing their own [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Sexual repression is often associated with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[shame]], being associated with sexual impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. McClintock, ''Sexual Shame: An Urgent Call to Healing'', Fortress Press, Minneapolis, MN. ({{ISBN|0800632389}}) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; What constitutes sexual repression is subjective and can vary greatly between cultures and moral systems. Many [[Religion and sexuality|religions]]{{which|date=November 2018}} have been accused of fostering sexual repression{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

Some ideologies{{which|date=November 2018}} seek to repress certain forms of sexual expression, such as [[homosexuality]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}, and some cultures{{which|date=November 2018}} even use [[violence|violent practices]] such as [[genital modification and mutilation]], [[honor killings]], or [[stoning]], in an attempt to regulate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]].

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] was the first to use the term widely, and argued that it was one of the roots of many problems in [[Western world|Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilf Hey. [http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 "Sigmund Freud: Psychoanalysis and Sexual Repression"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033909/http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 |date=2008-05-18 }}, vision.org&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed that people's naturally strong instincts toward sexuality were repressed by people in order to meet the constraints imposed on them by civilized life. However, Freud's ideas about sexual repression have not been without their critics. According to sex therapist Bernard Apfelbaum, Freud did not base his belief in universal innate, natural sexuality on the strength of sexual desire he saw in people, but rather on its weakness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bapfelbaumphd.com/Sexual_Reality.html B. Apfelbaum. "Sexual Reality and How We Dismiss It."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704081455/http://www.bapfelbaumphd.com/Sexual_Reality.html |date=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods of Indian history [[anaphrodisiac]]s were utilised in order to lower libidos.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBVNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q="anaphrodisiac"++repression&amp;dq="anaphrodisiac"++repression&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1_bPRrdLUAhXsLcAKHXCoCY0Q6AEILTAD&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of Islam have strict sexual codes which include banning homosexuality, demanding virginity before marriage accompanied by a ban on fornication, and can require modest dress-codes for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=csX0f7AVM3gC&amp;pg=PA722 Sex and Society] Volume 3 - Page 722&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
{{Further|Child marriage}}
Marriage has been seen as a means of controlling sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/1885/&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of marriage, such as [[child marriage]], are often practiced as a means of regulating the sexuality of girls, by ensuring they do not have several partners, thus preserving their [[virginity]] for the future husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dayofthegirl.org/child-marriage/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531090804/http://dayofthegirl.org/child-marriage/ |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[BBC World Service]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml|title=Article 16: Right to marriage and family and to equal rights of men and women during and after marriage|publisher=[[BBC World Service]]|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In some cases, parents willingly marry off their young girls in order to increase the family income or protect the girl from the risk of unwanted sexual advances or even [[promiscuity]].}}

==Female genital mutilation==
[[File:Fgm_map.gif|200px|thumb|Prevalence of FGM in Africa]]
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting or female circumcision, "comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice is concentrated in 27 countries in Africa as well as Iraqi Kurdistan, Yemen and Indonesia; and more than 125 million girls and women today are estimated to have been subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM does not have any health benefits, and has serious negative effects on health; including complications during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM is used as a way of controlling [[female sexuality]]; the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

{{quote|FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital [[virginity]] and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist "illicit" sexual acts.}}

FGM is condemned by international human rights instruments. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is also considered a form a [[violence against women]] by the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1993; according to which: ''Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [...] '''female genital mutilation''' [...]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male circumcision==
{{Main|Circumcision}}
[[File:Global Map of Male Circumcision Prevalence by Country.svg|thumb|300px|Male circumcision [[prevalence]] by country according to a World Health Organization's 2007 review.&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA&gt;{{cite web |title=Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Male circumcision has been practiced as a surgical means of sexual repression in some cultures, although it may be practiced for various reasons, with the World Health Organization recommending it as a means of reducing [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Circumcision is also a religious tradition in Judaism and Islam. According to medieval Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides, the "reason" for male circumcision is "the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/maimonides/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late-nineteenth century, circumcision of the penis was prescribed by John Harvey Kellogg as a "cure" for masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19924/19924-h/19924-h.htm#chapi133&lt;/ref&gt; William Acton, a leading authority on sexuality in mid-Victorian Britain, advocated male circumcision in order to prevent "undue excitement of the sexual desires … which it is our object to repress."&lt;ref&gt;Willliam Acton. The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and Advanced Life, Considered in their Physiological, Social, and Moral Relations. Third Edition. London: Churchill, 1862, pp. 5–6. https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cVX7PaDkzGYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

A "biocultural analysis" of male circumcision supports the hypothesis "that a practical consequence of circumcision, complementary to any religious-symbolic function, is to make a circumcised male less sexually excitable and distractible, and, hence, more amenable to his group's authority figures."&lt;ref&gt;Immerman, Ronald S. &amp; Wade C. Mackey (1997) "A biocultural analysis of circumcision." Social Biology 44: 3–4, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor killings==
{{Main|Honor killing}}
An honor killing is the [[homicide]] of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the perpetrators' belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family or community, usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, having [[sex outside marriage]], becoming the victim of [[rape]], dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/honor+killing?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/13/world/europe/turkey-gay-killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/23/arizona.iraqi.father/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to a UN Expert Group Meeting on good practices in legislation to address harmful practices against women:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Sherifa%20Zuhur%20-%20II_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They [honor killings] stem from the deeply-rooted social belief that male family members (in some cases, mothers and other women are involved in planning or carrying out honor crimes) should control the sexuality of or protect the reputation of women in the family, and that they may contain their movements or kill them for blemishing family honor, even when rumors or false gossip are the reason for public suspicion.}}

==Same-sex sexual activity==
{{Further|Sodomy law}}
Various cultures attempt to repress homosexual sexual expression. As of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by prison in 70 countries, and in five other countries and in parts of two others, homosexuality is punishable with the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from criminal prosecution, LGBT individuals may also face social stigmatization and serious violence (see [[violence against LGBT people]]).

==Studies==
Some researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} have hypothesized a relationship between sexual repression and [[rape]]. However, they have been unable to find any support for this hypothesis - whether the tremendous difficulty of measuring sexual repression is to blame, or whether the theory is simply false, is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA93 Mary E. Odem, Jody Clay-Warner, ''Confronting rape and sexual assault'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 104.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual repression is often viewed as a key issue within [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[feminist views on sexuality]] vary widely.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', neither refutes nor confirms what he calls the "repressive hypothesis." Instead, he says sexuality has become an important topic to understand and manipulate for the purpose of nation building. Through categorization of sexuality, the idea of repression was born. While he agrees sexuality has become much more controlled, he equates it to necessity. Furthermore, it is through [[psychiatric]] and medical discourse on sexuality that it has become repressed.

Foucault argues that religious confession as well as psychiatric procedure codify confession within as a means of extracting [[truth]]. Because the mechanisms of sex were obscure, it was elusive by nature and its mechanisms escaped observation. By integrating it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth century altered the scope of confession. Confession tended no longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished to hide but with what was hidden from himself. It had to be extracted by force, since it involved something that tried to stay hidden. This relationship of truth scientifically validated the view of the confessed which could assimilate, record, and verify this obscure truth.&lt;ref name="Foucault1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Foucault|title=The history of sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mbc5eMjLpoC|accessdate=5 January 2013|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-72469-8|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repression in various countries==
{{Incomplete section|date=May 2017}}
Many countries{{which|date=November 2018}} have developed a much more liberal attitude{{cn|date=November 2018}} towards sexuality, but in some{{which|date=November 2018}} it has become less so{{cn|date=November 2018}}:

===China===
Reproduction-based sex was urged by [[Mao Zedong]], but later politicians instituted a [[one-child policy]]. In a country where atheism is popular, the restriction cannot be ascribed to religion but to nationalist motives.&lt;ref name="Body &amp; Society"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Sexual Repression in Maoist China: Ideology, Structure and the Ownership of the Body |journal=[[Body &amp; Society]] |date=September 2005 |last=Yuehong Zhang |first=Everett |volume=11 |issue=3 |doi=10.1177/1357034X05056188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skretting Aquaculture Research Centre''' A/S (Skretting ARC) was established in 1989, and is the central [[R&amp;D]] unit for the global [[fish]] and [[shrimp]] [[Feeds for farmed fish|feed]] concern [[Skretting]], which is owned by [[Nutreco|Nutreco N.V.]] Nutreco’s head office is in [[Amersfoort]], The Netherlands. Skretting ARC's main objective is to provide research and technical support regarding fish and shrimp feed. Skretting ARC has about 60 manyears of which about 45% have degrees corresponding to MSc or PhD level. It has an international staff representing 13 nationalities. It performs research for all feed companies within Skretting in Europe, North &amp; South America, Asia and Australia. Skretting ARC’  is a legal entity owned 100% by Skretting AS.

== Core competencies ==
Skretting ARC’s core competencies are within fish and shrimp nutrition and health, raw feed materials, feed safety &amp; quality and feed manufacturing processes. Skretting ARC’s facilities include an extensive research station with hatchery and land based tanks with both fresh and seawater trial facilities, a pilot plant for test feed production and innovative process trials and a well-equipped modern laboratory. The research station is designed for running trials with [[Salmonidae|salmonids]] through all life stages with different water qualities (temperature and salinity). Facilities are also adapted for running trials with [[cod]] after [[metamorphosis]]. Main facilities are located within the vicinity of [[Stavanger]], however Skretting also has a trout facility in Italy and is working towards a facility in Asia. Skretting ARC collaborates with several universities and institutes around the world.

== Projects ==
Skretting ARC has participated in several [[Norwegian Research Council]] and [[European Union|EU]]-funded research projects over the years. Its researchers have been authors or co-authors of several scientific publications. Some examples of EU projects are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4334">'''Smoothed analysis''' is a way of measuring the [[Analysis of algorithms|complexity of an algorithm]]. It gives a more realistic analysis of the practical performance of the algorithm,  such as its running time, than using worst-case or average-case scenarios.

==Introduction==
[[Average-case analysis]] was first introduced to overcome the limitations of [[worst-case analysis]], however the difficulty is saying what an average case is. The actual inputs and distribution of inputs may be different in practice from the assumptions made during the analysis: a random input may be very unlike a typical input.

Smoothed analysis is a hybrid of worst-case and average-case analyses that inherits advantages of both, by measuring the expected performance of algorithms under slight random perturbations of worst-case inputs. If the smoothed complexity of an algorithm is low, then it is unlikely that the algorithm will take long time to solve practical instances whose data are subject to slight noises and imprecisions.

==Use==
Since its introduction in 2001, smoothed analysis has been used as a basis for considerable research, for problems ranging from [[mathematical programming]], [[numerical analysis]], [[machine learning]], and [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Spielman, S. H. Teng. ''Smoothed analysis: an attempt to explain the behavior of algorithms in practice'', Communications of the ACM, 52(10):76–84, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
The [[simplex algorithm]] is a very efficient algorithm in practice, and it is one of the dominant algorithms for linear programming in practice. Yet in the theoretical worst case it runs in exponential-time for most successfully analyzed pivot rules. This was one of the main motivations for developing smoothed analysis.

In smoothed analysis of linear programming, the typical input model has mean data &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}, \bar{\mathbf b} \in \mathbb{R}^n, b \in \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\|(\bar{\mathbf a}_i, \bar{\mathbf b}_i)\|_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all rows of the matrix &lt;math&gt;(\bar{\mathbf A}, \bar{\mathbf b})&lt;/math&gt;. The noise data &lt;math&gt;\|(\hat{\mathbf A}, \hat{\mathbf b})\|&lt;/math&gt; has its entries independently distributed entries sampled from a [[Gaussian distribution]] with mean &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The smoothed input data consists of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A = \bar{\mathbf A} + \hat{\mathbf A}, \mathbf b = \bar{\mathbf b} + \hat{\mathbf b}&lt;/math&gt;. The smoothed complexity of an algorithm is the maximum over admissible &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf A}, \bar{\mathbf b}, \mathbf c&lt;/math&gt; of the expectation over &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf A}, \hat{\mathbf b}&lt;/math&gt; of the time it takes to solve the linear program
:maximize
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c^T} \cdot \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
:subject to
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

An algorithm has polynomial smoothed complexity if its expected running time is bounded by a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;n, d, \sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and [[EATCS|the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] awarded the 2008 [[Gödel Prize]] to [[Daniel Spielman]] and [[Shanghua Teng]] for developing smoothed analysis. In 2010 Spielman received the [[Nevanlinna Prize]] for developing smoothed analysis.  Spielman and Teng's JACM paper "Smoothed analysis of algorithms: Why the simplex algorithm usually takes polynomial time" was also one of the three winners of the 2009 [[Fulkerson Prize]] sponsored jointly by the [[Mathematical Programming Society]] (MPS)  and the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS).

'''''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''''' ({{lang-de|Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus}}) is a book written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[sociologist]], economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="WeberBaehr2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Weber|author2=Peter R.

In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in [[Northern Europe]] evolved when the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprise]]s and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = AM | year = 2010 | title = Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism | url = http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sociological Theory | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 108–126 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01367.x| hdl = 2164/3035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses [[Lutherans]] (especially [[Pietists]], but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), [[Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Moravians]] (specifically referring to the [[Herrnhut]]-based community under [[Count von Zinzendorf]]'s spiritual lead).

In 1998, the [[International Sociological Association]] listed this work as the fourth most important sociological book of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="isa-sociology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/|title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 8th most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Elliott|title=What are the most-cited publications in the social sciences (according to Google Scholar)?|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/|website=LSE Imact Blog|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Basic concepts===
Although not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber's later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]],'' ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]],'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]),'' ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' argues that [[Puritan]] [[ethic]]s and [[idea]]s influenced the development of capitalism. The 'spirit of capitalism' does not refer to the spirit in the metaphysical sense but rather a set of values, the spirit of hard work and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Michael Shea |url=http://discoversociety.org/2015/10/06/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-language-of-austerity/ |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Language of Austerity |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=[[Discover Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions. To illustrate his theory, Weber quotes the ethical writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]]:

{{quote|sign=|source=|Remember, that ''time is money''.  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon ''that'' the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides. [...] Remember, that money is the ''prolific, generating nature''. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on. Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding feline taint, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.}}

Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. Indeed, Franklin claims that God revealed the usefulness of virtue to him.&lt;ref name="protestant"&gt;Weber, Max "The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–12}}

The Reformation profoundly affected the view of work, dignifying even the most mundane professions as adding to the common good and thus blessed by God, as much as any "sacred" calling (German: ''Ruf''). A common illustration is that of a cobbler, hunched over his work, who devotes his entire effort to the praise of God.

To emphasize the [[work ethic]] in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending ''less'' time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

It is particularly advantageous in technical occupations for workers to be extremely devoted to their craft.  To view the craft as an end in itself, or as a "calling" would serve this need well. This attitude is well-noted in certain classes which have endured religious education, especially of a [[Pietist]] background.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

He defines spirit of capitalism as the ideas and ''esprit'' that favour the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational]] pursuit of [[Wealth|economic gain]]: "We shall nevertheless provisionally use the expression 'spirit of capitalism' for that attitude which, ''in the pursuit of a calling [berufsmäßig]'', strives systematically for profit for its own sake in the manner exemplified by Benjamin Franklin."&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

Weber points out that such a [[spirit]] is not limited to [[Western culture]] if one considers it as the attitude of [[Person|individual]]s, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as he calls them – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'',  University of California Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|55}} As he wrote in his essays:

:{{quote|In order that a manner of life well adapted to the peculiarities of the capitalism… could come to dominate others, it had to originate somewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to the whole groups of man.}}

After defining the "spirit of capitalism," Weber argues that there are many reasons to find its origins in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many others like [[William Petty]], [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[John Keats]] have noted the [[Affinity (sociology)|affinity]] between Protestantism and the development of [[commercialism]].&lt;ref name="Bendix54"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber shows that certain branches of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. This recognition was not a goal in itself; rather they were a byproduct of other doctrines of faith that encouraged planning, hard work and self-denial in the pursuit of worldly riches.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

===Origins of the Protestant work ethic===

Weber traced the origins of the Protestant ethic to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], though he acknowledged some respect for secular everyday labor as early as the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|28}} The Roman Catholic Church assured salvation to individuals who accepted the church's sacraments and submitted to the clerical authority. However, the Reformation had effectively removed such assurances. From a [[psychological]] viewpoint, the average person had difficulty adjusting to this new worldview, and only the most devout believers or "religious geniuses" within Protestantism, such as [[Martin Luther]], were able to make this adjustment, according to Weber.

In the absence of such assurances from religious authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other "signs" that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of [[Predestination|double predestination]], in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one's own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin's followers. It became an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation, and to dispel any doubt about that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation. So, self-confidence took the place of priestly assurance of God's grace.

Worldly success became one measure of that self-confidence. Luther made an early endorsement of Europe's emerging divisions. Weber identifies the applicability of Luther's conclusions, noting that a "vocation" from God was no longer limited to the clergy or church, but applied to any occupation or trade. Weber had always detested Lutheranism for the servility it inspired toward the bureaucratic state. When he discussed it in the ''Protestant Ethic'', he used Lutheranism as the chief example of the ''[[unio mystica]]'' that contrasted sharply with the ascetic posture. Later he would associate "Luther, the symbolic exponent of [[bureaucratic despotism]], with the ascetic hostility to [[Eros]] — an example of Weber's sporadic tendency to link together bureaucratic and ascetic modes of life and to oppose both from mystical and aristocratic perspectives."&lt;ref name="Mitzman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mitzman|title=The Iron Cage: An Historical Interpretation of Max Weber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mayilngcerQC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1970|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3745-3|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Weber saw the fulfillment of the Protestant ethic not in [[Lutheranism]], which was too concerned with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] forms of Christianity.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}} The trend was carried further still in Pietism.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|90}} The [[Baptists]] diluted the concept of the calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop ''un''politically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|102–104}}

What Weber argued, in simple terms:
* According to the new Protestant religions, an individual was religiously compelled to follow a secular vocation (German: ''Beruf'') with as much zeal as possible. A person living according to this world view was more likely to accumulate money.
* The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully ''using'' hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries as a [[sin]]. Donations to an individual's church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of [[icon]]s. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their fellow man, and an affront to God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.

The manner in which this paradox was resolved, Weber argued, was the investment of this money, which gave an extreme boost to [[Primitive accumulation|nascent capitalism]].

===The Protestant work ethic in Weber's time===

By the time Weber wrote his essay, he believed that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]], which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and furniture, that industrialization offered.

In his remarkably prescient conclusion to the book, Weber lamented that the loss of religious underpinning to capitalism's spirit has led to a kind of involuntary servitude to mechanized industry.

{{quote|The Puritan wanted to work in calling; we are forced to do so.  For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order.  This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force.  Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the 'saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.' But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage. (Page 181, 1953 Scribner's edition.)}}

Weber maintained that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted the development of economic system in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and [[observation]], the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, and an increase in entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], that ''disenchantment of the world'' that could be seen as a unique characteristic of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Conclusions===

In the final endnotes Weber states that he abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional [[theology|theologian]], had begun work on ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area, which is laying groundwork for comparative analysis of religion and society. Weber moved beyond Protestantism with his research but would continue research into [[sociology of religion]] within his later works (the study of [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Judaism]] and the religions of [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|China]] and [[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Budhism|India]]).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"/&gt;{{rp|49}}

This book is also Weber's first brush with the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]. His idea of modern capitalism as growing out of the religious pursuit of wealth meant a change to a rational means of existence, wealth. That is to say, at some point the Calvinist rationale informing the "spirit" of capitalism became unreliant on the underlying religious movement behind it, leaving only rational capitalism. In essence then, Weber's "Spirit of Capitalism" is effectively and more broadly a Spirit of Rationalization.

==Reception==
The essay can also be interpreted as one of Weber's criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] and his theories. While Marx's [[historical materialism]] held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen ''The Protestant Ethic'' as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, not the other way around.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other scholars have taken a more nuanced view of Weber's argument. Weber states in the closing of this essay, "it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes equally little in the interest of historical truth." Weber's argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of 'material; and 'ideal' factors.&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Economic criticism===
The economist and historian [[Henryk Grossman]] criticises Weber's analysis on two fronts, firstly with reference to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s extensive work which showed that the stringent legal measures taken against poverty and vagabondage was a reaction to the massive population shifts caused by the [[enclosure]] of the [[commons]] in England.  And, secondly, in Grossman's own work showing how this "bloody legislation" against those who had been put off their land was effected across Europe and especially in France.  For Grossman this legislation, the outlawing of [[idleness]] and the [[poorhouses]] they instituted physically forced people from [[serfdom]] into [[wage-labor]].  For him, this general fact was not related to Protestantism and so capitalism came largely by force and not by any vocational training regarding an inner-worldliness of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Henryk (2006) ‘The Beginnings of Capitalism and the New Mass Morality’ Journal of Classical Sociology 6 (2): July&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that the Protestant "work ethic" reinforced or legitimized these legal measures within a larger cultural context.

In a paper published on 10 November 2009, Harvard economist Davide Cantoni tested Weber's Protestant hypothesis using population and economic growth in second-millennium Germany as the data set, with negative results. Cantoni writes:

{{quote|Using population figures in a dataset comprising 276 cities in the years 1300–1900, I find no effects of Protestantism on economic growth. The finding is robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls, and does not appear to depend on data selection or small sample size. In addition, Protestantism has no effect when interacted with other likely determinants of economic development. I also analyze the endogeneity of religious choice; instrumental variables estimates of the effects of Protestantism are similar to the OLS results.&lt;ref&gt;David Cantoni, "The Economic Effects of the Protestant Reformation: Testing the Weber Hypothesis in the German Lands," November 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205143318/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |archivedate=5 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Cantoni uses city size, and not relative real wage growth, which was the Weber thesis, as his "main dependent variable" (Cantoni, 2).

Other recent scholarship continues to find valid Protestant Ethic effects both in historical and contemporary development patterns.

Dudley and Blum write:
{{quote|Evidence of falling wages in Catholic cities and rising wages in Protestant cities between 1500 and 1750, during the spread of literacy in the vernacular, is inconsistent with most theoretical models of economic growth. In The Protestant Ethic, Weber suggested an alternative explanation based on culture. Here, a theoretical model confirms that a small change in the subjective cost of cooperating with strangers can generate a profound transformation in trading networks. In explaining urban growth in early-modern Europe, specifications compatible with human-capital versions of the neoclassical model and endogenous-growth theory are rejected in favor of a "small-world" formulation based on the Weber thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807123042/http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archivedate=2003-08-07  |title=Religion and Economic Growth: Was Weber Right? |first1=Ulrich |last1=Blum |first2=Leonard |last2=Dudley |date=February 2001 |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=207–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Revisionist criticism===
H. M. Robertson, in his book ''Aspects of Economic Individualism'', argued against the historical and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, a decidedly different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to [[Adam Smith]], the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.

Looking at the history of the development of economic thought, Robertson shows that Adam Smith and [[David Ricardo]] did not found economic science ''de novo''. In fact, liberal economic theory was developed by French and Italian Catholics, who were influenced by the [[Scholastics]]. The British economic thought was rather a step backwards since it espoused the [[Labor Theory of Value]], which had already been proved incorrect by the [[School of Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313191910/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-13 |title=Catholicism, Protestantism, and Capitalism |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |author-link=Murray Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=February 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===
It has recently been suggested that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" but rather through the promotion of literacy.&lt;ref name="urss.ru"&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]). P.87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Munich Discussion Paper No. 2007-7, 22 January 2007. http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1366/1/weberLMU.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] at the Russian Academy of Sciences,&lt;ref name="urss.ru"/&gt; showed that literacy levels differing in religious areas can sufficiently explain the economic gaps cited by Weber. The results were supported even under a concentric diffusion model of Protestantism using distance from Wittenberg as a model.&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"/&gt;

In 1958, American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] conducted an empirical inquiry into "religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life" in the [[Detroit]], Mich., area. It revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported basic hypotheses of Weber's work ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. According to Lenski, "the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church, had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics. and Family Life'', Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt;

German theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf notes: "Sociologists of religion like [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] have interpreted the Protestant revolution in [[Latin America]] as implicit support of basic elements of Weber's thesis. [...] At any rate, many pious persons there interpret their transition from the Roman Catholic church to Protestant [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations in terms of a moral idea that promises long-term economic gains through strong innerworldly asceticism. The strict ascetic self-discipline that has been successfully institutionalized in the Pentecostal congregations, the readiness to work more and with greater effort and to take less leisurely attitudes lead many Pentecostal Christians to believe that their new faith in God is supported by their economic successes."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Graf (2010), ''Der Protestantismus. Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Second, Revised Edition, Munich (Germany), pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Mathematics and Statistics''' is a constituent body of the [[Sydney Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]] at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]]. It was established in its present form in 1991.

As of December 2010, the Head of School is Professor Neville Weber and the Deputy Head of School is Associate Professor David Easdown.&lt;ref name="about_school"&gt;http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Magma computer algebra system]] is produced and distributed by the Computational Algebra Group within the School.

==History==
Mathematics has been taught at the University since its establishment. The first Professor of Mathematics was [[Morris Birkbeck Pell|Morris Pell]], one of the University's three foundation professors. Pell gave the first lecture in mathematics on 13 October 1852, two days after the University's inauguration, to all 24 students at the time. At least two years of mathematics were still required of all the University's students at the time of Pell's retirement in 1877.&lt;ref name="about_school" /&gt;

The School of Mathematics and Statistics was established on 1 January 1991 with the merging of the departments of Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, and Mathematical Statistics.&lt;ref name="about_school" /&gt;

The School is located in the Carslaw Building, which was completed in the early 1960s, and is named after mathematician [[Horatio Scott Carslaw|Horatio Carslaw]] (1870-1954), who was once Professor of Mathematics at the University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/Carslaw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The primary mode of operation is the definition of a model consisting of compartments, species and chemical reactions, and reaction rates that are functions of concentrations. Given initial concentrations of species, the VCell can calculate how these concentrations change over time. 

Models can range from the simple to the highly complex, and can represent a mixture of experimental data and purely theoretical assumptions.

Users access Virtual Cell as a [[distributed application]] over the Internet. The web-based [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface allows users to build complex models in biologically relevant terms: compartment dimensions and shape, molecular characteristics, and interaction parameters. VCell converts the biological description into an equivalent mathematical system of differential equations. Users can switch back-and-forth between the schematic biological view and the mathematical view in the common graphical interface. Indeed, if users desire, they can manipulate the mathematical description directly, bypassing the schematic view. VCell allows users a choice of numerical solvers to translate the mathematical description into software code which is executed to perform the simulations. The results can be displayed on-line, or they can be downloaded to the user's computer in a wide variety of export formats. The Virtual Cell license allows free access to all members of the scientific community.&lt;ref name=VCellHome&gt;{{cite web|title=VCell - The Virtual Cell|url=http://vcell.org/|publisher=UConn Health Center|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
VCell supports the following features:

* Simulations can be chosen to either resolve variations of concentrations over space ('''spatial simulations''') or assume concentrations constant across compartments ('''compartmental simulations''').
* For spatial simulations, geometries can be specified by [[analytic geometry]] equations, [[Constructive Solid Geometry|derived from combination of simple shapes]] or derived from imported images, such as 3D confocal microscope stacks. Utilities for segmenting image data into regions such as nucleus, cytosol and extracellular are provided.
* Simulations can be based on either integration of differential equations without use of random numbers ('''deterministic simulations''') or be based on random events ('''stochastic simulations''').
* Simulations can be run using a variety of solvers including: 6 [[ordinary differential equation]] (ODE) solvers, 2 [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) solvers, 4 non-spatial [[stochastic]] solvers and [[Smoldyn]]&lt;ref name=Smoldyn&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoldyn: a spatial stochastic simulator for chemical reaction networks|url=http://www.smoldyn.org/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for stochastic spatial simulations. Choices between fixed and variable time steps exist. Some solvers can be run locally, all solvers can be run remotely on VCell servers.
* For compartmental determinsitc models, the best parameter values to fit experimental data can be estimated using algorithms developed by the [[COPASI]] software system. These tools are available in VCell.
* Models and simulation setups (so-called '''Applications''') can be stored in local files as Virtual Cell Markup Language (VCML)&lt;ref name=VCMLSpec&gt;{{cite web|title=VCell Software Architecture - VCML Specification |url=http://www.nrcam.uchc.edu/technology/VcmlSpec.html |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or stored remotely in the [http://query1.cam.uchc.edu/WebQuery/ VCell database].
* Models can be imported and exported as [[SBML|Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)]]&lt;ref name=SBML&gt;{{cite web|title=Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)|url=http://sbml.org/Main_Page |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biological pathway]]s can be imported as [[BioPAX|Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX)]]&lt;ref name=BioPAX&gt;{{cite web|title=BioPAX - Biological Pathway Exchange |url=http://www.biopax.org/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build and annotate models. A VCell prototype (to be released as Beta in April 2012) also can import quantitative data as [[SBPAX|Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX)]].&lt;ref name=SBPAX&gt;{{cite web|title=Systems Biology Pathway Exchange|url=http://www.sbpax.org/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological and related data sources ==
VCell allows users integrated access to a variety of sources to help build and annotate models: 

* Models stored in the VCell database can be made accessible by their authors to some users ('''shared''') or all users ('''public''').
* VCell can import models from the [[BioModels Database]].&lt;ref name=BioModels&gt;{{cite web |title=BioModels Database - A Database of Annotated Published Models|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/ |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biological pathway]]s can be imported from [[Pathway Commons]].&lt;ref name=PathwayCommons&gt;{{cite web |title=Pathway Commons|url=http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc/ |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data on chemicals can be imported from [[UniProt]] ([[protein]]s)&lt;ref name=UniProt&gt;{{cite web|title=UniProt |url=https://www.uniprot.org/ |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ChEBI]] (mostly small molecules).&lt;ref name=ChEBI&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A VCell prototype (to be released as Beta in April 2012) can import quantitative data from [[Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages]]&lt;ref name=SignalingGateway&gt;{{cite web|title=Molecule Pages: A comprehensive signaling database|url=http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SABIO-Reaction Kinetics Database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SABIO-Reaction Kinetics Database|url=http://sabio.villa-bosch.de/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The Virtual Cell is being developed at the Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling at the [[University of Connecticut Health Center]].&lt;ref name=CCAM&gt;{{cite web|title=The Richard D. Berlin Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling (CCAM)|url=http://www.cbit.uchc.edu/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team is primarily funded through research grants through the [[National Institutes of Health]].
