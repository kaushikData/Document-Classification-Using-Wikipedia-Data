'''1-2-3''' is an unmanned [[fuel station]] chain in the Nordic and Baltic regions.

It was created in 2000, as the low cost extension of the [[Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail|Statoil]] chain, and owned by [[Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail|Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail ASA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rimi-bensin|last=Gultvedt|first=Bård|date=25 May 2001|work=VG|page=3|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first outlet was opened in [[Kaunas]] in December 2000. 65 outlets were planned in the Baltic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kanskje i Norge senere: Norsk billig-bensin til de baltiske stater|last=Dahl|first=Flemming|date=6 December 2000|work=Aftenposten|page=27|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; later to be supplemented by 107 outlets in [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Unlike the Statoil stations, there are no franchisees, all stations are vertically integrated.

It formed early on October&amp;nbsp;29 along a cold front to the southeast of [[the Carolinas]]. As it moved up the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], its associated snowfall broke records in at least 20&amp;nbsp;cities for total accumulations, resulting in a rare "white Halloween" two days later.

The storm arrived just two months after [[Hurricane Irene]] caused extensive power outages and property damage in the Northeast; with the [[2011 New England tornado outbreak]] also causing damage in [[Western Massachusetts]]. It dumped snow on trees that were often still in leaf, adding extra weight, with the ground in some areas still soft from a preceding warm, rainy period that increased the possibility trees could be uprooted. Trees and branches that collapsed caused considerable damage, particularly to power lines, with estimates of storm costs ranging between $1 billion and $3 billion. In all, 3.2 million U.S. residences and businesses&lt;ref&gt;''Transmission Facility Outages During the Northeast Snowstorm of October 29–30, 2011'', Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and North American Electric Reliability Corporation, 2012-05-12, pages 5-8. Retrieved 2014-05-03.&lt;/ref&gt; in 12 states experienced [[power outage]]s, with the storm also impacting three Canadian provinces.

Some customers in [[Connecticut]] did not get power back until early November;&lt;ref name="Hartford Courant story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahony|first=Edmund|title=Extreme Weather Of 2011: Freak October Snowstorm|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-halloween-year-1228-20111223-story.html|newspaper=[[The Hartford Courant]]|date=December 28, 2011|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; many outages lasted 11 days&lt;ref&gt;''Transmission Facility Outages During the Northeast Snowstorm of October 29–30, 2011'', Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and North American Electric Reliability Corporation, May 12, 2012, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Many communities chose to postpone celebrations of [[Halloween]] from two days to a week later as a result, or cancel them entirely. Delays in restoring power led to the resignation of the chief operating officer of [[Connecticut Light &amp; Power]] amid widespread criticism of the company's mishandling of both the nor'easter and Irene.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Butler-resigns-as-CL-P-chief-2274349.php "Butler resigns as CL&amp;P chief," Connecticut Post, 2011-11-18.

==Preparations==

Before the storm was at its strongest, local [[National Weather Service]] offices issued [[winter storm warning]]s from northwestern Virginia through central New England, as well as [[winter storm watch]]es from central Maryland through central Maine. Officials anticipated peak snowfall totals to be from {{convert|8|–|10|in|cm}} across much of the region.&lt;ref name="hpc3"&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Hamrick |date=October 28, 2011 |title=Storm Summary Number 3 for Autumn Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. Major Winter Storm |publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62mgX5qcg?url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc2.html |archivedate=October 29, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; All warnings were canceled after the storm moved away from the region.&lt;ref name="hpc11"/&gt;

===Fatalities===
Traffic accidents killed at least six people. Two were [[electrocuted]] by downed power lines. Overall, there were 39&amp;nbsp;deaths.&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt;

The storm affected transportation across the Northeast.

Some roads were also affected. Along the [[Jersey Shore]], the nor'easter produced coastal flooding that left [[Ventnor City, New Jersey|Ventnor Heights]] isolated. Officials closed a portion of the [[Black Horse Pike]] in [[West Atlantic City, New Jersey|West Atlantic City]] due to flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan |last=Good |newspaper=Press of Atlantic City |date=October 29, 2011 |title=Both main roadways into Ventnor Heights are closed due to flooding; coastal flood advisory remains in effect |accessdate=October 29, 2011 |url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/communities/margate_ventnor_longport/both-main-roadways-into-ventnor-heights-are-closed-due-to/article_15b2638e-0248-11e1-a6df-001cc4c002e0.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62nihZuxE?url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/communities/margate_ventnor_longport/both-main-roadways-into-ventnor-heights-are-closed-due-to/article_15b2638e-0248-11e1-a6df-001cc4c002e0.html |archivedate=October 29, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further north, the flooding closed five [[State highways in New Jersey|New Jersey state highways]] in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth]] and [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean]] counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Asbury Park Press|date=October 29, 2011|title=Storm flooding closes road lanes in Monmouth, Ocean counties|accessdate=October 29, 2011|url=http://www.app.com/article/20111029/NJNEWS10/310290050/Storm-flooding-closes-road-lanes-Monmouth-Ocean-counties?odyssey=nav%7chead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
Sporting events on Saturday, mostly college and high school [[American football|football]] games, were also impacted. [[Penn State]] officials limited parking at its home game in [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] to 1,500&amp;nbsp;spaces due to the inclement weather.&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt; It was the first Nittany Lions home October football game with measurable snow since record keeping began in 1896.&lt;ref name="ajc"/&gt; At [[West Point, New York]], [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] defeated [[Fordham Rams|Fordham]] 55–0 in its first home game played in snow since 1985.&lt;ref name="Army beating Fordham in snow"&gt;{{cite news|last=Interdonato|first=Sal|title=Army celebrates 'Christmas'|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111030/SPORTS36/110300340/-1/SPORTS|newspaper=[[Times-Herald Record]]|date=October 30, 2011|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Long Island]] where a wind swept mixture of heavy snow and rain fell, a match between [[Plainview – Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School]] and [[Valley Stream Central High School]] was cancelled after 15 players were treated for [[hypothermia]], prompting the former school district to reconsider game cancellation policies. At another football game on Long Island 10 players were checked and some treated for the condition.  Several players at Farmingdale High School reported extreme fatigue for several weeks following playing in the storm.&lt;ref name="Newsday cancellation policy story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chayes|first=Matthew|title= Athletes' hypothermia: Eyeing guidelines|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/high-school/football/athletes-hypothermia-eyeing-guidelines-1.3284741|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=October 30, 2011|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halloween===
Many traditional Halloween activities were affected by the storm. In communities without electricity, where tree limbs and wires were down, trick-or-treating was delayed until days when it was expected to be back and repairs had made the streets safer. This also occurred in communities where electricity was still fully or partially on but the streets still may have been unsafe. In [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], a popular destination for the holiday since [[Washington Irving]]'s classic short story, "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" is set there, Halloween events were canceled due to the storm and its aftermath. On the other hand, another popular Halloween destination, [[Salem, Massachusetts]], location of the [[Salem witch trials|1692 witch trials]], was unaffected due to its minimal snowfall.&lt;ref name="THR Halloween effects story"&gt;{{cite news|title=October storm disrupts Halloween across Northeast|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111101/NEWS90/111109994/-1/NEWS|agency=Associated Press  |date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Halloween event after 2011 snowstorm, Pequannock, NJ.jpg|thumb|right|A post-storm Halloween event in [[Pequannock, New Jersey]]|alt=Children receiving small treats from a table with a shiny orange covering and two small pumpkins on it. One child to the right is in costume as a green turtle. There are adults behind them wearing heavy coats and hats. In the rear is a large brick building with snow on the roof]] 
Some families were able to compensate for the lost Halloween. They took their children to trick-or-treat in other communities that still had electricity. Residents of [[Glen Rock, New Jersey]], organized a "trunk-or-treat" party at the local high school's football field, where children went around to parked sport-utility vehicles.&lt;ref name="THR Halloween effects story" /&gt; Since many schools had [[Weather-related cancellation#North America|snow days]], and there was little to distract children without electricity, many parents insisted on going ahead with the holiday. "You can't cancel Halloween" said a woman in [[Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey|Fairfield, New Jersey]]. "The kids are all hyped up. They had no school because there's no electricity and this and that." A boy in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] said he now planned to "buy some candy and eat it myself."&lt;ref name="NYT post-Halloween story" /&gt;

At [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]], the storm caused a power outage over a traditional party weekend at the college that lasted throughout most of the night on Saturday, October 29. While power was largely restored by Sunday, October 30, the campus cancelled classes on October 31, and the UMass Campus Center served as a rest location for students and area residents who were still without power.&lt;ref name="UMass Halloween effects story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wintry mid-autumn storm sweeps Western Mass., recovery begins|url=http://dailycollegian.com/2011/11/01/wintry-mid-autumn-storm-sweeps-western-mass-recovery-begins/|agency=[[The Massachusetts Daily Collegian]] |date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amherst College]] saw similar conditions, with the university newspaper reporting that students were taking refuge from power outages in Valentine Dining Hall, with one student describing the response as similar to hurricanes in her home state of Florida.&lt;ref name="Amherst College Halloween effects story"&gt;{{cite news|title=October Snowstorm Puts Amherst on Ice|url=http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article/2011/10/31/october-snowstorm-puts-amherst-ice|agency=The Amherst Student |date=October 31, 2011|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in some communities to hold Halloween the following weekend, or whenever conditions returned to normal, met with protest from some parents. Some considered the October 31 date to be immutable and nonnegotiable, so children would have to wait for 2012. "I don't have control over the calendar, so Halloween is on Halloween, which is the 31st", said Pat Murphy, mayor of [[New Milford, Connecticut]]. She noted the town had managed to celebrate the holiday that day on its [[village green]] despite considerable storm damage and continued power outages. Others had already allowed their children some trick-or-treating, and did not want them to indulge in candy a second time within the week.&lt;ref name="NYT Halloween makeup reservations story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Applebome|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Applebome|title=For Some, Halloween in November Is a Sour Idea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/nyregion/for-some-parents-halloween-in-november-is-sour-idea.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many school districts were forced by the storm to use up their remaining allotted snow days for the school year, after Hurricane Irene and [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]] had required some be used near the beginning of the year. The [[Weston, Connecticut]], public schools had already used nine snow days as of November 2, five more than its schedule allowed. Since more snow days would inevitably be used during the upcoming winter, they predicted that  vacation periods planned for later in the year would have to be shortened or canceled, or the school year would have to be extended.&lt;ref name="NYT snow-day effects story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hu|first=Winnie|author2=Schweber, Nate|title=The Joys, and Frustrations, of Snow Days in November|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/education/storm-forces-many-schools-to-use-up-snow-days-early.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 2, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm came at a critical time for high school [[senior (education)|seniors]] preparing college applications for [[early decision]], and 76 colleges and universities moved those deadlines back to compensate. In Connecticut, [[Weston High School (Connecticut)|Weston High School]], which had power, opened its library for students wishing to study or work on their applications; movies were shown in the auditorium.&lt;ref name="NYT snow-day effects story" /&gt;

===Electrical outages===
Approximately 1.7 million customers in the Northeast were still without electricity three days after the storm. Temperatures in the region warmed up to above {{convert|50|F}} during the day, but went down to near freezing at night.

Customers still suffering outages continued to cope as best they could, by sleeping at the homes of friends who had already had their electricity restored, taking showers at work and storing perishable foods outside.&lt;ref name="NYT one week later in CT story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Thousands Still Without Power in Connecticut|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/nyregion/in-connecticut-thousands-still-without-power.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2011|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power was not restored to all the customers who had lost it in the storm until November 9.&lt;ref name="Hartford Courant story" /&gt;

Many Connecticut residents were angry with the state's electric utilities, particularly [[Connecticut Light &amp; Power]] (CL&amp;P), which serves most of the state, for the long delays in restoring service. By the weekend after the storm, in comparison, most customers in other affected states had already gotten their electricity back. Malloy said they had "missed their own target" and ordered an investigation into their preparation and restoration efforts to be led by [[James Lee Witt]], director of the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] during the [[Clinton Administration]]. An [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]] man complained he had not seen any crews in his area since the storm.&lt;ref name="NYT Sunday evening CT blackout story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=Electric Carrier in Connecticut Still Counts 7% Without Power|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/nyregion/connecticut-utility-wont-meet-goal-to-restore-power.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2011|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators felt Malloy was being too lenient with CL&amp;P, noting that the company had cut its maintenance budget in the preceding year and that smaller public utilities, such as that serving the city of [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]], had experienced far less power loss and for far less time despite CL&amp;P's customers paying the highest rates in the contiguous United States.&lt;ref name="Breakingviews commentary in NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Rob|title=The Troubling Connecticut Power Failure|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/business/the-troubling-connecticut-power-failure.html|newspaper=[[Breakingviews]]|date=November 4, 2011|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar complaints had been made after the company had taken a long time to restore service after Hurricane Irene, and three weeks after the nor'easter, Jeff Butler, the company's CEO, resigned.&lt;ref name="Butler resignation"&gt;{{Cite news|last=McGeehan|first=Patrick|title=Connecticut Utility Chief Quits After Delays in Restoring Power|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/nyregion/connecticut-power-and-light-president-quits-after-snowstorm.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 18, 2011|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2011 Halloween nor'easter snow totals.jpg|thumb|left|Snowfall totals from the nor'easter|alt=An image showing a large bluish cloud over the Northeastern United States, with the deeper shades of blue representing the greatest snowfall]]
A month after the storm, Malloy released Witt's report, which concluded that "CL&amp;P was not prepared for an event of this size". The utility had planned for a worst-case scenario in which 100,000 customers lost power, only one-eighth of those actually affected by the nor'easter. While the report noted that such a storm had not hit in 25 years when the company's emergency plan was drawn up in June, it nevertheless faulted CL&amp;P for merely telling its emergency crews to be on call that weekend, instead of having them wait at predetermined locations. As a result, it was harder to mobilize them when the effects turned out to be far worse than they anticipated despite warnings from the NWS using terms such as "historic" and "catastrophic" prior to the storm.&lt;ref name="NYT CL&amp;P report story"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGeehan|first=Patrick|title=Connecticut Utility Faulted by Report on Storm Efforts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/nyregion/connecticut-light-and-power-unprepared-for-northeaster-report-says.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 3, 2011|accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ryanhanrahan.com/2011/11/02/surprise-storm-for-clp/&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also said that CL&amp;P did not ask for crews from neighboring states until after the storm, at which point other New England utilities were also seeking help from them. "Because of that poor preparation, it's not surprising that they didn't, or that they couldn't, respond with enough boots on the ground when the worst-case scenario was compounded by a factor of eight", said Malloy. The report did praise some aspects of CL&amp;P's response, such as its short call wait times, speedy repairs by crews once they reached their job sites and the absence of death or serious injury among responding utility crews.&lt;ref name="NYT CL&amp;P report story" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5672">'''ATAŞ''', short for "Anadolu Tasfiyehanesi Anonim Şirketi" (literally: '''Anatolian Refinery Joint-stock Company'''), is a former oil refinery company in Mersin, southern [[Turkey]]. Currently, The facility is used today as an oil storage and terminal.

==Oil refinery==
ATAŞ was established in 1958 following a special agreement between the Turkish government and the foreign oil companies [[Mobil]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[BP]] and [[Caltex]]. Caltex later sold its share to Mobil.&lt;ref name="nuveforum"/&gt;  Currently, the main shareholder is BP with 68%. Other partners are Shell &amp; Turcas Petrol (27%) and Turcas (5%).&lt;ref name="turcas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt;

The refinery was built by the Swiss contractor [[Foster Wheeler|Foster Wheeler AG]].&lt;ref name="elektrikport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elektrikport.com/haber-roportaj/foster-wheeler-bimas-genel-muduru-taskin-aliefendioglu-ile-soylesi/14852#ad-image-0|website=elektrikport.com|title=Foster Wheeler Bimaş Genel M&amp;#252;d&amp;#252;r&amp;#252; Taşkın ALİEFENDİOĞLU ile S&amp;#246;yleşi – Interview with Foster Wheeler Turkey director|language=tr |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was put into operation on 30 April 1962.&lt;ref name="atasterminal"/&gt; The company's headquarter as well as its facilities are located in [[Akdeniz, Mersin|Akdeniz]] district of [[Mersin]] at {{coord| 36|49|50|N|34|41|51|E}}.&lt;ref name="haritamap"/&gt; Its annual production was 3.2&amp;nbsp;million tonnes. On 7 June 2004, ATAŞ gave up refining crude oil.&lt;ref name="atasterminal"/&gt; With the shut down of the refinery after 42-year of production, households and industry facilities in 24 provinces of the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] and [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|Southeastern Anatolia]] regions faced fuel oil shortage. Temporary supply from the {{cvt|485|km}} far away [[Tüpraş Kırıkkale Oil Refinery]] caused an increase of oil prices around 11%.&lt;ref name="tg1"/&gt;

==Oil terminal== 
The facility was converted after investments into a large-scale storage and terminal for fuel oil, diesel oil and gasoline.&lt;ref name="turcas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; It underwent a renovation between 2004 and 2006 carried out by Foster Wheeler,&lt;ref name="well"/&gt; the original contractor in the 1960s. The terminal on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coast is suitable for docking of high-capacity tankers.&lt;ref name="atasterminal"/&gt; The storage capacity of ATAŞ terminal is {{cvt|570000|m3}}.&lt;ref name="turcas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt;

Beginning in 2015, the local administration in Akdeniz district has been making efforts to convert the campus of ATAŞ Terminal, which stress over {{cvt|30|ha}} and became inactive after the closure of the refinery, into a public park for social and cultural events by preserving its historical characteristic.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4161">{{string theory}}

In theoretical physics, ''' anti-de Sitter/condensed matter theory correspondence''' is the program{{clarify|why is it called a program if it's a correspondence?|date=December 2016}} to apply [[string theory]] to [[condensed matter theory]] using the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

==Overview==

Over the decades, [[experimental physics|experimental]] [[condensed matter]] physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter, including [[superconductors]] and [[superfluids]]. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including [[Subir Sachdev]] hope that the AdS/CFT correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.&lt;ref name="Merali 2011, p.303"&gt;Merali 2011, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

So far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a [[superfluid]] to an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]. A superfluid is a system of [[electrically neutral]] [[atoms]] that flows without any [[friction]]. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using [[liquid helium]], but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing [[lasers]]. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the [[temperature]] and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other [[phase (matter)|phases]]. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.&lt;ref name="Sachdev 2013, p.51"&gt;Sachdev 2013, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

With many physicists turning towards string-based methods to address problems in condensed matter physics{{fact|date=December 2016}}, some theorists working in this area have expressed doubts about whether the AdS/CFT correspondence can provide the tools needed to realistically model real-world systems. In a letter to [[Physics Today]], [[Nobel laureate]] [[Philip W. Anderson]] wrote

{{quote|text=As a very general problem with the AdS/CFT approach in condensed-matter theory, we can point to those telltale initials "CFT"—conformal field theory. Condensed-matter problems are, in general, neither relativistic nor conformal. Near a quantum critical point, both time and space may be scaling, but even there we still have a preferred coordinate system and, usually, a lattice. There is some evidence of other linear-T phases to the left of the strange metal about which they are welcome to speculate, but again in this case the condensed-matter problem is overdetermined by experimental facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v66/i4/p9_s1?bypassSSO=1 |title=Strange connections to strange metals |last1=Anderson |first1=Philip |publisher=Physics Today |accessdate=14 August 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5892">The '''affinity laws''' (Also known as the "Fan Laws" or "Pump Laws") for pumps/fans are used in [[hydraulics]], [[hydronics]] and/or [[HVAC]] to express the relationship between variables involved in pump or fan performance (such as [[head (hydraulic)|head]], [[volumetric flow rate]], shaft speed) and [[Power (physics)|power]]. They apply to [[pump]]s, [[fan (mechanical)|fans]], and [[hydraulic turbine]]s. In these rotary implements, the affinity laws apply both to centrifugal and axial flows.

The laws are derived using the [[Buckingham π theorem]]. The affinity laws are useful as they allow prediction of the head discharge characteristic of a pump or fan from a known characteristic measured at a different speed or impeller diameter. The only requirement is that the two pumps or fans are dynamically similar, that is the ratios of the fluid forced are the same.

'''Law 1. With impeller diameter (D) held constant:'''

* &lt;math&gt;  D &lt;/math&gt; is the impeller diameter (e.g. in or mm)
* &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the shaft rotational speed (e.g. [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]])
* &lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt; is the pressure or head developed by the fan/pump (e.g. psi or Pascal)
* &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is the shaft power (e.g. W).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/affinity-laws-d_408.html|title=Pump Affinity Laws|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws assume that the pump/fan [[efficiency]] remains constant i.e. &lt;math&gt; \eta_1 = \eta_2 &lt;/math&gt;, which is rarely exactly true, but can be a good approximation when used over appropriate frequency or diameter ranges (i.e., a fan will not move anywhere near 1000 times as much air when spun at 1000 times its designed operating speed, but the air movement may be increased by 99% when the operating speed is only doubled).  The exact relationship between speed, diameter, and efficiency depends on the particulars of the individual fan or pump [[design]]. [[Product testing]] or [[computational fluid dynamics]] become necessary if the range of acceptability is unknown, or if a high level of accuracy is required in the calculation.  [[Interpolation]] from accurate data is also more accurate than the affinity laws.  When applied to pumps the laws work well for constant diameter variable speed case (Law 1) but are less accurate for constant speed variable impeller diameter case (Law 2).


For radial flow centrifugal pumps, it is common industry practice to reduce the impeller diameter by "trimming", whereby the outer diameter of a particular impeller is reduced by machining to alter the performance of the pump. In this particular industry it is also common to refer to the mathematical approximations that relate the volumetric flow rate, trimmed impeller diameter, shaft rotational speed, developed head, and power as the "affinity laws". Because trimming an impeller changes the fundamental shape of the impeller (increasing the [[specific speed]]), the relationships shown in Law 2 cannot be utilized in this scenario. In this case the industry looks to the following relationships, which is a better approximation of these variables when dealing with impeller trimming.

'''With shaft speed (N) held constant and for small variations in impeller diameter via trimming:''' &lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heald |first1=C.C. |title=Cameron Hydraulic Data, 19th Ed. |pages=1-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; { Q_1 \over \ Q_2} = { \left ( {D_1 \over D_2} \right )}   &lt;/math&gt;
 
The pump developed head (the [[total dynamic head]]) varies to the square of the trimmed impeller diameter:&lt;ref name=Cameron/&gt;

'''Aluminum electrolytic capacitors''' are polarized [[electrolytic capacitor]]s whose [[anode]] [[electrode]] (+) is made of a pure [[aluminum]] foil with an [[etching|etched]] surface. The aluminum forms a very thin insulating layer of  [[aluminium oxide]] by [[anodization]] that acts as the [[dielectric]] of the capacitor. A non-solid [[electrolyte]] covers the rough surface of the oxide layer, serving in principle as the second electrode ([[cathode]]) (-) of the capacitor. A second aluminum foil called “cathode foil” contacts the electrolyte and serves as the electrical connection to the negative terminal of the capacitor.

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are divided into three subfamilies by the type of electrolyte: 
*non-solid  (liquid, wet) aluminum electrolytic capacitors, 
*[[Solid aluminum capacitor (SAL)|solid manganese dioxide aluminum electrolytic capacitors]], and 
*[[Polymer capacitor|solid polymer aluminium electrolytic capacitors]].

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are the most inexpensive type and also those with widest range of sizes, capacitance and voltage values. They are made with capacitance values from 0.1&amp;nbsp;µF up to 2,700,000&amp;nbsp;µF (2.7&amp;nbsp;F),&lt;ref name=DCMC&gt;CDE, series DCMC, [http://www.cde.com/catalogs/DCMC.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and rated voltages values from 4&amp;nbsp;V up to 630&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name="630 V"&gt;Jianghai, 630 V-Elkos [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/J14_CD_13H_BH1.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000522/http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/J14_CD_13H_BH1.pdf |date=2013-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid electrolyte provides oxygen for re-forming or self-healing of the dielectric oxide layer. However, it can evaporate through a temperature-dependent drying-out process, which causes electrical parameters to drift, limiting the service life time of the capacitors.

Due to their relatively high capacitance values aluminum electrolytic capacitors have low [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] values even at lower frequencies like [[Utility frequency|mains frequency]]. They are typically used in [[Power supply|power supplies]], [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] and [[DC-to-DC converter|DC-DC converters]] for smoothing and buffering rectified DC voltages in many electronic devices as well as in industrial power supplies and frequency converters as [[Direct current|DC link capacitors]] for [[variable-frequency drive|drives]], [[inverter]]s for [[photovoltaic]], and [[Frequency changer|converter]]s in [[wind power plant]]s. Special types are used for energy storage, for example in [[photoflash]] or [[strobe]] applications or for frequency coupling in audio applications.

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are polarized capacitors because of their anodization principle. They can only be operated with [[Direct current|DC]] voltage applied with the correct polarity. Operating the capacitor with wrong polarity or with [[Alternating current|AC]] voltage leads to a [[short circuit]] and can destroy the component. The exceptions is the bipolar aluminum electrolytic capacitor, which has a back-to-back configuration of two anodes in one case and can be used in AC applications.

===Oxide layer===
[[File:Anodic oxidation.jpg|thumb|right|Basic principle of anodic oxidation, in which, by applying a voltage with a current source, an oxide layer is formed on a metallic anode]]

Electrolytic capacitors use a chemical feature of some special metals, earlier called "valve metals". Applying a positive voltage to the anode material in an electrolytic bath forms an insulating oxide layer with a thickness corresponding to the applied voltage. This oxide layer acts as the dielectric in an electrolytic capacitor. The properties of this aluminum oxide layer compared with tantalum pentoxide dielectric layer are given in the following table:

&lt;/center&gt;

After forming a dielectric oxide on the rough anode structures, a counter-electrode has to match the rough insulating oxide surface. This is provided by the electrolyte, which acts as the cathode electrode of an electrolytic capacitor. Electrolytes may be "non-solid" (wet, liquid) or "solid". Non-solid electrolytes, as a liquid medium that has an ''ion conductivity'' caused by moving ions, are relatively insensitive to voltage spikes or current surges. Solid electrolytes have an ''electron conductivity'', which makes solid electrolytic capacitors sensitive to voltages spikes or current surges.

The anodic generated insulating oxide layer is destroyed if the polarity of the applied voltage changes.
[[Image:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|thumb|right|A dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates (electrodes), each of area '''''A''''', and with a separation '''''d'''''.]]

Every electrolytic capacitor in principle forms a "plate capacitor" whose capacitance is greater the larger the electrode area A and the [[permittivity]] ε, and the thinner the thickness (d) of the dielectric. 
:&lt;math&gt;C = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The capacitance is proportional to the product of the area of one plate multiplied with the permittivity, divided by the thickness of the dielectric.

Electrolytic capacitors obtain their large capacitance values by a large area and small dielectric thickness.  The dielectric thickness of electrolytic capacitors is very thin, in the range of nano[[meter]]s per volt, but the voltage strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. All etched or sintered anodes have a much higher surface compared to a smooth surface of the same area. This increases the capacitance value by a factor of up to 200 for aluminum electrolytic capacitors.&lt;ref name=Voltage&gt;A. Albertsen, Jianghai Europe, "Keep your distance – Voltage Proof of Electrolytic Capacitors", [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/3-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Voltage-Proof-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDK"&gt;[http://www.kdk.com/e/productinfo/specifications/c-03-02-03-e.pdf KDK, Specifications for Etched Foil for Anode, Low Voltage]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors===
&lt;center&gt;

File:Al-e-cap-construction.jpg|Construction of a typical single-ended aluminum electrolytic capacitor with non-solid electrolyte
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

An aluminum electrolytic capacitor with a non-solid electrolyte always consists of two aluminum foils separated mechanically by a spacer, mostly paper, which is saturated with a liquid or gel-like electrolyte. One of the aluminum foils, the anode, is etched (roughened) to increase the surface and oxidized (formed). The second aluminum foil, called the "cathode foil", serves to make electrical contact with the electrolyte. A paper spacer mechanically separates the foils to avoid direct metallic contact. Both foils and the spacer are wound and the winding is impregnated with liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte, which serves as cathode of the capacitor, covers the etched rough structure of the oxide layer on the anode perfectly and makes the increased anode surface effectual. After impregnation the impregnated winding is mounted in an aluminum case and sealed.

By design, a non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitor has a second aluminum foil, the so-called cathode foil, for contacting the electrolyte. This structure of an aluminum electrolytic capacitor results in a characteristic result because the second aluminum (cathode) foil is also covered with an insulating oxide layer naturally formed by air. Therefore, the construction of the electrolytic capacitor consists of two single series-connected capacitors with capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; of the anode and capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; of the cathode. The total capacitance of the capacitor C&lt;sub&gt;e-cap&lt;/sub&gt; is thus obtained from the formula of the series connection of two capacitors:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{e-cap} = \frac{C_A \cdot C_K}{C_A+C_K}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the total capacitance of the capacitor C&lt;sub&gt;e-cap&lt;/sub&gt; is mainly determined by the anode capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; when the cathode capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; is very large compared with the anode capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. This requirement is given when the cathode capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; is approximately 10 times higher than the anode capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. This can be easily achieved because the natural oxide layer on a cathode surface has a voltage proof of approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;V and is therefore very thin.

===Comparison of non-solid and solid types===
Although the present article only refers in essence to aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, an overview of the different types of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is given here in order to highlight the differences. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are divided into two sub-types depending on whether they make use of liquid or solid electrolyte systems. Because the different electrolyte systems can be constructed with a variety of different materials, they include further sub-types.
* Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte
** may use a liquid electrolyte based on [[ethylene glycol]] and [[boric acid]], so-called "borax" electrolytes, or 
** based on organic solvents, such as [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]], [[Dimethylacetamide|DMA]], [[gamma-Butyrolactone|GBL]], or 
** based on high water containing solvents, for so-called "low impedance", "low ESR" or "high ripple current" capacitors
* Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte
** have a solid manganese dioxide electrolyte, see [[solid aluminum capacitor (SAL)]], or
** a solid polymer electrolyte, see [[Polymer capacitor|polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitor]], or
** hybrid electrolytes, with both a solid polymer and a liquid, see also [[Polymer capacitor|polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are the best known and most widely used electrolytic capacitors. These components can be found on almost all boards of electronic equipment. They are characterized by particularly inexpensive and easy to process base materials.

Aluminum capacitors with liquid electrolytes based on borax or organic solvents have a large range of types and ratings. Capacitors with water-based electrolytes are often found in digital devices for mass production. Types with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte have served in the past as a "tantalum replacement". Polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid conductive polymer electrolytes are becoming increasingly important, especially in devices with a flat design, such as tablet PCs and flat panel displays. Electrolytic capacitors with hybrid electrolytes are relatively new on the market. With their hybrid electrolyte system they combine the improved conductivity of the polymer with the advantage of liquid electrolytes for better self-healing property of the oxide layer, so that the capacitors have the advantages of both low ESR and low leakage current.

The basic material of the anode for aluminum electrolytic capacitors is a foil with a thickness of ~ 20–100&amp;nbsp;µm made of aluminum with a high purity of at least 99.99%.&lt;ref name="KDK"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PanProd&gt;Production of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors, Panasonic [http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABA0000/ABA0000TE3.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214154719/http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABA0000/ABA0000TE3.pdf |date=2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is etched (roughened) in an electrochemical process to increase the effective electrode surface.&lt;ref name=CapXon&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.capxongroup.com/en/prod_page.aspx?catid=mp |title=CapXon, Manufacturing Process |access-date=2014-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211111731/http://www.capxongroup.com/en/prod_page.aspx?catid=mp |archive-date=2015-12-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By etching the surface of the anode, depending on the required rated voltage, the surface area can be increased by a factor of approximately 200 with respect to a smooth surface.&lt;ref name="KDK" /&gt;

After etching the aluminum anode the roughed surface is "anodic oxidized" or "formed". An electrically insulating oxide layer Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is thereby formed on the aluminum surface by application of a current in correct polarity if it is inserted in an electrolytic bath. This oxide layer is the capacitor dielectric.

This process of oxide formation is carried out in two reaction steps whereby the [[oxygen]] for this reaction has to come from the electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;Nichicon, "General Descriptions of Aluminum Electolytic Capacitors, 1-3 Dielectric (Aluminum Oxide Layer)" [http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~reese/electrolytics/tec1.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; First, a strongly exothermic reaction transforms the metallic aluminum (Al) into [[aluminum hydroxide]], Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:

: 2 Al + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↑

This reaction is accelerated by a high electric field and high temperatures, and is accompanied by a pressure buildup in the capacitor housing caused by the released [[hydrogen]] gas. The gel-like [[aluminum hydroxide]] Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also called alumina trihydrate (ATH), is converted via a second reaction step (usually slowly over a few hours at room temperature, more rapidly in a few minutes at higher temperatures) into [[aluminum oxide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:

:2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 AlO(OH) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The aluminum oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the metallic aluminum against aggressive chemical reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of aluminum oxide is usually not homogeneous. It forms a complex multilayer structured laminate of amorphous, crystalline and porous crystalline aluminum oxide mostly covered with small residual parts of unconverted aluminum hydroxide. For this reason, in the formation of the anode foil, the oxide film is structured by a special chemical treatment so that either an amorphous oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The amorphous oxide variety yields higher mechanical and physical stability and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.
[[File:Formierspanng und Schichtdicke.jpg|thumb|left|The thickness of the effective dielectric is proportional to the forming voltage]]
Amorphous oxide has a dielectric ratio of ~ 1.4&amp;nbsp;nm/V. Compared to crystalline aluminum oxide, which has a dielectric ratio of ~1.0&amp;nbsp;nm/V, the amorphous variety has a 40% lower capacitance at the same anode surface.&lt;ref name=Nano /&gt; The disadvantage of crystalline oxide is its greater sensitivity to tensile stress, which may lead to microcracks when subjected to mechanical (winding) or thermal (soldering) stressors during the post-forming processes.

The various properties of oxide structures affect the subsequent characteristics of the electrolytic capacitors. Anode foils with amorphous oxide are primarily used for electrolytic capacitors with stable long-life characteristics, for capacitors with low leakage current values, and for e-caps with rated voltages up to about 100 volts. Capacitors with higher voltages, for example photoflash capacitors, usually containing anode foils with crystalline oxide.&lt;ref name=Parler&gt;S. Parler, Cornell Dubilier CDE, "Heating in Aluminum Electrolytic Strobe and Photoflash Capacitors" [http://www.cde.com/resources/technical-papers/strobe.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the thickness of the effective dielectric is proportional to the forming voltage, the dielectric thickness can be tailored to the rated voltage of the capacitor. For example, for low voltage types a 10&amp;nbsp;V electrolytic capacitor has a dielectric thickness of only about 0.014&amp;nbsp;µm, a 100&amp;nbsp;V electrolytic capacitor of only about 0.14&amp;nbsp;µm. Thus, the dielectric strength also influences the size of the capacitor. However, due to standardized safety margins the actual forming voltage of electrolytic capacitors is higher than the rated voltage of the component.

Aluminum anode foils are manufactured as so-called "mother rolls" of about 500&amp;nbsp;mm in width. They are pre-formed for the desired rated voltage and with the desired oxide layer structure. To produce the capacitors, the anode widths and lengths, as required for a capacitor, have to be cut from the mother roll.&lt;ref&gt;Rubycon, Technical Notes for Electrolytic Capacitor, 2. Manufacture of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor [http://www.rubycon.co.jp/de/products/alumi/pdf/Process.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cathode ===
[[File:Al-Elko-Anodenfolie.jpg|thumb|150px|Anode and cathode foils are manufactured as so called "mother rolls", from which the widths and lengths are cut off, as required for capacitor production]]

The second aluminum foil in the electrolytic capacitor, called the "cathode foil", serves to make electrical contact with the electrolyte. This foil has a somewhat lower degree of purity, about 99.8%. It is always provided with a very thin oxide layer, which arises from the contact of the aluminum surface with the air in a natural way. In order to reduce the contact resistance to the electrolyte and to make it difficult for oxide formation during discharging, the cathode foil is alloyed with metals such as [[copper]], [[silicon]], or [[titanium]]. The cathode foil is also etched to enlarge the surface.

Because of the extremely thin oxide layer, which corresponds to a voltage proof of about 1.5&amp;nbsp;V, their specific capacitance is, however, much higher than that of anode foils.&lt;ref name="KDK"/&gt; To justify the need for a large surface capacitance of the cathode foil see the section on charge/discharge stability below.

The cathode foils, as the anode foils, are manufactured as so-called "mother rolls", from which widths and lengths are cut off, as required, for capacitor production.

=== Electrolyte ===
The electrolytic capacitor got its name from the electrolyte, the conductive liquid inside the capacitor. As a liquid it can be adapted to the porous structure of the anode and the grown oxide layer with the same shape and form as a "tailor-made" cathode. An electrolyte always consists of a mixture of [[solvent]]s and additives to meet given requirements. The main electrical property of the electrolyte is its conductivity, which is physically an [[ion]]-conductivity in liquids. In addition to the good conductivity of operating electrolytes, various other requirements are, among other things, chemical stability, high [[flash point]], chemical compatibility with aluminum, low [[viscosity]], low [[environmental impact]] and low costs. The electrolyte should also provide oxygen for forming and self-healing processes, and all this within a temperature range as wide as possible. This diversity of requirements for the liquid electrolyte results in a wide variety of proprietary solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Non-aqueous Electrolytes and Their Characteristics, FaradNet Electrolytic Capacitors, Part III: Chapter 10 [http://www.faradnet.com/deeley/chapt_10.htm#index#index]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elna, Principles, 3. Electrolyte, Table 2: An Example of the Composition of the Electrolyte {{cite web|url=http://www.elna.co.jp/en/capacitor/alumi/principle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053235/http://www.elna.co.jp/en/capacitor/alumi/principle.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrolytic systems used today can be roughly summarized into three main groups:

* Electrolytes based on ethylene glycol and boric acid. In these so-called glycol or [[borax]] electrolyte an unwanted chemical crystal water reaction occurs according to the scheme: "acid + alcohol" gives "ester + water". These borax electrolytes are standard electrolytes, long in use, and with a water content between 5 and 20%. They work at a maximum temperature of 85&amp;nbsp;°C or 105&amp;nbsp;°C in the entire voltage range up to 600&amp;nbsp;V. Even with these capacitors, the aggressiveness of the water must be prevented by appropriate measures.&lt;ref name=Alfonso/&gt;
* Almost anhydrous electrolytes based on organic solvents, such as [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF), [[dimethylacetamide]] (DMA), or [[γ-butyrolactone]] (GBL). These capacitors with organic solvent electrolytes are suitable for temperature ranges from 105&amp;nbsp;°C, 125&amp;nbsp;°C or 150&amp;nbsp;°C, have low leakage current values and have very good long-term capacitor behavior.
* Water based electrolytes with high water content, up to 70% water for so-called "low-impedance", "low-ESR" or "high-ripple-current" electrolytic capacitors with rated voltages up to 100 V&lt;ref name=Uzawa /&gt; for low-cost mass-market applications. The aggressiveness of the water for aluminum must be prevented with suitable additives.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

Since the amount of liquid electrolyte during the operating time of the capacitors decreases over time through self-healing and by diffusion through the seal, the electrical parameters of the capacitors may be adversely affected, limiting the service life or lifetime of "wet" electrolytic capacitors, see the section on lifetime below.

=== Separator ===
The anode and cathode foils must be protected from direct contact with each other because such contact, even at relatively low voltages, may lead to a short circuit. In case of direct contact of both foils the oxide layer on the anode surface gives no protection. A spacer or separator made of a special highly absorbent paper with high purity protects the two metal foils from direct contact. This capacitor paper also serves as a reservoir for the electrolyte to extend the lifetime of the capacitor.

The thickness of the spacer depends on the rated voltage of the electrolytic capacitor. It is up to 100&amp;nbsp;V between 30 and 75&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name="Thiesbürger"&gt;K. H. Thiesbürger: ''Der Elektrolyt-Kondensator''., S.&amp;nbsp;88–91, 4. Auflage, Roederstein, Landshut 1991 ({{OCLC|313492506}}).&lt;/ref&gt; For higher voltages, several layers of paper (duplex paper) are used to increase the breakdown strength.

=== Encapsulation ===
[[File:Elkosobrust.jpg|thumb|View of three different imprinted predetermined breaking points (pressure relief vents) on the bottom of cases of radial electrolytic capacitors]]

The encapsulation of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is also made of aluminum in order to avoid [[galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions, normally with an aluminum case (can, tub). For radial electrolytic capacitors it is connected across the electrolyte with a non-defined resistance to the cathode (ground). For axial electrolytic capacitors, however, the housing is specifically designed with a direct contact to the cathode.

In case of a malfunction, overload or wrong polarity operating inside the electrolytic capacitor housing, substantial gas pressure can arise. The tubs are designed to open a pressure relief vent and release high pressure gas, including parts of the electrolyte. This vent protects against bursting, explosion or fly away of the metal tub.

For smaller housings the pressure relief vent is carved in the bottom or the notch of the tub. Larger capacitors like screw-terminal capacitors have a lockable overpressure vent and must be mounted in an upright position.

=== Sealing ===
The sealing materials of aluminum electrolytic capacitors depend on the different styles. For larger screw-terminal and snap-in capacitors the sealing washer is made of a plastic material. Axial electrolytic capacitors usually have a sealing washer made of phenolic resin laminated with a layer of rubber. Radial electrolytic capacitors use a rubber plug with a very dense structure. All sealing materials must be inert to the chemical parts of the electrolyte and may not contain soluble compounds that could lead to contamination of the electrolyte. To avoid leakage, the electrolyte must not be aggressive to the sealing material.

== Production ==
[[File:Al-e-cap-production-flow.jpg|thumb|center|500px| Process flow diagram for production of radial aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte]]

The production process starts with mother rolls. First, the etched, roughened and pre-formed anode foil on the mother roll as well as the spacer paper and the cathode foil are cut to the required width.&lt;ref name=PanProd/&gt;&lt;ref name=CapXon/&gt; The foils are fed to an automatic winder, which makes a wound section in a consecutive operation involving three sequential steps: terminal welding, winding, and length cutting. In the next production step the wound section fixed at the lead out terminals is soaked with electrolyte under vacuum impregnation. The impregnated winding is then built into an aluminum case, provided with a rubber sealing disc, and mechanically tightly sealed by curling. Thereafter, the capacitor is provided with an insulating shrink sleeve film. This optically ready capacitor is then contacted at rated voltage in a high temperature post-forming device for healing all the dielectric defects resulting from the cutting and winding procedure. After post-forming, a 100% final measurement of capacitance, leakage current, and impedance takes place. Taping closes the manufacturing process; the capacitors are ready for delivery.

[[Image:Early electrolytic capacitor.jpg|thumb|The first published electrolytic capacitor from 1914. It had a capacitance of around 2 microfarads.]]
[[File:Elektrolytkondensator-Flüssigkeits-Ko-Wiki-07-02-20.jpg|thumb|View of the anode of a "wet" aluminum electrolytic capacitor, Bell System Technique 1929]]

In 1875, French researcher [[Eugène Ducretet]] discovered that certain "valve metals" (aluminum and others) can form an oxide layer that blocks an electric current from flowing in one direction but allows it to flow in the reverse direction.

[[Karol Pollak]], a producer of accumulators, found out that the oxide layer on an aluminum anode remained stable in a neutral or alkaline electrolyte, even when the power was switched off. In 1896 he obtained a patent for an ''Electric liquid capacitor with aluminium electrodes'' (de: ''Elektrischer Flüssigkeitskondensator mit Aluminiumelektroden'') based on the idea of using the oxide layer in a polarized capacitor in combination with a neutral or slightly alkaline electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;

The first electrolytic capacitors realized industrially consisted of a metallic box used as cathode, filled with a [[Sodium borate|borax]] electrolyte dissolved in water, in which a folded aluminum anode plate was inserted. Applying a DC voltage from outside, an oxide layer was formed on the surface of the anode. The advantage of these capacitors was that they were significantly smaller and cheaper than all other capacitors at this time with respect to realized capacitance value. This construction with different styles of anode construction but with a case as cathode and a container as the electrolyte was used up to the 1930s and was called a "wet" electrolytic capacitor, referring to its high water content.

[[File:Historische Anodenformen.jpg|thumb|left|Some various forms of historical anode structures. For all of these anodes the outer metallic container serves as the cathode]]

The first common application of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers in the late 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the [[valve amplifier]] technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and oiled silk [[film capacitor]]s were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.

[[File:Dry Electrolytic capacitor, pic5.JPG|thumb|A "dry" electrolytic capacitor with 100&amp;nbsp;µF and 150&amp;nbsp;V]]

The ancestor of the modern electrolytic capacitor was patented by [[Samuel Ruben]] in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;US Patent Nr. 1774455, ''Electric condenser'', filed October 19, 1925, granted August 26, 1930 [https://www.google.com/patents/US1774455]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Samuel Ruben: Inventor, Scholar, and Benefactor" by Kathryn R. Bullock [http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/fal/fal06/fall06_p16-17.pdf PDF www.electrochem.org]&lt;/ref&gt; who teamed with [[Philip Mallory]], the founder of the battery company that is now known as [[Duracell|Duracell International]]. Ruben's idea adopted the stacked construction of a [[silver mica capacitor]]. He introduced a separate second foil to contact the electrolyte adjacent the anode foil instead of using the electrolyte-filled container as the cathode of the capacitor. The stacked second foil got its own terminal additional to the anode terminal and the container had no longer an electrical function. This type of electrolytic capacitor with one anode foil separated from a cathode foil by a liquid or gel-like electrolyte of a non-aqueous nature, which is therefore dry in the sense of having a very low water content, became known as the "dry" type of electrolytic capacitor.&lt;ref name="Deeley"&gt;P. McK. Deeley, "Electrolytic Capacitors", The Cornell-Dubilier Electric Corp. South Plainfield New Jersey, 1938 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Electrolytic_Capacitors.html?id=T7I4AAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt; This invention, together with the invention of wound foils separated with a paper spacer 1927 by A.

[[William Dubilier]], whose first patent for electrolytic capacitors was filed in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;William Dubilier, Electric Condenser, US Patent 468787&lt;/ref&gt; industrialized the new ideas for electrolytic capacitors and started large-scale commercial production in 1931 in the Cornell-Dubilier (CD) factory in Plainfield, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Deeley /&gt; At the same time in Berlin, Germany, the "Hydra-Werke", an [[AEG]] company, started the production of electrolytic capacitors in large quantities.

Already in his patent application of 1886 Pollak wrote that the capacitance of the capacitor increased if the surface of the anode foil was roughened. A number of methods have since been developed for roughening the anode surface, mechanical methods like sand blasting or scratching, and chemical etching with acids and acid salts forced by high currents.&lt;ref name="Boggs"&gt;J. Ho, T. R. Jow, S. Boggs, Historical Introduction to Capacitor Technology, Electrical Insulation Magazine, IEEE (Volume:26, Issue: 1) January 19, 2010, {{ISSN|0883-7554}}, {{doi|10.1109/MEI.2010.5383924}}, [http://www.ifre.re.kr/board/filedown.php?seq=179 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these methods were developed in the CD factory between 1931 and 1938. Today (2014), electro-chemically etching of low voltage foils can achieve up to a 200 fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface.&lt;ref name="Voltage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KDK"/&gt; Progress relating to the etching process is the reason for the ongoing reduction in the dimensions of aluminum electrolytic capacitors over the past decades.

[[File:Alu-Elko-Miniaturisierung.jpg|thumb|Miniaturization of aluminum electrolytic capacitors from 1960 to 2005 in case 10x16mm up to factor ten]]

The period after World War II is associated with a rapid development in radio and television technology as well as in industrial applications, which had great influence on production quantities but also on styles, sizes and series diversification of electrolytic capacitors. New electrolytes based on organic liquids reduced leakage currents and ESR, broadened temperature ranges and increased lifetimes. Corrosion phenomena caused by chlorine and water could be avoided by a higher purity manufacturing processes and by using additives in the electrolytes.

The development of [[Tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] in the early 1950s&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Taylor, H. E. Haring, J. Electrochem. Soc. 103 (1956) 611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. A. McLean, Power, F. S., Proc. Inst. Radio Engrs. 44 (1956) 872&lt;/ref&gt; with [[manganese dioxide]] as solid electrolyte, which has a 10 times better conductivity than all other types of non-solid electrolytes, also influenced the development of aluminum electrolytic capacitors. In 1964 the first aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte ([[Solid aluminum capacitor (SAL)]]) appeared on the market, developed by [[Philips]].&lt;ref&gt;Valvo-Handbuch Einzelteile 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

The decades from 1970 to 1990 were marked by the development of various new professional aluminum electrolytic capacitor series with f.&amp;nbsp;e. very low leakage currents or with long life characteristics or for higher temperatures up to 125&amp;nbsp;°C, which were specifically suited to certain industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;Philips Data Handbook PA01, 1986, the first 125&amp;nbsp;°C series "118 AHT"&lt;/ref&gt; The great diversity of the many series of aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes up to now (2014) is an indicator of the adaptability of the capacitors to meet different industrial requirements.

[[File:Electrolytes-electric conductivity.jpg|thumb|left|Conductivity of non-solid and solid electrolytes]]

In 1983 a further reduction of the ESR was achieved by [[Sanyo]] with its "[[OS-CON]]" aluminum electrolytic capacitors. These capacitors use as solid organic conductor the charge transfer salt TTF-TCNQ ([[tetracyanoquinodimethane]]), which provided an improvement in conductivity by a factor of 10 with respect to the manganese dioxide electrolyte.

The ESR values of TCNQ-capacitors were significantly reduced by the discovery of [[conducting polymer]]s by [[Alan J. Heeger]], [[Alan MacDiarmid]] and [[Hideki Shirakawa]].&lt;ref&gt;A. G.

electrolytic capacitor, on the market. These electrolytic capacitors with polymer electrolytes achieved ESR values low enough to compete with [[Ceramic capacitor|ceramic multilayer capacitors]] (MLCCs). They were still less expensive than tantalum capacitors and were a short time later used in devices with a flat design, such as [[laptop]]s and [[cell phone]]s.

New water-based electrolytes were developed in Japan from the mid-1980s with the goal of reducing ESR for inexpensive non-solid electrolytic capacitors. Water is inexpensive, an effective solvent for electrolytes, and significantly improves the conductivity of the electrolyte.

The Japanese manufacturer [[Rubycon Corporation|Rubycon]] was a leader in the development of new water-based electrolyte systems with enhanced conductivity in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Uzawa&gt;Shigeru Uzawa, Akihiko Komat-u, Tetsushi Ogawara, Rubycon Corporation, Ultra Low Impedance Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor with Water based Electrolyte {{cite web|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200217/000020021702A0509168.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524092432/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200217/000020021702A0509168.php |archivedate=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new series of non-solid capacitors with water-based electrolyte was called in the data sheets "Low-ESR", "Low-Impedance", "Ultra-Low-Impedance" or "High-Ripple Current" series.

In these capacitors the water reacts quite aggressively and even violently with aluminum, accompanied by strong heat and gas development in the capacitor, and often leads to the explosion of the capacitor.

== Electrical parameters ==
[[File:Electrolytic capacitor model.svg|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of an electrolytic capacitor]]
The electrical characteristics of capacitors are harmonized by the international generic specification IEC 60384-1. In this standard, the electrical characteristics of capacitors are described by an idealized series-equivalent circuit with electrical components that model all ohmic losses, capacitive and inductive parameters of an electrolytic capacitor:

* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor,
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]], which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESR".
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]], which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESL". 
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;leakage&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] that represents the leakage current

=== Capacitance standard values and tolerances ===
[[File:E-cap-capacitance versus temperature.jpg|thumb|Typical capacitance as a function of temperature]]
The basic unit of electrolytic capacitors capacitance is the [[farad|microfarad]] (μF, or less correctly uF).

The capacitance value specified in manufacturers' data sheets is called the rated capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or nominal capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; and is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. Standardized measuring conditions for electrolytic capacitors are an [[Alternating current|AC]] measurement with 0.5&amp;nbsp;V at a frequency of 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz and a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C.

The capacitance value of an electrolytic capacitor depends on the measuring frequency and temperature. The value at a measuring frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz is about 10% less than the 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz value. Therefore, the capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors are not directly comparable and differ from those of [[film capacitor]]s or [[ceramic capacitor]]s, whose capacitance is measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or higher.

Measured with an AC measuring method with 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz the measured capacitance value is the closest value to the electrical charge stored in the capacitor. The stored charge is measured with a special discharge method and is called [[Direct current|DC]] capacitance. The DC capacitance is about 10% higher than the 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz AC capacitance. The DC capacitance is of interest for discharge applications like [[photoflash]].

The percentage of allowed deviation of the measured capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance tolerance. Electrolytic capacitors are available in different tolerance series, whose values are specified in the [[E-series of preferred numbers|E series]] specified in IEC 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC 60062.
* rated capacitance, [[E-series of preferred numbers|E3 series]], tolerance ±20%, letter code "M"
* rated capacitance, [[E-series of preferred numbers|E6 series]], tolerance ±20%, letter code "M"
* rated capacitance, [[E12 series]], tolerance ±10%, letter code "K"

The required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application. Electrolytic capacitors that are often used for [[Electronic filter|filtering]] and [[Decoupling capacitor|bypassing]] capacitors do not need narrow tolerances because they are not used for accurate frequency applications, such as for [[oscillator]]s.

=== Rated and category voltage ===
[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|Relation between rated and category voltage and rated and category temperature]]

In IEC 60384-1 the allowed operating voltage is called the "rated voltage" U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or the "nominal voltage" U&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;. The rated voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range.

The voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors, which is directly proportional to the dielectric layer thickness,&lt;ref name=Voltage /&gt; decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a high temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types, therefore, the IEC standard specifies a second "temperature derated voltage" for a higher temperature range, the "category voltage" U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage, peak pulse voltage or superimposed AC voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range.

=== Surge voltage ===
Aluminum electrolytic capacitors can be applied for a short time with an overvoltage, also called a surge voltage. The surge voltage indicates the maximum voltage value within the temperature range that may be applied during the lifetime at a frequency of 1000 cycles (with a dwell time of 30 seconds and a pause of 5 minutes and 30 seconds in each instance) without causing any visible damage to the capacitor or a capacitance change of more than 15%.

For capacitors with a rated voltage of ≤ 315 volts the surge voltage is 1.15 times the rated voltage, and for capacitors with a rated voltage exceeding 315 volts the surge voltage is 1.10 times the rated voltage.

=== Transient voltage ===

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are relatively insensitive to high and short-term transient voltages higher than the surge voltage, if the frequency and the energy content of the transients is low. This ability depends on the rated voltage and component size. Low energy transient voltages lead to a voltage limitation similar to a [[zener diode]].

The electrochemical oxide forming processes take place when voltage in correct polarity is applied and generates an additional oxide when transients arise. This formation is accompanied with heat and hydrogen gas generation. This is tolerable if the energy content of the transient is low. However, when a transient peak voltage causes an electric field strength that is too high for the dielectric, it can directly cause a short circuit. An unambiguous and general specification of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application has to be carefully approved.

Electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte cannot withstand transients or peak voltages higher than the surge voltage. Transients for this type of electrolytic capacitor may destroy the component.

=== Reverse voltage ===
[[File:Exploded Electrolytic Capacitor.jpg|thumb|An exploded electrolytic capacitor on a PCB]]
Electrolytic capacitors are polarized capacitors and generally require an anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage. However, the cathode foil of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is provided with a very thin, natural air-originated oxide layer. This oxide layer has a voltage proof of approximately 1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;Product Information: Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors FAQ/Capacitor, Power Supply Units RUBYCON CORPORATION {{cite web|url=http://www.rubycon.co.jp/en/products/alumi/faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210656/http://www.rubycon.co.jp/en/products/alumi/faq.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte can withstand a very small reverse voltage and, for example, can be measured with an AC voltage of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;V, as specified in relevant standards.

At a reverse voltage lower than −1.5&amp;nbsp;V at room temperature, the cathode aluminum foil begins to build up an oxide layer corresponding to the applied voltage. This is aligned with generating hydrogen gas with increasing pressure. At the same time the oxide layer on the anode foil begins dissolution of the oxide, which weakens the voltage proof. It is now a question of the outside circuit whether the increasing gas pressure from oxidization leads to bursting of the case, or the weakened anode oxide leads to a breakdown with a [[short circuit]]. If the outside circuit is high-ohmic the capacitor fails and the vent opens due to high gas pressure. If the outside circuit is low-ohmic, an internal short circuit is more probable. In every case a reverse voltage lower than −1.5&amp;nbsp;V at room temperature may cause the component to catastrophically fail due to a dielectric breakdown or overpressure, which causes the capacitor to burst, often in a spectacularly dramatic fashion. Modern electrolytic capacitors have a safety vent that is typically either a scored section of the case or a specially designed end seal to vent the hot gas/liquid, but ruptures can still be dramatic.

To minimize the likelihood of a polarized electrolytic being incorrectly inserted into a circuit, polarity has to be very clearly indicated on the case, see the section headed "Polarity marking".

Special bipolar capacitors designed for AC operation, usually referred to as "bipolar", "non-polarized" or "NP" types, are available. In these, the capacitors have two anode foils of opposite polarity connected in series. On each of the alternate halves of the AC cycle, one anode acts as a blocking dielectric, preventing reverse voltage from damaging the opposite anode. But these bipolar electrolytic capacitors are not adaptable for main AC applications instead of power capacitors with metallized polymer film or paper dielectric.

=== Impedance===
[[File:Kondensator Zeigerdiagramm-1-.svg|thumb|right|120px|Simplified series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor for higher frequencies (above); vector diagram with electrical reactances X&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt; and X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and resistance ESR and for illustration the impedance Z and dissipation factor tan δ]]

In general, a capacitor is seen as a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[resistor]]. Especially aluminum electrolytic capacitors are used in many applications as a [[decoupling capacitor]]s to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground or for [[capacitive coupling]] of audio AC signals. Then the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is as important as the capacitance value.

The impedance is the vector sum of [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]; it describes the phase difference and the ratio of amplitudes between sinusoidally varying voltage and sinusoidally varying current at a given frequency in an AC circuit. In this sense impedance can be used like Ohm's law

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\hat u}{\hat \imath} = \frac{U_\mathrm{eff}}{I_\mathrm{eff}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, impedance is a frequency-dependent AC resistance and possesses both magnitude and [[Phasor|phase]] at a particular frequency. 
[[File:Kondensator-Impedanzverläufe-Wiki-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Typical impedance curves for different capacitance values as a function of frequency showing the typical form with decreasing impedance values below resonance and increasing values above resonance. The higher the capacitance, the lower the resonance frequency.]]

In capacitor data sheets, only the impedance magnitude |Z| is specified, and simply written as "Z". In this sense the impedance is a measure of the capacitor's ability to pass alternating currents.

Impedance can be calculated using the idealized components of a capacitor's series-equivalent circuit, including an ideal capacitor &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; a resistor &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle ESR&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; and an inductance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle ESL&lt;/math&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In this case the impedance at the angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is therefore given by the geometric (complex) addition of ESR, by a capacitive reactance ([[Capacitance]])

: &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

and by an inductive reactance ([[Inductance]])

: &lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z=\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\mathrm{C} + (-X_\mathrm{L}))^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_L&lt;/math&gt; have the same value (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_C=X_L&lt;/math&gt;), then the impedance is only determined by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle ESR&lt;/math&gt;.

The impedance specified in the data sheets of various capacitors often shows typical curves for different capacitance values. The impedance at the resonant frequency defines the best working point for coupling or decoupling circuits. The higher the capacitance the lower the operable frequency range. Due to their large capacitance values, aluminum electrolytic capacitors have relatively good decoupling properties in the lower frequency range up to about 1&amp;nbsp;MHz or a little more. This and the relatively low price is often the reason for using electrolytic capacitors in 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz [[Power supply|standard]] or [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]].

===ESR and dissipation factor tan δ===
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery caption="Typical impedance and ESR curves as a function of frequency and temperature" class="centered" mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the terminal resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes, the electrolyte resistance, and the [[dielectric losses]] in the dielectric oxide layer.&lt;ref&gt;A. Berduque, Kemet, Low ESR Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitors for Medium to High Voltage Applications, [http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/10/2011-03%20CARTS%20-%20Low%20ESR%20Aluminum%20Electrolytic%20Capacitors%20for%20Mid-to-High%20Voltage%20Applications.pdf] PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

ESR depends on temperature and frequency. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte the ESR generally decreases with increasing frequency and temperature.&lt;ref name=DFR&gt;[http://www.dfrsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Uprating-of-Electrolytic-Capacitors.pdf Joelle Arnold, Uprating of Electrolytic Capacitors, DfR Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; ESR influences the remaining superimposed AC [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] behind smoothing and may influence circuit functionality. Related to the capacitor, ESR is accountable for internal heat generation if a [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple current]] flows over the capacitor. This internal heat reduces capacitor lifetime.

Referring to the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the impedance values of electrolytic capacitors are measured at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, depending on the capacitance and voltage of the capacitor.

For aluminum electrolytic capacitors, for historical reasons sometimes the [[dissipation factor]] tan δ is specified in the relevant data sheets instead of the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle ESR&lt;/math&gt; . The dissipation factor is determined by the tangent of the phase angle between the capacitive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_C&lt;/math&gt; minus the inductive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_L&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle ESR&lt;/math&gt;. If the inductance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle ESL&lt;/math&gt; is small, the dissipation factor for a given frequency can be approximated as:
: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta = \mbox{ESR} \cdot \omega C&lt;/math&gt;

=== Ripple current ===
[[File:rippelstrom mit Schaltplan.png|thumb|The superimposed (DC biased) AC ripple current flows across the smoothing capacitor C1 of a power supply and causes internal heat generation corresponding to the capacitor's ''ESR'']]

A [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple current]] is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation. It arises, for example, in power supplies (including [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as biased charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.

Due to the ESR of the capacitor the ripple current I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; causes electrical power losses ''P&lt;sub&gt;V el&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
:&lt;math&gt; P_{V el} = I_R^2 \cdot\ ESR&lt;/math&gt;
which result in heat generation inside the capacitor winding core.

This internally generated heat, together with ambient temperature and possibly other external heat sources, leads to a capacitor core temperature whose hottest area is located in the winding, having a temperature difference of ''Δ T'' compared with the ambient temperature. This heat has to be distributed as thermal losses ''P&lt;sub&gt;V th&lt;/sub&gt;'' over the capacitor's surface ''A'' and the thermal resistance ''β'' to the ambient environment. 
: &lt;math&gt; P_{V th} = \Delta T \cdot A \cdot \beta&lt;/math&gt;
The thermal resistance β depends on the case size of the relevant capacitor and if applicable on additional cooling conditions.

[[File:E-cap-ESR-heat dissipation.jpg|thumb|left|Ripple current causes internal heat, which has to be dissipated to the ambient environment]]

If the internally generated power losses ''P&lt;sub&gt;V el&lt;/sub&gt;'' dissipated by [[thermal radiation]], [[convection]], and [[thermal conduction]] to the ambient environment correspond to the thermal losses ''P&lt;sub&gt;V th&lt;/sub&gt;,'', then a temperature balance between capacitor temperature and ambient temperature is given.&lt;ref name=Jianglife&gt;A. Albertsen, Jianghai, Electrolytic Capacitor Lifetime Estimation [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/1-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Lifetime-Estimation-long-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the specified rated value for maximum ripple current in manufacturers' data sheets is calculated for a heating the capacitor core (cell) of 10&amp;nbsp;°C for 85&amp;nbsp;°C series, 5&amp;nbsp;°C for 105&amp;nbsp;°C series and 3&amp;nbsp;°C for 125&amp;nbsp;°C series.

The rated ripple current of aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte corresponds with the specified lifetime of the capacitor series. This current may flow permanent over the capacitor up to the maximum temperature during the specified or calculated time. Ripple current lower than specified or forced cooling&lt;ref name=Jianglife /&gt; lengthen the capacitor's lifetime.

The lifetime of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte depends on the evaporation rate and therefore on the core temperature of the capacitor. With forced cooling or special positioning of the capacitor on the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] the lifetime can be influenced positively.&lt;ref name=Jianglife /&gt;

The ripple current is specified as an effective (RMS) value at 100 or 120&amp;nbsp;Hz or at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz at upper category temperature. Non-sinusoidal ripple currents have to be analyzed and separated into their single sinusoidal frequencies by means of [[Fourier analysis]] and summarized by squared addition of the single currents.&lt;ref name="VishayIAC"&gt;Vishay, Aluminium capacitors, Introduction, Revision: 10-Sep-13 1 Document Number: 28356, Chapter Storage, page 7 [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126094004/http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf |date=2016-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_R=\sqrt{{i_1}^2 + {i_2}^2  +  {i_3}^2 + {i_n}^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

Periodically appearing high current pulses, which may be much higher than the rated ripple current, have to be analyzed in the same matter.

Because the ESR decreases with increasing frequencies. the ripple current data sheet value, specified at 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz, can be higher at higher frequencies. In cases like this manufacturers specify correction factors for ripple current values at higher frequencies. For example, the ripple current at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz can usually be approximated to be 30 to 40% higher than the 100/120 value.

If the ripple current exceeds the rated value, the corresponding heat generation exceeds the capacitor's temperature limit and may destroy the internal structure (voltage proof, boiling point) of the capacitors. Then the components tend to short circuiting, vent opening or explosion. Ripple currents higher than rated values are possible only with forced cooling.&lt;ref name=Jianglife /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vishaypower /&gt;

===Charge/discharge stability===
[[Image:KATHODEN-Formierung.png|thumb|During discharging the current flow direction in the capacitor changes, the cathode (-) gets an anode (+), two internal voltages with opposite polarity arise. The capacitor construction rule - C&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; - ensures no post-forming of the cathode foil during discharging.]]

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes always contain, in addition to the anode foil, a cathode foil that serves as electrical contact to the electrolyte. This cathode foil is provided with a very thin, natural, air-originated oxide layer, which act also as a dielectric. Thus, the capacitor construction forms a series circuit of two capacitors, the capacitance of the anode foil C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and the cathode foil C&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;. As described above, the capacitance of the capacitor C&lt;sub&gt;e-cap&lt;/sub&gt; is mainly determined by the anode capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; when the cathode capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; is approximately 10 times higher than the anode capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes normally can be charged up to the rated voltage without any current limitation. This property is a result of the limited ion movability in the liquid electrolyte, which slows down the voltage ramp across the dielectric, and the capacitor's ESR.

During discharging the internal construction of the capacitor reverses the internal polarity. The cathode (-) gets an anode (+), and changes the current flow direction. Two voltages arise over these electrode. In principle the voltage distribution over both electrodes behaves as the reciprocally CV product of each electrode.

The design rule of high cathode capacitance assures that the voltage appearing over the cathode during discharge is not higher than roughly 1.5&amp;nbsp;V, that is its natural air-originated voltage proof. No further post-forming of the cathode foil takes place, which may lead to capacitance degradation.&lt;ref name="Thiesbürger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubycon, Technical Notes for Electrolytic Capacitor, Charge and Discharge Application of Electrolytic Capacitor, [http://www.rubycon.co.jp/de/products/alumi/pdf/ChargeDischarge.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Then the capacitors are discharge-proof.

===Current surge, peak or pulse current===
Small (diameter &lt;25&amp;nbsp;mm) aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes can normally be charged up to the rated voltage without any current surge, peak or pulse limitation up to a peak current value of about 50&amp;nbsp;A. This property is a result of the limited ion movability in the liquid electrolyte, which slows down the voltage ramp across the dielectric, and the capacitor's ESR. Only the frequency of peaks integrated over time must not exceed the maximal specified ripple current.

===Leakage current===
[[File:Leakage current curves.svg|thumb|right|general leakage behavior of electrolytic capacitors: leakage current &lt;math&gt;I_{leak}&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; depending of the kind of electrolyte

[[File:Leakage current 1000-35.jpg|thumb|right|Typical leakage current curve of an industrial long-life electrolytic capacitor with non-solid electrolyte]] 
A characteristic property of electrolytic capacitors is the "leakage current". This [[Direct current|DC current]] is represented by the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors, and flows if a voltage is applied.

The leakage current includes all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes and mechanical damage and is the DC current that can pass through the dielectric after applying a voltage in correct polarity. It depends on the capacitance value, on applied voltage and temperature of the capacitor, on measuring time, on the kind of electrolyte, and on preconditions like previous storage time without voltage applied or thermic stress from soldering. (All non-solid electrolytic capacitors needs a recovery time of some hours after soldering before measuring the leakage current. Non-solid chip capacitors need a recovery time after reflow soldering of about 24 hours.) Leakage current is reduced by applying operational voltage by self-healing processes.

The leakage current drops in the first minutes after applying DC voltage. In this time the dielectric oxide layer can repair all weaknesses by building up new layers in a self-healing process. The time it takes leakage current to drop generally depends on the kind of electrolyte. Solid electrolytes' leakage current drops much faster than in the case of non-solid types, but it remain at a somewhat higher level. Wet electrolytic capacitors with high water content electrolytes in the first minutes generally have higher leakage current than those with organic electrolyte, but after several minutes they reach the same level. Although the leakage current of electrolytic capacitors is higher compared with the current flow over the insulation resistance at ceramic or film capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non-solid electrolytic capacitors can take several weeks.

The leakage current ''I&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;'' specification in manufacturers' data sheets refers to the capacitor's capacitance value ''C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;,'' rated voltage ''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;,'' a correlation factor and a minimum current value. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{Leak} = 0{.}01\,\mathrm{{A}\over{ V \cdot F}} \cdot U_\mathrm R \cdot C_\mathrm R + 3\,\mathrm{\mu A}&lt;/math&gt;

After a measuring time of 2 or 5 minutes, depending on the data sheet specification, the measured leakage current value has to be lower than the calculated value. Normally the leakage current is always lower the longer the capacitor voltage is applied. The leakage current during operation after, for example, one hour is the operational leakage current. This value depends strongly on the manufacturer's series characteristics. It could be lower than 1/100 of the specified value.

The leakage current depends on the applied voltage and the ambient temperature. The value during continuous operation at 85&amp;nbsp;°C is approximately four times higher than at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. Otherwise the value is approximately one half, reducing the applied voltage to 70% of the rated voltage.&lt;ref name="VishayIAC"/&gt;

Non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors that leakage current after an operation time of, for example, one hour remain on a higher level than specified. Mostly they have been mechanically damaged internally due to high mechanical stress during mounting.

=== Dielectric absorption (soakage) ===
{{main|Dielectric absorption}}

Dielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], "soakage" or "battery action".

Dielectric absorption may be a problem in circuits using very small currents in electronic circuits, such as long-[[time constant|time-constant]] [[integrator]]s or [[sample-and-hold]] circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datasheetarchive.com/files/national/htm/nsc03883.htm Bob Pease, Understand Capacitor Soakage to Optimize Analog Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Dielectric absorption is not a problemIn in most applications of electrolytic capacitors supporting power supply lines.

But especially for electrolytic capacitors with high rated voltage the voltage at the terminals generated by the dielectric absorption can be a safety risk to personnel or circuits. In order to prevent shocks most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before use.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.designers-guide.org/Modeling/da.pdf "Modeling Dielectric Absorption in Capacitors", by Ken Kundert]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability, lifetime and failure modes==

===Reliability (failure rate)===
[[File:Elko-Badewannenkurve-english.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Bathtub curve]] with times of "early failures", "random failures", and "wear-out failures". The time of random failures is the time of constant failure rate and corresponds with the lifetime of non-solid electrolytic capacitors.]]

The [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] prediction of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is generally expressed as a [[Failure rate]] λ, abbreviated FIT (Failures In Time). It is a measure of the number of failures per unit hour during the time of constant random failures in the [[bathtub curve]]. The flat part in the bathtub curve corresponds with the calculated lifetime or [[service life]] of non-solid electrolytic capacitors. The failure rate is used to calculate a survival probability for a desired lifetime of an electronic circuit in combination with other participating components.

FIT is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) component-hours of operation at fixed working conditions (e.g., 1000 components for 1&amp;nbsp;million hours, or 1&amp;nbsp; million components for 1000 hours (1&amp;nbsp;[[Parts-per notation|ppm]]/1000 hours) each during the period of constant random failures. This failure rate model implicitly assumes the idea of "random failure". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate. Failures are short circuits, open circuits and degradation failures (exceeding specified limits of electrical parameters).

The reciprocal value of FIT is the MTBF, the [[Mean Time Between Failures]].

The standard operating conditions for the failure rate FIT are 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5&amp;nbsp;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. For other conditions of applied voltage, current load, temperature, capacitance value, circuit resistance (for tantalum capacitors), mechanical influences and humidity the FIT figure can recalculated with acceleration factors standardized for industrial&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;IEC/EN 61709, Electric components. Reliability. Reference conditions for failure rates and stress models for conversion&lt;/ref&gt; or military&lt;ref name="everyspec.com"&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-HDBK/MIL-HDBK-0200-0299/MIL-HDBK-217F_NOTICE-2_14590/ MIL-HDBK-217F Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt; contexts. The higher the temperature and the applied voltage, the higher the failure rate.

It is good to know that for capacitors with solid electrolytes the failure rate is often expressed as per cent failed components per thousand hours (n&amp;nbsp;%/1000&amp;nbsp;h), and specified at reference conditions 85&amp;nbsp;°C and rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. That is, "n" number of failed components per 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; hours, or in FIT the ten-thousand-fold value per 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; hours but for different reference conditions. For these other conditions the "%I1000&amp;nbsp;h" figure can be recalculated with acceleration factors standardized for industrial&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; or military&lt;ref name="everyspec.com"/&gt; contexts.

Most modern aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes nowadays are very reliable components with very low failure rates, with predicted life expectancies of decades under normal conditions. It is best practice to have electrolytic capacitors pass a post-forming process step after production, similar to a "[[burn in]], so that early failures are eliminated during production. The FIT values given in data sheets are calculated from the long-time experience of the manufacturer, based on the lifetime test results. Typical reference failure rate values for aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes are for low voltages types (6.3–160&amp;nbsp;V) FIT rates in the range of 1 to 20 FIT&lt;ref&gt;Reliability of Electrolytic Capacitors, Dr. Arne Albertsen, Jianghai Europe [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/2-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Reliability-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and for high voltage types (&gt;160–550&amp;nbsp;V) FIT rates in the range of 20 to 200 FIT.&lt;ref name="CDI-Rel"&gt;S. G. Parler, Cornell Dubilier, Reliability of CDE Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors [http://www.digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/CDE_338/PDF/CDE_Reliability.pdf?redirected=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Field failure rates for aluminum capacitors are in the range of 0.5 to 20&amp;nbsp;FIT.&lt;ref name=CDI-Rel /&gt;

The data for the "failure rate" specification are based on the results of lifetime testing (endurance testing). In addition a "field failure rate" is sometimes specified. This figures comes from big customers that noticed failures in the field out of their application. Field failure rates could have much lower values. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors they are in the range of 0.5 to 20 FIT. The field failure rate values are in line with the usual orders of magnitude for electronic components.

===Lifetime, service life===
[[File:Lebensdauer-Testergebnisse-english.png|thumb|right|400px|The electrical values of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes change over time due to evaporation of the electrolyte. Reaching specified limits of the electrical parameters, the capacitors counts as "wear out failure". The graph shows this behavior in a 2000&amp;nbsp;h endurance test at 105&amp;nbsp;°C.]]

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes have an exceptional position among electronic components because they work with an electrolyte as liquid ingredient. The liquid electrolyte determines the time-dependent behavior of electrolytic capacitors. They age over time as the electrolyte evaporates. This also implies that there is a sharp decline in useful lifespan with increasing temperature. As a rule of thumb, every 10 degrees rise halves the useful life span. This very slow drying-out of the electrolyte depends on the series construction, ambient temperature, voltage and ripple current load. Lowering the electrolyte over time influences the capacitance, impedance and ESR of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and impedance and ESR increases with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. The leakage current decreases because all weaknesses are healed after the long forming time. In contrast to electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolytes, "wet" electrolytic capacitors have an "end of life" when the components reach specified maximum changes of capacitance, impedance or ESR. The time period to the "end of life" is called the "lifetime", "useful life", "load life" or "service life". It represents the time of constant failure rate in the failure rate bathtub curve.

Under normal ambient conditions electrolytic capacitors can have more than a 15-year lifetime, but this can be limited depending on the degradation behavior of the rubber bung (which is not typically aged during lifetime testing). This rating is tested with an [[accelerated aging]] test called an "endurance test" according to IEC 60384-4-1 with rated voltage at the upper category temperature.&lt;ref name="Beuth"&gt;IEC 60384-4-1, Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 4-1: Blank detail specification - Fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, Beuth Verlag [http://www.beuth.de/en/]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the challenges with this aging test is the time required to extract any meaningful results. In response to demands for long life, high temperature performance from automotive and green energy applications (solar microvinverters, LEDs, wind turbines, etc.), some capacitors require more than a year's worth of testing (10000 hours) before they can be qualified. Due to this limitation, there has been increasing interest in methodologies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/A-New-Method-for-Testing-Electrolytic-Capacitors-to-Compare-Life-Expectancy.pdf?t=1508517982007&lt;/ref&gt; to accelerate the test in a manner that still produces relevant results.

The graph at right show the behavior of the electrical parameters of aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes due to evaporation of the electrolyte in a 2000&amp;nbsp;h endurance test at 105&amp;nbsp;°C. The process of drying out is also detectable by weight loss.

After this endurance test the specified parameter limits to pass the test are, on the one hand, no total failures (short circuit, open circuit) and on the other hand, not reaching degradation failure, a reduction of capacitance over 30% and an increase of the ESR, impedance or loss factor by more than a factor of 3 compared to the initial value. Parameters of the tested component beyond these limits can be counted as evidence of degradation failure.

The testing time and temperature depend on the tested series. That is the reason for the many different lifetime specifications in the data sheets of manufacturers, which are given in the form of a time/temperature indication, for example: 2000&amp;nbsp;h/85&amp;nbsp;°C, 2000&amp;nbsp;h/105&amp;nbsp;°C, 5000&amp;nbsp;h/105&amp;nbsp;°C, 2000&amp;nbsp;h/125&amp;nbsp;°C. This figures specifies the minimum lifetime of the capacitors of a series, when exposed at the maximum temperature with applied rated voltage.

Referring to the endurance test, this specification does not include the capacitors' being loaded with the rated ripple current value. But the additional internal heat of 3 to 10&amp;nbsp;K, depending on the series, which is generated by the ripple current is usually taken into account by the manufacturer due to safety margins when interpreting the results of its endurance tests. A test with an actual applied ripple current is affordable for any manufacturer.

A capacitor's lifetime for different operational conditions can be estimated using special formulas or graphs specified in the data sheets of serious manufacturers. They use different ways achieve the specification; some provide special formulas,&lt;ref name=NCCTN&gt;NCC, Technical Note Judicious Use of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors [http://www.chemi-con.co.jp/e/catalog/pdf/al-e/al-sepa-e/001-guide/al-technote-e-170401.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Rubycon Corporation |url=http://www.rubycon.co.jp/en/products/alumi/pdf/Life.pdf |title=Life of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807080931/http://www.rubycon.co.jp/en/products/alumi/pdf/Life.pdf |archivedate=2015-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hitachi aic-europe, Explanations to the useful life, page 18 [http://www.hitachi-chem.co.jp/english/products/sds/files/e_infodenkai.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; others specify their capacitor lifetime calculation with graphs that take into account the influence of applied voltage.&lt;ref name="Jianglife"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Snap-In HU |publisher=aic-europe.com |url=http://www.aic-europe.com/snap-in-kondensatoren/snap-in-hu.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060531/http://www.aic-europe.com/snap-in-kondensatoren/snap-in-hu.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EpcosGTI&gt;Epcos, Aluminum electrolytic capacitors, General technical informations [http://www.epcos.de/blob/185386/download/4/pdf-generaltechnicalinformation.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle for calculating the time under operational conditions is the so-called “10-degree-rule”.&lt;ref&gt;Panasonic (10-degree-rule; [http://www.industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABA0000/ABA0000TE6.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214165210/http://www.industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABA0000/ABA0000TE6.pdf |date=2014-12-14 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIC Life expectancy of aluminum electrolytic capacitors (rev.1) ([http://www.niccomp.com/Products/General/Alumlyticlifeexpect.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Mirsky, Determining end-of-life, ESR, and lifetime calculations for electrolytic capacitors at higher temperatures, EDN, August 20, 2008, [http://www.edn.com/design/components-and-packaging/4326347/Determining-end-of-life-ESR-and-lifetime-calculations-for-electrolytic-capacitors-at-higher-temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule is also well known as the [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius rule]]. It characterizes the change of thermic reaction speed. For every 10&amp;nbsp;°C lower temperature, evaporation halves. That means for every 10&amp;nbsp;°C lower temperature the lifetime of capacitors doubles.

:&lt;math&gt;L_x =L_\text{Spec}\cdot 2^\frac{T_0-T_A}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''''L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = life time to be estimated
* '''''L&lt;sub&gt;Spec&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = specified life time (useful life, load life, service life)
* '''''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = upper category temperature (°C)
* '''''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = temperature (°C) of the case or ambient temperature near the capacitor

If a lifetime specification of an electrolytic capacitor is, for example, 2000&amp;nbsp; h/105&amp;nbsp;°C, the capacitor's lifetime at 45&amp;nbsp;°C can be "calculated" as 128,000 hours—roughly 15 years—by using the 10-degree-rule. Although the result of the longer lifetime at lower temperatures comes from a mathematical calculation, the result is always an estimation of the expected behavior of a group of similar components.

The lifetime of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes depends on the evaporations rate and therefore on the core temperature of the capacitor. This core temperature on the other hand depends on the ripple current load. Using the 10-degree-rule with the capacitor case temperature gives a good approach to operational conditions. In case of higher ripple currents the lifetime could be influenced positively with force cooling.

Near the end of the capacitor's lifetime degradation failure begins to appear. At the same time the range of the constant failure rate ends. But even after exceeding the capacitor's specified end of life the electronic circuit is not in immediate danger; only the functionality of the capacitor is reduced. With today's high levels of purity in the manufacture of electrolytic capacitors it is not to be expected that short circuits occur after the end-of-life-point with progressive evaporation combined with parameter degradation.

===Failure modes===
[[File:Al-Elko-bad-caps-Wiki-07-02-17.jpg|thumb|Failed aluminum electrolytic capacitors with open vent caused by using a wrong electrolyte]] 
Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes have, in terms of quality, a relatively negative public image. This is contrary to industrial experience, where electrolytic capacitors are considered to be reliable components if used within their specified specifications during the calculated lifetime. The negative public image might be, among other reasons, because failed electrolytic capacitors in devices are easily and immediately visible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capacitorlab.com/visible-failures/ Capacitorlab, Visual Signs of Capacitor Failure]&lt;/ref&gt; This is exceptional and not the case with other electronic components.

As with any industrial product, specific causes of failure modes are known for aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes. They can be differentiated in failures causes by capacitor development and production, by device production, by capacitor application or by external influences during use.&lt;ref&gt;W. BONOMO, G. HOOPER, D. RICHARDSON, D. ROBERTS, and TH. VAN DE STEEG, Vishay Intertechnology, Failure modes in capacitors [http://www.electronicproducts.com/Passive_Components/Capacitors/Failure_modes_in_capacitors.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacitor manufacturing industries can only influence the first failure mode. Most manufacturers have had well-structured quality control departments for decades, supervising all development and manufacturing steps. Failure mode flow charts demonstrate this.&lt;ref name=NCCTN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elna-intro&gt;[http://www.elna.co.jp/en/capacitor/alumi/trust/ Elna, Reliability of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nichi-intro&gt;[http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~reese/electrolytics/tec2.pdf Nichicon, Application Guidelines for Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pan-intro&gt;Panasonic, Reliability of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors [http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABA0000/ABA0000TE4.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117014745/http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABA0000/ABA0000TE4.pdf |date=2015-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rub-intro&gt;Rubycon, Cautions for Proper Use of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor [http://www.rubycon.co.jp/kr/catalog/e_pdfs/aluminum/CautionAlumi_Eng.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jianghai, Technical notes, Typical failure modes and factors of aluminum electrolytic capacitors [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/Failure_Modes.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a typical physically or chemically caused major failure mode during application, like "field crystallization" for tantalum capacitors, is not known for non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors.

===Capacitor behavior after storage or disuse===
In many quarters, electrolytic capacitors are considered very unreliable components when compared to other passives. This is partly a function of the history of these components. Capacitors manufactured during and before [[World War II]] sometimes suffered from contamination during manual manufacturing, and in particular chlorine salts were often the reason for corrosive processes leading to high leakage currents. Chlorine acts on aluminum as a catalyst for the formation of unstable oxide without becoming chemically bound itself.

After World War II this problem was known but the measuring equipment was not accurate enough to detect chlorine in very low ppm concentration. The situation improved over the next 20 years and the capacitors became good enough for longer life applications. This lead in turn to a previously unnoticed water driven corrosion, which weakens the stable dielectric oxide layer during storage or disuse. This leads to high leakage currents after storage. Most of the electrolytes in that time contain water, and many of the capacitors reach their end of life by drying out.&lt;ref name="Thiesbürger" /&gt; Water driven corrosion was the reason for recommended precondition instructions.

The first solution in the 1970s was the development of water-free electrolyte systems based on organic solvents. Their advantages, among other things were lower leakage currents and nearly unlimited shelf life.&lt;ref name=Baur&gt;Ch. Baur, N. Will, Epcos, Long-term stability of aluminum electrolytic capacitors [http://www.epcos.com/epcos-en/373562/tech-library/articles/applications---cases/applications---cases/built-to-last/172020 Built to last]&lt;/ref&gt; But now another problem was observed. The growing mass production with automatic insertion machines requires a washing of the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]'s after soldering. The cleaning solutions contain chloroalkanes ([[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]) agents. These halogens solutions sometimes permeate the sealing of the capacitors and start chlorine corrosion. Again there was a leakage current problem.

The use of CFCs as solvents for dry cleaning have been phased out, for example, by the [[Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control|IPPC]] directive on [[greenhouse gas]]es in 1994 and by the [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOC) directive of the [[European Union|EU]] in 1997. In the meantime electrolytic systems have been developed with additives to inhibit the reaction between anodic aluminum oxide and water, which solve most of the high leakage current problems after storage.&lt;ref name="Sanz"&gt;J. M. Sanz, J. M. Albella, J. M. Martinez-Duart, On the inhibition of the reaction between anodic aluminum oxide and water [http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/hindawi-publishing-corporation/on-the-inhibition-of-the-reaction-between-anodic-aluminum-oxide-and-Wn4Q79WyDa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors to have a stable behavior during longer storage times can be tested by using an accelerating test of storage the capacitors at its upper category temperature for a certain period, usually 1000 hours without voltage applied. This "shelf life test" is a good indicator for an inert chemically behavior of the electrolytic system against the dielectric aluminum oxide layer because all chemical reactions are accelerated by high temperatures. Nearly all today's series of capacitors fulfill the 1000 hours shelf life test, which is equivalent to a minimum five years of storage at room temperature. Modern electrolytic capacitors don't need preconditioning after such storage. However, many capacitor series are specified only for two years storage time, but the limit is set by oxidation of terminals and resulting solderability problems.

For restoring antique radio equipment using older electrolytic capacitors built in the 1970s or earlier, "pre-conditioning" is often recommended. For this purpose, the rated voltage is applied to the capacitor via a series resistance of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;kΩ for a period of one hour. Applying a voltage via a safety resistor repairs the oxide layer by self-healing, but slowly, minimizing internal heating. If capacitors still don't meet the leakage current requirements after preconditioning, it may be an indication of permanent damage.

===Parallel connection===
Smaller or low voltage aluminum electrolytic capacitors may be connected in parallel without any safety correction action. Large sizes capacitors, especially large sizes and high voltage types, should be individually guarded against sudden energy charge of the whole capacitor bank due to a failed specimen.

===Series connection===
Some applications like [[AC/AC converter]]s with DC-link for frequency controls in [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase grids]] need higher voltages than electrolytic capacitors usually offer. For such applications electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series for increased voltage-withstanding capability. During charging, the voltage across each of the capacitors connected in series is proportional to the inverse of the individual capacitor's leakage current. Since every capacitor differs somewhat in individual leakage current, the capacitors with a higher leakage current will get less voltage. The voltage balance over the series-connected capacitors is not symmetrical. Passive or active voltage balance has to be provided in order to stabilize the voltage over each individual capacitor.&lt;ref name=VishayIAC /&gt;&lt;ref name=EpcosGTI /&gt;

===Imprinted markings===
Electrolytic capacitors, like most other electronic components, have imprinted markings to indicate the manufacturer, the type, the electrical and thermal characteristics, and the date of manufacture. In the ideal case, if they are large enough the capacitor should be marked with:
* Manufacturer's name or trademark;
* Manufacturer's type designation;
* Polarity of the terminations (for polarized capacitors)
* Rated capacitance;
* Tolerance on rated capacitance
* Rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)
* Climatic category or rated temperature;
* Year and month (or week) of manufacture;
Smaller capacitors use a shorthand notation to display all the relevant information in the limited space available. The most commonly used format is: XYZ K/M VOLTS V, where XYZ represents the capacitance in µF, the letters K or M indicate the tolerance (±10% and ±20% respectively), and VOLTS V represents the rated voltage.
Example:
* A capacitor with the following text on its body: 10M 25 has a capacitance of 10&amp;nbsp;µF, tolerance K = ±10% with a rated voltage of 25&amp;nbsp;V.
Capacitance, tolerance, and date of manufacture can also be identified with a short code according to IEC 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads):
* µ47 = 0.47&amp;nbsp;µF, 4µ7 = 4.7&amp;nbsp;µF, 47µ = 47&amp;nbsp;µF
The date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards in abbreviated form.
* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, "1208" is "2012, week number 8".
* Version 2: coding with year code/month code,
Year code: "R" = 2003, "S"= 2004, "T" = 2005, "U" = 2006, "V" = 2007, "W" = 2008, "X" = 2009, "A" = 2010, "B" = 2011, "C" = 2012, "D" = 2013, "E" = 2014, "F" = 2015 etc.
Month code: "1" to "9" = Jan. to Sept., "O" = October, "N" = November, "D" = December
"C5" is then "2012, May"

===Polarity marking===

File:Polarity-wet-Al-Elcaps.jpg
File:Polarity-rectangular-chips.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

* Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte have a polarity marking at the cathode (minus) side
* Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte have a polarity marking at the anode (plus) side

[[File:V-Chip.jpg|thumb|150px|Polarity marking on a SMD-V-chip capacitor]]
[[Surface-mount technology|SMD]] style electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte (vertical-chips, V-chips) have a colored filled half circle or a minus bar on the top case side visible to indicate the minus terminal side. Additionally, the insulating plate under the capacitor body uses two skewed edges to indicate that the negative terminal is on the complement position.

Radial or single-ended electrolytic capacitor styles have a bar across the side of the capacitor to indicate the negative terminal side, and the negative terminal lead is shorter than the positive terminal lead.

Axial electrolytic capacitor styles have a bar across or around the case pointing to the negative lead end to indicate the negative terminal. The positive terminal of the capacitor is on the side of the sealing. The negative terminal lead is shorter than the positive terminal lead.

On a [[printed circuit board]] it is customary to indicate the correct orientation by using a square through-hole pad for the positive lead and a round pad for the negative one.

===Standardization===
The standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/ IEC Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu IEC Webstore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the Generic Specification:

[[Image:Pacinotti 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Antonio Pacinotti]]

'''Antonio Pacinotti''' (17 June 1841 &amp;ndash; 24 March 1912) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[physics|physicist]], who was Professor of Physics at the [[University of Pisa]].

==Biography==
Pacinotti was born in [[Pisa]], where he also died. He was the son of Luigi Pacinotti and Caterina Catanti, attended the ''istituto arcivescovile Santa Caterina'', and took part in the second war of Italian independence as ''sergente volontario''. He was a student of [[Carlo Matteucci]] and graduated in mathematics at Pisa under Riccardo Felici. He was appointed as assistant to the astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Donati]] in 1862, professor at the technological institute of [[Bologna]] in 1864, professor of physics at the [[University of Cagliari]] in 1873, and, finally, successor to his father in 1881 in the chair of technological physics at the [[University of Pisa]]. Among his students was [[Augusto Righi]].

Pacinotti died in Pisa.

==Scientific studies and invention of the dynamo==
[[Image:Pacinotti-Grammescher Ring.png|thumb|250px|right|Pacinotti-Gramme ring armature]]
[[Image:Pacinotti dynamo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dynamo of Pacinotti]]
He is best known for inventing an improved form of [[direct current|direct-current]] [[electrical generator]], or [[dynamo]],  which he built in 1860 and described in a paper published in ''[[Il Nuovo Cimento]]'' of 1865. It used a ring armature around which was wrapped a coil of wire, to produce a smoother current than that available from previous types of dynamo.  He found that the device could also be used as an [[electric motor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4UAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA218 Heinrich Schellen (1884) ''Magneto-electric and Dynamo-electric Machines, 3rd Ed., Vol.1'', D. Van Nostrand, New York, p.218, fig.124], translated by Nathaniel S. Keith and Percy Neyman, on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1862, Pacinotti was one of several independent discoverers of the [[comet]] [[109P/Swift-Tuttle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pgj.pagesperso-orange.fr/16-perseides.htm Les Perséides en 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lungarno Pacinotti]], an embankment of the [[Arno River]] in Pisa, is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panchetti.it/?p=1467 LUNGARNO PACINOTTI]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barro Blanco''' is a [[gravity dam]] currently under construction on the [[Tabasara River]] in the [[Chiriqui Province]] of [[Panama]]. As of 2015, the project is under construction and is 95 percent completed. Although the government had authorized the dam, it suspended construction in February 2015 after protests. The President of the Republic authorized the partial restart of construction in August 2015, but prohibited the filling of the reservoir pending a final agreement.&lt;ref name=Restart/&gt; Important issues concerning the dam are controversial, such as the question whether the indigenous communities in the area initially had expressed their support or their opposition to the dam's construction and how well they had been informed about the project and its impacts prior to expressing their views.

==Technical features==
The dam was designed to minimize the impact on the river, never leaving any section of the river dry. The [[roller-compacted concrete]] gravity dam is to have a maximum height of {{convert|44.91|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a maximum reservoir surface of {{convert|2.58|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|0.69|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} currently occupied by the [[Tabasara River]] and {{convert|1.89|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} that would be inundated, according to the project design document submitted to the UN [[Clean Development Mechanism]] Executive Board.&lt;ref name=PDS&gt;{{cite web|title=CDM Project Design Form: Barro Blanco Hydroelectric Power Plant Project, 27 April 2010|url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/filestorage/B/O/L/BOLWGNA7FS4YKM23JCHPQ695ZIU8ET/Barro%20Blanco%20PDD%20v3.08?t=UFl8bW9jODYwfDBxLsf-CL2pJpjCuQ9t2tw1|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|0.07|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of the inundated land would be located In the indigenous territory (''Comarca'') of the [[Ngöbe–Buglé people]]. The installed capacity of the planned hydropower plant is 28.84 Megawatt.

==Ownership and financing==
The project developer is ''Generadora del Istmo S. A.'' (GENISA), a Panamanian special purpose company created specifically for this project.

==Context of the conflict==
There is a long-standing conflict between the [[Ngäbe]] people and the government concerning mining and the construction of dams for hydropower generation in or near their territory.&lt;ref name=prensaindigena/&gt; The [[Ngäbe-Buglé Comarca]] was created in 1997 for the use of the Ngäbe  and Buglé indigenous communities &lt;ref&gt;Cansari and Gausset, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite this during the 1970s the Panamanian government proposed to dam the Tabasara with a 220MW hydroelectric project designed to supply energy to the proposed Colorado Copper Mines. This project was cancelled following widespread protests &lt;ref&gt;Orozco, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. They had won the first battle of the Tabasara dams, however, during the 1990s another project was proposed - this time a 48MW dam, they again successfully defeated this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This thereafter resulted in the Panamanian government changing national law in order to repeal requirements related to participation from indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;Runk, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

This long history of conflict regarding their traditional and spiritual lands has resulted in the prolonged social mobilisation of the Ngäbe-Buglé communities.

==Environmental and social impact==
According to GENISA, no indigenous village or houses would be inundated by the reservoir and no one would be resettled. However 5 hectares of stream bed will be flooded during the rainy season. The land to be inundated consists of ravines close to the river that are not suitable for agriculture or livestock grazing.&lt;ref name="Preguntas frecuentes"&gt;{{cite web|last=GENISA|title=Preguntas Frecuentes, Preguntas 20 y 30|url=http://www.genisa.com.pa/preguntas-frecuentes/|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another source the area to be flooded is {{convert|1.89|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, or 189 hectares.&lt;ref name=PDS/&gt; However, critics allege that the livelihoods of some 5000 Ngöbe farmers who rely on the river for potable water, agriculture and fishing will be negatively impacted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Business &amp; Biodiversity Campaign|title=UN’s Offsetting Project Barro Blanco Hampers Panama Peace-Talks|url=http://www.business-biodiversity.eu/default.asp?Menue=155&amp;News=807|accessdate=8 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706194622/http://www.business-biodiversity.eu/default.asp?Menue=155&amp;News=807|archive-date=2014-07-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and primary forest would be cut down. They also say that the impacted communities have never provided their free, prior and informed consent to the project.&lt;ref name=Arrest&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arghiris|first1=Richard|title=GENISA director arrested in Honduras as Panama's President sends riot squad to indigenous protests|url=https://intercontinentalcry.org/genisa-director-arrested-panamas-president-postures-28212/|publisher=Interncontinental Cry Magazine, Center for World Indigenous Studies|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, they say that the habitat of the endangered [[Craugastor tabasarae|Tabasará rain frog]] would be destroyed.&lt;ref name=cry&gt;{{cite web|last=JOHN AHNI SCHERTOW|title=Urge Development Banks To Walk Away From Barro Blanco Dam, 10 May 2012|url=http://intercontinentalcry.org/urge-development-banks-to-walk-away-from-barro-blanco-dam/|publisher=Intercontinental Cry|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; GENISA says that the Tabasará rain frog lives in several habitats in Panama, including in the Anton Valley hundreds of kilometers away from the site.&lt;ref name="Preguntas frecuentes"/&gt;

==Chronology==

===Concession award and environmental impact study (2006-2008)===
In 2006, under the government of President [[Martín Torrijos]], an international public tender was announced for various hydropower projects in Panama, including Barro Blanco. Among the four participating companies GENISA was selected. The Public Services Authority  ASEP authorized GENISA to prepare studies and, subject to obtaining all relevant approvals, to develop the Barro Blanco project.

GENISA commissioned an Environmental Impact Study. As part of this study, in August 2007 in a public forum with the participation of local authorities, villagers close to the project were asked about their view of the dam. At the time, the indigenous M-10 Movement rejected the dam, because it considered indigenous people would lose their land, would not be able to use the river any more and because the environment would be harmed. However, most of the consulted people supported the project, because it would provide jobs, better road access and improved living standards. Some of those who were opposed to the project subsequently sold their land to the project developer.&lt;ref name=PDS/&gt; In December 2007, GENISA and representatives of the Ngobe Bugle people signed a cooperation agreement that included safeguards for the fundamental rights of the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=AENOR/&gt; 

In May 2008 the Panamanian Environmental Authority ANAM approved the project based on the study.&lt;ref name="Buena Suerte"/&gt; In December 2008 GENISA signed a Memorandum of Understanding in which it committed itself to implement a social development plan for the indigenous communities living next to the dam, including "infrastructure, health and education programs" during the construction and during the operation of the dam.&lt;ref name="Preguntas 25-28"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preguntas Frecuentes, Preguntas 25, 27 y 28|url=http://www.genisa.com.pa/preguntas-frecuentes/|publisher=GENISA|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 a validation team consisting of the consulting firm AENOR working for the UN CDM Executive Board visited the area and confirmed "that the most relevant communities involved in the area of the project were consulted, all of them supported the project activity, and project participant (i.e. GENISA) has forecasted several social compensation measurements for the communities involved."&lt;ref name=AENOR&gt;{{cite web|last=AENOR|title=CDM Validation Report, Barro Blanco Hydropower Plan Project|url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/filestorage/F/M/0/FM07ILOVK4URYHQA5BJPC9NSX62G3Z/Barro%20Blanco%20V%20Report%20June2010.pdf?t=Ymt8bWVyYmNyfDC1OhyBaQyqiRam0I7sRd7C|accessdate=9 December 2012|pages=22|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Rivers Network]] says that the validation report by AENOR was flawed, since allegedly only the non-indigenous population had been consulted and they had failed to take into account all comments received.&lt;ref name=IRN/&gt; In 2009 the concession contract between the government and GENISA was signed.&lt;ref name="Buena Suerte"/&gt;

===Increase of capacity and controversy about impact study (2009-2010)===
After presidential elections in early 2009, in June 2009 [[Ricardo Martinelli]], a businessman who promised to quickly upgrade Panama's infrastructure, took office as President of Panama. In May 2009 GENISA requested a modification of the permit to increase the capacity by 52% to 28.8 Megawatt by moving the turbines to a lower elevation, without increasing the water level in the reservoir. The original environmental study and the permit referred to an installed capacity of only 19 Megawatt. In January 2010 ANAM approved the modification, and in January 2011 the concession contract was modified accordingly.&lt;ref name="Buena Suerte"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zelideth Cortez|title=La buena suerte de GENISA (The luck of GENISA), 29 February 2012|url=http://www.laestrella.com.pa/online/impreso/2012/02/29/la-buena-suerte-de-genisa.asp|publisher=La Estrella|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, according to the UN CDM project document, 98% of the land to be inundated was owned by GENISA.&lt;ref name=PDS/&gt;

According to critics, the environmental impact study was flawed, because impacts on biodiversity were assessed superficially and because the capacity of the plant was increased.&lt;ref name=foue/&gt; In late 2010 the [[European Investment Bank]] withdrew funding for the dam after an investigation into human rights abuses prompted by NGO protests.&lt;ref name=IRN&gt;{{cite web|last=International Rivers|title=5,000 Indigenous Peoples Ignored In Grab for Carbon Credits|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/blogs/246/5-000-indigenous-peoples-ignored-in-grab-for-carbon-credits|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011 DEG and FMO approved their loans for the project.

===Indigenous approval despite conflict about mining (2011)===
In February 2011, the Panamanian government proposed a new mining law that would facilitate the development of mining projects in indigenous areas, while the indigenous people had asked for a law banning mining in their territories. The proposal and the simultaneous launching of bids for a large copper mining project called Cerro Colorado triggered protests of indigenous people, including local communities from the Barro Blanco area, who blocked the [[Interamerican Highway]] for four days. The protests were violently suppressed. The conflict was temporarily ended through the San Felix agreement, signed in the village of San Felix.&lt;ref name=prensaindigena&gt;{{cite web|title=Panamá: Conflicto minero e hidroeléctrico en la Comarca Ngäbé Büglé, 13 March 2012|url=http://www.prensaindigena.org.mx/?q=content/panam%C3%A1-conflicto-minero-e-hidroel%C3%A9ctrico-en-la-comarca-ngäbé-büglé|publisher=Prensa Indígena|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the dam began in February 2011.

On June 25, 2011, according to the project developer GENISA, the regional congress of the Kädriri, the local group of [[Ngäbe people]], approved by public majority voting that the construction of the dam should continue, after having been authorized to take a decision by the General Congress of the Ngäbe-Buglé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GENISA|title=Preguntas Frecuentes, Pregunta 27|url=http://www.genisa.com.pa/preguntas-frecuentes/|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2011 the UN [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) Board approved the [[carbon finance]] proposal that was to generate part of the revenue stream for the project.&lt;ref name=foue/&gt; On August 25, 2011, a Compensation and Benefits Agreement was signed between GENISA and the Board of the Regional Congress of the Kädriri.&lt;ref name="Preguntas 25-28"/&gt;

===International campaign and UN inspection (2012-13)===
However, the conflict remained unresolved. The government called for a referendum on the dam, but the indigenous leader [[Silvia Carrera]], elected as Cacica General in September 2011, initially rejected it.&lt;ref name=prensaindigena/&gt; An international campaign was started to stop construction of the dam and international funding for it. In March 2012 Parliament passed a modified version of the mining law that prohibited mining in the indigenous territory and required the approval of the Ngöbe Buglé  General Congress for any future hydroelectric projects.&lt;ref&gt;The Panama Digest:[http://www.thepanamadigest.com/2012/03/mining-banned-to-protect-the-ngobe-bugle-shire/ Mining Banned to Protect the Ngöbe Buglé Shire], 27 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, the traditional authorities of the Ngöbe criticized Silvia Carrera for having given in. They had asked for a complete ban on hydropower projects to be included in the law.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Survival:[http://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/campaign-update-panama-ngobe-dialogue-ends-new-mining-law-protests-continue Campaign Update – Panama: Ngöbe Dialogue Ends in New Mining Law, Protests Continue], 22 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction had to be halted in May 2012, because the local population occupied the site. The protests were suspended while "UN inspectors" were expected to visit the area.&lt;ref&gt;Don Winner:[http://www.panama-guide.com/article.php/20120531154806624 Role Of The United Nations Questioned - Barro Blanco Hydro Electric Project], Panama-Guide.com, 31 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012 an inspection team led by [[UNDP]] and  consisting of representatives of the Catholic Church, the environmental agency ANAM, the electricity regulatory agency ASEP and the project developer GENISA, visited the area. The purpose of the inspection was to verify on the ground issues that had not been answered satisfactorily in the environmental impact assessment. The inspection team presented its report in December 2012, recommending a water flow simulation to understand the impact of sudden floods as well as a participatory rural appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Informe de la Misión de verificación ralizada del 23 al 28 de septiembre de 2012|url=http://www.bananamarepublic.com/informe_mision_verficacion_final_20121219.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013 an indigenous protester against the dam was killed by masked assailants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robin Oisín Llewellyn|title=Indigenous protester killed by masked assailants in Panama over UN-condemned dam|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2013/0325-llewellyn-barro-blanco.html|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=13 June 2013|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, [[James Anaya]], UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people, visited Panama and spoke to the Ngöbe. In his report he concluded that the Ngöbe "were not properly consulted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaigns: Barro Blanco – Large hydro project, Panama|url=http://carbonmarketwatch.org/category/barro-blanco-large-hydro-project-panama/|publisher=Carbon Market Watch|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the visit 12 local and international civil society organizations had asked Anaya to conduct a formal investigation into the human rights impacts of the dam and to call on the government to "immediately halt the dam’s construction until the threats to the rights of the indigenous Ngӓbe people affected by the project have been fully addressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Representative on Indigenous Peoples Asked to Investigate Human Rights Violations Caused by Panama’s Barro Blanco Dam|url=http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2013/06/18/un-representative-indigenous-peoples-asked-investigate-human-rights-violations|publisher=CommonDreams|accessdate=13 March 2016|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2013, the United Nations released three reports on the water flow simulation, a participatory rural appraisal as well as an ecological and economic analysis conducted by two independent international experts, [[Gonzalo Castro de la Mata]] and Luis Lopez, showing that the dam had no impact on global biodiversity, but had "real and important impacts" on the indigenous populations living in the area. However, the report did not mention that any villages would be inundated. Furthermore, the experts concluded that "the local population had not been correctly consulted". They also concluded that the local population had "a rudimentary and often erroneous knowledge of the project, being a product of rumors, often without foundation". Together with the insufficient consultation this had created a climate of fear.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP Panama Press Release:[http://www.pa.undp.org/content/panama/es/home/presscenter/articles/2013/09/06/presentan-resultados-del-peritaje-independiente-al-proyecto-hidroelectrico-barro-blanco-.html Presentan resultados del peritaje independiente al proyecto hidroeléctrico Barro Blanco], retrieved on March 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complaints and suspension of works (2014-2016)===
In April 2014 Silvia Carrera, the Cacica General of the [[Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé]], submitted a complaint to the Independent External Panels of DEG and FMO. In May 2015 the joint review of the panels found that the banks had failed to fully comply with the standards to which they had committed themselves. While the banks took significant steps to understand the situation as part of their due diligence process, they accepted an indigenous peoples report that was insufficient for the purpose to approve the credit in January 2011, requiring further investigations as a condition for disbursement, while their own standards would have required a fully satisfactory report at the time of approval. The two banks accepted the conclusions and committed themselves to "further raise the bar on the required level of information on stakeholder consultation available to (them) at the time of credit approval."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaint Mechanism: Barro Blanco|url=https://www.deginvest.de/International-financing/DEG/Die-DEG/Verantwortung/Beschwerdemanagement/Barro-Blanco/|publisher=DEG|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the government of Panama - since June 2014 led by a new President, [[Juan Carlos Varela]] - suspended the construction of the dam in February 2015 on the grounds that the environmental and social impact assessment was faulty pending the outcome of a court case that challenges the assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente paraliza proyecto Barro Blanco por incumplimientos|url=http://www.prensa.com/provincias/Anam-proyecto-Barro-Blanco-incumplimientos_0_4138086364.html|publisher=La Prensa|accessdate=4 July 2015|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 new protests erupted, with protesters shutting down the [[Interamerican Highway]] for two days, as a result of which the President sent a riot squad to the area.&lt;ref name=Arrest/&gt; In August 2015 President Varela and the Cacia General of the indigenous Comarca, Silvia Carrera, signed an agreement to the effect that the civil works of the dam would be completed, but that the electromechanical works would remain suspended and the dam would not be flooded until a final agreement had been reached. GENISA complained that it had been left out of the agreement and that the agreement violated the agreements concluded by the state with the company.&lt;ref name=Restart&gt;{{cite web|title=Gobierno firma acuerdo con indígenas sobre Barro Blanco; no descarta comprar la hidroeléctrica|url=http://www.prensa.com/politica/Gobierno-indigenas-Barro-Blanco-hidroelectrica_0_4274572679.html|publisher=La Prensa|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015 the environmental agency ANAM imposed a 775,200 USD fine on GEMISA for having failed to comply with the resettlement and compensation measures under the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gobierno impone sanción a Genisa por Barro Blanco|url=http://www.prensa.com/sociedad/Gobierno-sancion-Genisa-Barro-Blanco_0_4307569401.html|publisher=La Prensa|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 2016 the indigenous movement 10th of April claimed that the agreement had been violated, because tests to fill the reservoir had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indígenas vuelven a la calle por Barro Blanco|url=http://laestrella.com.pa/panama/nacional/indigenas-vuelven-calle-barro-blanco/23917307|publisher=La Estrella|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, 2016, a technical report was presented to the indigenous communities, showing that the dam was technically safe. Furthermore, a sub-commission consisting of the government and traditional authorities was created to further study the impacts of the project in view of a "final decision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comunicado Conjunto.

In response, Vice-President and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado]] held talks with indigenous leaders early June 2016. Carrera said that the filling "was a violation of the rights of indigenous people in the area, and of the contract signed by President Juan Carlos Varela."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panamanian Officials Meet With Indigenous Leaders Over Barro Blanco Hydropower Project|url=https://www.ooskanews.com/story/2016/06/panamanian-officials-meet-indigenous-leaders-over-barro-blanco-hydropower-project|publisher=OOSKAnews|accessdate=17 June 2016|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Branford Land Trust''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that purchases land to make it non-developable, protected land through [[land trust]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Hill Woods Joins the Branford Land Trust|url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/branford/entry/red_hill_woods_joins_the_branford_land_trust/|publisher=Branford Eagle|accessdate=17 April 2017|date=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1967 the Trust aims to protect Branford's natural resources through:
* Acquiring and managing open space
* Promoting education about our natural resources, and
* Encouraging our community involvement

The Trust owns nearly {{convert|775|acre|km2}} in over 130 parcels in [[Branford, Connecticut]], U.S., on the shore of [[Long Island Sound]], just east of New Haven. It has worked for the acquisition of several large publicly owned tracts, including the [[Short Beach]] Preserve, a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land with rugged rock outcroppings, tall [[oak]]s, [[beech]]es, groves of [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]], [[wetland]]s and a bluff offering views of [[Talmadge Pond]] and Long Island Sound.

In 2002, the Land Trust was awarded the Branford Chamber of Commerce Community Advancement Award which "recognizes the sustained efforts of an individual organization or company for their efforts towards helping to make Branford a better place to work and live."

{{good article}}{{Infobox copper}}
'''Copper''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cu''' (from {{lang-la|cuprum}}) and [[atomic number]] 29. It is a soft, malleable, and [[ductility|ductile]] metal with very high [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity]]. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a [[Copper (color)|pinkish-orange color]]. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a [[building material#Metal|building material]], and as a constituent of various metal [[alloy]]s, such as [[sterling silver]] used in [[jewelry]], [[cupronickel]] used to make marine hardware and [[coins]], and [[constantan]] used in [[strain gauge]]s and [[thermocouples]] for temperature measurement.

Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ([[native metal]]s). This led to very early human use in several regions, from c. 8000 BC. Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be [[Smelting|smelted]] from sulfide ores, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, [[tin]], to create [[bronze]], c. 3500 BC.&lt;ref  name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=McHenry |editor1-first=Charles |title=The New Encyclopedia Britannica |date=1992 |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. |location=Chicago |isbn=0-85229-553-7 |page=612 |volume=3 |edition=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[ancient Rome|Roman era]], copper was principally mined on [[Cyprus]], the origin of the name of the metal, from ''aes сyprium'' (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to ''сuprum'' (Latin), from which the words derived, ''coper'' ([[Old English]]) and ''copper'', first used around 1530.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/copper|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|title=Copper|date=2018|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as [[azurite]], [[malachite]], and [[turquoise]], and have been used widely and historically as pigments.

Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green [[verdigris]] (or [[patina]]). Copper is sometimes used in [[decorative art]], both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as [[bacteriostatic agent]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and wood preservatives.

Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace [[dietary mineral]] because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex [[cytochrome c oxidase]]. In [[molluscs]] and [[crustacea]]ns, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment [[hemocyanin]], replaced by the iron-complexed [[hemoglobin]] in fish and other [[vertebrate]]s. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor-last = Johnson, MD PhD |editor-first = Larry E. |title = Copper |work = Merck Manual Home Health Handbook |publisher = Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. |date = 2008 |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders_of_nutrition/minerals/copper.html |accessdate = 7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1&amp;nbsp;mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/consumers/health/cu_health_uk.html|title=Copper in human health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Copper just above its melting point.jpg|left|upright=0.7|thumb|Copper just above its melting point keeps its pink luster color when enough light outshines the orange [[incandescence]] color]]
Copper, [[silver]], and [[gold]] are in [[group 11 element|group 11]] of the periodic table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-[[electron shell]] and are characterized by high [[ductility]], and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through [[metallic bond]]s. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a [[covalent bond|covalent]] character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low [[hardness]] and high ductility of [[monocrystalline|single crystals]] of copper.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book|author1=George L. Trigg|author2=Edmund H. Immergut|title=Encyclopedia of applied physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVQ5RAAACAAJ|accessdate=2 May 2011|date=1 November 1992|publisher=VCH Publishers|isbn=978-3-527-28126-8|pages=267–272|volume=4: Combustion to Diamagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the [[crystal lattice]], such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained [[polycrystalline]] form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Smith, William F.|author2 = Hashemi, Javad|last-author-amp = yes |title = Foundations of Materials Science and Engineering|page = 223|publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional|date= 2003|isbn = 0-07-292194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Siemens (unit)|S]]/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book|author = Hammond, C. R.|title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|edition = 81st|publisher =CRC press|isbn = 0-8493-0485-7|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Resistance Welding Manufacturing Alliance |title=Resistance Welding Manual|date=2003|publisher=Resistance Welding Manufacturing Alliance|isbn=0-9624382-0-0|edition=4th|pages=18–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray or silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Chambers|first = William|last2 = Chambers|first2 = Robert|title = Chambers's Information for the People|publisher = W. &amp; R. Chambers|date = 1884|volume = L|page = 312|edition = 5th|url = https://books.google.com/?id=eGIMAAAAYAAJ|isbn = 0-665-46912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish [[tarnish]] when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.

As with other metals, if copper is put in contact with another metal, [[galvanic corrosion]] will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galvanic Corrosion|url=http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Forms-galvanic/galvanic-corrosion.htm|work=Corrosion Doctors|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper does not react with water, but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the [[rust]] that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion ([[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]). A green layer of [[verdigris]] (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qL3vfUZHMYC|title=Cultural Heritage Conservation and Environmental Impact Assessment by Non-Destructive Testing and Micro-Analysis|last=Grieken|first=Rene van|last2=Janssens|first2=Koen|date=2005-09-27|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-97078-2|page=197|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Statue of Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copper.org: Education: Statue of Liberty: Reclothing the First Lady of Metals – Repair Concerns|url=http://www.copper.org/education/liberty/liberty_reclothed1.html|work=Copper.org|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper [[tarnish]]es when exposed to some [[sulfur]] compounds, with which it reacts to form various [[copper sulfide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rickett|first1=B.

{{Main|Isotopes of copper}}
There are 29 [[isotope]]s of copper. &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu and &lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;Cu are stable, with &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu comprising approximately 69% of naturally occurring copper; both have a [[spin (physics)|spin]] of {{frac|3|2}}.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nubase2003 Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|pages=3–128|publisher=Atomic Mass Data Center|date=2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|author=Audi, G|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A. H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other isotopes are [[radioactivity|radioactive]], with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Cu with a [[half-life]] of 61.83&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt; Seven [[nuclear isomer|metastable isotopes]] have been characterized; &lt;sup&gt;68m&lt;/sup&gt;Cu is the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes. Isotopes with a [[mass number]] above 64 decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by [[positron emission|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]. [[Copper-64|&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu]], which has a half-life of 12.7 hours, decays both ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reCenter.jsp?z=29&amp;n=35 |title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides |work=National Nuclear Data Center |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most copper is mined or [[copper extraction techniques|extracted]] as copper sulfides from large [[open pit mine]]s in [[porphyry copper]] deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include [[Chuquicamata]], in Chile, [[Bingham Canyon Mine]], in Utah, United States, and [[El Chino Mine]], in New Mexico, United States. According to the [[British Geological Survey]], in 2005, Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one-third of the world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Copper can also be recovered through the [[in-situ leach]] process.

===Reserves===
{{see also|Peak copper#Reserves}}
Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and [[smelting|smelted]] has been extracted since 1900,&lt;ref name=Leonard2006/&gt; and more than half was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, Lester|title=Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble|publisher=New York: W.W.

[[File:Copper Flash Smelting Process (EN).svg|left|thumb|Scheme of flash smelting process]]
The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), bornite (Cu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;FeS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and, to a lesser extent, covellite (CuS) and chalcocite (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt; These minerals are concentrated from [[comminution|crushed]] ores to the level of 10–15% copper by [[froth flotation]] or [[bioleaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watling |first=H.

The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the [[silicate]] slag that floats on top of the heated mass. The resulting ''copper matte,'' consisting of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, is [[roasting (metallurgy)|roasted]] to convert all sulfides into oxides:&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  → 2 Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The cuprous oxide is converted to ''blister'' copper upon heating:
:2 Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 Cu + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The Sudbury [[Matte (metallurgy)|matte]] process converted only half the sulfide to oxide and then used this oxide to remove the rest of the sulfur as oxide. It was then electrolytically refined and the anode mud exploited for the [[platinum]] and gold it contained. This step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides to copper metal. [[Natural gas]] is blown across the blister to remove most of the remaining oxygen and [[electrorefining]] is performed on the resulting material to produce pure copper:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Samans|first=Carl|title=Engineering metals and their alloys|date=1949|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|oclc=716492542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this is in more-developed countries (140–300&amp;nbsp;kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30–40&amp;nbsp;kg per capita).

The process of recycling copper is roughly the same as is used to extract copper but requires fewer steps. High-purity scrap copper is melted in a [[furnace#Metallurgical furnace|furnace]] and then [[redox|reduced]] and cast into [[Billet (semi-finished product)|billets]] and [[ingot]]s; lower-purity scrap is refined by [[electroplating]] in a bath of [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/innovations/1998/06/recycle_overview.html "Overview of Recycled Copper" ''Copper.org''].

==Alloys==
{{See also|List of copper alloys}}
Numerous copper [[alloy]]s have been formulated, many with important uses. [[Brass]] is an alloy of copper and [[zinc]]. [[Bronze]] usually refers to copper-[[tin]] alloys, but can refer to any alloy of copper such as [[aluminium bronze]]. Copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and [[carat (purity)|carat]] gold and carat solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys.&lt;ref name=goldalloys&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utilisegold.com/jewellery_technology/colours/colour_alloys/ |accessdate=6 June 2009 |title=Gold Jewellery Alloys |publisher=World Gold Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414151414/http://www.utilisegold.com/jewellery_technology/colours/colour_alloys |archivedate=14 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lead-free [[solder#Solder alloys|solders]] consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/Solder_Sn97Cu3.pdf Balver Zinn Solder Sn97Cu3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707210148/http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/Solder_Sn97Cu3.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }}.

The alloy of copper and [[nickel]], called [[cupronickel]], is used in low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US five-cent coin (currently called a ''nickel'') consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8C7pXhnqje4C|title=Corrosion Tests and Standards|publisher=ASTM International|page=368|language=en|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; ''[[Shakudō]]'' is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold, typically 4–10%, that can be [[patina]]ted to a dark blue or black color.&lt;ref name="Shakudō"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oguchi|first=Hachiro|date=1983|title=Japanese Shakudō: its history, properties and production from gold-containing alloys|journal=Gold Bulletin|volume=16|issue=4|pages=125–132|publisher=World Gold Council|doi=10.1007/BF03214636}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 June 2016 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compounds==
[[File:CopperIoxide.jpg|thumb|A sample of [[copper(I) oxide]].]]
{{See also|Category:Copper compounds}}

Copper forms a rich variety of compounds, usually with [[oxidation state]]s +1 and +2, which are often called ''cuprous'' and ''cupric'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Holleman"/&gt;

===Binary compounds===
As with other elements, the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and [[halide]]s. Both [[copper(I) oxide|cuprous]] and [[copper(II) oxide|cupric oxides]] are known. Among the numerous [[copper sulfide]]s, important examples include [[copper(I) sulfide]] and [[copper monosulfide|copper(II) sulfide]].

Cuprous halides (with [[copper(I) chloride|chlorine]], [[copper(I) bromide|bromine]], and [[copper(I) iodide|iodine]]) are known, as are cupric halides with [[copper(II) fluoride|fluorine]], [[copper(II) chloride|chlorine]], and [[copper(II) bromide|bromine]]. Attempts to prepare copper(II) iodide yield only cuprous iodide and iodine.&lt;ref name="Holleman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holleman |first1=A. F. |last2=Wiberg |first2=N. |title=Inorganic Chemistry |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-12-352651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 CuI + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Coordination chemistry===
[[File:Tetramminkupfer(II)-sulfat-Monohydrat Kristalle.png|thumb|left|Copper(II) gives a deep blue coloration in the presence of ammonia ligands. The one used here is [[Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate|tetramminecopper(II) sulfate]].]]
Copper forms [[coordination complex]]es with [[ligand]]s. In aqueous solution, copper(II) exists as [Cu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate (speed of water ligands attaching and detaching) for any transition [[metal aquo complex]]. Adding aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] causes the precipitation of light blue solid [[copper(II) hydroxide]]. A simplified equation is: [[File:Cu-pourbaix-diagram.svg|thumbnail|Pourbaix diagram for copper in uncomplexed media (anions other than OH- not considered). Ion concentration 0.001&amp;nbsp;m (mol/kg water). Temperature 25&amp;nbsp;°C.]]
:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Ammonia solution|Aqueous ammonia]] results in the same precipitate. Upon adding excess ammonia, the precipitate dissolves, forming [[Schweizer's reagent|tetraamminecopper(II)]]:
:Cu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → [Cu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
Many other [[oxyanion]]s form complexes; these include [[copper(II) acetate]], [[copper(II) nitrate]], and [[copper(II) carbonate]]. [[Copper(II) sulfate]] forms a blue crystalline penta[[hydrate]], the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory. It is used in a [[fungicide]] called the [[Bordeaux mixture]].&lt;ref name="Boux"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cItuoO9zSjkC&amp;pg=PA623|page = 623|chapter = Nonsystematic (Contact) Fungicides|title = Ullmann's Agrochemicals|isbn = 978-3-527-31604-5|author1 = Wiley-Vch|date = 2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polyol]]s, compounds containing more than one alcohol [[functional group]], generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for [[reducing sugars]]. Specifically, using [[Benedict's reagent]] and [[Fehling's solution]] the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph L. Shriner, Christine K. F. Hermann, Terence C. Morrill, David Y. Curtin, Reynold C. Fuson "The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds" 8th edition, J. Wiley, Hoboken. {{ISBN|0-471-21503-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with [[ethylenediamine]] and other [[amine]]s dissolve [[cellulose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saalwächter | first1 = Kay | last2 = Burchard | first2 = Walther | last3 = Klüfers | first3 = Peter | last4 = Kettenbach | first4 = G. | last5 = Mayer | first5 = Peter | last6 = Klemm | first6 = Dieter | last7 = Dugarmaa | first7 = Saran | year = 2000 | title = Cellulose Solutions in Water Containing Metal Complexes | url = | journal = Macromolecules | volume = 33 | issue = 11| pages = 4094–4107 | doi = 10.1021/ma991893m | bibcode = 2000MaMol..33.4094S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amino acid]]s form very stable [[chelate complex]]es with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving [[potassium ferrocyanide]], which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.

===Organocopper chemistry===
{{Main|Organocopper compound}}
Compounds that contain a carbon-copper bond are known as organocopper compounds. They are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper(I) oxide and have [[Reactions of organocopper reagents|many uses in chemistry]]. They are synthesized by treating copper(I) compounds with [[Grignard reaction|Grignard reagents]], [[terminal alkyne]]s or [[organolithium compound|organolithium reagents]];&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Organocopper Chemistry" Norbert Krause, Ed., Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{ISBN|978-3-527-29773-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, the last reaction described produces a [[Gilman reagent]]. These can undergo [[substitution reaction|substitution]] with [[alkyl halides]] to form [[coupling reaction|coupling products]]; as such, they are important in the field of [[organic synthesis]]. [[Copper(I) acetylide]] is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the [[Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berná|first1=José|last2=Goldup|first2=Stephen|last3=Lee|first3=Ai-Lan|last4=Leigh|first4=David|last5=Symes|first5=Mark|last6=Teobaldi|first6=Gilberto|last7=Zerbetto|first7=Fransesco|title=Cadiot–Chodkiewicz Active Template Synthesis of Rotaxanes and Switchable Molecular Shuttles with Weak Intercomponent Interactions|journal=Angewandte Chemie|date=26 May 2008|volume=120|issue=23|pages=4464–4468|doi=10.1002/ange.200800891}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sonogashira coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Sonogashira Reaction: A Booming Methodology in Synthetic Organic Chemistry|author = Rafael Chinchilla|author2 = Carmen Nájera|last-author-amp = yes|journal = [[Chemical Reviews]]|date = 2007|volume = 107|issue = 3|pages = 874–922|doi = 10.1021/cr050992x|pmid = 17305399}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nucleophilic conjugate addition|Conjugate addition]] to [[enone]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1986 |title=An Addition of an Ethylcopper Complex to 1-Octyne: (E)-5-Ethyl-1,4-Undecadiene |journal=[[Organic Syntheses]] |volume=64 |page=1 |url=http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV7P0236.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.15227/orgsyn.064.0001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619005340/http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV7P0236.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[carbometalation|carbocupration]] of alkynes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kharasch |first1=M.

===Copper(III) and copper(IV)===
Copper(III) is most often found in oxides. A simple example is potassium [[cuprate]], KCuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a blue-black solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Potassium Cuprate (III)|title=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry|edition=2nd|editor=G. Brauer|publisher=Academic Press|year=1963|location=NY|volume=1|page=1015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most extensively studied copper(III) compounds are the [[cuprate superconductor]]s. [[Yttrium barium copper oxide]] (YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) consists of both Cu(II) and Cu(III) centres. Like oxide, [[fluoride]] is a highly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[anion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schwesinger, Reinhard |author2=Link, Reinhard |author3=Wenzl, Peter |author4=Kossek, Sebastian |title=Anhydrous phosphazenium fluorides as sources for extremely reactive fluoride ions in solution|doi=10.1002/chem.200500838|year=2006|journal=Chemistry: A European Journal|volume=12|issue=2|pages=438–45 |pmid=16196062}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states. Both copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known, [[Potassium hexafluorocuprate(III)|K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CuF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Caesium hexafluorocuprate(IV)|Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Holleman/&gt;

Some copper proteins form [[oxo complex]]es, which also feature copper(III).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=E. A. |last2=Tolman |first2=W. B. |date=2004 |title=Reactivity of Dioxygen-Copper Systems |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=104 |pages=1047–1076 |doi=10.1021/cr020633r |issue=2 |pmid=14871149}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[tetrapeptide]]s, purple-colored copper(III) complexes are stabilized by the deprotonated [[amide]] ligands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDonald |first1=M.

Complexes of copper(III) are also found as intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=1187}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Kharasch–Sosnovsky reaction]].

It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000–1000 BC in the Near East, and 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the [[Neolithic]] period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the [[Chalcolithic]] period (copper-stone), when copper tools were used with stone tools. The term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world, the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

===Ancient and Post-classical history===
[[File:Venus symbol.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|In [[alchemy]] the symbol for copper was also the symbol for the goddess and planet [[Venus]].]]

In Greece, copper was known by the name ''chalkos'' (χαλκός). It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as ''aes Cyprium'', ''aes'' being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and ''Cyprium'' from [[Cyprus]], where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to ''cuprum'', hence the English ''copper''. [[Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Nomenclature of Copper and its Alloys|author = Rickard, T.

Copper was first used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on [[Isle Royale]] with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The State of Our Knowledge About Ancient Copper Mining in Michigan|journal = The Michigan Archaeologist|volume = 41|page = 119|author = Martin, Susan R.|date = 1995|url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/copper.html|issue = 2–3|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160207073036/http://www.ramtops.co.uk/copper.html|archivedate = 7 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.

The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. [[Julius Caesar]] had his own coins made from brass, while [[Augustus|Octavianus Augustus Caesar]]'s coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000&amp;nbsp;t, [[Roman metallurgy|Roman copper mining and smelting activities]] reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]]; the [[Roman province|provinces]] most intensely mined were those of [[Hispania]], [[Cyprus]] and in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1126/science.272.5259.246|title = History of Ancient Copper Smelting Pollution During Roman and Medieval Times Recorded in Greenland Ice|pages = 246–249 (247f.)|date = 1996|last1 = Hong|first1 = S.|last2 = Candelone|first2 = J.-P.|issue = 5259|last3 = Patterson|first3 = C.

[[File:Kupferfittings 4062.jpg|thumb|Assorted copper fittings]]
The major applications of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it is put into such alloys as [[brass]] and [[bronze]] (5% of total use).&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; For more than two centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boatus.com/magazine/2012/february/copper.asp|title=Is Copper Bottom Paint Sinking?|website=BoatUS Magazine|author=Ryck Lydecker|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small part of the copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Boux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Applications for Copper"&gt;{{cite web|title = Copper|publisher = [[American Elements]]|date = 2008|url = http://www.americanelements.com/cu.html|accessdate = 12 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machining]] of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good [[machinability]] in creating intricate parts.

===Wire and cable===
{{Main| Copper wire and cable}}

Despite competition from other materials, copper remains the preferred [[electrical conductor]] in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead [[electric power transmission]] where [[aluminium]] is often preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Pops, Horace, 2008, "Processing of wire from antiquity to the future", ''Wire Journal International'', June, pp. 58–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Metallurgy of Copper Wire, http://www.litz-wire.com/pdf%20files/Metallurgy_Copper_Wire.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Copper wire is used in [[power generation]], [[power transmission]], [[power distribution]], [[telecommunications]], [[electronics]] circuitry, and countless types of [[electrical equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Günter, 1999, Copper: Its Trade, Manufacture, Use, and Environmental Status, edited by Kundig, Konrad J.A., ASM International, pps. 141–192 and pps. 331–375.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electrical wiring]] is the most important market for the copper industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/elements/C-K/Copper.html |title=Copper, Chemical Element – Overview, Discovery and naming, Physical properties, Chemical properties, Occurrence in nature, Isotopes |publisher=Chemistryexplained.com |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Günter, 1999, Copper: Its Trade, Manufacture, Use, and Environmental Status, edited by Kundig, Konrad J.A., ASM International, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high [[electrical conductivity]], [[tensile strength]], [[ductility]], [[creep (deformation)]] resistance, [[corrosion]] resistance, low [[thermal expansion]], high [[thermal conductivity]], ease of [[solder]]ing, [[malleability]], and ease of installation.

For a short period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, copper wiring was replaced by [[aluminium wiring]] in many housing construction projects in America.  The new wiring was implicated in a number of house fires and the industry returned to copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heimer.com/Inspection-Information/Aluminum-Wiring.html|title=Aluminum Wiring Hazards and Pre-Purchase Inspections.|website=www.heimer.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/electrical-wiring/part2/section-16.html|title=Electrical Wiring FAQ (Part 2 of 2)Section - Aluminum wiring|website=www.faqs.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antibiofouling applications===
{{Main|Copper alloys in aquaculture|Copper sheathing}}
Copper is [[biostatic]], meaning bacteria and many other forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason it has long been used to line parts of ships to protect against [[barnacle]]s and [[mussel]]s. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by [[Muntz metal]] and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in [[copper alloys in aquaculture]], copper alloys have become important netting materials in the [[aquaculture]] industry because they are [[antimicrobial]] and prevent [[biofouling]], even in extreme conditions&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Edding, Mario E., Flores, Hector, and Miranda, Claudio, (1995), Experimental Usage of Copper-Nickel Alloy Mesh in Mariculture.

====Compression clothing====
Recently, some [[compression bandage|compression]] clothing with inter-woven copper has been marketed with health claims similar to the folk medicine claims. Because compression clothing is a valid treatment for some ailments, the clothing may have that benefit, but the added copper may have no benefit beyond a [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Copper proteins]] have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen transportation, processes that exploit the easy interconversion of Cu(I) and Cu(II).&lt;!-- this obscure detail probably doesn't need so many citations, someone read on the topic should choose one and remove the rest !--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Copper is essential in the aerobic [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] of all [[eukaryotes]]. In [[mitochondria]], it is found in [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is the last protein in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water. Copper is also found in many [[superoxide dismutase]]s, proteins that catalyze the decomposition of [[superoxide]]s by converting it (by [[disproportionation]]) to oxygen and [[hydrogen peroxide]]:
* Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-SOD + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-SOD + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (reduction of copper; oxidation of superoxide)
* Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-SOD + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-SOD + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (oxidation of copper; reduction of superoxide)

The protein [[hemocyanin]] is the oxygen carrier in most [[mollusk]]s and some [[arthropod]]s such as the [[horseshoe crab]] (''Limulus polyphemus'').&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web|title = Fun facts|work = Horseshoe crab|publisher = University of Delaware|url = http://www.ocean.udel.edu/horseshoecrab/funFacts.html|accessdate = 13 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based [[hemoglobin]]. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the [[laccase]]s and [[tyrosinase]]s. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by their role in the formation of [[lacquer]]s.&lt;ref name="Lippard"&gt;S. J. Lippard, J. M.

===Dietary needs===
Copper is an essential [[trace element]] in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;mg per kg of body mass.&lt;ref name="copper.org"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.copper.org/consumers/health/papers/cu_health_uk/cu_health_uk.html|title = Amount of copper in the normal human body, and other nutritional copper facts|accessdate = 3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to [[serum albumin|albumin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adelstein|first1=S.

Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/67/5/965S.abstract | title = Copper transport | pmid = 9587137 | date = 1 May 1998 | author1 = M C Linder | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 965S–971S | last2 = Wooten | first2 = L. | last3 = Cerveza | first3 = P. | last4 = Cotton | first4 = S. | last5 = Shulze | first5 = R. | last6 = Lomeli | first6 = N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper in the body normally undergoes [[enterohepatic circulation]] (about 5&amp;nbsp;mg a day, vs. about 1&amp;nbsp;mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via [[bile]], which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor =20170553 | pmid = 775938 | date =1976 | last1 =Frieden | first1 =E. | last2 =Hsieh | first2 =H.

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated the estimated average requirements (EARs) and recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for copper in 2001. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) is used instead. The AIs for copper are: 200&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 0–6-month-old males and females, and 220&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 7–12-month-old males and females. The RDAs for copper are: 340&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 1–3-year-old males, 440&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 4–8-year-old males, 700&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 9–13-year-old males, 890&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 14–18-year-old males, and 900&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for males that are 19 years old and older. The RDAs for copper are: 340&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 1–3-year-old females, 440&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 4–8-year-old females, 700&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 9–13-year-old females, 890&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 14–18-year-old females, and 900&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for females that are 19 years old and older. The RDAs for copper are: 1,000&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 14–50-year-old pregnant females; furthermore, 1,300&amp;nbsp;μg of copper for 14–50-year-old lactating females.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRI-Tables/2_%20RDA%20and%20AI%20Values_Vitamin%20and%20Elements.pdf?la=en Dietary Reference Intakes: RDA and AI for Vitamins and Elements] Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies Press, 2011. Retrieved 18 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; As for safety, the IOM also sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper the UL is set at 10&amp;nbsp;mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Copper. IN: [https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/9  Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Copper]. National Academy Press. 2001, PP. 224–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 18 and older the AIs are set at 1.3 and 1.6&amp;nbsp;mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 0.7 to 1.3&amp;nbsp;mg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |year=2017 |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 5&amp;nbsp;mg/day, which is half the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals |publisher=European Food Safety Authority |year=2006 |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For copper labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg, but {{as of|2016|May|27|lc=y|df=US}} it was revised to 0.9&amp;nbsp;mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates "Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel - Compliance Date"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deficiency===
Because of its role in facilitating iron uptake, [[copper deficiency]] can produce [[anemia]]-like symptoms, [[neutropenia]], bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, [[Wilson's disease]] causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.

Severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels, low ceruloplasmin, and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels; these are not sensitive to marginal copper status. The "cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets" has been stated as another factor in deficiency, but the results have not been confirmed by replication.&lt;ref name=Bonhametal2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonham |first= Maxine |last2= O'Connor |first2= Jacqueline M. |last3= Hannigan |first3= Bernadette M. |last4= Strain |first4= J.

Chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to [[Wilson's disease]] with copper accumulation and [[cirrhosis]] of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes.&lt;ref name="copper.org"/&gt;

=== Human exposure ===
In the US, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has designated a [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for copper dust and fumes in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup href="Legionnaires' disease"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[Recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, time-weighted average. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup href="arthritis"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decline curve generated by decline curve analysis software, utilized in petroleum economics to indicate the depletion of oil &amp; gas in a [[petroleum reservoir]].]]

'''Decline curve analysis''' is a means of predicting future [[oil well]] or gas well production based on past production history. Production decline curve analysis is a traditional means of identifying well production problems and predicting well performance and life based on measured oil well production.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/~petro/faculty/Kelly/Deline.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  
Before the availability of computers, decline curve analysis was performed by hand on [[semi-log plot]] paper. Currently, decline curve analysis software on PC computers is used to plot production decline curves for petroleum economics analysis.

==Background==
Oil and gas wells usually reach their maximum output shortly after [[completion (oil and gas wells)|completion]]. From that time, other than wells completed in water-drive reservoirs, they decline in production, the rapidity of decline depending on the output of the wells and on other factors governing their productivity. The production decline curve shows the amount of oil and gas produced per unit of time for several consecutive periods; if the conditions affecting the rate of production are not changed, the curve may be fairly regular, and, if projected, will furnish useful knowledge as to the future production of the well. By the aid of this knowledge the value of a property may be judged, and proper depletion and depreciation charges may be made on the books of the operating company.({{Harvnb|Lewis|1918}})&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/transactionsmining59amer/transactionsmining59amer_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Production decline curve analysis is important in determining the value in oil and gas wells in oil and gas economics.  Decline curves are the most common means of forecasting oil and gas production.  Decline curves have many advantages: they use data which is easy to obtain, they are easy to plot, they yield results on a time basis, and they are easy to analyze.  Decline curves are also one of the oldest methods of predicting oil reserves.({{Harvnb|Thompson|1985}})

: “Not all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water. You can find some oil deposits buried deep under the ocean floor.” ...Using sonic equipment, oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to produce oil. Then they use a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) to dig the initial well. Some units are converted into production rigs, meaning they switch from drilling for oil to capturing oil once it's found. Most of the time, the oil company will replace the MODU with a more permanent oil production rig to capture oil.” ...The MODU's job is to drill down into the ocean's floor to find oil deposits. The part of the drill that extends below the deck and through the water is called the riser. The riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the floor and the rig. Engineers lower a drill string &amp;ndash; a series of pipes designed to drill down to the oil deposit &amp;ndash; through the riser.”&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[File:Model well, burial find, China, Han dynasty, 206 BC to 220 AD, earthenware - Östasiatiska museet, Stockholm - DSC09578.JPG|thumb|200px|A Chinese ceramic model of a well with a water [[pulley]] system, excavated from a tomb of the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC - 220 AD) period]]

Some of the earliest evidence of water wells are located in China.  The Chinese discovered and made extensive use of deep drilled groundwater for drinking. The Chinese text ''[[I Ching|The Book of Changes]]'', originally a divination text of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 -771 BC), contains an entry describing how the ancient Chinese maintained their wells and protected their sources of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Kuhn |first=Oliver  |date=2004-06-30 |title=Ancient Chinese Drilling |url=https://csegrecorder.com/articles/view/ancient-chinese-drilling |journal=Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists |publisher= Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists |volume=29 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence and old Chinese documents reveal that the prehistoric and ancient Chinese had the aptitude and skills for digging deep water wells for drinking water as early as 6000 to 7000 years ago.

==Types of Deepwater Drilling Facilities==
Drilling in deep waters can be performed by two main types of mobile deepwater drilling rigs: [[semi-submersible]] drilling rigs and [[drillship]]s. Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a fixed platform, or a floating platform, such as a [[spar (platform)|spar platform]], a [[tension-leg platform]], or a semi-submersible production platform..
# Fixed Platform- A Fixed Platform consists of a tall, (usually) steel structure that supports a deck. Because the Fixed Platform is anchored to the sea floor, it is very costly to build. This type of platform can be installed in water depth up to {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. 
# Jack-Up Rigs- Jack-up rigs are mobile units with a floating hull that can be moved around; once arrived to the desired location, the legs are lowered to the sea floor and locked into place. Then the platform is raised up out of the water. That makes this type of rig safer to work on, because weather and waves are not an issue. 
# Compliant Tower Platform - A compliant tower is a particular type of fixed platform. Both are anchored to the sea floor and both work places are above the water surface. However, the compliant tower is taller and narrower, and can operate up to 1 kilometer (3,000 feet) water depth. 
# Semi-submersible production platform. This platform is buoyant, meaning the bulk of it is floating above the surface. However, the well head is typically located on the sea floor, so extra precautions must be made to prevent a leak.  A contributing cause to the oil spill disaster of 2010 was a failure of the leak-preventing system. These rigs can operate anywhere from {{convert|200|to|2000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} below the surface.
# Tension-Leg Platform- The Tension-leg Platform consists of a floating structure, held in place by tendons that run down to the sea floor. These rigs drill smaller deposits in narrower areas, meaning this is a low-cost way to get a little oil, which attracts many companies. These rigs can drill anywhere from {{convert|200|to|1200|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} below the surface.
# Subsea Systems- Subsea Systems are actually wellheads, which sit on the sea floor and extract oil straight from the ground. They use pipes to force the oil back up to the surface, and can siphon oil to nearby platform rigs, a ship overhead, a local production hub, or even a faraway onshore site. This makes the Subsea system very versatile and a popular choice for companies.
# Spar Platform- Spar Platforms use a large cylinder to support the floating deck from the sea floor. On average, about 90% of the Spar Platform's structure is underwater. Most Spar Platforms are used up to depths of 1 kilometer (3,000 feet), but new technology can extend them to function up to {{convert|3500|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} below the surface. That makes it one of the deepest drilling rigs in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/energy/stories/types-of-offshore-oil-rigs}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Gulf Oil Spill Disaster==
On 20 April 2010, a BP deepwater oil rig ([[Deepwater Horizon]]) exploded, killing 11 and releasing 750 000 cubic meters (200 million gallons) of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. With those numbers, many scientists consider this disaster to be one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of animal deaths have resulted from the release of the oil. A Center study estimates that over 82,000 birds; about 6,000 sea turtles; and nearly 26,000 marine mammals were killed from either the initial explosion or the oil spill.

{{for|the early computer|Harwell Dekatron Computer}}
[[File:Dekatron.jpg|thumb|upright|An octal-base dekatron.]]

In [[electronics]], a '''Dekatron''' (or '''Decatron''', or generically '''three-phase gas counting tube''' or '''glow-transfer counting tube''' or '''cold cathode tube''') is a gas-filled [[Counter (digital)#Decade counter|decade counting]] tube. Dekatrons were used in computers, calculators and other counting-related products during the 1950s and 1960s. "Dekatron," now a [[generic trademark]], was the brand name used by [[Ericsson Telephones Limited]] (ETL), of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Nottingham]] (not to be confused with the Swedish [[Ericsson|TelefonAB Ericsson]] of [[Stockholm]]).

[[File:Dekatron.gif|left|thumb|A dekatron in operation.]]
The dekatron was useful for computing, calculating and frequency-dividing purposes because one complete revolution of the neon dot in a dekatron means 10 pulses on the guide electrode(s), and a signal can be derived from one of the ten cathodes in a dekatron to send a pulse, possibly for another counting stage. Dekatrons usually have a maximum input frequency in the high kilohertz (kHz) range – 100 kHz is fast, 1 MHz is around the maximum possible. These frequencies are obtained in [[hydrogen]]-filled fast dekatrons. Dekatrons filled with [[inert gas]] are inherently more stable and have a longer life, but their counting frequency is limited to 10 kHz (1–2 kHz is more common).

Internal designs vary by the model and manufacturer, but generally a dekatron has ten [[cathode]]s and one or two guide electrodes plus a common [[anode]]. The cathodes are arranged in a circle with a guide electrode (or two) between each cathode. When the guide electrode(s) is pulsed properly, the neon gas will activate near the guide pins then "jump" to the next cathode. Pulsing the guide electrodes (negative going pulses) repeatedly will cause the neon dot to move from cathode to cathode. 

[[File:Dekatron top.jpg|thumb|Detail of the top of a dekatron — central anode disk surrounded by 30 internal cathode pins.]]
[[File:Dekatron operation neg.png|thumb|Sending sequenced pulses to guide electrodes will determine the direction of movement.]]
Hydrogen dekatrons require high voltages ranging from 400 to 600 volts on the anode for proper operation; dekatrons with inert gas usually require ~350 volts. When a dekatron is first powered up, a glowing dot appears at a random cathode; the tube must then be reset to zero state, by driving a negative pulse into the designated starting cathode. The color of the dot depends on the type of gas that is in the tube. Neon-filled tubes display a red-orange dot; argon-filled tubes display a purple dot (and are much dimmer than neon).

''Counter'' (common-cathode) dekatrons have only one [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry/borrow]] cathode wired to its own socket pin for multistage cascading and the remaining nine cathodes tied together to another pin; therefore they don't need bases with more than 9 pins.

''Counter/Selector'' (separate-cathode) dekatrons have each cathode wired to its own pin; therefore their bases have at least 13 pins. ''Selectors'' allow for monitoring the status of each cathode or to [[Frequency divider|divide-by-n]] with the proper reset circuitry. This kind of versatility made such dekatrons useful for numerical division in early calculators.

Dekatrons come in various physical sizes, ranging from smaller than a [[Tube socket#Miniature tubes|7-pin miniature]] [[vacuum tube]] to as large as an [[Tube socket#Octal base|octal base tube]]. While most dekatrons are decimal counters, models were also made to count in [[Quinary|base-5]] and [[Duodecimal|base-12]] for specific applications.

The dekatron fell out of practical use when [[transistor]]-based counters became reliable and affordable. Today, dekatrons are used by electronic hobbyists in simple "spinners" that run off the mains frequency (50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) or as a numeric indicator for homemade clocks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13324">'''Engineered Cementitious Composite''' (ECC), also called Strain Hardening Cement-based Composites (SHCC) or more popularly as '''bendable concrete''', is an easily molded [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]-based composite reinforced with specially selected short random fibers, usually [[polymer]] fibers.&lt;ref name="ECC"&gt;{{cite web  | title = A brief introduction to ECC and ECC technology network | url=http://www.engineeredcomposites.com/html/introduction.html | accessdate = 2007-11-03 | work =Engineeredcomposites.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike regular [[concrete]], ECC has a strain capacity in the range of 3–7%,&lt;ref name="ECC"/&gt; compared to 0.01% for ordinary portland cement (OPC) paste, mortar or concrete. ECC therefore acts more like a ductile [[metal]] like material rather than a brittle [[glass]] like material (as does OPC concrete), leading to a wide variety of applications.

==Development==

ECC, unlike common [[fiber reinforced concrete]], is a family of [[Microelectromechanical systems|micromechanically]] designed materials.&lt;ref&gt;V.C. Li: ''From mechanics to structural engineering - The design of cementitious composites for civil engineering applications''  Structural Engineering/Earthquake Engineering (1993) 10:37s-48s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, M., and Li, V. C., “Rheology, Fiber Dispersion, and Robust Properties of Engineered Cementitious Composites, “ Materials and Structures, 46 (3): 405-420, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a cementitious material is designed/developed based on micromechanics and fracture mechanics theory to feature large tensile ductility, it can be called an ECC. Therefore, ECC is not a fixed material design, but a broad range of topics under different stages of research, development, and implementations. The ECC material family is expanding. The development of an individual mix design of ECC requires special efforts by systematically engineering of the material at nano-, micro-, macro- and composite scales.

ECC looks similar to ordinary portland cement-based concrete, except that it can deform (or bend) under strain.&lt;ref name="ECC"/&gt; A number of research groups are developing ECC science, including those at the [[University of Michigan]], [[University of California, Irvine]], [[Delft University of Technology]], the [[University of Tokyo]], the [[Czech Technical University]], [[University of British Columbia]], and [[Stanford University]]. Traditional concrete’s lack of durability and failure under strain, both stemming from brittle behavior, have been a pushing factor in the development of ECC.

==Properties==
ECC has a variety of unique properties, including tensile properties superior to other [[fiber reinforced composite|fiber-reinforced composites]], ease of processing on par with conventional cement, the use of only a small volume fraction of fibers (~ 2%), tight crack width, and a lack of anisotropically weak planes.&lt;ref&gt;M.D. Lepech and V.C. Li: “Large scale processing of Engineered Cementitious Composite.” ACI Materials Journal (2008) 105:358-366.&lt;/ref&gt; These properties are due largely to the interaction between the fibers and cementing matrix, which can be custom-tailored through micromechanics design. Essentially, the fibers create many microcracks with a very specific width, rather than a few very large cracks (as in conventional concrete.) This allows ECC to deform without catastrophic failure.

This microcracking behavior leads to superior [[corrosion]] resistance (the cracks are so small and numerous that it is difficult for aggressive media to penetrate and attack the reinforcing steel) as well as to self-healing.&lt;ref name="National Geographic News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/05/090505-self-healing-concrete.html|title=Bendable Concrete Heals Itself -- Just Add Water|last=Minard |first=Anne |date=2009-05-05|work=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, M., and Li, V. C., "Cracking and Healing of Engineered Cementitious Composites under Chloride Environment," ACI Materials Journal, Vol. 108, No. 3, May–June 2011, pp. 333-340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sahmaran, M., Li, M., and Li, V. C., “Transport Properties of Engineered Cementitious Composites Under Chloride Exposure,” ACI Materials Journal, Vol. 104, No. 6, November 2007, pp. 604-611.&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of water (during a rainstorm, for instance) unreacted cement particles recently exposed due to cracking hydrate and form a number of products ([[Calcium Silicate Hydrate]], [[calcite]], etc.) that expand and fill in the crack. These products appear as a white ‘scar’ material filling in the crack. This self-healing behavior not only seals the crack to prevent transport of fluids, but mechanical properties are regained. This self-healing has been observed in a variety of conventional cement and concretes; however, above a certain crack width self healing becomes less effective. It is the tightly controlled crack widths seen in ECC that ensure all cracks thoroughly heal when exposed to the natural environment.

When combined with a more conductive material, all cement materials can increase and be used for damage-sensing. This is essentially based on the fact that conductivity will change as damage occurs; the addition of conductive material is meant to raise the conductivity to a level where such changes will be easily identified. Though not a material property of ECC itself, semi-conductive ECC for damage-sensing &lt;ref&gt;Li, M., Lin, V., Lynch, J., and Li, V. C., “Multifunctional Carbon Black Engineered Cementitious Composites for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure,” Proceedings of RILEM 6th International Conference on High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cement Composites, Ann Arbor, MI, June 20–22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lin, V., Li, M., Lynch, J., and Li., V. C., “Mechanical and Electrical Characterization of Self-Sensing Carbon Black ECC,” SPIE Smart Structures and Materials, Nondestructive Evaluation and Health Monitoring, San Diego, CA, March 6–11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; are being developed.

==Types==
There are a number of different varieties of ECC, including:
*Lightweight (i.e. low density) ECC have been developed through the addition of air voids, glass bubbles, polymer spheres, and/or lightweight aggregate. Compared to other lightweight  concretes, lightweight ECC has superior ductility. Applications include floating homes, barges, and canoes.
*‘Self compacting concrete’ refers to a [[concrete]] that can flow under its own weight. For instance, a self-compacting material would be able to fill a mold containing elaborate pre-positioned steel reinforcement without the need of vibration or shaking to ensure even distribution. Self-compacting ECC was developed through the use of chemical [[Concrete#Chemical admixtures|admixtures]] to decrease viscosity and through controlling particle interactions with mix proportioning.
*Sprayable ECC, which can be pneumatically sprayed from a hose, have been developed by using various superplasticizing agents and viscosity-reducing admixtures. Compared to other sprayable [[fiber reinforced composite|fiber-reinforced composites]], sprayable ECC has enhanced pumpability in addition to its unique mechanical properties. Sprayable ECC has been used for retrofitting/repair work and tunnel/sewer linings.
*An extrudable ECC for use in the extrusion of pipes was first developed in 1998. Extruded ECC pipes have both higher load capacity and higher deformability than any other extruded fiber-reinforced composite pipes.

==Field Applications==
ECC have found use in a number of large-scale applications in Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Australia and the U.S.[3]. These include:

* The Mitaka Dam near [[Hiroshima]] was repaired using ECC in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeredcomposites.com/Applications/mitaka_dam.html''ECC Technology Network - Mitaka Dam'' accessed 11/11/09]&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the then 60-year-old dam was severely damaged, showing evidence of cracks, spalling, and some water leakage. A 20&amp;nbsp;mm-thick layer of ECC was applied by spraying over the 600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; surface.
* Also in 2003, an earth retaining wall in Gifu, Japan, was repaired using ECC.&lt;ref&gt;V.C. Li, G. Fischer, and M.D Lepech: ''Shotcreting with ECC'', Spritzbeton Tagung (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary [[portland cement]] could not be used due to the severity of the cracking in the original structure, which would have caused reflective cracking. ECC was intended to minimize this danger; after one year only microcracks of tolerable width were observed.
* The 95&amp;nbsp;m (312&amp;nbsp;ft.) Glorio Roppongi high-rise apartment building in [[Tokyo]] contains a total of 54 ECC coupling beams (two per story) intended to mitigate earthquake damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Bendable concrete minimizes cracking and fracture problems'', MRS Bulletin (2006) 31: pp. 862&lt;/ref&gt; The properties of ECC (high damage tolerance, high energy absorption, and ability to deform under shear) give it superior properties in seismic resistance applications when compared to ordinary [[portland cement]]. Similar structures include the 41-story Nabeaure Yokohama Tower (four coupling beams per floor.)
* The {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} long Mihara Bridge in [[Hokkaido]], Japan was opened to traffic in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeredcomposites.com/Applications/mihara_bridge.html”ECC Technology Network – Mihara Bridge” accessed 10/28/09]&lt;/ref&gt; The steel-reinforced road bed contains nearly 800 m3 of ECC material. The tensile ductility and tight crack control behavior of ECC led to a 40% reduction in material used during construction.
* Similarly, a 225-mm thick ECC bridge deck on interstate 94 in [[Michigan]] was completed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;M.D. Lepech and V.C. Li: ''Application of ECC for bridge deck link slabs'', Materials and Structures (2009) 42:1185–1195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, V. C., Lepech, M., and Li, M., “Field Demonstration of Durable Link Slabs for Jointless Bridge Decks Based on Strain-Hardening Cementitious Composites,” Michigan Department of Transportation Research Report RC-1471, December 2005, 265 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; 30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of material was used, delivered on-site in standard mixing trucks. Due to the unique mechanical properties of ECC, this deck also used less material than a proposed deck made of ordinary portland cement. Both the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] are monitoring the bridge in an attempt to verify the theoretical superior durability of ECC; after four years of monitoring, performance remained undiminished.
* The first self-consolidating and high-early-strength ECC patch repair was placed on Ellsworth Road Bridge over US-23 in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Li, V. C., Li, M., and Lepech, M., “High Performance Material for Rapid Durable Repair of Bridges and Structures,” Michigan Department of Transportation Research Report RC-1484, December 2006, 142 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, M., Multi-Scale Design for Durable Repair of Concrete Structures, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Michigan, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The high-early-strength ECC can achieve a compressive strength of 23.59 ± 1.40 MPa (3422.16 ± 203.33 psi) in four hours and 55.59 ± 2.17 MPa (8062.90 ± 315.03 psi) in 28 days, allowing for fast repair and re-opening the session to traffic. The high-early-strength ECC repair has shown superior long-term durability in field conditions compared to typical concrete repair materials.

The idea of Eress (European Partnership for Railway Energy Settlement System) was presented for the first time in 1999 by Director of Jernbaneverket Bane Energi  Johnny Brevik in a Nordic Railway Conferance in Tampere Finland. It was a new idea therefore it took 4 years before the first agreement between Jernbaneverket, Banverket and Banedanmark was signed in 2004.  Johnny Brevik was the first leader of the Board of Directors (2004-2009). 

The '''European Partnership for Railway Energy Settlement Systems''' (Eress) is a European Partnership for Railway Energy Settlement Systems. The Eress railway energy settlement system, Erex, provides energy metering services and enables the industry to measure, control and bill for the actual energy consumed by trains. At any given time there will be numerous trains active on the railway network. Trains consume electricity from the grid, for which they need to pay according to their use. The national authority, represented by an infrastructure manager, is responsible for billing this use. The infrastructure manager sends an energy bill to the train companies. In Europe before Eress, most infrastructure managers used estimates to bill train energy consumption.

The program is based on an earlier idea from the Norwegian National Rail Administration. It was founded in 2004 under the name Nress (Nordic Railway Energy Settlement System), and was a collaboration between Trafikkverket (former Banverket), Banedanmark and Bane NOR (Former Jernbaneverket). In 2008 the name was changed to Eress (European Railway Energy Settlement System). Although the administrative headquarter is in [[Oslo, Norway]], the Eress Board of Directors consists of representatives from each of the 7 existing partners.&lt;ref name="Smith2016"/&gt; The program has been shown to result in energy savings and was awarded an award for Energy and CO2 at the 2012 [[International Union of Railways]] Sustainability Conference.

==Energy settlement==
The energy settlement system provided by Eress is called Erex. This, according to Railway Pro (2011), enables infrastructure managers to fulfill requirements for a neutral and non-discriminatory operation, and railway undertakings to understand their use of energy and thereby save energy and costs. The system is composed of the following elements: Advanced energy meters mounted on board trains, an energy measurement system that collects and validates the metered data and a settlement system that performs the settlement, cost distribution, data exchange and billing. According to that article, Erex is unique on the European market in the way that it's the only system that can provide such advanced services to railways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaypro.com/wp/metering-and-saving-energy-%e2%80%93-erex/ Ilie , Elena "Metering and saving energy - Erex ". Railway Pro Communication Platform , August 23, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently (2017), the system is being tested by the French National Railways (SNCF): "French National Railways (SNCF) is to test the Erex IT energy management and billing system on 50 of its freight locomotives developed by the Eress consortium of five European infrastructure managers and one railway."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/locomotives/sncf-to-test-energy-management-system.html Briginshaw, David. "SNCF to test energy management system ". Railjournal by Simmons-Boardman Publishing Inc., Feb 27, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy savings ==
In the ''Railway Journal'' on June 16, 2016, Mr. Dyre Martin Gulbrandsen reports that the added accuracy in invoicing by the Eress system creates an incentive to save energy. By billing the actual energy used the train companies start adhere to a more economic driving pattern.&lt;ref name="Smith2016"/&gt;

===Documented energy savings===
At least two studies of the Norwegian National Railways (NSB) have documented energy savings resulting from the adoption of Eress. One study found an 18% energy efficiency improvement for NSB between 2004 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaypro.com/wp/operators-strive-to-improve-their-energy-performance/ Ilie, Elena. "Operators strive to improve their energy performance ". Railway Pro, Dec 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Another from 2016 noted that NSB saved €37m in energy consumption costs since installing Erex in 2004, and that the rail system is using approximately 75% of the energy it was consuming 12 years ago.&lt;ref name="Smith2016"/&gt;

== Awards ==
During the 10th International Union of Railways Sustainability Conference in 2012 in Venice, Eress was awarded an Energy and CO2 award.&lt;ref&gt;Three additional awards were given: Sustainable Mobility award to TRENITALIA, Sustainable Land Use award to ÖBB Green Paper, and the Jury’s Special Prize on Energy Efficiency to Indian Railways.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fe'i bananas''' (also spelt '''Fehi''' or '''Fei''') are cultivated plants in the [[genus]] ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'', used mainly for their fruit. They are distinct in appearance and origin from the majority of [[banana]]s and [[Plantain (true)|plantain]]s currently grown, which derive from different wild species. Found mainly in the islands of the Pacific, particularly [[French Polynesia]], Fe'i bananas have skins which are brilliant orange to red in colour with yellow or orange flesh inside. They are usually eaten cooked and have been an important food for [[Pacific Islanders]], moving with them as they migrated across the ocean. Most are high in [[beta-carotene]] (a precursor of [[vitamin A]]).

The [[scientific name]] for Fe'i bananas is '''''Musa'' × ''troglodytarum''''' L. Precisely which wild species they are descended from remained unclear {{As of|2013|January|lc=yes}}.

==Description==
[[File:Hillsman carrying feis to Papeete, by Coulon.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-1906 photograph titled "Hillsman carrying feis to Papeete" (Tahiti)]]
Fe'i bananas are cultivated varieties ([[cultivars]]), rather than wild forms. They are distinctly different from the much more common [[banana]]s and [[Plantain (true)|plantain]]s derived from ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''.&lt;ref name=Ploe07/&gt; All members of the [[genus]] ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'' are tall [[herbaceous plant]]s, typically around {{convert|3|–|10|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall or even more. Although they appear tree-like, the "trunk" is actually a [[pseudostem]], formed from the tightly wrapped bases of the leaves. At maturity each pseudostem produces a single flowering stem that grows up inside it, eventually emerging from the top. As it elongates, female flowers appear which go on to form fruit – the bananas. Finally male flowers are produced. In cultivated bananas, the fruit is usually seedless and the male flowers sterile.&lt;ref name=Nels06/&gt;

Fe'i bananas can be distinguished from other kinds of cultivated bananas and plantains in a number of ways. They have highly coloured [[sap]], pink through to bright magenta and dark purple. The [[bract]]s of the flowering spike ([[inflorescence]]) are bright shiny green rather than dull red or purple. The flowering and fruiting stem is more or less upright (rather than drooping), so that the bunches of bananas are also upright. Ripe fruit has brilliant orange, copper-coloured or red skin with orange or yellow flesh inside. It has prominent ridges, making it squarish in cross-section.&lt;ref name=Ploe07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt;

==Systematics==
[[File:Musa uranoscopos Rumphius.jpg|thumb|"''Musa Uranoscopos''" – the lectotype of ''Musa troglodytarum'' L.; from Rumphius (1747), ''Herbarium amboinensis'', tab. 61&lt;ref name=Rump47/&gt;]]
As with many names in the genus ''Musa'', considerable confusion has existed as to the proper [[scientific name]], if any, for Fe'i bananas. Some authorities have preferred to treat Fe'i bananas as a formal or informal [[cultivar group]] rather than employing a Latin [[binomial name|binomial]], using names like ''Musa'' (Fe'i Group) 'Utafan'.&lt;ref name=RHS_Fei/&gt;

One of the earliest detailed accounts of the genus ''Musa'' was by the German-Dutch botanist [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius|Georg E. Rumpf]] (c.1627–1702), usually known by the Latinized name Rumphius. His ''Herbarium amboinensis'' was published in 1747, after his death. His figure and description of a "species" under the name "''Musa Uranoscopos''" (meaning "heaven-looking banana") is consistent with a Fe'i banana; he refers to the upright flowering spike (although the figure, reproduced here, shows the terminal bud drooping), the coloured sap, and the effect of consumption on urine.&lt;ref name=Rump47/&gt;

However, the starting point for botanical names is the publication of [[Carl Linnaeus]]' ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753, so "''Musa uranoscopos''" is not an acceptable name. In the second edition of ''Species Plantarum'', Linnaeus lumped together Rumphius' ''Musa uranoscopos'' and ''Musa'' 'Pissang Batu' under the name ''Musa troglodytarum'', in spite of the fact that Rumphius had noted several distinctions between the two. Linnaeus' treatment has been described as "beyond understanding".&lt;ref name=HakkVareChri12/&gt; In 1917, Merrill designated the illustration of Rumphius' ''Musa uranoscopos'' as the [[type (biology)|lectotype]] of ''Musa troglodytarum'' L. On this basis, Häkkinen, Väre and Christenhusz concluded in 2012 that "all Fe'i cultivars, including those featured in [[Paul Gauguin]]'s famous paintings, should be treated under the name ''M. troglodytarum'' L."&lt;ref name=HakkVareChri12/&gt; Other sources also accept this as the scientific name for the group as a whole – for example [[Rafaël Govaerts]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=WCSP_255026/&gt; The name may be written as ''M.''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''troglodytarum'' to stress the hybrid origin of Fe'i bananas.

[[Synonym (taxonomy)|Synonyms]] of ''M.&amp;nbsp;troglodytarum'' are:&lt;ref name=HakkVareChri12/&gt;&lt;ref name=HakVar08/&gt;
*"''M.&amp;nbsp;uranoscopos''" Rumphius (1747) – published before 1753, so not an acceptable name
*''M.&amp;nbsp;uranoscopos'' Lour. (1790) – a superfluous name because it was provided as an alternative name to Linnaeus', hence illegitimate; [[João de Loureiro|Loureiro]]'s description is based on a different plant, ''[[Musa coccinea|M.&amp;nbsp;coccinea]]
*''M.&amp;nbsp;uranoscopos'' Colla (1820) – superfluous and hence illegitimate
*''M.&amp;nbsp;uranoscopos'' Mig. (1855) – superfluous and hence illegitimate
*''M.&amp;nbsp;uranoscopos'' Seem. (1868) – superfluous and hence illegitimate
*''M.&amp;nbsp;seemannii'' Mueller (1875)  – superfluous and hence illegitimate
*''M.&amp;nbsp;fehi'' Bertero ex Vieillard (1862)

Whereas most cultivated bananas and plantains are derived from species in ''Musa'' section ''Musa'', Fe'i bananas are clearly part of section ''Callimusa'' (in particular the species formerly grouped as section ''Australimusa'').&lt;ref name=Wong02/&gt; However, their precise origins are unclear. On the basis of appearance (morphology), ''[[Musa maclayi]]'', native to [[Papua New Guinea]], has been proposed as a parent. More recent genetic studies suggest they are close to ''[[Musa lolodensis|M.&amp;nbsp;lolodensis]]'' and ''[[Musa peekelii|M.&amp;nbsp;peekelii]]'', both from New Guinea and neighbouring islands. Fe'i bananas may be hybrids between several different wild species.&lt;ref name=Ploe07/&gt; They are generally considered to have originated in New Guinea and then to have been spread eastwards and northwards (as far as the [[Hawaiian Islands]]) for use as food.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt;

A few cultivars have been found which appear to be intermediate between Fe'i bananas and the more common [[Banana|''Musa'' section ''Musa'']] bananas and plantains. Although the part of the stem holding the fruit is upright, the rest of the stem then bends over so that the terminal bud faces sideways or downwards. An example is the cultivar 'Tati'a' from [[Tahiti]]. Molecular analysis of bananas with this growth habit from Papua New Guinea has shown evidence of genetic input from ''[[Musa acuminata|M. acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana|M. balbisiana]]'', the parents of the section ''Musa'' cultivars.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt; Rumphius' illustration of his "''Musa uranoscopos''" shows the same morphology, although this might be artistic license.&lt;ref name=HakkVareChri12/&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:Fe'i banana map.png|400px|thumb|
The dashed lines show the region in which Fe'i bananas are found and where they have, at least historically, been used as food.&lt;ref group=Note name=Note2/&gt;
]]
Fe'i bananas are mainly found from the [[Moluccas]] in the west to [[French Polynesia]] in the east, particularly the [[Society Islands]] and the [[Marquesas]]. They have been important both as a [[Staple food|staple]] and as a ceremonial food, although their cultivation and use has sharply declined in recent decades. As the [[Pacific Islander]]s spread by canoe throughout the Pacific, they took Fe'i bananas with them; cultivation has been traced back to around 250 BC in the Marquesas and to around 800 AD in [[Tahiti]] in the Society Islands.&lt;ref name=Ploe07/&gt; They are believed to have originated in the New Guinea area, where cultivars with seeds occur, as do the wild species from which they are thought to be descended.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt;

==Cultivars==

Fe'i bananas are not in commercial cultivation. There are lists of cultivars for different islands, but it is not clear whether these are synonyms, with the same cultivar being known by different names in different locations and languages.&lt;ref name=Ploe07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nels06/&gt; Further, it is not clear whether local names apply to cultivars (i.e. distinct cultivated varieties) or to broader groups. Thus Ploetz et al. refer to a banana found in eastern Indonesia by the cultivar name 'Pisang Tongkat Langit'.&lt;ref name=Ploe07/&gt; However, ''pisang tongkat langit'' can be translated as "sky stick banana" or "heaven cane banana",&lt;ref name=Kamus/&gt; corresponding to Rumphius' name ''Musa uranoscopos'' (heaven-gazing banana). ''Pisang tongkat langit'' is treated by other sources as referring to ''M.''&amp;nbsp;× ''troglodytarum'' as a whole rather than to a single cultivar. Significant genetic variation has been reported among bananas from the Moluccas for which this name is used.&lt;ref name=Karu11/&gt;

The list below is selective; where many names are given in sources, it concentrates on those with the most description available.

==Use==

===As food===
Fe'i bananas are generally eaten as "plantains", i.e. they are usually cooked rather than eaten raw. They have been described as "delicious and nutritious when baked or boiled, especially if the slices are swathed in fresh coconut cream."{{sfn|ps=|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=3}} They have also been described as "unpleasantly astringent" unless cooked, having higher proportions of starch and lower proportions of sugar than other kinds of banana.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt; However, in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], some cultivars, particularly 'Karat Pwehu', 'Karat Pako' and to a lesser extent 'Utin Iap' (='Uht En Yap'), are commonly eaten raw when fully ripe. [[Karat banana]]s have a soft texture and a sweet taste and were a traditional weaning food in the Micronesian island of [[Pohnpei]].&lt;ref name=Engl03/&gt;

In countries where Fe'i bananas were once a major food item, there has been a shift away from eating traditional foods towards eating imported foods. Bananas with whiter flesh are preferred over traditional varieties with deeply coloured flesh.&lt;ref name=Engl03/&gt; One issue with Fe'i bananas is that eating them causes the production of yellow coloured urine, thought to be caused by the excretion of excess [[riboflavin]] present in the fruit. This effect led people to believe that Fe'i bananas might not be safe to eat, particularly for children.&lt;ref name=Engl10/&gt; Along with the shift away from traditional foods, there has been a rise in [[vitamin A deficiency]]. Fe'i bananas with deeper coloured flesh have been shown to contain high levels of [[beta-carotene]], a precursor of vitamin A. A year-long promotional campaign in Pohnpei in 1999 to encourage the consumption of Karat cultivars had some success in increasing sales.&lt;ref name=Engl03/&gt;

Levels of beta-carotene vary considerably among Fe'i bananas. In a study of traditional [[Solomon Islands]] cultivars, the highest level of beta-carotene found in a Fe'i cultivar was almost 6,000&amp;nbsp;µg per 100&amp;nbsp;g of flesh compared to the highest level of 1,300&amp;nbsp;µg in a non-Fe'i cultivar. However, there was an overlap; some Fe'i cultivars contained less beta-carotene than non-Fe'i cultivars.&lt;ref name=Engl10/&gt;

===Other uses===

Fe'i banana plants have many other uses. Like other kinds of banana, the leaves may be used as plates or containers for cooked food. They can also be used as a roofing material, particularly for temporary huts. The fibres of the midrib of the leaves can be used to make ropes, often used to carry bunches of bananas. Other fibrous parts of the leaves can be dried and plaited into mats and similar items. The pseudostems are buoyant, and so can be used to make temporary rafts.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt;

Fe'i bananas have distinctive reddish sap which does not readily fade on exposure to light. It is used as a dye, and has also been used to make ink.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt;

==Historical reports==

The early European explorers of the Pacific islands produced a few accounts of Fe'i bananas. In 1788, [[Daniel Solander]] accompanied [[Joseph Banks]] on [[James Cook]]'s first voyage to the Pacific Ocean aboard the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]''. In the account he published later, he noted five kinds of banana or plantain called "Fe'i" by the Tahitians. [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]] lived in the Society Islands in the 1850s. He refers to the name "Fe'i", saying that Fe'i bananas were the principal food for the inhabitants of some islands. He also noted that Fe'i banana plants have an upright fruit cluster.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] visited Tahiti in the Society Islands in 1835 and gave an account in ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''. Although he does not mention the name "Fe'i", he does speak of the "mountain-banana": "On each side of the ravine there were great beds of the mountain-banana, covered with ripe fruit. Many of these plants were from twenty to twenty-five feet high, and from three to four in circumference."&lt;ref name=Darw45/&gt; Fe'i bananas have been noted to grow best in Tahiti on slopes at the base of cliffs.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt;

[[Laurence Howland MacDaniels|Laurence H. MacDaniels]] published a study of the Fe'i banana in 1947. He reported that Fe'i bananas were the staple [[carbohydrate]] food of the Society Islanders, and that more than 95% of the bananas on sale were of the Fe'i type. Although some Fe'i banana plants were found in gardens, most bananas were gathered from the "wild", thought to have been planted in the past and abandoned.&lt;ref name=MacD47/&gt;

==In culture==
[[File:Paul Gauguin 042.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Gauguin]]'s ''Le Repas''; Fe'i bananas bottom left]]
Fe'i bananas are an important component of ceremonial feasts in the Marquesas and the Society Islands.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt; Karat bananas are reported to be one of the few kinds of banana that can be used in ceremonial presentations in Pohnpei, Micronesia.&lt;ref name=Engl03/&gt; A Samoan legend is that the mountain and the lowland banana fought. The mountain banana – the Fe'i banana – won. Filled with pride at its victory, the mountain banana raised its head high, whereas the defeated lowland banana never raised its head again.&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt; (Fe'i bananas have an upright fruiting stem, whereas the fruiting stem droops in other kinds of banana.)

The bright orange-red colours of Fe'i bananas make them attractive to artists. The French [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionist]] painter [[Paul Gauguin]] visited the [[Society Islands]], including [[Tahiti]], towards the end of the 19th century. Three of his works include what are considered to be Fe'i bananas: ''Le Repas'' (The Meal, 1891), ''La Orana Maria'' (Hail Mary, 1891) and ''Paysage de Tahiti'' (Tahitian Landscape, 1891&lt;ref group=Note name=Note1/&gt;).&lt;ref name=Shar01/&gt;

==Conservation==

Fe'i banana cultivars, along with other Pacific crop propagation material, have been saved at the [[Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees]] (CePaCT), which catalogs living plants of the Pacific region for conservation. More than 100 samples of Fe'i bananas were collected in French Polynesia, from isolated farms on six different islands. The samples will be conserved in a gene bank in Tahiti, with duplicates kept at CePaCt.&lt;ref name=Cepact/&gt;

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group="Note"|refs=

&lt;ref name=Note1&gt;There are several paintings by Gaugin with similar titles. Although {{Harvtxt|Sharrock|2001}} gives the date as 1892, it is the painting of 1891 that shows a man apparently carrying orange bananas. See {{Citation |title=Tahitian Landscape, 1891 |publisher=The Web Gallery of Impressionism |url=http://impressionistsgallery.co.uk/artists/Artists/ghi/Gauguin/pictures/Tahitian%20Landscape,%201891%20.jpg |accessdate=2013-01-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flixborough Explosion Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 139649.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Memorial to those who died in the disaster]]

The '''Flixborough disaster''' was an [[explosion]] at a [[chemical plant]] close to the village of [[Flixborough]], [[North Lincolnshire]], [[England]] on Saturday, 1 June 1974. It killed 28 people and seriously injured 36 out of a total of 72 people on site at the time. The casualty figures could have been much higher, if the explosion had occurred on a [[weekday]], when the main office area would have been occupied.&lt;ref name=srag/&gt;&lt;ref name=aria&gt;{{cite web |title=Catastrophic explosion of a cyclohexane cloud June 1, 1974 Flixborough United Kingdom|url=http://www.aria.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/wp-content/files_mf/FD_5611_flixborough_1974_ang.pdf|publisher=French Ministry of the Environment – DPPR / SEI / BARPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary campaigner on process safety wrote "the shock waves rattled the confidence of every chemical engineer in the country".&lt;ref name=Kinnersley/&gt;{{efn-ua |Various authors&lt;ref name= "Kletzlfa"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kletz |first= Trevor A. |authorlink= Trevor Kletz |title= Learning from Accidents, 3rd edition |publisher= Gulf Professional |year= 2001 |location= Oxford U.K. |pages= 103–9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zulmgUi5_aEC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA73,M1 |doi= |id= |isbn= 978-0-7506-4883-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; have compared it with the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] in one aspect or other}} 

The disaster involved (and may well have been caused by) a hasty modification. There was no on-site senior manager with mechanical engineering expertise (virtually all the plant management had chemical engineering qualifications); mechanical engineering issues with the modification were overlooked by the managers who approved it, nor was the severity of the potential consequences of its failure appreciated. 

Flixborough led to a widespread public outcry over process plant [[safety]]. Together with the passage of the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974|Health and Safety at Work Act]] in the same year it led to (and is often quoted in justification of) a more systematic approach to process safety in UK process industries, and – in conjunction with the [[Seveso disaster]] and the consequent [[European Union|EU]] 'Seveso directives' – to explicit UK government regulation of plant processing or storing large inventories of hazardous materials, currently (2014) by the [[Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999]] (COMAH).

==Overview==
[[File:The Flixborough Disaster - geograph.org.uk - 476616.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Another view of the memorial]]
The chemical works, owned by Nypro UK (a joint venture between [[DSM (company)|Dutch State Mines]] (DSM) and the British [[National Coal Board]] (NCB)) had originally produced fertiliser from by-products of the coke ovens of a nearby steelworks. Since 1967, it had instead produced [[caprolactam]], a chemical used in the manufacture of [[nylon 6]].{{efn|p 2}} The caprolactam was produced from [[cyclohexanone]]. This was originally produced by hydrogenation of [[phenol]], but in 1972 additional capacity was added, built to a DSM design in which hot liquid [[cyclohexane]] was partially oxidised by compressed air. The plant was intended to produce 70,000 tpa (tons per annum) of caprolactam but was reaching a rate of only 47,000 tpa in early 1974. Government controls on the price of caprolactam put further financial pressure on the plant.&lt;ref name=aria/&gt;

It was a failure of this plant that led to the disaster. A major leak of liquid from the reactor circuit caused the rapid formation of a large cloud of flammable hydrocarbon. When this met an [[combustion|ignition]] source (probably a furnace at a nearby [[hydrogen]] production plant{{efn-ua|the conclusion of the official Inquiry, but this has been queried, given the pattern of deposition of soot from the explosion&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;}}) there was a massive [[fuel-air explosive|fuel-air explosion]]. The plant [[control room]] collapsed, killing all 18 occupants. Nine other site workers were killed, and a delivery driver died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in his cab. Fires started on-site which were still burning ten days later. Around 1,000 buildings within a mile radius of the site (in Flixborough itself and in the neighbouring villages of [[Burton upon Stather]] and [[Amcotts]]) were damaged, as were nearly 800 in [[Scunthorpe]] (three miles away); the blast was heard over thirty miles away in [[Grimsby]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. Images of the [[list of industrial disasters|disaster]] were soon shown on television, filmed by [[BBC]] and [[Yorkshire Television]] [[stock footage|filmstock]] [[news crew]]s who had been covering the Appleby-Frodingham Gala in Scunthorpe that afternoon.

The plant was re-built but cyclohexanone was now produced by hydrogenation of phenol (Nypro proposed to produce the hydrogen from LPG;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=FLIXBOROUGH CHEMICAL PLANT (REBUILDING)|journal=Hansard HC Deb|date=27 November 1978|volume=959 cc179-90|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1978/nov/27/flixborough-chemical-plant-rebuilding#S5CV0959P0_19781127_HOC_421|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the absence of timely advice from the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) planning permission for storage of 1200 te LPG at Flixborough was initially granted subject to HSE approval, but HSE objected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=LIQUEFIED GAS STORAGE (CANVEY ISLAND)|journal=Hansard HC Deb|date=27 March 1979|volume=965 cc417-30|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1979/mar/27/liquefied-gas-storage-canvey-island#S5CV0965P0_19790327_HOC_373|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;); as a result of a subsequent collapse in the price of nylon it closed down a few years later. The site was demolished in 1981, although the administration block still remains. The site today is home to the Flixborough Industrial Estate, occupied by various businesses and [[Glanford Power Station]].

The foundations of properties severely damaged by the blast and subsequently demolished can be found on land between the estate and the village, on the route known as Stather Road. A memorial to those who died was erected in front of offices at the rebuilt site in 1977. Cast in [[bronze]], it showed [[mallard]]s alighting on water. When the plant was closed, the statue was moved to the pond at the parish church in Flixborough. During the early hours of [[New Year's Day]] 1984, the sculpture was stolen. It has never been recovered but the plinth it stood on, with a plaque listing all those who died that day, can still be found outside the church.

The cyclohexane oxidation process is still operated in much the same plant design in the Far East.&lt;ref name=Kletzlfa/&gt;

==The disaster==

===The plant===
In the DSM process, cyclohexane was heated to about 155&amp;nbsp;°C (311 °F) before passing into a series of six [[chemical reactor|reactors]]. The reactors were constructed from mild steel with a stainless steel lining; when operating they held in total about 145 tonnes of flammable liquid at a working pressure of 8.6&amp;nbsp;bar gauge (0.86 MPa gauge; 125 psig).{{efn|p 3}} In each of the reactors, compressed air was passed through the cyclohexane, causing a small percentage of the cyclohexane to oxidise and produce [[cyclohexanone]], some [[cyclohexanol]] also being produced. Each reactor was slightly (approximately 14 inches, 350&amp;nbsp;mm) lower than the previous one, so that the reaction mixture flowed from one to the next by gravity through nominal 28-inch bore (700mm DN) stub pipes with inset bellows.{{efn-ua |i.e. the fatal modification did not introduce the bellows (a point not always appreciated by popular retellings)}} The inlet to each reactor was [[baffle (heat transfer)|baffled]] so that liquid entered the reactors at a low level; the exiting liquid flowed over a weir whose crest was somewhat higher than the top of the outlet pipe.&lt;ref name="Venart2"/&gt; The mixture exiting reactor 6 was processed to remove reaction products, and the unreacted cyclohexane (only about 6% was reacted in each pass) then returned to the start of the reactor loop.

Although the operating pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled bleed valve once the plant had reached steady state, the valve could not be used during start-up, when there was no air feed, the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the bleed valve was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider than those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of vent valves). A pressure-relief valve acting at {{convert|11.|kg/cm2|bar psi|-0|abbr=on}} gauge was also fitted.

===Reactor 5 leaks and is bypassed===
Two months prior to the explosion, the number 5 reactor was discovered to be leaking. When [[thermal insulation|lagging]] was stripped from it, a crack extending about {{convert|6|ft}} was visible in the mild steel shell of the reactor. It was decided to install a temporary pipe to bypass the leaking reactor to allow continued operation of the plant while repairs were made. In the absence of 28-inch nominal bore pipe (700mm DN), 20-inch nominal bore pipe (500mm DN) was used to fabricate the bypass pipe for linking reactor 4 outlet to reactor 6 inlet. The new configuration was tested for leak-tightness at working pressure by pressurisation with nitrogen. For two months after fitting the bypass was operated continuously at temperature and pressure and gave no trouble. At the end of May (by which time the bypass had been lagged) the reactors had to be depressurised and allowed to cool in order to deal with leaks elsewhere. The leaks having been dealt with, early on 1 June attempts began to bring the plant back up to pressure and temperature.

===The explosion===
At about 16:53 on Saturday 1 June 1974, there was a massive release of hot cyclohexane in the area of the missing reactor 5, followed shortly by ignition of the resulting cloud of flammable vapour{{efn-ua|or of that part of it within [[flammability limit]]s Visualisations of the output of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics|CFD]] modelling of the release showing the upper and lower flammable limit envelopes can be found in&lt;ref name=Venart2/&gt; for both the inquiry's favoured failure scenario and Venart's}} and a massive explosion{{efn-ua |As of 2014 a TNT equivalence of 15 or 16 t with no error band seems to be a standard value on popularising websites but estimation of TNT equivalence is inherently inexact. The explosion was estimated to be equivalent to 15–45 t TNT at the Inquiry.{{efn |para 89 pp 13–14}} 16±2 t ''at 45 m above ground level'' was the best-fit estimate of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sudee|first1=C|last2=Samuels|first2=D E|last3=O'Brien|first3=T P|title=The characteristics of the explosion of cyclohexane at the Nypro (UK) Flixborough plant on 1st June 1974|journal=Journal of Occupational Accidents|date=1976–77|pages=203–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the gist of their paper is given in the 2nd Report of the Advisory Committee on Major Hazards.&lt;ref name=acmh2/&gt; TNT equivalence is now thought less useful than more modern approaches to characterisation of vapour cloud explosions and there are no '''directly comparable''' estimates of TNT equivalence for the Buncefield event.

For any given distance where the comparison can be made, Flixborough gives a higher estimated over-pressure than Buncefield, and (other things being equal – overpressure estimation techniques might have changed so much in 30 years that the comparison is meaningless) is therefore presumably to be judged the larger explosion.}} in the plant. It virtually demolished the site. Since the accident took place at a weekend there were relatively few people on site: of those on-site at the time, 28 were killed and 36 injured. Fires continued on-site for more than ten days. Off-site there were no fatalities, but 50 injuries were reported and about 2,000 properties damaged.{{efn |para 1 p 1}}

The occupants of the works laboratory had seen the release and evacuated the building before the release ignited; most survived. None of the 18 occupants of the plant control room survived, nor did any records of plant readings. The explosion appeared to have been in the general area of the reactors and after the accident only two possible sites for leaks before the explosion were identified: "the 20 inch bypass assembly with the bellows at both ends torn asunder was found jack-knifed on the plinth beneath" and there was a 50-inch long split in nearby 8-inch nominal bore stainless steel pipework".{{efn|p 14}}

==Court of Inquiry==
Immediately after the accident, ''[[New Scientist]]'' commented presciently on the normal official response to such events, but hoped that the opportunity would be taken to introduce effective government regulation of hazardous process plants.
{{Quote|Disasters on the scale of last Saturday's tragic explosion ... at Flixborough tend to provoke a brief wave of statements that such things must never happen again. With the passage of time these sentiments are diluted into bland reports about human error and everything being well under control – as happened with the [[Summerland fire]]. In the Flixborough case, there is a real chance that the death toll could trigger meaningful changes in a neglected aspect of industrial safety.&lt;ref name=Tinker/&gt;}}

The Secretary of State for Employment set up a Court of Inquiry to establish the causes and circumstances of the disaster and identify any immediate lessons to be learned, and also an expert committee to identify major hazard sites and advise on appropriate measures of control for them. The Inquiry sat for 70 days in the period September 1974 – February 1975, and took evidence from over 170 witnesses.{{efn |Appendix III p 50}}  In parallel, an Advisory Committee on Major Hazards was set up to look at the longer term issues associated with hazardous process plant.

===Circumstances of the disaster===
The report of the court of inquiry was critical of the installation of the bypass pipework on a number of counts: although plant and senior management were [[chartered engineer]]s (mostly chemical engineers) the post of Works Engineer which had been occupied by a chartered mechanical engineer had been vacant since January 1974 and at the time of the accident there were no professionally qualified engineers in the works engineering department. Nypro had recognised this to be a weakness and identified a senior mechanical engineer in an NCB subsidiary as available to provide advice and support if requested.{{efn|p 4}}  At a meeting of plant and engineering managers to discuss the failure of Reactor 5, the external mechanical engineer was not present. The emphasis was upon prompt restart and – the inquiry felt – although this did not lead to the deliberate acceptance of hazards, it led to the adoption of a course of action whose hazards (and indeed engineering practicalities) were not adequately considered or understood. The major problem was thought to be getting reactor 5 moved out of the way. Only the plant engineer was concerned about restarting before the reason for the failure was understood, and the other reactors inspected.{{efn |paras 54–59 pp7–8}}{{efn-ua|A leak had developed on the air feed to the reactor, and a water spray had been put on it as a prudent precaution against hot cyclohexane reaching the leak site. The water spray had been nitrate dosed and after the crack was discovered DSM advised that nitrates were known to promote [[stress corrosion cracking]] of mild steel. There had been no similar air leaks (and consequently no similar water sprays) on the other reactors.}} The difference in elevation between reactor 4 outlet and reactor 6 inlet was not recognised at the meeting. At a working level the offset was accommodated by a dog-leg in the bypass assembly; a section sloping downwards inserted between (and joined with by mitre welds) two horizontal lengths of 20-inch pipe abutting the existing 28-inch stubs. This bypass was supported by scaffolding fitted with supports provided to prevent the bellows having to take the weight of the pipework between them, but with no provision against other loadings.{{efn-ua|and the pipework lifted about 6 mm at plant operating temperature because of thermal expansion of the reactors}} The Inquiry noted on the "design" of the assembly:
{{Quote|No-one appreciated that the pressurised assembly would be subject to a turning moment imposing shear forces on the bellows for which they are not designed. Nor did anyone appreciate that the hydraulic thrust on the bellows (some 38 tonnes at working pressure) would tend to make the pipe buckle at the mitre joints. No calculations were done to ascertain whether the bellows or pipe would withstand these strains; no reference was made to the relevant British Standard, or any other accepted standard; no reference was made to the designer's guide issued by the manufacturers of the bellows; no drawing of the pipe was made, other than in chalk on the workshop floor; no pressure testing either of the pipe or the complete assembly was made before it was fitted.{{efn |p 9}}}}

The Inquiry noted further that "there was no overall control or planning of the design, construction, testing or fitting of the assembly nor was any check made that the operations had been properly carried out". After the assembly was fitted, the plant was tested for leak-tightness by pressurising with nitrogen to 9&amp;nbsp;kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; i.e. roughly operating pressure, but below the pressure at which the system relief valve would lift and below the 30% above design pressure called for by the relevant British Standard.{{efn |p 10 BS 3351}}

===Cause of the disaster===
The 20-inch bypass was therefore clearly not what would have been produced or accepted by a more considered process but controversy developed (and became acrimonious) as to whether its failure was the initiating fault in the disaster (the 20-inch hypothesis, argued by the plant designers (DSM) and the plant constructors; and favoured by the court's technical advisers&lt;ref name=Kinnersley/&gt;), or had been triggered by an external explosion resulting from a previous failure of the 8-inch line (argued by experts retained by Nypro and their insurers&lt;ref name=Kinnersley/&gt;).

====The 20-inch hypothesis====
Tests on replica bypass assemblies showed that bellows squirm could occur at pressures below the safety valve setting, but that squirm did not lead to a leak (either from damage to the bellows or from damage to the pipe at the mitre welds) until well above the safety valve setting. However theoretical modelling suggested that the expansion of the bellows as a result of squirm would lead to a significant amount of work being done on them by the reactor contents, and there would be considerable shock loading on the bellows when they reached the end of their travel. If the bellows were 'stiff' (resistant to squirm), the shock loading could cause the bellows to tear at pressures below the safety valve setting; it was not impossible that this could occur at pressures experienced during start-up, when pressure was less tightly controlled. (Plant pressures at the time of the accident were unknown since all relevant instruments and records had been destroyed, and all relevant operators killed).{{efn |pp18-19}}
The Inquiry concluded that this ("the 20-inch hypothesis") was 'a probability' but one 'which would readily be displaced if some greater probability' could be found.{{efn |p18}}

====The 8-inch hypothesis====
Detailed analysis suggested that the 8-inch pipe had failed due to [[creep cavitation]] at a high temperature while the pipe was under pressure. Failure had been accelerated by contact with molten zinc and there were indications that an elbow in the pipe had been at significantly higher temperature than the rest of the pipe.{{efn |Appendix II pp 46–49}} The hot elbow led to a non-return valve held between two pipe flanges by twelve bolts. After the disaster, two of the twelve bolts were found to be loose; the inquiry concluded that they were probably loose before the disaster. Nypro argued that the bolts had been loose, there had consequently been a slow leak of process fluid onto lagging leading eventually to a lagging fire, which had worsened the leak to the point where a flame had played undetected upon the elbow, burnt away its lagging and exposed the line to molten zinc, the line then failing with a bulk release of process fluid which extinguished the original fire, but subsequently ignited giving a small explosion which had caused failure of the bypass, a second larger release and a larger explosion. Tests failed to produce a lagging fire with leaked process fluid at process temperatures; one advocate of the 8-inch hypothesis then argued instead that there had been a gasket failure giving a leak with sufficient velocity to induce static charges whose discharge had then ignited the leak.{{efn-ua|All gasket materials in the area had been destroyed by the fire, so there was no direct evidence for or against a preceding gasket fault; the plant was known to have suffered leaks elsewhere because the wrong type of gasket had been fitted.&lt;ref name=Kinnersley&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kinnersley|first1=Patrick|title=What really happened at Flixborough?|journal=New Scientist|date=27 February 1975|volume=65|issue=938|pages=520–522|accessdate=7 July 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_S6C-s8oPC0C|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====The inquiry conclusion====
The 8-inch hypothesis was claimed to be supported by eyewitness accounts and by the apparently anomalous position of some debris post-disaster. The inquiry report took the view that explosions frequently throw debris in unexpected directions and eyewitnesses often have confused recollections. The inquiry identified difficulties at various stages of the accident development in the 8-inch hypothesis, their cumulative effect being considered to be such that the report concluded that overall the 20-inch hypothesis involving 'a single event of low probability' was more credible than the 8-inch hypothesis depending upon 'a succession of events, most of which are improbable'.{{efn |p 32}}

===Lessons to be learned===
The inquiry report identified 'lessons to be learned' which it presented under various headings; 'General observation' (relating to cultural issues underlying the disaster), 'specific lessons' (directly relevant to the disaster, but of general applicability) are reported below; there were also 'general' and 'miscellaneous lessons' of less relevance to the disaster. The report also commented on matters to be covered by the Advisory Committee on Major Hazards.

====General observation====
*Plant – where possible – should be designed so that failure does not lead to disaster on a timescale too short to permit corrective action.
*Plant should be designed and run to minimise the rate at which critical management decisions arise (particularly those in which production and safety conflict).
*Feedback within the management structure should ensure that top management understand the responsibilities of individuals and can ensure that their workload, capacity and competence allow them to effectively deal with those responsibilities

====Specific lessons====
The disaster was caused by 'a well designed and constructed plant' undergoing a modification that destroyed its technical integrity.
*Modifications should be designed, constructed, tested and maintained to the same standards as the original plant

When the bypass was installed, there was no works engineer in post and company senior personnel (all chemical engineers) were incapable of recognising the existence of a simple engineering problem, let alone solving it
*When an important post is vacant, special care should be taken when decisions have to be taken which would normally be taken by or on the advice of the holder of the vacant post
*All engineers should learn at least the elements of other branches of engineering than their own{{efn-ua |More a long-term solution than an ''immediate lesson'', but a long-held belief of the inquiry's vice-chairman [[Joseph Pope (academic)|Joseph Pope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://exchange.nottingham.ac.uk/blog/sir-joseph-pope-engineering-pioneer/| title=Sir Joseph Pope, Engineering Pioneer| publisher=University of Nottingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Matters to be referred to the Advisory Committee====
No one concerned in the design or construction of the plant envisaged the possibility of a major disaster happening instantaneously.{{efn-ua|ICI Petrochemicals Safety Newsletter 60 (January 1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=60/6 Explosion of Clouds of Gas or Vapour in the Open Air|journal=ICI Petrochemicals Division Safety Newsletter|date=January 1974|issue=60|url=http://psc.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/ICI_SAFETY_NEWSLETTER_No_60.swf|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarised a published 1973 conference paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strehlow|first1=R A|title=Unconfined vapour cloud explosions – an overview|journal=Symposium (International) on Combustion|date=1973|issue=14|pages=1189–1200|doi=10.1016/S0082-0784(73)80107-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: Unconfined vapour cloud explosions had been experienced since the 1930s; by the early 1970s there had been about 100 known incidents, with about 5 more every year. Significant overpressures could be developed where the release was large, and ignition delayed: at Pernis in 1968 pipebridges had been blown down}} It was now apparent that such a possibility exists where large amounts of potentially explosive material are processed or stored. It was 'of the greatest importance that plants at which there is a risk of instant as opposed to escalating disaster be identified. Once identified measures should be taken both to prevent such a disaster so far as is possible and to minimise its consequences should it occur despite all precautions.'{{efn |para 219 p36}} There should be coordination between planning authorities and the [[Health and Safety Executive]], so that planning authorities could be advised on safety issues before granting planning permission; similarly the emergency services should have information to draw up a disaster plan.

===Conclusion===
The inquiry summarised its findings as follows:

{{Quote|We believe, however, that if the steps we recommend are carried out, the risk of any similar disaster, already remote, will be lessened. We use the phrase "already remote" advisedly for we wish to make it plain that we found nothing to suggest that the plant as originally designed and constructed created any unacceptable risk. The disaster was caused wholly by the coincidence of a number of unlikely errors in the design and installation of a modification. Such a combination of errors is very unlikely ever to be repeated. Our recommendations should ensure that no similar combination occurs again and that even if it should do so, the errors would be detected before any serious consequences ensued.{{efn |para 226, pp 37–38}}}}

==Response to Inquiry Report==

===Controversy as to immediate cause===
Nypro's advisers had put considerable effort into the 8-inch hypothesis, and the inquiry report put considerable effort into discounting it. The critique of the hypothesis spilled over into criticism of its advocates: 'the enthusiasm for the 8-inch hypothesis felt by its proponents has led them to overlook obvious defects which in other circumstances they would not have failed to realise'.{{efn |para 172 p 29}} Of one proponent the report noted gratuitously that his examination by the court 'was directed to ensuring that we had correctly appreciated the main steps in the hypothesis some of which appeared to us in conflict with facts which were beyond dispute'.{{efn |para 141 p 21}} The report thanked him for his work in assembling eyewitness evidence but said his use of it showed 'an approach to the evidence which is wholly unsound'.{{efn |para 113 p17}}

The proponent of the 8-inch gasket failure hypothesis responded by arguing that the 20-inch hypothesis had its share of defects which the inquiry report had chosen to overlook, that the 8-inch hypothesis had more in its favour than the report suggested, and that there were important lessons that the inquiry had failed to identify:

{{Quote|[T]he Court's commitment for the 20-inch hypothesis led them to present their conclusions in a way that does not help the reader to assess contrary evidence. The Court could still be right that a single unsatisfactory modification caused the disaster but this is no reason for complacency. There are many other lessons. It is to be hoped that the respect normally accorded to the findings of a Court of Inquiry will not inhibit chemical engineers in looking beyond the report in their endeavours to improve the already good safety record of the chemical industry.&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox|first1=J I|title=Flixborough – Some Additional Lessons|journal=The Chemical Engineer|date=May 1976|issue=309|pages=353–8|url=http://business.virgin.net/olwen.cox/pubs/Flixborough.htm|accessdate=26 June 2014}} (updated version of original article)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Flixborough inquiry findings have not been accorded the normal respect; one critic of them was able to note after a flurry of articles on the 25th anniversary:

{{Quote|In view of the Court of Inquiry's qualified conclusion, the cause of the accident has been the subject of considerable controversy, especially as to the actual failure process (e.g., Ball, 1975, 1976; Butler, 1975; Cox, 1976; Gugan, 1976; King, 1977; Warner, 1975; Warner and Newland, 1975); the amount of cyclohexane released, and whether the unconfined vapor cloud formed in the release detonated (e.g., Gugan, 1978, 1980; Ale and Bruning, 1980a, b; Fu and Eyre, 1980; Phillips, 1981). The debate and argument continue to this day (e.g.,Gugan, 2000; Hoiset et al., 2000; King, 2000; Kletz, 2000; Swan, 2000).&lt;ref name=Venart2/&gt;}}

The HSE website currently (2014) says "During the late afternoon on 1 June 1974 a 20 inch bypass system ruptured, which may have been caused by a fire on a nearby 8-inch pipe".&lt;ref name=srag&gt;{{cite web |title=Flixborough (Nypro UK) Explosion 1st June 1974: Accident Summary|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/sragtech/caseflixboroug74.htm|publisher=Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a strong consensus for either hypothesis other possible immediate causes have been suggested.{{efn-ua|Press reporting of both has included the suggestion that the new hypothesis clears the dead operators of the slur of having caused the accident; in fact none of the competing theories makes that claim – unless it is felt that the inquiry report's explicit refusal to blame 'pilot error' by the dead is really an implicit invitation to others to do so}}

====Post-enquiry forensic engineering – two-stage rupture of bypass====
The enquiry noted the existence of a small tear in a bellows fragment, and therefore considered the possibility of a small leak from the bypass having led to an explosion bringing the bypass down. It noted this to be not inconsistent with eyewitness evidence, but ruled out the scenario because pressure tests showed the bellows did not develop tears until well above the safety valve pressure.{{efn|p15}} This hypothesis has however been revived, with the tears being caused by fatigue failure at the top of the reactor 4 outlet bellows because of flow-induced vibration of the unsupported bypass line. Finite element analysis has been carried out (and suitable eyewitness evidence adduced) to support this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Venart2&gt;{{cite web |last1=Venart|first1=J E S|title=Flixborough The Disaster and Its Aftermath|url=http://aevnmont.free.fr/SACH-BOOKS/Petrochemistry/Handbook%20of%20Hazardous%20Materials%20Spills%20Technology/Part%20IX.%20Case%20Histories/42.%20Flixborough-%20The%20Disaster%20and%20Its%20Aftermath.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Venart1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venart|first1=J E S|title=Flixborough: A final footnote|journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries|volume=20|issue=4|pages=621–643|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950423007000800|accessdate=25 June 2014|doi=10.1016/j.jlp.2007.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-enquiry forensic engineering – the 'water hypothesis'====
The reactors were normally mechanically stirred but reactor 4 had operated without a working stirrer since November 1973; free phase water could have settled out in unstirred reactor 4 and the bottom of reactor 4 would reach operating temperature more slowly than the stirred reactors. It was postulated that there had been bulk water in reactor 4 and a disruptive boiling event had occurred when the interface between it and the reaction mixture reached operating temperature. Abnormal pressures and liquor displacement resulting from this (it was argued) could have triggered failure of the 20-inch bypass.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King|first1=Ralph|title=Flixborough 25 years on|journal=Process Engineering|date=15 Jan 2000|url=http://processengineering.theengineer.co.uk/flixborough-25-years-on/273087.article}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Although this is not commented upon in the reference, the basic physics would suggest that interfacial boiling could be triggered not only by increasing temperature with pressure steady but also by -with temperature steady – reducing pressure e.g. by manual venting}}{{efn-ua |Experimental work carried out for HSE in 2000 confirmed that the vapour pressure of cyclohexane at 155&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C is well below plant operating pressure; likewise that of water, but the vapour pressure of immiscible liquids is nearly additive and at operating temperature the sum of vapour pressures would exceed operating pressure – the work was not on a large enough scale to resolve whether disruptive boiling by this mechanism would have created forces large enough to fail the bypass&lt;ref name=Snee&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snee|first1=T J|title=Interaction Between Water and Hot Cyclohexane in Closed Vessels|journal=Process Safety and Environmental Protection|volume=79|issue=2|pages=81–88|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582001709366|accessdate=25 June 2014|doi=10.1205/09575820151095166}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

===Dissatisfaction with other aspects of the Inquiry Report===
The plant design had assumed that the worst consequence of a major leak would be a plant fire and to protect against this a fire detection system had been installed. Tests by the Fire Research Establishment had shown this to be less effective than intended.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; Moreover, fire detection only worked if the leak ignited at the leak site; it gave no protection against a major leak with delayed ignition, and the disaster had shown this could lead to multiple worker fatalities. The plant ''as designed'' therefore could be destroyed by a single failure and had a much greater risk of killing workers than the designers had intended. Critics of the inquiry report therefore found it hard to accept its characterisation of the plant as 'well-designed'.{{efn-ua |In addition, King&lt;ref name=King/&gt; takes the crack on reactor 5 to indicate ''mechanical design'' problems: he notes that post-inquiry work on behalf of HSE showed that nitrate stress corrosion cracking only occurs in mild steel in areas subject to abnormal stress; the failure of reactor 5 therefore required not only the presence of nitrate in the cooling water, but some inadequacy in the reactor design leading to high local stress. (The crack skirted a 28" branch,{{efn|Plate 7}} and King is reported elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Mannan|editor1-first=Sam|title=Lees' Loss Prevention in the Process Industry (3rd edition)|date=2005|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=9780750675550|pages=2/1–2/17 (''Appendix 2: Flixborough'')}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have claimed an HSE source had told him that the reactors had been designed against a 9 t thrust upon these branches, not the 38t thrust the inquiry noted the bypass 'design' to have ignored)}} The HSE (through the Department of Employment) had come up with a 'shopping list' of about 30 recommendations on plant design,&lt;ref name=Kinnersley/&gt; many of which had not been adopted (and a few explicitly rejected{{efn|para 203 p 33}}) by the Inquiry Report; the HSE inspector who acted as secretary to the inquiry spoke afterwards of making sure that the real lessons were acted upon.&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt; More fundamentally, [[Trevor Kletz]] saw the plant as symptomatic of a general failure to consider safety early enough in process plant design, so that designs were [[inherent safety|inherently safe]] – instead processes and plant were selected on other grounds then safety systems bolted on to a design with avoidable hazards and unnecessarily high inventory. 'We keep a lion and build a strong cage to keep it in. But before we do so we should ask if a lamb might do.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kletz|first1=Trevor|title=Supplement to Safety Newsletter 75|journal=Imperial Chemical Industries Limited Petrochemicals Division Safety Newsletter|date=April 1975|issue=75|url=http://psc.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/ICI_SAFETY_NEWSLETTER_No_75.swf|accessdate=27 June 2014}} – the same thought but with the lower-risk animal a cat had appeared immediately post-Flixborough in Safety Newsletter No 67 (July 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

If the UK public were largely reassured to be told the accident was a one-off and should never happen again, some UK process safety practitioners were less sanguine. Critics felt that the Flixborough explosion was not the result of multiple basic engineering design errors unlikely to coincide again; the errors were rather multiple instances of one underlying cause: a complete breakdown of plant safety procedures (exacerbated by a lack of relevant engineering expertise, but that lack was also a procedural shortcoming).&lt;ref name= Booth&gt;{{cite web |last1=Booth|first1=Richard|title=Safety: too important a matter to be left to the engineers?

==ICI Petrochemicals: 'A new world where new methods are needed'==
The Petrochemicals Division of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) operated many plants with large inventories of flammable chemicals at its [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]] site (including one in which cyclohexane was oxidised to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol). Historically good process safety performance at Wilton had been marred in the late 1960s by a spate of fatal fires caused by faulty isolations/handovers for maintenance work.&lt;ref name=Kletzbiog/&gt; Their immediate cause was [[human error]] but ICI felt that saying that most accidents were caused by human error was no more useful than saying that most falls are caused by gravity.&lt;ref name=Kletzlfa/&gt; ICI had not simply reminded operators to be more careful, but issued explicit instructions on the required quality of isolations, and the required quality of its documentation.&lt;ref name=Kletzbiog&gt;Kletz, T., (2000) ''By Accident – a life preventing them in industry'' PVF Publications {{ISBN|0-9538440-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more onerous requirements were justified as follows:

{{Quote|Why do we need the HOC{{efn-ua |(ICI) Heavy Organic Chemicals (Division); the predecessor of ICI Petrochemicals Division}} rules on the isolation and identification of equipment for maintenance? They were introduced about 2 years ago, but [[Billingham Manufacturing Plant|Billingham]] managed for 45 years without them. During those 45 years there were no doubt many occasions when fitters broke into equipment and found it had not been isolated, or broke into the wrong line because it had not been identified positively. But pipe-lines were mostly small, and the amount of flammable gas or liquid on the plant was not usually large. Now pipe-lines are much larger and the amount of gas or liquid that can leak out is much greater. Several serious incidents in the last 3 years have shown that we dare not risk breaking into lines that are not properly isolated. As plants have got larger we have moved ... into a new world where new methods are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=14/8 Why Do We Need New Rules For Preparing For Maintenance|journal=ICI Petrochemicals Division Safety Newsletter|date=November 1969|volume=14|url=http://psc.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/ICI_SAFETY_NEWSLETTER_No_1-50.swf|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The change in scale was real and much larger than anything experienced since (in 1956 a typical ethylene plant might have a capacity of 30, 000 tpa; in 1974 ICI and BP planned an ethylene plant with a capacity of 500, 000 tpa;&lt;ref name=Tinker&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tinker|first1=Jon|title=Comment: Flixborough and the Future|journal=New Scientist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HH2rKM_GWVEC&amp;pg=PA643|date=6 June 1974|volume=62|issue=901|page=590|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2014 an 830,000 tpa unit is still one of the largest in Europe&lt;ref name=Mossmorran&gt;{{cite web |title=Your guide to the Fife Ethylene Plant|url=http://www.exxonmobil.co.uk/UK-English/files/FEP_brochure.pdf|publisher=Esso UK Limited|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but it subsequently transpired that Billingham had had similar rules, but they had fallen into disuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kletz|first1=Trevor|title=15/7 COMMENTS FROM READERS|journal=ICI Petrochemicals Division Safety Newsletter|issue=15|url=http://psc.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/ICI_SAFETY_NEWSLETTER_No_1-50.swf|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

In accordance with this view, post-Flixborough (and without waiting for the Inquiry Report), ICI Petrochemicals instituted a review of how it controlled modifications. It found that major projects requiring financial sanction at a high level were generally well-controlled, but for more (financially) minor modifications there was less control and this had resulted in a past history of 'near-misses' and small-scale accidents,&lt;ref name=Kletz83&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kletz|first1=Trevor|title=Must Plant Modifications Lead to Accidents?|journal=Imperial Chemical Industries Limited Petrochemicals Division Safety Newsletter|date=January 1976|issue=83|url=http://psc.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/ICI_SAFETY_NEWSLETTER_No_83.swf|accessdate=1 July 2014}}– reprinted, with slight modifications in Chemical Engineering Progress, Vol 2, No 11, November 1976, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; few of which could be blamed on chemical engineers.{{efn-ua |e.g. for one pipe work mod "the plant engineer had not considered it necessary to consult the piping experts, as the pipe was straight, without any bends... As at Flixborough there was a failure to recognise the circumstances in which expert advice should have been sought" – the problem being spotted pre-use by the traditional informal safeguard of a senior engineer walking the plant to have a look at what his subordinates were doing&lt;ref name=Kletz83/&gt;}} To remedy this, not only were employees reminded of the principal points to consider when making a modification (both on the quality/compliance of the modification itself and on the effect of the modification on the rest of the plant), but new procedures and documentation were introduced to ensure adequate scrutiny. These requirements applied not only to changes to equipment, but also to process changes. All modifications were to be supported by a formal safety assessment. For major modifications this would include an [[Hazard and operability study|'operability study']]; for minor modifications a checklist-based safety assessment was to be used, indicating what aspects would be affected, and for each aspect giving a statement of the expected effect. The modification and its supporting safety assessment then had to be approved in writing by the plant manager and engineer. Where instruments or electrical equipment were involved signatures would also be needed from the relative specialist (instrument manager or electrical engineer). A Pipework Code of Practice was introduced specifying standards of design construction and maintenance for pipework – all pipework over 3"nb (DN 75&amp;nbsp;mm) handling hazardous material would have to be designed by pipework specialists in the design office.&lt;ref name=Kletz83/&gt;
The approach was publicised outside ICI; while the Pipework Code of Practice on its own would have combatted the specific fault(s) that led to the Flixborough disaster, the adoption more generally of tighter controls on modifications (and the method by which this was done) were soon recognised to be prudent good practice.{{efn-ua |but not necessarily '''best''' practice: some adopters of the approach have felt -or been made to feel- a danger of a group mindset where no off-plant personnel are involved (and the safety culture is not that of ICI) and therefore added a requirement for approval by a responsible person off-plant to ensure that the interests of production are not allowed to override those of safety}} In the United Kingdom, the ICI approach became a ''de facto'' standard for high-risk plant (partly because the new (1974) Health and Safety at Work Act went beyond specific requirements on employers to state general duties to keep risks to workers as low as reasonably practicable and to avoid risk to the public so far as reasonably practicable; under this new regime the presumption was that recognised good practice would inherently be 'reasonably practicable' and hence should be adopted, partly because key passages in reports of the Advisory Committee on Major Hazards were clearly supportive).

==Advisory Committee on Major Hazards==

===Dissatisfaction with existing regulatory regime===
The terms of reference of the Court of Inquiry did not include any requirement to comment on the regulatory regime under which the plant had been built and operated, but it was clear that it was not satisfactory. Construction of the plant had required [[planning permission]] approval by the local council; while "an interdepartmental procedure enabled planning authorities to call upon the advice of Her Majesty's Factory Inspectorate when considering applications for new developments which might involve a major hazard"&lt;ref name=hansardjune3&gt;{{cite web |last1=HC Deb 03 June 1974 vol 874 cc 867-77|title=Flixborough (Explosion)|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1974/jun/03/flixborough-explosion|website=Hansard|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (there was no requirement for them to do so), since the council had not recognised the hazardous nature of the plant&lt;ref name=Kinnersley/&gt; they had not called for advice. As the ''New Scientist'' commented within a week of the disaster:

{{Quote|There are now probably more than a dozen British petrochemical plants with a similar devastation-potential to the Nypro works at Flixborough. Neither when they were first built, nor now that they are in operation, has any local or government agency exercised effective control over their safety. To build a nuclear power plant, the electricity industry must provide a detailed safety evaluation to the Nuclear Inspectorate before it receives a licence. On the other hand, permission for highly hazardous process plants only involves satisfying a technically unqualified local planning committee, which lacks even the most rudimentary powers once the plant goes on stream. ... The Factory Inspectorate has standing only where it has promulgated specific regulations&lt;ref name=Tinker/&gt;}}

===Terms of Reference and personnel===
The ACMH's terms of reference were to identify types of (non-nuclear) installations posing a major hazard, and advise on appropriate controls on their establishment, siting, layout, design, operation, maintenance and development (including overall development in their vicinity). Unlike the Court of Inquiry, its personnel (and that of its associated working groups) had significant representation of safety professionals, drawn largely from the nuclear industry and ICI (or ex-ICI)

===Suggested regulatory framework===
In its first report&lt;ref name=acmh1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Health &amp; Safety Commission|title=Advisory Committee on Major Hazards FIRST REPORT|date=1976|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0 11 880884 2|url=http://consultations.hse.gov.uk/gf2.ti/f/4194/126405.1/pdf/-/acmh1.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (issued as a basis for consultation and comment in March 1976), the ACMH noted that hazard could not be quantified in the abstract, and that a precise definition of 'major hazard' was therefore impossible. Instead{{efn|para 29}} installations with an inventory of flammable fluids above a certain threshold or of toxic materials above a certain 'chlorine equivalent' threshold should be ' ''notifiable installations'' '. A company operating a notifiable installation should be required to survey its hazard potential, and inform HSE of the hazards identified and the procedures and methods adopted (or to be adopted) to deal with them.

HSE could then choose to – in some cases (generally involving high risk or novel technology) – require{{efn|para 31}} submission of a more elaborate assessment, covering (as appropriate) "design, manufacture, construction, commissioning, operation and maintenance, as well as subsequent modifications whether of the design or operational procedures or both". The company would have to show that "it possesses the appropriate management system, safety philosophy, and competent people, that it has effective methods of identifying and evaluating hazards, that it has designed and operates the installation in accordance with appropriate regulations, standards and codes of practice, that it has adequate procedures for dealing with emergencies, and that it makes use of independent checks where appropriate"

For most 'notifiable installations' no further explicit controls should be needed; HSE could advise and if need be enforce improvements under the general powers given it by the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act (HASAWA), but for a very few sites explicit licensing by HSE might be appropriate;{{efn|para 35}} responsibility for safety of the installation remaining however always and totally with the licensee.

===Ensuring safety of 'major hazard' installations===
HASAWA already required companies to have a safety policy, and a comprehensive plan to implement it. ACMH felt that for major hazard installations{{efn|paras 58-9}} the plan should be formal and include
*the regulation by company procedures of safety matters (such as: identification of hazards, control of maintenance (through clearance certificates, permits to work etc.), control of modifications which might affect plant integrity, emergency operating procedures, access control)
*clear safety roles (for e.g. the design and development team, production management, safety officers)
*training for safety, measures to foster awareness of safety, and feedback of information on safety matters

Safety documents were needed both for design and operation. The management of major hazard installations must show that it possessed and used a selection of appropriate hazard recognition techniques,{{efn-ua|this from para 61, where the examples given included 'operability studies'}} had a proper system for audit of critical safety features, and used independent assessment where appropriate.

The ACMH also called for tight discipline in the operation of major hazard plants:

{{Quote|The rarity of major disasters tends to breed complacency and even a contempt for written instructions. We believe that rules relevant to safety must be everyday working rules and be seen as an essential part of day-to-day work practice. Rules, designed to protect those who drew them up if something goes wrong, are readily ignored in day-to-day work. Where management lays down safety rules, it must also ensure that they are carried out. We believe that to this end considerable formality is essential in relation to such matters as permits to work and clearance certificates to enter vessels or plant areas. In order to keep strong control in the plant, the level of authority for authorisations must be clearly defined. Similarly the level of authority for technical approval for any plant modification must also be clearly defined. To avoid the danger of systems and procedures being disregarded, there should be a requirement for a periodic form of audit of them.{{efn|para 63}}}}

The ACMH's second report (1979) rejected criticisms that since accidents causing multiple fatalities were associated with extensive and expensive plant damage the operators of major hazard sites had every incentive to avoid such accidents and so it was excessive to require major hazard sites to demonstrate their safety to a government body in such detail:

{{Quote|We would not contest that the best run companies achieve high standards of safety, but we believe this is because they have .... achieved what is perhaps best described as technical discipline in all that they do.

We believe that the best practices must be followed by all companies and that we have reached a state of technological development where it is not sufficient in areas of high risk for employers merely to demonstrate to themselves that all is well. They should now be required to demonstrate to the community as a whole that their plants are properly designed, well constructed and safely operated.&lt;ref name=acmh2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Health &amp; Safety Commission|title=Advisory Committee on Major Hazards: Second Report|date=1979|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0 11 883299 9|url=https://archive.org/details/AdvisoryCommitteeOnMajorHazardsSecondReport1979|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The approach advocated by the ACMH was largely followed in subsequent UK legislation and regulatory action, but following the release of chlordioxins by a runaway chemical reaction at [[Seveso]] in northern Italy in July 1976, 'major hazard plants' became an EU-wide issue and the UK approach became subsumed in EU-wide initiatives (the [[Directive 82/501/EC|Seveso Directive]] in 1982, superseded by the [[Directive 96/82/EC|Seveso II Directive]] in 1996). A third and final report was issued when the ACMH was disbanded in 1983.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7874">'''Gyrokinetics''' is a theoretical framework to study plasma behavior on perpendicular spatial scales comparable to the [[gyroradius]] and frequencies much lower than the particle [[Cyclotron resonance|cyclotron frequencies]]. 
These particular scales have been experimentally shown to be appropriate for modeling plasma turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. McKee, C.C. Petty, et al. Non-dimensional scaling of turbulence characteristics and turbulent diffusivity. Nuclear Fusion, 41(9):1235, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The trajectory of charged particles in a magnetic field is a helix that winds around the field line. This trajectory can be decomposed into a relatively slow motion of the [[guiding center]] along the field line and a fast circular motion, called gyromotion. For most plasma behavior, this gyromotion is irrelevant. Averaging over this gyromotion reduces the equations to six dimensions (3 spatial, 2 velocity, and time) rather than the seven (3 spatial, 3 velocity, and time). Because of this simplification, gyrokinetics governs the evolution of charged rings with a guiding center position, instead of gyrating charged particles.

== Derivation of the gyrokinetic equation ==

Fundamentally, the gyrokinetic model assumes the plasma is strongly magnetized ( &lt;math&gt;\rho_{i} \ll L_{plasma}&lt;/math&gt; ), the perpendicular spatial scales are comparable to the gyroradius ( &lt;math&gt;k_{\perp} \rho_{i} \sim 1&lt;/math&gt; ), and the behavior of interest has low frequencies ( &lt;math&gt;\omega \ll \Omega_{i} \ll \Omega_{e}&lt;/math&gt; ). We must also expand the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]], &lt;math&gt;f_{s} = f_{s 0} + f_{s 1} + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, and assume the perturbation is small compared to the background (&lt;math&gt;f_{s 1} \ll f_{s 0}&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;G.G. Howes, S.C. Cowley, W. Dorland, G.W. Hammett, E. Quataert, and A.A. Schekochihin. Astrophysical gyrokinetics: Basic equations and linear theory. ApJ, 651(1):590, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The starting point is the [[Fokker–Planck equation]] and [[Maxwell's equations]]. The first step is to change spatial variables from the particle position &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; to the guiding center position &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we change velocity coordinates from &lt;math&gt;(v_{x},v_{y},v_{z})&lt;/math&gt; to the velocity parallel &lt;math&gt;v_{||} \equiv \vec{v} \cdot \hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic moment]] &lt;math&gt;\mu \equiv \frac{m_{s} v_{\perp}^{2}}{2 B}&lt;/math&gt;, and the gyrophase angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Here parallel and perpendicular are relative to &lt;math&gt;\vec{b} \equiv \vec{B}/B&lt;/math&gt;, the direction of the magnetic field, and &lt;math&gt;m_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the particle. Now, we can average over the gyrophase angle at constant guiding center position, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \ldots \right\rangle_{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;, yielding the gyrokinetic equation.

The electrostatic gyrokinetic equation, in the absence of large plasma flow, is given by&lt;ref&gt;I. G. Abel, G. G. Plunk, E. Wang, M. Barnes,
S. C. Cowley, W. Dorland, and A. A. Schekochihin. Multiscale Gyrokinetics for Rotating Tokamak Plasmas: Fluctuations, Transport and Energy Flows.  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.4782.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial h_{s}}{\partial t} + \left( v_{||} \hat{b} + \vec{V}_{d s} + \left\langle \vec{V}_{\phi} \right\rangle_{\varphi} \right) \cdot \vec{\nabla}_{\vec{R}} h_{s} - \sum_{s'} \left\langle C \left[ h_{s}, h_{s'} \right] \right\rangle_{\varphi} = \frac{Z_{s} e f_{s 0}}{T_{s}} \frac{\partial \left\langle \phi \right\rangle_{\varphi}}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial f_{s 0}}{\partial \psi} \left\langle \vec{V}_{\phi} \right\rangle_{\varphi} \cdot \vec{\nabla} \psi &lt;/math&gt;.

Here the first term represents the change in the perturbed distribution function, &lt;math&gt;h_{s} \equiv f_{s 1} + \frac{Z_{s} e \phi}{T_{s}} f_{s 0}&lt;/math&gt;, with time. The second term represents particle streaming along the magnetic field line. The third term contains the effects of cross-field particle drifts, including the [[curvature drift]], the [[grad-B drift]], and the lowest order [[Guiding center#Electric field|E-cross-B drift]]. The fourth term represents the nonlinear effect of the perturbed &lt;math&gt;\vec{E} \times \vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; drift interacting with the distribution function perturbation. The fifth term uses a collision operator to include the effects of collisions between particles. The sixth term represents the Maxwell–Boltzmann response to the perturbed electric potential. The last term includes temperature and density gradients of the background distribution function, which drive the perturbation. These gradients are only significant in the direction across flux surfaces, parameterized by &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic flux]].

The gyrokinetic equation, together with gyro-averaged Maxwell's equations, give the distribution function and the perturbed electric and magnetic fields. In the electrostatic case we only require [[Gauss's law]] (which takes the form of the quasineutrality condition), given by&lt;ref&gt;F.I. Parra, M. Barnes, and A.G. Peeters. Up-down symmetry of the turbulent transport of toroidal angular momentum in tokamaks. Phys. Plasmas, 18(6):062501, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{s} Z_{s} e B \int d v_{||} d\mu d\varphi h_{s} \left(\vec{R}\right) = \sum_{s} \frac{Z_{s}^{2} e^{2} n_{s} \phi}{T_{s}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Usually solutions are found numerically with the help of [[supercomputers]], but in simplified situations analytic solutions are possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1223">The '''Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Association''' (HELMEPA), established in 1982, is Europe’s first private sector voluntary [[marine environment]] protection association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helmepa.gr/index2.php&lt;/ref&gt;

HELMEPA's aims are to eliminate ship-generated [[marine pollution]] and enhance safety at sea.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helmepa.gr/index2.php&lt;/ref&gt;
The Association trains seafarers and executives so that they are aware of safety and the protection of the marine environment,"  . HELMEPA has also launched several  environmental projects and public awareness campaigns such as the environmental education of schoolchildren through HELMEPA Junior. 

HELMEPA supports governments in ratifying and implementing international conventions on the protection of the marine environment. 

Politicians and notable business men like [[Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou]] actively support HELMEPA.

== History ==
The art of crafting is a 400 year old tradition. The [[artisans]] who make the toys are referred as ''Aryakhastriyas'' (also known as Nakarshalu), who have their mention in the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]''.&lt;ref name=art_status /&gt; They are said to have migrated from [[Rajasthan]] in the 16th century to Kondappali and claims their origin to Muktharishi, a sage endowed with skills in arts and crafts by [[Lord Shiva]].&lt;ref name=toys /&gt;
[[File:Wood craft models on display at Shilparamam in Hyderabad.jpg|thumb|Wood craft models on display at Shilparamam in Hyderabad]]

== Toy crafting ==

The Kondapalli toys are made from [[soft wood]] known as ''Tella Poniki'' which are found in nearby Kondapalli Hills. The wood is first carved out and then the edges are smooth finished. The later step involves coloring with either oil and [[water-colour]]s or [[Vegetable dye|vegetable dyes]] and [[Enamel paint|enamel paints]] are applied based on the type of the toys.&lt;ref name=toys /&gt;&lt;ref name=preservation&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chandaraju|first1=Aruna|title=Playing safe with local craft|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/64394/playing-safe-local-craft.html|accessdate=27 January 2016|work=Deccan Herald|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[artisans]] mainly work on producing figures of mythology, animals, birds, bullock carts, rural life etc., and the most notable one is ''[[Dasavataram]]'', [[Dancing Dolls|dancing dolls]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banu|first1=Saira|title=Treasure in traditional toys|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/treasure-in-traditional-toys/article15906.ece|accessdate=27 January 2016|work=The Hindu|date=6 September 2009|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==
The art form which has got patronage from the rulers in ancient times is in decline due to lack of profits, time taking to produce toys, influence of western art and younger generations not encouraged towards this art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devalla|first1=Rani|title=Kalamkari saris in a new combination|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/kalamkari-saris-in-a-new-combination/article8143354.ece|accessdate=27 January 2016|work=The Hindu|date=23 January 2016|location=Visakhapatnam|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tales that Kondapalli toys narrate|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/content/379894/tales-kondapalli-toys-narrate.html|date=11 January 2014|first=Swaati|last=Chaudhury|accessdate=2 August 2018|newspaper=Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lepakshi]] and ''Lanco Institute of General Humanitarian Trust'' took initiative to keep alive the art of crafting toys.&lt;ref name=preservation /&gt;

'''''Lenin''''' ({{lang-ru|Ленин}}) is a Soviet [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]. Launched in 1957, it was both the world's first [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] surface ship&lt;ref name=soviet-life-feb-69 /&gt; and the first [[List of civilian nuclear ships|nuclear-powered civilian vessel]]. ''Lenin'' entered operation in 1959 and worked clearing sea routes for cargo ships along Russia's northern coast. From 1960 to 1965 the ship covered over 85,000 miles during the Arctic navigation season, of which almost 65,000 were through ice.&lt;ref name=soviet-life-feb-69 /&gt; On April 10, 1974 the vessel was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. She was officially decommissioned in 1989.&lt;ref name=sowlenin /&gt; She was subsequently converted to a museum ship and is now permanently based at [[Murmansk]].

==Propulsion==
When launched in 1957, ''Lenin'' was powered by three [[OK-150 reactor|OK-150]] reactors. In its late-1960s configuration, at full capacity the ship used five to six pounds of [[uranium-235]] per 100 days.&lt;ref name=soviet-life-feb-69 /&gt;

In the configuration employed from 1970, two [[OK-900 reactor|OK-900]] reactors provided steam for four steam turbines, that were in turn connected to generators, which powered three sets of [[electric motor]]s to drive the ship's three propellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| last1=Reistad| first1=Ole| last2=Ølgaard| first2=Povl L| date=April 2006| title=Russian Nuclear Power Plants for Marine Applications| url=http://www.nks.org/download/pdf/NKS-Pub/NKS-138.pdf| publisher=Nordic Nuclear Safety Research (nks.org)| ISBN=87-7893-200-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear accidents==
In February 1965, there was a [[loss-of-coolant accident]]. After being shut down for refueling, the coolant was removed from the number two reactor before the [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] had been removed. As a result, some of the fuel elements melted and deformed inside the reactor. This was discovered when the spent elements were being unloaded for storage and disposal. 124 fuel assemblies (about 60% of the total) were stuck in the reactor core. It was decided to remove the fuel, control grid, and [[control rod]]s as a unit for disposal; they were placed in a special cask, solidified, stored for two years, and dumped in [[Tsivolki Bay]] (near the [[Novaya Zemlya]] archipelago) in 1967.

The second accident was a cooling system leak which occurred in 1967, shortly after refueling. Finding the leak required breaking through the concrete and metal biological shield with [[sledgehammer]]s. Once the leak was found, it became apparent that the sledgehammer damage could not be repaired; subsequently, all three reactors were removed by blowing them off the ship with shaped charges above a burial site off Novaya Zemlya,&lt;ref&gt;[https://helion-ltd.ru/unloading-nuclear-installation/ Выгрузка атомной установки ОК – 150 с ледокола «Ленин»]. {{retrieved|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by two OK-900 reactors. This was completed in early 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Nuclear icebreaker ''Lenin'' |url=http://www.bellona.org/english_import_area/international/russia/civilian_nuclear_vessels/icebreakers/30131 |work=Russian nuclear icebreaker fleet |publisher=www.bellona.org |accessdate=2013-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015031630/http://www.bellona.org/english_import_area/international/russia/civilian_nuclear_vessels/icebreakers/30131 |archivedate=2007-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
''Lenin'' was decommissioned in 1989, because its hull had worn thin from ice friction. She was laid up at [[Atomflot]], a base for nuclear icebreakers in [[Murmansk]], and according to [[Pravda|Pravda.ru]], repair and conversion into a [[museum ship]] was completed in 2005.

'''Liberation cutting''' has similar goals to [[Cleaning (forestry)|cleaning]], namely the allocation of resources to the most promising trees available on a site. What separates liberation cutting from cleaning is that the overtopping competitors are of a distinctly older age class.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.M., B.C. Larson, M.J. Kelty, P.M.S. Ashton (1997). ''The Practice of Silviculture: Applied Forest Ecology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Need for liberation cutting often occurs when seedlings of a desired species have been regenerated by a logging operation, but that operation has left older, poor quality or undesired trees that are shading the regeneration and limiting its growth.

Liberation cutting may be superficially similar to an [[Shelterwood cutting|overstory removal]] cutting. The major difference between these is that in the overstory removal, regeneration was deliberate and the best trees were saved for the final harvest. In the liberation cutting, the worst trees remain and regeneration was likely an afterthought to a logging operation.

Harvesting the undesired trees is not a requirement in liberation operations; the poor quality trees may be killed in place and left as [[snags]], or felled and left to contribute [[coarse woody debris]].

The '''Pegasus Toroidal Experiment''' is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] confinement experiment relevant to [[fusion power]] production, run by the Department of Engineering Physics of the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. It is a [[spherical tokamak]], a very low-aspect-ratio version of the [[tokamak]] configuration, i.e. the minor radius of the torus is comparable to the major radius.

'''Penta-graphene''' is a [[carbon allotrope]] composed entirely of carbon pentagons and resembling the [[Cairo pentagonal tiling]].&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt; Penta-graphene was proposed in 2014 on the basis of analyses and simulations.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt; Further calculations showed that it is unstable in its pure form,&lt;ref name="pnas2"/&gt; but can be stabilized by hydrogenation.&lt;ref name=stam/&gt; Owing to its atomic configuration, penta-graphene has an unusually negative [[Poisson’s ratio]] and very high ideal strength believed to exceed that of a similar material, [[graphene]].&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt;

Penta-graphene contains both [[Orbital hybridisation#sp2 hybrids|''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] and ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized carbon atoms. Contrary to graphene, which is a good conductor of electricity, penta-graphene is an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]] with an [[Direct and indirect band gaps|indirect band gap]] of 4.1–4.3 eV. Its hydrogenated form is called penta-[[graphane]]. It has a diamond-like structure with ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and no ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonds, and therefore a wider band gap (ca. 5.8 eV) than penta-graphene.&lt;ref name=stam/&gt; Chiral penta-graphene nanotubes have also been studied as metastable allotropes of carbon.&lt;ref name="Atlahuice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAvramon"/&gt;

'''Phosphorus pentachloride''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. It is one of the most important phosphorus chlorides, others being [[phosphorus trichloride|PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[phosphorus oxytrichloride|POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; finds use as a [[Chlorination reaction|chlorinating]] reagent.  It is a colourless, water-sensitive and moisture-sensitive [[solid]], although commercial samples can be yellowish and contaminated with [[hydrogen chloride]].

==Structure==
The structures for the phosphorus chlorides are invariably consistent with [[VSEPR theory|VSEPR]] theory.  The structure of PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; depends on its environment.  Gaseous and molten PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is a neutral molecule with [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|trigonal bipyramidal]] geometry and (''D''&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;) [[Molecular symmetry|symmetry]]. The [[hypervalent]] nature of this species (as well as for {{chem|PCl|6|-}}, see below) can be explained with the inclusion of non-bonding [[molecular orbital]]s ([[molecular orbital theory]]) or [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] ([[valence bond theory]]). This trigonal bipyramidal structure persists in nonpolar solvents, such as [[carbon disulfide|CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[carbon tetrachloride|CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = D. E. C. | last=Corbridge| title = Phosphorus: An outline of its chemistry, biochemistry, and uses| year = 1995| publisher = Elsevier Science | isbn = 0-444-89307-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the solid state PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[ionic compound]], formulated {{chem|PCl|4|+|PCl|6|-}}.&lt;ref name="Holleman"&gt;{{cite book| first= A.

[[File:EntryWithCollCode76731.png|thumb|left|Structure of solid phosphorus pentachloride, illustrating its autoionization at higher concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Finch, A.; Fitch, A.N.; Gates, P.N.|title=Crystal and Molecular structure of a metastable modification of phosphorus pentachloride|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|year=1993|pages= 957-958|doi=10.1039/C39930000957}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In solutions of polar solvents, PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes self-[[ionization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Suter |first1=R. W.|last2= Knachel |first2=H. C. |last3=Petro |first3=V.

:PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} {{chem|PCl|4|+}} + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

At higher concentrations, a second equilibrium becomes more prevalent:

:2&amp;nbsp;PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} {{chem|PCl|4|+}} + {{chem|PCl|6|-}}

The cation {{chem|PCl|4|+}} and the anion {{chem|PCl|6|-}} are [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] and [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]], respectively. At one time, PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in solution was thought to form a dimeric structure, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, but this suggestion is not supported by [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectroscopic]] measurements.

===Related pentachlorides===
[[Arsenic pentachloride|AsCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Antimony pentachloride|SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] also adopt trigonal bipyramidal structures. The relevant bond distances are 211&amp;nbsp;pm (As−Cl&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;), 221&amp;nbsp;pm (As−Cl&lt;sub&gt;ax&lt;/sub&gt;), 227&amp;nbsp;pm (Sb−Cl&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;), and 233.3&amp;nbsp;pm (Sb−Cl&lt;sub&gt;ax&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haupt |first1=S. |last2=Seppelt |first2=K. | title = Solid State Structures of AsCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; | journal = [[Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie]] | year = 2002 | volume = 628 |pages = 729–734 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3749(200205)628:4&lt;729::AID-ZAAC729&gt;3.0.CO;2-E | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low temperatures, SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; converts to the dimer, dioctahedral Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, structurally related to [[niobium pentachloride]].

==Preparation==
PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is prepared by the [[Halogenation|chlorination]] of PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. N.|last=Maxson|title=Phosphorus Pentachloride|journal=Inorganic Syntheses|date=1939|volume=1|pages=99–100|doi=10.1002/9780470132326.ch34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reaction is used to produce around 10,000 tonnes of PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; per year (as of 2000).&lt;ref name="Holleman" /&gt;
:PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{pad|3em}} (Δ''H'' = −124&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol)

PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exists in equilibrium with PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [[chlorine]], and at 180&amp;nbsp;°C the degree of dissociation is about 40%.&lt;ref name="Holleman" /&gt; Because of this equilibrium, samples of PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; often contain chlorine, which imparts a greenish coloration.

==Reactions==

===Hydrolysis===
In its most characteristic reaction, PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; [[chemical reaction|reacts]] upon contact with [[water (molecule)|water]] to release [[hydrogen chloride]] and give phosphorus oxides. The first hydrolysis product is [[phosphorus oxychloride]]:
:PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;nbsp;HCl

In hot water, hydrolysis proceeds completely to [[phosphoric acid|orthophosphoric acid]]:
:PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  5&amp;nbsp;HCl

===Chlorination of organic compounds===
In synthetic chemistry, two classes of chlorination are usually of interest: oxidative chlorinations and substitutive chlorinations. Oxidative chlorinations entail the transfer of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the reagent to the substrate. Substitutive chlorinations entail replacement of O or OH groups with chloride. PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can be used for both processes.

Upon treatment with PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, [[carboxylic acid]]s convert to the corresponding [[acyl chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | authorlink = Roger Adams|last1=Adams |first1=R. |last2=Jenkins |first2=R. L. | title = ''p''-Nitrobenzoyl chloride | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 394 | prep = cv1p0394 | year = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following mechanism has been proposed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayden|first=Jonathan|title=Organic chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-850346-0|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[File:Phosphorus pentachloride mechanism.png|450px]]

It also converts [[alcohol]]s to [[alkyl halide|alkyl chlorides]]. [[Thionyl chloride]] is more commonly used in the laboratory because the resultant [[sulfur dioxide]] is more easily separated from the organic products than is POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with a tertiary amides, such as [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF), to give dimethylchloromethyleneammonium chloride, which is called the [[Vilsmeier–Haack reaction|Vilsmeier reagent]], [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N=CClH]Cl.  More typically, a related salt is generated from the reaction of DMF and POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Such reagents are useful in the preparation of derivatives of [[benzaldehyde]] by formylation and for the conversion of C−OH groups into C−Cl groups.&lt;ref name="Burks"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Burks |first=J. E., Jr |title=Phosphorus(V) chloride |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis |editor-first=L. |editor-last=Paquette |date=2004 |publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York, NY |doi=10.1002/047084289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is especially renowned for the conversion of [[carbonyl|C=O]] groups to CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | last1= Gross |first1=H. |last2=Rieche |first2=A. |last3=Höft |first3=E. |last4=Beyer |first4=E. | title = Dichloromethyl methyl ether | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 365 | prep = cv5p0365 | year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[benzophenone]] and phosphorus pentachloride react to give the [[diphenyldichloromethane]]:&lt;ref name="Spaggiari2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spaggiari|first=A.|first2=D. |last2=Vaccari |first3=P. |last3=Davoli |first4=G. |last4=Torre |first5=F. |last5=Prati |year=2007|title=A Mild Synthesis of Vinyl Halides and ''gem''-Dihalides Using Triphenyl Phosphite−Halogen-Based Reagents|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=72|issue=6|pages=2216–2219|issn=0022-3263|pmid=17295542|doi=10.1021/jo061346g}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO  +  PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  →   (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The [[electrophilic]] character of PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is highlighted by its reaction with [[styrene]] to give, after [[hydrolysis]], [[phosphonic acid]] derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | last= Schmutzler |first=R. | title = Styrylphosphonic dichloride | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 1005 | prep = cv5p1005 | year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with related reagents===
Both PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; convert R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH groups to the chloride R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CCl.  The pentachloride is however a source of chlorine in many reactions.  It chlorinates allylic and benzylic CH bonds.  PCl5 bears a greater resemblance to [[sulfuryl chloride|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], also a source of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  For oxidative chlorinations on the laboratory scale, sulfuryl chloride is often preferred over PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; since the gaseous SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by-product is readily separated.

===Chlorination of inorganic compounds===
As for the reactions with organic compounds, the use of PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has been superseded by SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The reaction of [[phosphorus pentoxide]] and PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; produces [[phosphorus oxychloride|POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Frank Albert|last= Cotton| title = Advanced Inorganic Chemistry| year = 1999| publisher = Wiley-Interscience| isbn = 978-0-471-19957-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2017}}

:6&amp;nbsp;PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; → 10&amp;nbsp;POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; chlorinates [[nitrogen dioxide]] to form unstable [[nitryl chloride]]:

:PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2&amp;nbsp;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →  PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  2&amp;nbsp;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl
:2&amp;nbsp;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl → 2&amp;nbsp;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is a precursor for [[lithium hexafluorophosphate]], LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, an [[electrolyte]] in [[lithium ion batteries]]. {{chem|LiPF|6}} is produced by the reaction of {{chem|PCl|5}} with [[lithium fluoride]], with [[lithium chloride]] as a side product:

:PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  6&amp;nbsp;LiF  →  LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; +  5&amp;nbsp;LiCl

==Safety==
PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is a dangerous substance as it reacts violently with water.

== History ==

Phosphorus pentachloride was first prepared in 1808 by the English chemist [[Humphry Davy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=The Bakerian Lecture.  An account of some new analytical researches on the nature of certain bodies, particularly the alkalies, phosphorus, sulphur, carbonaceous matter, and the acids hitherto undecomposed; with some general observations on chemical theory|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|date=1809|volume=99|pages=39–104|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015034564347;view=1up;seq=53}}  On pp. 94–95, Davy mentioned that when he burned phosphorus in  chlorine gas ("oxymuriatic acid gas"), he obtained a clear liquid (phosphorus trichloride) and a white solid (phosphorus pentachloride).&lt;/ref&gt;  Davy's analysis of phosphorus pentachloride was inaccurate;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Researches on the oxymuriatic acid [i.e., chlorine], its nature and combinations; and on the elements of the muriatic acid [i.e., hydrogen chloride].

In [[astronomy]], '''planetary [[transit (astronomy)|transit]]s and [[occultation]]s''' occur when a [[planet]] passes in front of another [[astronomical object|object]], as seen by an observer. The occulted object may be a distant [[star]], but in rare cases it may be another planet, in which case the event is called a ''mutual planetary occultation'' or ''mutual planetary transit'', depending on the relative [[apparent diameter]]s of the objects.&lt;ref name=ESAA1992&gt;P. Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac ''Explanatory Supplement to the ''Astronomical Almanac'': A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac''] (Sausalito [CA]: University Science Books, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual planetary occultations and transits==
Mutual occultations or transits of planets are extremely rare. The most recent event occurred on 3 January 1818, and the next will occur on 22 November 2065. Both involve the same two planets: [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].

===Historical observations===
An occultation of [[Mars]] by Venus on 13 October 1590 was observed by the German astronomer [[Michael Maestlin]] at [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;{{cite web |title=Planet-on-Planet Occultations (Worldwide) |first=Jan |last=Curtis |url=http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/curtis/astro4.html |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sat57"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Albers |first=Steven |date=March 1979 |title=Mutual Occultation of Planets |journal=Sky and Telescope |volume=57 |issue=3 |page=220 |bibcode= 1979S&amp;T....57..220A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1737 event (see list below) was observed by [[John Bevis]] at [[Royal Greenwich Observatory|Greenwich Observatory]] – it is the only detailed account of a mutual planetary occultation. A transit of Mars across Jupiter on 12 September 1170 was observed by the monk Gervase at [[Canterbury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Stubbs |publisher=Longman &amp; Company |date=1879 |title=Volume 1 of the Historical Works of Gervase of Canterbury |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Chinese astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1988AJ.....96.1482H |last1=Hilton |first1=J.

===Future events===
The next time a mutual planetary transit or occultation will happen (as seen from Earth) will be on 22 November 2065 at about 12:43 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], when Venus near [[superior conjunction]] (with an [[angular diameter]] of 10.6") will transit in front of Jupiter (with an angular diameter of 30.9"); however, this will take place only 8° west of the Sun, and will therefore not be visible to the unaided/unprotected eye. Before transiting Jupiter, Venus will occult Jupiter's [[natural satellite|moon]] [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] at around 11:24 UTC as seen from some southernmost parts of Earth. [[Parallax]] will cause actual observed times to vary by a few minutes, depending on the precise location of the observer.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===List of mutual planetary occultations and transits===
There are only 18 mutual planetary transits and occultations as seen from Earth between 1700 and 2200. There is a very long break of events between 1818 and 2065.&lt;ref name="sat57"/&gt;

===Mutual occultations, transits, and eclipses of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn===
Twice during the orbital cycles of Jupiter and [[Saturn]], the equatorial (and satellite) planes of those planets are aligned with Earth's orbital plane, resulting in a series of mutual occultations and eclipses between the moons of these giant planets. The terms ''eclipse'', ''occultation'', and ''transit'' are also used to describe these events.&lt;ref name=ESAA1992/&gt; A satellite of Jupiter (for example) may be eclipsed (i.e. made dimmer because it moves into Jupiter's shadow), occulted (i.e. hidden from view because Jupiter lies on our line of sight), or may transit (i.e. pass in front of) Jupiter's disk (see also [[Solar eclipses on Jupiter]]).

==Other planetary occultations==
This table is another compilation of occultations and transits of bright stars and planets by solar planets.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} These events are not visible everywhere the occulting body and the occulted body are above the skyline. Some events are barely visible, because they take place in close proximity to the Sun.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40287">'''Postage stamp paper''' is the foundation or [[substrate (printing)|substrate]] of the postage stamp to which the ink for the stamp's design is applied to one side and the adhesive is applied to the other.  The [[paper]] is not only the foundation of the stamp but it has also been incorporated into the stamp's design, has provided security against fraud and has aided in the automation of the postal delivery system.

[[Stamp catalog]]s like [[Scott catalogue|Scott's Standard Postage Stamp Catalog]] (SC) often document the paper the stamp is printed on to describe a stamp's classification. The same stamp design can appear on several kinds of paper.  [[Stamp collector]]s and [[philatelist]]s understand that a stamp's paper not only defines a unique stamp but could also mean the difference between an inexpensive stamp from one that is rare and worth more than its common counterpart.

Making an accurate determination of the stamp's paper may require special tools such as a [[micrometer]] to measure the thickness of a stamp, certain fluid chemicals to reveal hidden features, [[magnifying glass]]es or [[loupe]]s to see fine details, [[digital microscope]]s to examine the minutest details of the paper or [[ultraviolet]] light to illuminate the paper to reveal its ''glowing'' aspects.  Certain paper types may require the services of an expert as the only sure way of knowing the true identity of the stamp's paper.

==Paper characteristics==

All paper is endowed with certain characteristics by its [[Papermaking|maker]]. Depending on the purpose of the paper, the craftsman will choose specific materials and apply certain manufacturing processes to achieve the design objectives.  Characteristics such as composition, weight, color, size, watermark, surface finish, opacity, hardness and strength all have to be established before the papermaker can begin his work.

The making of paper can be broken down into three phases; the preparing of the pulp into a suspension of fibers; the forming of the paper on a mould or an endless wire mesh; and lastly the finishing of the paper's surface and drying.  From a philatelic interest, it is the second phase, the forming of the paper that yields the most interesting characteristics.

[[File:US 1956 3c Nassau Hall.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Pulp dyed orange to match [[Princeton University]]'s school colors for the 1956 [[Nassau Hall]] 200th anniversary]]
In the first phase of papermaking the characteristics such as its composition, color and weight is determined.  Paper has as its chief component, a mat of [[cellulose]] fibers. Cellulose is the skeleton structure of plant cells and can be separated from the plant for use in paper.  Cellulose has several characteristics that make it desirable for paper, the foremost being its strength when formed into a mat or web.   When cellulose fibers come in contact with each other in water, a bond is formed.  When water is removed from the adjoining fibers, the bond between the fibers strengthens.    [[Pulp (paper)|Pulp]], the collection of individual fibers, may be bleached, especially if the paper is to be dyed a different color or the paper is expected to be white.  Since most paper is either printed or written upon, [[filler (materials)|filler]]s are added to the pulp to fill the pores of the paper and [[sizing]] is added to make the fibers water resistant, yet both act as fillers.  Unsized paper is [[blotting paper]], making it unsuitable for printing.  Fillers and sizing are added to the pulp to absorb the ink quickly, unlike pure cellulose.  Fillers can be glues made from animal products, starches from rice or wheat, resins or gums, or minerals such as [[calcium carbonate]], [[titanium dioxide]] or kaolin.   Mineral fillers are the most common as they are very effective as a filler. When all of these ingredients are assembled, they are suspended in water, which may include a color dye, as the ''furnish'' to the second phase of papermaking.

The paper is formed in the second stage of papermaking.  With handmade paper, the ''furnish'' is stored in a vat and the craftsman uses a mould to strain out enough material to form a sheet of paper.  The mould determines the dimensions of the finished sheet and its weight, which ultimately establishes the paper’s thickness.  The mould is usually a wire mesh that acts as a [[strainer]] such that the ''furnish'' is separated out of the water.  The water drains off, leaving layers upon layers of fibers or a web of paper on the mould.  The texture of the paper is determined by the nature of the mould.  Wove paper has a uniform texture while laid paper has a fine-lined texture created by wires that are attached to the wire mesh.   If a watermark is part of the paper’s design, it is the mould that creates the watermark, in the same way that the fine lines of laid paper are created.  A watermark is a deliberate thinning of the paper by the placing of either wires or metal shapes, called ''bits'', onto the wire mesh of the mould.  When the mould is removed from the vat, the water drains causing the pulp to be deposited more between the wires or ''bits'' relative to the top of the ''bits'' or wires.  When the dried paper is held up to a light, the thinner paper will appear lighter in contrast to the thicker paper, thus creating a watermark.  Numerous countries have used a variety of designs for their watermarks as a means to prevent forgery of stamps, making the watermark of particular philatelic interest.

In comparison, machine-made paper is made on the [[Fourdrinier machine]] by drawing the ''furnish'' out of a vat onto an endless wire mesh.   The paper, shortly after being drawn from the vat, is usually pressed with a [[Dandy roll]] as the mechanism to imprint a watermark onto the paper.  Machine-made paper can produce single sheets of paper or one large continuous web of paper that is collected to form large rolls.

One characteristic of machine-made paper is that it creates a direction or an alignment of the fibers, which directly impacts its strength.  This is of particular importance when tearing the paper, as one would do to separate a stamp for use.  When the tear is aligned with the direction of the fibers, the paper will tear evenly.  When the tear is opposed to the direction of the fibers, the paper will tear unevenly, in a jagged line.   Handmade paper disperses the fibers in unpredictable directions and therefore yields a paper with the most overall strength.  A paper’s strength had an influence on the separation methods used for a stamp.  For example, a stronger paper may have needed a higher number of perforations per inch to best facilitate the separation of the stamps.  Similarly, many stamps have two different standards of perforation for its length and width to optimize the ease of separation while minimizing the cost of manufacturing.

In the last stage of papermaking, the paper is finished and dried.  The finishing of the paper can include the application of a coating that will produce the best effects when printed upon.   The coating is a fine layer of special sizing applied to one or both sides of the paper to fill in all of the pores and to smooth out the surface of the paper.   A glossy appearance often is a characteristic of [[coated paper]].  Once the coating is applied, the paper making process is complete.

Certain postage stamps have been printed on security paper, which is paper that has additional characteristics coated or printed onto the paper to prevent the reuse of the postage stamp and as a means to prevent forgery.

===Shrinkage===

Shrinkage is a characteristic of paper because of the nature of cellulose fibers.  The cellulose fiber is [[hygroscopic]] and acts like a sponge when immersed in water.  The fibers expand in their width and not in their length.  With handmade paper, because there is no direction associated with the fibers, the paper expands and shrinks unevenly in both the length and width of the finished sheet.   With machine-made paper, because there is a direction to the fibers, the paper shrinks unevenly, that is, less in its length (in the direction of the fibers) and more in its width (in the direction opposite of the fibers).  This characteristic is important to the printer because certain printing techniques required the paper to be dampened prior to printing.  As such, when the paper dried, the uneven shrinkage of machine-made paper would produce an image of different proportions than the die that created it.  The differences in appearance between wet and dry printed stamps can sometimes be quite noticeable, with dry printed stamps generally having sharper images on stiffer and thicker paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stampsmarter.com/learning/Manuf_WetDryPrintingMethods.html The Wet and Dry Printing Methods on U.S. Stamps]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/insights/stamp-collecting-basics/2012/april/what-s-the-difference-between-dry-printing-and-wet-printing-.html What's the difference between dry printing and wet printing?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watermarks==

'''[[Watermark]]s''' are created in the paper by special pieces of bent wire or ''bits'', either attached to the mould or attached to the Dandy roll of machine-made paper. The watermark is inherently created differently by these two methods.  In the case of the mould, the watermark is created by the settling of the fibers on the mould, thus creating the intentional thinning of the paper.  In the case of the Dandy Roll, the watermark is pressed into the wet pulp.  The papermaker closely adjusts the pressure the Dandy Roll exerts on the paper to ensure a proper impression of the watermark design into the paper.  Too little pressure and the watermark may not be detectable.

Philatelically, there are several descriptive terms used to categorize watermarks.

[[File:Watermark crown script CA.jpg|150px|thumb|''Multiple'' watermark when viewed from the back of the stamp.]]
:* ''Simple'' – When the entire watermark design can be seen on each individual stamp.

:* ''Multiple'' – When the watermark design can be seen several times on a single stamp or portions of several instances of the design are visible on a single stamp. For example, the watermarked stamps of Great Britain and her colonies.

:* ''Sheet'' – When the watermark design is so large that it covers multiple stamps such that only a portion of the watermark design is on a single stamp. For example, on India's Coat of Arms watermark of 1854

:* ''Paper-makers'' – When the watermark documents the papermaker's name, the trade name of the paper or in some instances the stamp contractor or printer. These are similar to ''sheet'' watermarks.  For example, the "Harrison &amp; Sons, London" watermark used for Maldive Islands 1933 issue.

:* ''Stitch'' – The unintentional watermark that is created by the joining of the endless wire mesh belt used in machine-made papermaking.

:* ''Marginal'' – When the watermark design appears in the sheet margins. Examples can be found in the many British Commonwealth issues.

:* ''Pattern'' – When wavy lines, lozenges, diamond mesh and others such that the pattern is repeated evenly over the whole stamp. For example, the lozenges pattern on Germany Empire's 1905-19 issue or circles pattern on the 1920 issue.

:* ''False'' – When the appearance of a watermark is created by lightly printing on the stamp.  For example, the quadrille pattern printed on France's 1892 15c issue.
 
[[File:Watermark Crown CA.jpg|125px|left|thumb|''Normal'' and ''Single'' watermark as seen from the back of the stamp.]]

:Lastly, by way of ''orientation''. These designations describe the orientation of the watermark with respect to the stamp's design.

:::::::* ''Normal'' – When the watermark coincides with the design of the stamp when viewed from the front of the stamp.  The watermark will be mirrored when viewed from the back of the stamp.

:::::::* ''Inverted'' – When the watermark is upside down when viewed from the front of the stamp. That is, when the stamp's printed design is right side up and the watermark design is upside down.

:::::::* ''Reversed'' – When the watermark is reversed when viewed from the front of the stamp.  The watermark will be un-mirrored when viewed from the back.  For example, letter watermarks would not be reversed when viewed from the back of the stamp.

:::::::* ''Inverted and reversed'' – When the watermark is both upside down and reversed when viewed from the front of the stamp.

:::::::* ''Sideways'' – When the watermark is rotated 90° with respect to the stamp's design.

=== Watermark detection ===

Watermark detection can be as simple as holding the stamp up to a light or by placing it face down on a black surface. If this does not reveal the watermark there are fluids, electrical devices and ink pads that may reveal the thinning of the paper;

:* A special stamp watermark detecting fluid may be applied to a stamp lying face down in a black plastic tray. As the fluid evaporates the watermark becomes visible and as it does not contain water the fluid may be used on mint stamps without damaging the gum. A drop of [[benzine]] can also be used to coax the watermark out of the paper but care should be observed as the inks of photogravure stamps are soluble in benzine and will ruin the stamp.

:* There are various mains or battery powered devices available in which the stamp is placed on a metal plate and a clear plastic block is pressed down onto it. A light is then switched on to reveal the watermark.

:* With the 'Morley Bright' detector the stamp is placed face down in a unit that contains ink in a sealed sachet that flows into the watermarked area of the stamp under thumb pressure.

:* There are color-filtering techniques that neutralize the color of the stamp's design, thus making it easier to see the watermark.  There is a device known as the ''Philatector'' that electronically employs a set of color filters as a means to detect the watermark.

:* If the reverse of a stamp is placed on a black background on a computer scanner and graphics software is used to adjust the color saturation and contrast this may in some cases increase visibility of a watermark.

==Flaws and Errors==

While the words ''flaws'' and ''errors'' as synonymous, they are used to distinctly describe either a defect in the stamp's paper or when an incorrect paper was used in the printing of the stamp.  Flaws describe faults or defects in the paper of the stamp, typical of handling after manufacturing or less frequently during the manufacturing of the paper.  Errors describe an incorrect type of paper used to print a stamp, typically the use of watermarked paper when it was not specified for the issue.  While a paper fault represents a damaged or defective stamp that devalues its worth, paper errors have the opposite effect and are sought after by collectors.

===Flaws===

During the manufacturing of paper, flaws can occur in the web.  One such flaw is the '''''pinhole'''''.  The term is used to designate a small blemish typically characterized by  a small hole in the substance of the paper. Pinholes are typical of very thin paper and can be found by holding the stamp up to light.

[[File:Pinholes annotated.jpg|250px|thumb|Pinholes found in an Afghanistan 1894 2 [[Afghan abasi|abasi]] stamp.]]

A rare flaw in paper is when the watermark bit has been improperly repaired on the Dandy roll. Great Britain's ''Emblems'' watermark is composed of two roses, one shamrock and one thistle.  A defect was created when the Dandy roll was repaired and instead of a thistle bit, a rose bit was added creating the ''three roses and a shamrock'' flaw. This flaw is found on Great Britain's 1862 3d (plate 2), 1865-67 3 d (plate 4), 6 d (plates 5 and 6), 9d (plate 4) and 1s (plate 4).&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Norman Williams]], ''Fundamentals of Philately'', 1990 page 82 {{ISBN|0-933580-13-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another paper flaw is a '''''crease'''''. A crease is when the paper becomes an overlapped fold, which subsequently is printed upon. This kind of crease is more of a printing error as it is a paper flaw. Creased stamps can also occur as a result of handling, where it's clear that the stamp has been folded. While the former example is collected by specialists as printing errors, the later simply devalues the stamp.

Another common handling flaw is a '''''tear'''''. The torn stamp is usually complete but the paper is partially ripped. Tearing a piece off of the stamp, however, is how the Afghan postal clerk cancelled a stamp and so this is not a flaw but evidence that the stamp was probably postally used,&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Sutton, ''The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia'' 1967 page 309&lt;/ref&gt; especially if the stamp is still on the postal matter.

A stamp can be damaged if it is soaked off of a water-soluble colored paper. For numerous occasions, people send greeting cards in envelopes that are on colored paper. The worst offender is the red envelope. If warm water is used in soaking the stamp from the paper of the envelope, the red dye can and does bleed into the stamp's paper, leaving it tinted red. This is not a stamp variety but simply a damaged stamp.  Yellow and blue dyes in colored paper bleed into a stamps too.

A '''''thin''''' is created when a stamp is improperly removed from the paper it was attached.  Since paper is created by depositing layers of fibers onto each other to form a web, they can be separated by the layers too.  When the paper is finished, the outside layers become the strongest layers. Soaking a stamp in water is the usual way of removing it from the postal matter.  Water will dissolve the glue used as the adhesive but it also weakens the bonds of the paper's fibers. Just as the removal of water strengthens the bonding between fibers, adding water weakens them.  A failed attempt at removing the stamp from other paper typically results in portion of the stamp's paper being left attached to the postal matter.  ''Thins'' can be created in a variety of ways and all result in a damaged stamp.

===Errors===

Errors of paper are created when the incorrect paper is used for the stamp's design rather than a papermaking defect. One example of this is when the watermarked paper intended for use with U.S. revenue stamps was used for the $1 Woodrow Wilson stamp (SC#832).  The mistake was made sometime between 1950 and 1951 and some 160,000 to 400,000 copies are estimated to have been printed.&lt;ref&gt;Roland E. Rustad, ''The Prexies'' 1994 page 316 {{ISBN|0-930412-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative paper terms==

When the paper of the stamp is described, stamp catalogs often use words that are relative, such as ''thick'' and ''thin''. This is done to describe the variations of the stamp's paper in a particular issue. Thick may be as much as 0.005&amp;nbsp;inches and thin as little as 0.001&amp;nbsp;inches, with medium somewhere in between.

Paper can described as being ''opaque'', ''semi-translucent'' and ''semi-transparent''. The [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the stamp describes the ability of light to shine through the paper. If no light shines through the paper, then it is opaque. If some light passes through, in any amount, the paper is semi-translucent.  [[Transparency and translucency|Transparency]] describes the ability to see an object through the paper or when the paper is placed over printed letters the ability to see the printing through the paper.  If the stamp's design can be seen through the back of the stamp, then it is semi-transparent.

Another comparative set of terms refers to the paper's hardness.  ''Hard'', ''stout hard'', and ''soft'' have been used to describe the paper. Experts have described the ''snap'' of the stamp when ''flicked'' as a means to determine if the stamp was printed on hard or soft paper.  A sharper snap implied hard paper because the hardness is a characteristic of the amount or kind of [[sizing]] used when making the paper.

''Porous'' paper is used to describe paper as absorbent, usually in contrast to less absorbent paper used in the stamps of the same country.  [[Porosity]] is a characteristic of paper. Wood fibers are [[hydrophilic]] or water loving.  Sizing is added to paper to create a resistance to water as well as to fill in the gaps between the fibers.  Porosity is a measure of how the paper responds to a liquid.

There are several popular stamp collecting terms. ''On-paper'' refers to any stamp that is still adhering to another piece of paper.  Similarly, ''off-paper'' is used to describe a postally used stamp that is no longer adhering to any other kind of paper.  ''Wallpaper'' is the slang name given to the sheets of stamps that have little or no philatelic or monetary value.

==Stamp paper varieties==

Philatelically, stamp paper can be partitioned into a few large groups.  The first that is typically encountered in the stamp catalogs describes the [[wikt:texture|texture]] of the paper, such as wove or laid. Many stamps have been printed with these different paper textures. Other groups can be formed as: Colored paper, safety or [[security paper]] and coated paper.

In a stamp catalog, a stamp's paper is usually identified at the beginning of the issue.  It will also be identified when the paper changes either within the issue or with the next issue.  When colored paper is used for the stamp, the ink colors are listed first and then the paper's color is listed next in ''italics''. Sometimes the paper is described as ''ordinary'', which simply means that the common paper of the period was used.  Coated paper is usually not listed but may be surmised by the printing process used to print the stamp.  For example, [[photogravure]] printing yields the best clarity when printed on coated papers.

Batonné paper describes its texture and is similar to [[laid paper]] but has far fewer lines, typically spaced about ½ apart.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Norman Williams]], ''Fundamentals of Philately'', 1990 page 51 {{ISBN|0-933580-13-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacing of the lines is similar to lined paper, which act as guide lines. Batonné paper may be either wove or laid.  When it is formed in laid paper, fine laid lines are visible between the batons. Batonné is from the French meaning baton or staff.

| &lt;!-- Paper description --&gt;
The ''bluish'' color of this paper is a result of an unintentional chemical reaction of the constituents of the furnish. Another potential cause may be the presence of prussiate of potassium in the ink or latent in the paper. When the paper was dampened prior to printing, the paper fibers were dyed blue. Other terms are the French word ''blueté'' or ''blue rag paper''.

| &lt;!-- Paper Description --&gt;
Chalk paper is a type of safety paper that was designed to cause the stamp's design to rub off or smear when an attempt was made to remove the cancellation on the stamp. The paper was coated with a solution containing a suspension of chalk. The British government used chalky paper in many of its colonies.  One destructive test of chalk paper is to rub a piece of silver on the paper. A black, pencil-like mark will result if the paper is chalky.

| &lt;!-- Paper Description --&gt;
Colored paper can be found in any number of colors.  Since color is added to the pulp, the color is present throughout the paper.  To identify colored paper, examine both sides of the stamp including the perforated edges.  There is tinted paper as well as surface-colored stamps (Great Britain's ''White Backs'' as an example), where color was applied intentionally after the normal processes of papermaking were finished.

| &lt;!-- Paper Description --&gt;
[[Rotary printing press]]es require long continuous rolls to keep the presses operational. When one roll was exhausted, another was joined to the end of the first roll to keep the press fed with paper. Where the two lengths of paper were overlapped, a seam was formed creating a double thickness of paper.  Normally, these seams were cut from the sheets but occasionally these double paper stamps slipped the inspector's eye and entered into post office stocks.  Up until the 1950s, the Scott's catalog listed them with a unique designation. But because double paper stamps became so common, Scott's stopped listing them with a special designation.

Duplex or two-ply paper has two different papers bonded together to form a single finished sheet of paper.  The first ply of paper was unsized, therefore very absorbent and would take the cancellation easily. The second ply was sized and much stronger.

''Goldbeaters skin'' was a tough paper that was made transparent with [[resin]] or [[collodium]]. The stamp's design was printed in reverse on the back of the paper and the adhesive was applied over the design. When the stamp was applied to the letter, the stamp's design appeared through the paper correctly.  This paper can also be referred to as ''resinized paper''.

[[File:Electrical Substation.JPG|thumb|Four reclosers on the right side of a substation]]

In [[electric power distribution]], '''automatic circuit reclosers''' (ACRs) are a class of [[switchgear]] which is designed for use on overhead electricity distribution networks to detect and interrupt momentary [[Fault (power engineering)|faults]]. Also known as Reclosers or Autoreclosers, ACRs are essentially [[high voltage]] rated [[Circuit breaker|circuit breakers]] with integrated current and voltage sensors and a [[Digital protective relay|protection relay]], optimized for use as an overhead network distribution protection asset. Commercial ACRs are governed by the ANSI/IEEE C37.60, IEC 62271-111 and IEC 62271-200 standards. The three major classes of operating voltage are 15.5 kV, 27 kV and 38 kV.

For overhead distribution networks, the majority of faults are transient, such as [[lightning strike]], [[Voltage spike|surges]] or foreign objects coming into contact with the exposed distribution lines. By this logic, 80% of outages can be resolved by a simple close operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=B. M. Weedy|title=Electric Power Systems|page=26|year=1972|edition=Second|location=London|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-471-92445-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reclosers are designed to handle a short close-open duty cycle, where [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] can optionally configure the number of attempted close operations prior to transitioning to a lockout stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/643b6a63#/643b6a63/14|title=Auto-Recloser - Safety and Minimising Downtime|last=Thompson|first=Stan|date=|website=Transmission &amp; Distribution Issue 1 2018|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclosers were invented in the mid 1900s in the USA. Some of the earliest reclosers were introduced by Kyle Corporation (which was acquired by Cooper Power Systems - part of the Eaton family) in the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cooperindustries.com/content/public/en/power_systems/about_us/our_history.html&lt;/ref&gt; The brand was the industry leader in reclosers, sectionalizers and switchgear until the 2000s when many other manufacturers entered the market. Reclosers were originally oil filled [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] devices with rudimentary mechanical protection relaying capabilities. Modern Automatic Circuit Reclosers are significantly more advanced than the original hydraulic units. The advent of [[semiconductor]] based electronic protective relays in the 1980s resulted in increased sophistication, allowing for differing responses to the various cases of abnormal operation or fault on a distribution networks. The high voltage insulation and interrupting device in modern reclosers typically consist of [[Dielectric|Solid Dielectric]] Insulation with [[vacuum interrupter]]s for current interruption and arc quenching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Electrical Engineering Handbook|page=1319|year=1993|editor=Richard C. Dorf|location=Boca Raton|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-0185-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Lineman's and Cableman's Handbook|pages=18-8 through 18-15|year=1997|editor=Edwin Bernard Kurtz|edition=9th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-036011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclosers are often used as a key component in a [[smart grid]], as they are effectively computer controlled switchgear which can be remotely operated and interrogated using [[SCADA]] or other [[Telecommunication|communications]]. This capability allows utilities to aggregate data about their network performance, and develop automation schemes for power restoration. This automation can either be distributed (executed at the remote recloser level) or centralized (close and open commands issued by a central control room to be executed by remotely controlled ACRs).

==Description==
[[File:A recloser installed on a remote feeder.jpg|thumb|A Recloser installed on a Rural Feeder]]
In order to prevent damage, each station along the network is protected with [[circuit breaker]]s or [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s which will turn off power in the event of a [[short circuit]]. This presents a major problem when dealing with transient events. For instance, a tree limb blown off a tree during a windstorm that lands on the power line may cause a short circuit that could cause damage. However, the fault could quickly clear itself as the limb falls to the ground. If the only protection system is provided by breakers at distribution substations, large areas of the distribution network could be blacked out while repair crews reset the breakers. Reclosers are programmed to automate the reset process and allow a more granular approach to service restoration. The result is increased [[availability]] of supply.

Reclosers address this problem by further dividing up the network into smaller sections. For instance, the city grid example above might be equipped with reclosers at every branch point on the network. Reclosers, because of their upstream position in the network, handle much less power than the breakers at the feeder stations, and therefore can be set to trip at much lower power levels. This means that a single event on the grid will cut off only the section handled by a single recloser, long before the feeder station would notice a problem.

Modern recloser installations are often equipped with SCADA communications, allowing the majority of reclosers to be remotely operated by staff in the utility [[control room]]. This allows for re-switching the network, as operators can use information provided by the reclosers in the field to reconfigure the distribution network if a fault is detected in the field, or to fix [[Power-flow study|load flow]] issues. Remote control of reclosers also saves significant [[Operating expense|operational expenditure]], as it can reduce the necessity of field crews to travel to site to reset devices which have transitioned to lockout.

Autoreclosers are made in single-phase and [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] versions, and use either oil, [[vacuum]], or [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] interrupters. Controls for the reclosers range from the original electromechanical systems to digital electronics with [[Electricity meter|metering]] and [[SCADA]] functions. The ratings of reclosers run from 2.4–38&amp;nbsp;kV for load currents from 10–1200&amp;nbsp;A and fault currents from 1–16&amp;nbsp;kA.

On a [[Three-phase|3-phase]] circuit, a recloser is more beneficial than three separate [[fuse cutout]]s. For example, on a [[Three-phase electric power#Transformer connections|wye]] to [[Three-phase electric power#Transformer connections|delta]] conversion if cutouts are used on the wye side, and only 1 out of 3 of the cutout fuses open, some customers on the delta side would have a [[Brownout (electricity)|low voltage]] condition, due to voltage transfer through the [[Transformer#Construction|transformer windings]]. Low voltage can cause severe damage to electronic equipment. But if a recloser were used, all three phases will open, eliminating the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Power Distribution Planning Reference Book|last=Willis|first=H. Lee|date=2004|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|isbn=0824748751|page=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reclosing principles ==

Whilst original hydraulic recloser designs had rudimentary protection capabilities, modern semiconductor controlled devices exhibit sophisticated [[control system]]s which allow for the configuration of varying responses to different classes of faults on the distribution network. The number of reclose attempts is limited to a maximum of four by recloser Standards. The basic philosophy of reclosing is to actively consider the fault cases and provide an effective response based on the fault type, this is done on a probabilistic methodology in conjunction with the detection of fault type.

The most common fault type on an overhead distribution network is lightning strike. Lightning surges cause an increase in voltage which can cause localised breakdown of insulation, allow arcing over insulators. Reclosers can detect this as an overcurrent or Earth Fault (depending on the asymmetry of the fault). Lightning surges pass very quickly (reduce in 50ms), so the first reclose operation of a recloser can be configured to both trip and reclose quickly. This first reclose allows for interruption of the arcing caused by lightning, but restores the power quickly.

If the recloser closes onto a fault, it is likely that the fault is a secondary class of fault, vegetation contact or equipment failure. An overcurrent fault would indicate a line to line class fault, which can be confirmed by negative phase sequence overcurrent protection, whereas an earth fault can indicate a Line to Ground or Double Line to Ground fault. Reclosers can then apply a fuse burning policy, where they remain closed for a short period to allow fuses on lateral lines to burn, isolating the fault. If the fault is not cleared, the recloser trips open again. This same policy can be used to deliver energy to fault sites to burn the fault off the line. This could be a branch crossing between multiple lines, or fauna (birds, snakes, etc.) coming into contact with the conductors.

Sensitive Earth Fault protection in reclosers is typically set to immediate lockout. This detection of small leakage currents (less than 1 ampere) on a medium voltage line can indicate insulator failure, broken cables or lines coming into contact with trees. There is no merit in applying reclosing to this scenario, and the industry best practice is not to reclose on Sensitive Earth Fault. Reclosers with sensitive earth fault protection capable of detecting 500mA and below are used as a fire mitigation technique, as they provide an 80% risk reduction in fire starts,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/41719/R_D_Report_-__Marxsen_Consulting_-_Vegetation_conduction_ignition_tests_final_report_15_July_2015_DOC_15_183075_-_external_.PDF|title=Vegetation Conduction Ignition Tests|last=Marxsen|first=Dr Tony|date=3/07/2018|website=https://www.energy.vic.gov.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3/07/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however they are never to be used as reclosers in this application, only as single shot distributed circuit breakers which allow for sensitivity to verify the existence of these faults.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://royalcommission.vic.gov.au/finaldocuments/summary/PF/VBRC_Summary_PF.pdf|title=Victorian Royal Commission into the Black Saturday Bushfires Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=http://royalcommission.vic.gov.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3/07/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Traditional reclosers were designed simply to automate the action of a line crew visiting a remote distribution site to close a tripped circuit breaker and attempt to restore power. With the advanced protection functionality of modern reclosers, these devices are used in a multitude of additional applications

|'''Single Phase Laterals'''
|A North American network style design, Single Phase laterals use Overcurrent as their key protection element. 3 Single Phase units can be combined into a "Single Triple" arrangement, where single phase reclosing can be used to improve reliability to the unfaulted phases. Permanent faults are typically 3 phase lockout, despite the ability to lock single phases, as the risk of circulating currents is high.

|'''Mobile Mining Equipment Protection'''
|Reclosers can be used to protect three phase mining equipment. These devices are occasionally mounted in mobile kiosks that can be moved as the equipment is moved around the mine site. Design complexity of protection equipment is reduced in these applications, as reclosers include all protection and control required to meet the application. This reduces testing and commissioning costs of the equipment.

==Autoreclosers in action==
Residential customers in areas fed by affected [[overhead power lines]] can occasionally see the effects of an autorecloser in action. If the fault affects the customer's own distribution circuit, they may see one or several brief, complete outages followed by either normal operation (as the autorecloser succeeds in restoring power after a transient fault has cleared) or a complete outage of service (as the autorecloser exhausts its retries). If the fault is on an adjacent circuit, the customer may see several brief "dips" (sags) in voltage as the heavy fault current flows into the adjacent circuit and is interrupted one or more times. A typical manifestation would be the dip, or intermittent black-out, of domestic lighting during an electrical storm. Autorecloser action may result in electronic devices losing time settings, losing data in volatile memory, halting, restarting, or suffering damage due to power interruption. Owners of such equipment may need to protect electronic devices against the consequences of power interruptions and also power surges.

==Sectionalizers==
Reclosers may cooperate with down-stream protective devices called sectionalizers, usually a [[disconnector]] or [[Fuse cutout|cutouts]] equipped with a tripping mechanism triggered by a counter or a timer.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, ''The Lineman's and Cableman's Handbook'' pp. 18–12.&lt;/ref&gt; A sectionalizer is generally not rated to interrupt fault current however it often has a larger Basic Insulation Level, allowing some sectionalizers to be used as a point of isolation. Each sectionalizer detects and counts fault current interruptions by the recloser (or circuit breaker). After a pre-determined number of interruptions, the sectionalizer will open, thereby isolating the faulty section of the circuit, allowing the recloser to restore supply to the other non-fault sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abiri-Jahromi|first=Amir|author2=Fotuhi-Firuzabad, Mahmud |author3=Parvania, Masood |author4= Mosleh, Mohsen |title=Optimized Sectionalizing Switch Placement Strategy in Distribution Systems|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery|date=1 January 2012|volume=27|issue=1|pages=362–370|doi=10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2171060|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6072299&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6072299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern recloser controllers can be configured to have reclosers operate in sectionalizer mode. This is used in applications where protection grading margins are too small to provide effective protection co-ordination between electrical assets.

==Fire safety and wildfires==
Fire risk is an innate risk of an overhead distribution network. Regardless of the choice of distribution protection switchgear, the fire risk is always higher with overhead conductors than with underground reticulation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Victorian Royal Commission into the 2009 bushfires indicated that reclosing must be disabled on high bushfire risk days, however on low risk days it should be applied for reliability of supply.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Incorrectly configured or old model reclosers have been implicated in the starting or spread of wildfires. Research into the Australian 2009 Black Saturday Bushfires indicated that reclosers operating as single shot circuit breakers with Sensitive Ground Fault protection configured at 500mA would reduce fire start risk by 80%. Any form of reclosing should be removed on high fire risk days, and reclosing in general should not be applied to detected Sensitive Earth Fault faults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Victorian utilities responded to the Royal Commission by converting some of their overhead network in high risk areas to underground cable, replacing exposed overhead conductors with insulated cables, and replacing old reclosers with modern ACRs with remote communications to ensure that settings can be adjusted on high bushfire risk days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ausnetservices.com.au/-/media/Files/AusNet/About-Us/Regulatory-Publications/Bushfire-Mitigation-Plan-2017---Electricity-Distribution-Network.ashx?la=en|title=AusNet Services Bushfire Mitigation Plan for the Electricity Distribution Network|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ausnetservices.com.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shovel logging''', sometimes called '''Hoe Chucking''', uses a log loader to swing [[logging|logs]] to the forest road. Shovel [[logging]] is one of a number of [[Outline of forestry*Harvesting|methods]] that may be used to move logs from forest to road. Rather than driving out to the log and [[skidder|dragging]] it back to the landing, the loader moves slowly across the harvest area, grabbing logs/trees within reach, and swinging them around to drop them closer to the road. Logs further from the road can be shoveled to the landing in a few passes back and forth. 
 
Skidding and [[cable logging]] can be more cost efficient for logs further from the road.  Shovel logging can make use of the loader between log truck arrivals. It can also reduce soil disturbance, since it requires only a single pass to move all the logs in reach. 

The machine shown here is typical of the 'shovels' used for shovel logging. It is a modified [[excavator]] or 'shovel'. The name dates back to a previous generation of equipment when loggers uses [[power shovel]]s (often with a [[different boom]]) to load logs.

[[File:Simoca sulky.jpg|thumb|Sulky and horse in [[Simoca]], the 'sulky capital' of [[Argentina]] ]]

A '''sulky''' is a lightweight [[cart]] having two wheels and a seat for the driver only but usually without a body, generally pulled by horses or dogs, and is used for [[Harness racing|harness races]]. The term is also used for a light [[Baby transport#Strollers and pushchairs|stroller]], an arch mounted on wheels or crawler tracks, used in [[logging]], or other types of [[vehicle]] having wheels and usually a seat for the driver, such as a [[plough]], lister or [[cultivator]].

==Horse sulky==
[[Image:Zemaitukai.jpg|thumb|Roadster style sulkies in eastern Europe]]
A sulky for [[horse]]s is a lightweight two-wheeled, single-seat cart that is used as a form of [[rural]] transport in many parts of the world. A special development of this is now used in most forms of [[harness racing]] in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[New Zealand]], including both [[Trot (horse gait)|trot]]ting and [[Horse gait|pacing]] races. They are called "sulkies" because the driver must prefer to be alone &lt;ref&gt;"The Encyclopaedia of Driving" 1979, by Sallie Walrond&lt;/ref&gt;

Race sulkies come in two categories, 
* Traditional symmetrical sulkies
* Asymmetric or "offset" sulkies

An "improved sulky" with pneumatic tires and adjustable height was patented at the United States Patent Office by W.J. Hamill on August 15, 1893. (see Google patents)
The asymmetric sulky was patented in Australia in the 1980s and came to prominence in 1987 when a two-year-old [[gelding]] named [[Rowleyalla]] used one to break the then world record for his category, at 3.4 seconds under the existing mark.

In 1990 the asymmetric sulky was introduced into North America, winning seven of its first nine starts at [[Freehold Raceway|Freehold, NJ]]. Today the great majority of sulky manufacturers in North America are producing asymmetric sulkies.

An additional sulky type is the "team-to-pole" or "pairs" sulky, a lightweight single seat sulky designed for draft by two horses abreast.

These may also be split into two types:
* Traditional pole and yoke with draft by traces.
* Dorsal hitch with draft direct from the saddle to the yoke and, via the pole, to the sulky.

Of the two, the dorsal hitch pairs sulky is the most recent, holding all current world pairs speed records over the mile to July 31, 2005.

===Sulkies used in harness racing===
[[File:Vienna - Trotting racer at the Krieau - 6602.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Racing sulky]]
There are two types of sulkies used in [[harness racing]].
*Jog Carts, used only for training, are bigger and bulkier than a racing cart.  These may sometimes be known as Roadcarts. The shafts may be wood, aluminum, steel or stainless steel.  They have bigger seats which requires less athleticism to sit upon, and may also seat two. The most modern styles provide full independent suspension by hydraulic dampers and progressive rate coil springs. These give both a smoother ride and higher speed than traditional types. They are also lighter.
*Race Bikes are the only style allowed to be used in races or qualifying heats.  They are more compact and aerodynamic than a jog cart, have smaller seats that reduce weight, but require more athleticism for the driver to sit upon.  Shafts may be of carbon fibre, aluminum, titanium, stainless steel or, less often, wood.
*Speed Carts have a similar design to race bikes in a single seat and stirrups for the driver, but have roadgoing tyres, mud flaps, longer shafts and are heavier than race bikes. Some may have a limited form of suspension built into the seat. These are usually made of steel and are heavier than race bikes but much lighter than jog carts.

When it rains, or the track has excessive moisture, trainers and drivers are required to put plastic [[mud flap]]s on the back of the wheels. All race bikes must comply with the relevant procedures and standards in order to be approved. In no way can a race bike have any component that will directly interfere with another horse or driver.

==Dog sulky==
[[Image:Hundewa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sacco Wagon]]
[[File:Goat racing.JPG|thumb|Juniors racing feral goats that are pulling sulkies]]
Smaller sulkies are also used for [[dog]]s, both for racing and as [[transport]]ation.

The dog driving sulkies can be divided into two main types: 
* Conventional two-shaft carts attaching to harness on either side of the dog or dogs. 
* Single-shaft dorsal hitch carts, which attach to a single point on top of the dog's shoulders.

A further distinction may be made between sulkies with the axles rigidly connected to the vehicle, and those with the axles insulated from the vehicle by springs and dampers. Those with springs and dampers may be further divided into single-axle sprung carts and "independent suspension" sprung and damped carts. Needless to say, those with independent suspension by coil springs and dampers tend to be both more expensive and smoother riding.

Driving sulky construction materials run the full gamut from timber, through powder-coated steel tube, aluminum tube, and stainless steel tube. The very latest types (currently undergoing field tests in California) use nanotechnology-based stainless steels of prodigious strength-to-weight ratio.

The great majority of driving sulkies available have the wheel axles rigidly affixed to the frames. This makes for a rough ride on anything but smooth surfaces such as pavement. But in recent years lightweight, single shaft, independent suspension, driving sulkies have been introduced. These allow safe high speed use in off-road conditions.

The most recent designs are of the single shaft type, as proponents believe that this type gives the dog(s) greater freedom, less possibility of injury, and a quicker and easier training regime. A single shaft dog sulky, made of stainless steel tube and fitted with independent suspension and disc brakes, weighs a little under 18&amp;nbsp;kg. The highest speed so far recorded in one of these sulkies being 64.8 kilometers per hour (February 22, 2007, Australia).

However, as at August 2005, multiple shaft types are still the most common.

For off-road use, dog sulkies with sprung and damped independent suspension systems offer greatly improved comfort and safety over traditional unsprung types.

'''Superheated steam''' is a [[steam]] at a temperature higher than its vaporization (boiling) point at the absolute pressure where the temperature is measured.

The steam can therefore cool (lose internal energy) by some amount, resulting in a lowering of its temperature without changing state (i.e., condensing) from a gas, to a mixture of saturated vapor and liquid.  If unsaturated steam (a mixture which contain both water vapor and liquid water droplets) is heated at constant pressure, its temperature will also remain constant as the [[vapor quality]] (think dryness, or percent saturated vapor) increases towards 100%, and becomes dry (i.e., no saturated liquid) saturated steam. Continued heat input will then "super" heat the dry saturated steam. This will occur if saturated steam contacts a surface with a higher temperature.

Superheated steam and liquid water cannot coexist under [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], as any additional heat simply evaporates more water and the steam will become saturated steam. However this restriction may be violated temporarily in dynamic (non-equilibrium) situations. To produce superheated steam in a power plant or for processes (such as drying paper) the saturated steam drawn from a [[boiler]] is passed through a separate heating device (a [[superheater]]) which transfers additional heat to the steam by contact or by [[radiation]].

Superheated steam is not suitable for [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;William D. Wise, [http://www.chemicalprocessing.com/articles/2005/592.html "Succeed at steam sterilization''], "Chemical processing" 27 November 2005. Retrieved  2010-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because the superheated steam is dry. Dry steam must reach much higher temperatures and the materials exposed for a longer time period to have the same effectiveness; or equal F0 kill value. Superheated steam is also not useful for heating. [[#Saturated steam|Saturated steam]] has a much higher wall heat transfer coefficient.&lt;ref name="systhermique.com"&gt;[http://www.systhermique.com/steam-condensate/services/troubleshooting/superheated-steam/ Saturated steam vs superheated steam: Site for SCCS Group].

Superheated steam’s greatest value lies in its tremendous internal energy that can be used for kinetic reaction through mechanical expansion against turbine blades and reciprocating pistons, that produces rotary motion of a shaft.  The value of superheated steam in these applications is its ability to release tremendous quantities of internal energy yet remain above the condensation temperature of water vapor; at the pressures at which reaction turbines and reciprocating piston engines operate.

Of prime importance in these applications is the fact that water vapor containing entrained liquid droplets is generally incompressible at those pressures.  If steam doing work in a reciprocating engine or turbine, cools to a temperature at which liquid droplets form; the water droplets entrained in the fluid flow will strike the mechanical parts of engines or turbines, with enough force to bend, crack or fracture them.&lt;ref&gt;Leyzerovich, A. S., ''Wet-Steam Turbines for Nuclear Power Plants'', PennWell, USA, 2005.{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superheating and pressure reduction through expansion ensures that the steam flow remains as a compressible gas throughout its passage through a turbine or an engine, preventing damage of the internal moving parts.

== Saturated steam ==
'''Saturated steam''' is steam that is in equilibrium with heated water at the same pressure, i.e., it has not been heated more than the [[boiling point]] for that pressure.  This is in contrast to superheated steam, in which the steam (vapor) has been separated from the water droplets then additional heat has been added.

These condensation droplets are a cause of damage to [[steam turbine]] blades,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reason why such turbines rely on a supply of dry, superheated steam.

'''Dry steam''' is saturated steam that has been very slightly superheated. This is not sufficient to change its energy appreciably, but is a sufficient rise in temperature to avoid condensation problems, given the average loss in temperature across the steam supply circuit. Towards the end of the 19th century, when superheating was still a less-than-certain technology, such steam-drying gave the condensation-avoiding benefits of superheating without requiring the sophisticated boiler or lubrication techniques of full superheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, water vapor that includes water droplets is described as '''wet steam'''. If wet steam is heated further, the droplets evaporate, and at a high enough temperature (which depends on the pressure) all of the water evaporates, the system is in [[vapor–liquid equilibrium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=R Paul |year=2001 |title=Introduction to Food Engineering |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-646384-2}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it becomes ''saturated steam''.

Saturated steam is advantageous in heat transfer due to the high latent heat of vaporization. It is a very efficient mode of heat transfer. In layman's terms, saturated steam is at its dew point at the corresponding temperature and pressure. The typical latent heat of vaporization (or condensation) is 970 Btu/lb for saturated steam at atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.spiraxsarco.com/esc/SS_Properties.aspx?lang_id=ENG&amp;country_id=US|title=Saturated Steam Calculator|last=|first=|date=|website=Spirax Sarco.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Steam engine===
{{main|High-pressure steam locomotive}}
Superheated steam was widely used in main line [[steam locomotive]]s.  [[Saturated steam]] has three main disadvantages in a [[steam engine]]:  it contains small droplets of water which have to be periodically drained from the cylinders; being precisely at the boiling point of water for the boiler pressure in use, it inevitably condenses to some extent in the steam pipes and cylinders outside the boiler, causing a disproportionate loss of steam volume as it does so; and it places a heavy demand on the boiler.

Superheating the steam dries it effectively, raises its temperature to a point where condensation is much less likely and increases its volume significantly.  Added together, these factors increase the power and economy of the locomotive.  The main disadvantages are the added complexity and cost of the superheater tubing and the adverse effect that the "dry" steam has on lubrication of moving components such as the steam valves.  [[Shunting locomotives]] did not generally use superheating.

The normal arrangement involved taking steam after the regulator valve and passing it through long superheater tubes inside specially large firetubes of the boiler.  The superheater tubes had a reverse ("torpedo") bend at the firebox end so that the steam had to pass the length of the boiler at least twice, picking up heat as it did so.

===Processing===
Other potential uses of superheated steam include: drying, cleaning, layering, reaction engineering, epoxy drying and film use where saturated to highly superheated steam is required at one atmospheric pressure or at high pressure. Ideal for steam drying, steam oxidation and chemical processing.  Uses are in surface technologies, cleaning technologies, steam drying, catalysis, chemical reaction processing, surface drying technologies, curing technologies, energy systems and nanotechnologies.
Superheated steam is not usually used in a heat exchanger due to low heat transfer co-efficient.&lt;ref name="spiraxsarco.com"&gt;[http://www.spiraxsarco.com/resources/steam-engineering-tutorials/steam-engineering-principles-and-heat-transfer/superheated-steam.asp Superheated Steam : International site for Spirax Sarco]. Spiraxsarco.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In refining and hydrocarbon industries superheated steam is mainly used for stripping and cleaning purposes.

===Pest control===
Superheated steam is used for [[Soil steam sterilization|soil steaming]].{{Dubious|date=June 2011}}&lt;!-- Wet steam is used, not superheated --&gt;  Steam is induced into the soil which causes almost all organic material to deteriorate. Soil steaming is an effective alternative to chemicals in agriculture.

'''Supersonic flow over a flat plate''' is a classical [[fluid dynamics]] problem. There is no exact solution to it.

==Physics==
[[File:Supersonic flow over a sharp leading edged flat plate at zero incidence.JPG|thumb|Supersonic flow over a sharp leading edged flat plate at zero incidence]]
When a fluid flow at the speed of sound over a thin sharp flat plate over the leading edge at low incident angle at low [[Reynolds Number]]. Then a laminar boundary layer will be developed at the leading edge of the plate. And as there are viscous boundary layer, the plate will have a fictitious boundary layer so that a curved induced shock wave will be generated at the leading edge of the plate.
The shock layer is the region between the plate surface and the boundary layer. This shock layer be further subdivided into layer of viscid and inviscid flow, according to the values of [[Mach number]], [[Reynolds Number]] and Surface Temperature. However, if the entire layer is viscous, it is called as merged shock layer.

==Solution to the Problem==

This Fluid dynamics problem can be solved by different Numerical Methods. However, to solve it with Numerical Methods several assumptions have to be considered. And as a result shock layer properties and shock location is determined. Results vary with one or more than one of viscosity of the fluid, Mach number and angle of incidence changes. Generally for large angles of incidences, the variation of Reynold’s Number has significant effects on the change of the flow variables, whereas the viscous effects are dominant on the upper surface of the plate as well as behind the trailing edge of the plate.

Different experimenters get different result as per the assumptions they have made to solve the problem.

The primary method which is generally used to this problem:

===Explicit Finite Difference Approach===
This method involves using time-dependent [[Navier-Stokes equation]] which is advantageous because of its inherent ability to evolve to the correct steady state solution.
The continuity, momentum and energy equations and some other situational equations are needed to solve the problem. MacCormack’s time marching technique is applied and then using [[Taylor series]] expansion the flow field variables are advanced at each grid point. Then, initial boundary conditions are applied and solving equations will converge to approximated results.
These equations can be solved by using different algorithms to get better and efficient results with minimum errors.

[[Swiss International Air Lines]] '''Flight 850 (LX 850)''' was an international scheduled passenger flight from [[Basle]], [[Switzerland]], to [[Hamburg]], Germany. On 10 July 2002, the flight was unable to land at [[Fuhlsbüttel Airport]] due to weather. Attempts were made to divert to other airports at [[Berlin]] and [[Eberswalde]] before the crew decided to land at [[Werneuchen]]. On landing, the aircraft struck an earth bank which ripped off all three undercarriage legs, and came to rest on its belly with an engine on fire. One of the sixteen passengers suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was written off.

The investigation into the accident by the [[German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation]] (BFU) took over eight years to complete. It raised a number of issues, including poor [[crew resource management]], insufficient weather information being passed to the crew of Flight 850 and faulty runway markings at [[Werneuchen Airfield]], where the runway had been reduced in length from {{convert|2400|m|ft}} to {{convert|1500|m|ft}}, but the runway markings had not been altered to reflect this.

Flight 850 was originally scheduled to be operated by an [[Embraer ERJ 145 family|Embraer 145]] aircraft.

The designated alternative airport was [[Bremen Airport]], some {{convert|55|nmi|km}} to the south-west. To reach Bremen would have meant flying through the frontal system. Another aircraft successfully landed on Runway 33 at Hamburg, reporting strong winds. The crew of Flight 850 declined to attempt a landing on Runway 23, and requested a diversion to [[Langenhagen Airport]], [[Hannover]]. [[Air Traffic Control]] (ATC) did not suggest any other alternatives, nor were they requested by the crew.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avherald.com/h?article=434c6b66&amp;opt=0 |title=Report: Crossair SB20 at Werneuchen on Jul 10th 2002, landed before runway and impacted earth wall |first=Simon |last=Hradecky |publisher=The Aviation Herald |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

En route, the frontal system prevented the crew from turning towards Hannover. A decision was made to divert to [[Tegel Airport]], Berlin. The [[Automatic Terminal Information Service]] at Tegel stated that the weather there was clear and no significant change was expected. Approaching Tegel's Runway 08L, the crew requested priority handling, stating that they had fuel for 40 minutes flight. On approach, severe turbulence was again encountered due to the frontal system having reached Berlin. The approach was abandoned and the crew requested an alternate airfield from ATC. [[Eberswalde Airfield]] was suggested and accepted by the crew, who stated "We'll take anything at this point". On hearing this remark, ATC treated the aircraft's situation as an emergency. En route to [[Eberswalde]], thunderstorms were observed and alternates were sought from ATC.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt;

Hamburg ATC then offered [[Neubrandenburg Airport]], which was rejected by the crew of Flight 850 on receiving the weather information. [[Werneuchen Airfield]] was then offered, which was {{convert|20|nmi|km}} away and offered a runway {{convert|1500|m|ft}} long. Werneuchen was accepted by the crew. ATC managed to contact the chairman of the flying club based at Werneuchen. He stated that the runway surface was {{convert|2400|m|ft}} long, but an earth bank stretched across the runway leaving {{convert|1500|m|ft}} available. Landing on Runway 08 meant that the first part of the runway fell before the earth bank. Almost an hour after aborting the approach to Fuhlsbüttel, Flight 850 began its approach to Werneuchen. The crew reported that they were visual with the runway and were advised by Werneuchen ATC that they needed to land on the eastern part of Runway 08. When Flight 850 turned onto its final approach, the captain remarked that the runway was "longer than [[Berne Airport|Berne]]", and told the first officer to land wherever he wanted.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt; Although the closed off part of the runway had been marked as such, the markings had weathered severely over the years, meaning that the original markings were easier to see than those that actually applied. Fading light and a lack of runway lighting contributed to the inability of the crew to see the earth bank.&lt;ref name=Hugin2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huginonline.com/try/plsql/pressreleases.queryview?P_IDENTIFIER=866571&amp;p_la=5 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125211231/http://www.huginonline.com/try/plsql/pressreleases.queryview?P_IDENTIFIER=866571&amp;p_la=5 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 January 2013 |title=Further update on the landing of SWISS flight LX 850 |publisher=Hugin |date=12 July 2002 |accessdate=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first officer landed the aircraft at what appeared to be the runway threshold. It then came in contact with the earth bank which ripped off all three undercarriage legs and the aircraft slid to a halt on its belly. The fire alarm for the port engine sounded, and the crew performed fire drills on both engines.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt; One female passenger injured her leg.&lt;ref name=Werneuchen/&gt; The wrecked aircraft was initially stored&lt;ref name=Reg/&gt; but was later declared as damaged beyond economic repair&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt; and was subsequently scrapped.&lt;ref name=Reg/&gt;

==Investigation==
The [[German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation]] (BFU) opened an investigation into the accident, which was to take 3,005 days (over eight years) to complete.&lt;ref name=ASN100702/&gt; It found that a combination of factors caused the accident. Had the crew received the SIGMETs, the BFU considers it is likely that the crew would have realised that the thunderstorms were not isolated, but part of a system, and therefore made different decisions to those that they did.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt;

The [[METAR]]s for both Tegel and [[Schönefeld Airport|Schönefeld]] airports showed [[Wikt:CAVOK|CAVOK]] and [[NOSIG]], the latter element was criticised by the BFU.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt; At 17:50, this METAR was issued at Tegel Airport: EDDT 04001KT CAVOK 30/17 Q1002 A2959 0998 2947 NOSIG.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;&lt;ref name=Translate2&gt;METAR for Tegel Airport, wind from 040° at {{convert|1|kn|km/h}}, Ceiling and Visibility OK, QNH 1002 HPa, current [[altimeter setting]] 29.59 in.Hg, falling to 998 HPa, 29.47 in.Hg, '''NO SIG'''nificant change expected.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the cold front was {{convert|30|km|nmi}} south west of Tegel, and had moved {{convert|100|km|nmi}} in the previous hour. The BFU was of the opinion that NOSIG should not have been in the METAR, and that a [[SPECI]] would have been required.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt; At 18:20, a new METAR was issued at Tegel: EDDT VRB01KT 9999 FEW040CB SCT120 BKN260 29/17 Q1002 A2959 0998 2947 TEMPO 27025G55KT 2000 +TSRA BKN009 BKN015CB COMMENTS: OCNL LTNG AND CB SW OF STN.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;&lt;ref name=Translate3&gt;METAR for Tegel Airport. Wind variable at {{convert|1|kn|km/h}}, visibility in excess of {{convert|10|km|nmi}}, few clouds at 400 ft, thunderstorm, scattered clouds at 1,200 ft, broken clouds at 2,600 ft, current altimeter setting 29.59 in.Hg, falling to 998 HPa, 29.47 in.Hg. Temporarily winds from 270° at {{convert|25|kn|km/h}}, gusting to {{convert|55|kn|km/h}}, visibility {{convert|2|km|nmi}} in thunder showers and rain, broken clouds at 900 ft, broken clouds at 1,500 ft including cumulonimbus. Occasional lightning and cumulonimbus clouds south west of the airport {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--See [[Talk:Swiss_International_Airlines_Flight_850#METARs]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This METAR was issued two minutes before Flight 850 began its approach to Tegel.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt;

The decision to abort the approach to Fuhlsbüttel was supported by the BFU, but not the decision to divert to Hannover. The decision to divert to Tegel was supported by the BFU, based on the incorrect information given to the crew of CAVOK and NOSIG at Tegel. On approach to Werneuchen, ATC did not use correct terminology. It also found that the runway markings at Werneuchen did not conform to the required standard.&lt;ref name=AH434c6b66/&gt;

This page documents the '''[[tornado]]es and [[tornado outbreak]]s of 1964''', primarily in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes.

A '''wet wing''' is an [[aerospace engineering]] technique where an aircraft's [[wing]] structure is sealed and used as a [[fuel tank]]. Wet wings are also called ''integral fuel tanks''.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 557. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By eliminating the need for [[fuel bladder]]s, aircraft can weigh less and the wing root bending moment caused by the lift generated by the wings in flight is decreased. This offers further reduction in weight by allowing structural components to be designed lighter as the components do not need to support larger forces.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Wet wings are common among most civilian designs, from large transport aircraft, such as [[airliner]]s, to small [[general aviation]] aircraft. Because the tanks are an integral part of the structure, they cannot be removed, and require access panels for [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] and visual inspections.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A disadvantage of the wet wing is that every rivet, bolt, [[nut plate]], hose and tube that penetrates the wing must be sealed to prevent fuel from leaking or seeping around these hardware components. This sealant must allow for expansion and contraction due to rapid temperature changes (such as when cold fuel is pumped into a warm wing tank) and must retain its sealing properties when submerged in fuel and when left dry for long periods of time. Working with this sealant can be difficult and replacing old sealant inside a small wing tank can be harder if the old sealant needs to be removed as well before new sealant can be applied.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
