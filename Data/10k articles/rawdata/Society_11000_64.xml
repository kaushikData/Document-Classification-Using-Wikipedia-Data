A military-style '''[[robbery]] of [[Prosegur]]’s office occurred in [[Ciudad del Este]]''', [[Paraguay]]'s border town to Brazil, on April 24, 2017.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/24/army-60-robbers-gets-away-with-spectacular-heist-in-paraguay.html |author= |title=Army of 60 robbers gets away with spectacular heist in Paraguay|publisher=Fox News |date=April 24, 2017| accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been termed  “the robbery of the century” and “mega-robbery” by the media,&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; and is the “biggest heist in Paraguay’s history".&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

In the night, about 50&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; to 80&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; heavily-armed robbers closed off the perimeter of the office with cars and, during a three hour assault, were reportedly able to access at least one of the three vaults of the company. One police officer was killed, and several people were wounded.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/25/525584135/mega-robbery-in-paraguay-dozens-reportedly-took-part-in-violent-heist |author=Bill Chappell| title='Mega-Robbery' In Paraguay: Dozens Reportedly Took Part In Violent Heist| publisher=NPR |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The robbers were thought to have taken between 8 million to 40 million USD.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; According to Prosegur, 8 million USD were missing from one vault.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-26/brazil-police-arrest-suspects-in-multi-million-dollar-heist/8471828| author= |title=Paraguay robbery: Huge Brazilian gang mounts multi-million-dollar raid on armoured car firm, four dead| publisher=ABC News |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities have assumed that the robbers came from and returned to Brazil where an apparent staging house was found across the border in [[Foz do Iguaçu]]. A subgroup of the robbers was reported to be intercepted in [[Itaipulandia]] resulting in a gun battle during which three suspects were killed and four arrested.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/americas/paraguay-vault-robbery/ |author=Nicole Chavez |title='Robbery of the century': 8 arrested in neighboring Brazil |publisher=CNN |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional suspects were arrested in Parana.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Paraguayan police suspects that the [[First Capital Command]] (PCC), a criminal Brazilian gang, may be behind the robbery.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

The [[Age of consent|ages of consent]] vary by jurisdiction across [[Europe]]. The ages of consent are currently set between '''14''' and '''18'''. The vast majority of countries set their ages in the range of 14 to 16; only four countries, Cyprus (17), Ireland (17), Turkey (18) and Vatican City (18), do not fit into this pattern. The laws can also stipulate the specific activities that are permitted or differentially specify the age at which a given sex can participate. Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. The highlighted age is that at which, or above which, an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age. In 2014, the self-declared state of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] lifted the ban on [[sodomy]], decriminalizing homosexual sex.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25918330 |title=BBC News - Northern Cyprus lifts ban on gay sex |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jurisdictions in Europe have an equal and [[gender-neutral]] age limit.

The below is a list of all jurisdictions in Europe as listed in [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe]].

==International obligations==
Neither the [[European Union]] nor the [[Council of Europe]] have suggested any specific age of consent, and there has not been any effort so far to standardize the age across member states. However, most countries in Europe now have binding legal obligations in regard to the sexual abuse of children under 18. The [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse|Lanzarote Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/treaties/Html/201.htm|title=Liste complète|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came into effect in 2011, obligates the countries that ratify it to criminalize certain acts concerning children under 18, such as the involvement of such children in prostitution and pornography. Other acts that must be criminalized include:

"Engaging in sexual activities with a child (child is defined in Article 3 as "person under the age of 18 years") where:
* Use is made of coercion, force or threats; or
* Abuse is made of a recognised position of trust, authority or influence over the child, including within the family; or
* Abuse is made of a particularly vulnerable situation of the child, notably because of a mental or physical disability or a situation of dependence."

The age of consent is called "the legal age for sexual activities" and must be chosen by states at the age they see fit. (No specific age is recommended.) As of September 2018, the convention has been ratified by 44 states, while another 3 states have signed but not yet ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/201/signatures |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222194134/http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/201/signatures |archivedate=22 December 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union (EU 28), there is a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] regarding the sexual abuse of children under 18, known as ''"Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography" |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0093 |website=EUR-Lex |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albania==
Since 2001, the age of consent in Albania is '''14''', regardless of gender and sexual orientation. In the case of a girl, however, sex is illegal if she is over&amp;nbsp;14 but has not reached "sexual maturity", as provided by article 100 of the criminal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1565/file/d46a10bcf55b80aae189eb6840b4.htm/preview|title=CRIMINAL CODE OF THE REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA|accessdate=11 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613054559/http://legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1565/file/d46a10bcf55b80aae189eb6840b4.htm/preview |archivedate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Andorra==
The age of consent in Andorra is '''14''', as specified by Article 147 of the penal code, which reads: "''Whoever carries out a sexual act with a person '''younger than fourteen years''' ... shall be punished with imprisonment for between three months and three years.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leslleis.com/L2005009_7#Article_147_|title=Llei 9/2005, del 21 de febrer, qualificada del Codi penal|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|language=Catalan|work=leslleis.com|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As specified by Articles 148 and 149, it is illegal - regardless of age - for a person occupying a position of authority or superiority over a person to engage in sexual activity with them, or when it involves the abuse of trust or situation of need or dependence.  The penalty is more severe when the subject is below the age of 18.

==Armenia==
The age of consent in Armenia is '''16'''.

''Article 141. Sexual acts with a person under 16.''

''Sexual intercourse or other sexual acts with a person obviously '''under 16''', by a person who reached 18 years of age, in the absence of elements of crime envisaged in Articles 138, 139 or 140 of this Code, is punished with correctional labor for the term of up to 2 years, or with imprisonment for the term of up to 2 years.''&lt;ref name="legislationline.org"/&gt;

==Austria==
The general age of consent in Austria is '''14''', as specified by Section 206&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40023134/NOR40023134.html |title=RIS Dokument |publisher=Ris.bka.gv.at |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code. (The term ''unmündig'' is specified in Section 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40093644/NOR40093644.html |title=RIS Dokument |publisher=Ris.bka.gv.at |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code.) Paragraph 4 of Section 206 defines a close-in-age exception of maximum three years.

''However'', Section 207b&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40033821/NOR40033821.html |title=RIS Dokument |publisher=Ris.bka.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code contains an exception to the general age of consent: if one of the partners is ''younger than 16 years'' of age and "''not sufficiently mature to understand the significance of the act''", then the act is punishable.

The offence "initiating sexual contacts with minors under 14 through the use of computer system" is punishable by two years' imprisonment (Section 208a Penal Code).

===History===
The Austrian Criminal Code previously specified 18 as the age of consent for [[male homosexual sex]] in which the other partner was aged 14–18, while no equivalent provision existed for heterosexual sexual conduct; this was Section 209 of the Criminal Code. In November 1996, an amendment was put before the Austrian Parliament to remove Section 209; but the vote ended in a draw, and the amendment failed to pass. In July 1998, a similar amendment was put forward; it was voted down by the conservative majority. Section 209 came into force when homosexuality between males became legal in 1971.

On 24 June 2002, the Austrian Constitutional Court ruled that Section 209 was unconstitutional. The Section was later repealed on 14 August 2002. On 9 January 2003, the European Court of Human Rights held, in ''L &amp; V v Austria'', that Section 209 violated Articles 8 and 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

==Azerbaijan==
The age of consent in Azerbaijan is '''16'''.

''Article 152''

''Sexual intercourse with the person '''below the age of 16 years''', as well as the same offences linked with satisfaction of sexual passion in perverted forms shall be
''punished by imprisonment up to 3 years''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaAzerbaijan.pdf |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080229152337/http%3A//www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaAzerbaijan.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-29 |title=Internet / Home - INTERPOL |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belarus==
The age of consent in Belarus is '''16''', as specified by Articles 168 and 169, which read: "''Sexual relations, sodomy, lesbian acts or other actions of sexual character of an adult, reached eighteen years of age, with a person who obviously '''has not reached sixteen years''' of age, at absence of attributes of the crimes stipulated by articles 166 and 167 present codes, are punished by restriction of freedom of two years to four years or by imprisonment of two years to five years.''" and "''Dissolute actions accomplished by a person, reached eighteen years of age, concerning a person who obviously '''has not reached sixteen years''' of age, at absence of attributes of the crimes stipulated by articles 166, 167 and 168 present codes, are punished by arrest of about six months or imprisonment of one year to three years.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislationline.org/legislations.php?jid=7&amp;ltid=15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182826/http://www.legislationline.org/legislations.php?jid=7&amp;ltid=15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=Belarus Criminal Code |language=Russian |work=National register of legal acts of Byelorussia |year=2005 |at=paragraph № 74, 2/1112 |publisher=legislationline.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
The age of consent in Belgium is '''16''', as specified by Article 372 of the Criminal Code (Code pénal/Strafwetboek), which reads:

"''Any indecent assault committed without violence or threat on the person or with the assistance of the person of a child of either sex, '''aged less than sixteen''', shall be punished by imprisonment (of five years to ten years).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?DETAIL=1867060801%2FF&amp;caller=list&amp;row_id=1&amp;numero=2&amp;rech=4&amp;cn=1867060801&amp;table_name=LOI&amp;nm=1867060850&amp;la=F&amp;dt=CODE+PENAL&amp;language=fr&amp;fr=f&amp;choix1=ET&amp;choix2=ET&amp;fromtab=loi_all&amp;trier=promulgation&amp;chercher=t&amp;sql=dt+contains++%27CODE%27%26+%27PENAL%27and+actif+%3D+%27Y%27&amp;tri=dd+AS+RANK+&amp;imgcn.x=41&amp;imgcn.y=12#LNK0094 Article 372 of the Criminal Code (Code pénal, in French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203060924/http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?DETAIL=1867060801%2FF&amp;caller=list&amp;row_id=1&amp;numero=2&amp;rech=4&amp;cn=1867060801&amp;table_name=LOI&amp;nm=1867060850&amp;la=F&amp;dt=CODE%20PENAL&amp;language=fr&amp;fr=f&amp;choix1=ET&amp;choix2=ET&amp;fromtab=loi_all&amp;trier=promulgation&amp;chercher=t&amp;sql=dt%20contains%20%20%27CODE%27&amp;%20%27PENAL%27and%20actif%20=%20%27Y%27&amp;tri=dd%20AS%20RANK%20&amp;imgcn.x=41&amp;imgcn.y=12 |date=3 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&amp;la=N&amp;cn=1867060801&amp;table_name=wet|title=LOI - WET|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The Belgian Criminal Code previously specified an age of consent of 18 for homosexual sex. This provision - Article 372bis - was added in 1965 and repealed in 1985.

==Bosnia and Herzegovina==
Sexual activity with children younger than '''14''' is illegal under Article 207, which prohibits sexual acts with a "child", and a "child" is defined in Article 2(8) as a person '''under 14'''. ''However'', Article 209 mentions a "juvenile" who is defined in Article 2(9) as a person ''under 18'', although it is not clear if this article refers only to sexual acts performed ''in view'' of a minor under 18 or if it can be used also to punish sexual acts performed ''with'' the minor:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1661/file/5863a4917995d1a282d020fb2715.htm/preview |title=5863a4917995d1a282d020fb2715.htm |publisher=Legislationline.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 207, Sexual Intercourse with a Child: (1) Whoever performs sexual intercourse or equivalent sexual act on a child, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term between one and eight years.
* Article 208, Meaning of Terms as Used in This Code: (8) A child, as referred to in this Code, is a person who ''has not reached fourteen years of age''.
* Article 209, Satisfying Lust in the Presence of a Child or Juvenile: Whoever, in the presence of a ''child'' or ''juvenile'', performs acts aimed at satisfying his own lust or the lust of a third person, or whoever induces a ''child'' to submit to such acts in his presence or in the presence of a third person, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term between three months and three years.
* Article 205: (2) prohibits sexual intercourse with a juvenile (defined as a person under 18) by "abuse of position".

==Bulgaria==
The age of consent in Bulgaria is '''14''', as specified by Articles 149 and 151 (1). However Article 151 (2) has a provision for those who are over 14 and do "''not understand the characteristics or the importance of the act.''"

''Art. 151. (1) A person who has sexual intercourse with a person '''who has not completed the age of 14 years''', insofar as the act does not constitute a crime under Article 152, shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for two to six years.''&lt;ref name="legislationline.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes |title=Criminal codes |publisher=Legislationline.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Art. 149. (1) A person who performs an act for the purpose of arousing or satisfying sexual desire, without copulation, '''with a person under 14 years of age''', shall be punished for lewdness by deprivation of liberty for one to six years.''&lt;ref name="legislationline.org"/&gt;

==Croatia==
The age of consent for all sexual conduct in [[Croatia]] under the new Criminal Code in force since 1 January 2013 is '''15''', regardless of sexual orientation or gender, regulated by Article 158.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zakon.hr/z/98/Kazneni-zakon |title=Croatian Criminal Code (in Croatian) |publisher=Zakon.hr |date= |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1) Whoever performs sexual intercourse with a child '''under fifteen years of age''' or induces a child to commit sexual intercourse with a third person, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of one to ten years.

(2) Whoever commits lewd act with a child '''under fifteen years of age''' or induces a child to commit lewd act on itself or with a third person, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term between six months and five years.

However, there is a close-in-age exemption of three years.

===History===
Before the year 2013, the legal age of consent in Croatia was 14. Homosexual acts were illegal until 1977, when Croatia, then as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Federal Republic]], changed its Penal Code. Age of consent was equalised in 1998.

==Cyprus==
The age of consent for all sexual conduct in Cyprus under the 2002 ''Criminal Code'' is '''17''', regardless of sexual orientation or gender.

===History===
Until 1998, homosexual acts between men were entirely forbidden under Section 171 (1929). In 1989, Alecos Modinos, president of the Cypriot Gay Liberation Movement, brought a case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. In 1993, the Court held that the prohibition of homosexual acts was a violation of Article 8. In January 1995, the Cypriot Government introduced a Bill in the Cypriot Parliament that would have abolished the ban. Strong opposition from the [[Orthodox Church]] meant the Bill stalled when referred to the Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee. The European Commission repeated its warning that Cyprus must follow the Court's ruling. In May 1997, again a government measure to repeal the ban failed because of the strength of the opposition. In April 1998, the Council of Europe set a deadline for compliance of 29 May 1998 and on 21 May 1998, the House of Representatives voted 36 to 8 in favour legalising homosexual acts. However it was set at 18 while heterosexual acts remained at 16.

In 2002, under pressure from the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=George Psyllides|title=Gays Ruling 'Too Little, Too Late'|work=Cyprus Mail|date=6 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; the parliament finally ended the disparate provisions and changed the age of consent to 17 for both heterosexual and homosexual acts, under the revised ''Criminal Code''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/0_154/index.html |title=Ο περί Ποινικού Κώδικα Νόμος - ΚΕΦ.154 |publisher=Cylaw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Akrotiri and Dhekelia===
For both of these Sovereign Base Areas (British military enclaves) on the island of Cyprus, the age of consent is 16.

==Czech Republic==
The age of consent in the [[Czech Republic]] is '''15'''.

Additionally, the section of the new Czech penal code 40/2009 Sb. about "crimes against family and children" contains § 202 which criminalizes a '''"seducing to sexual intercourse"''' aimed at persons under '''18 years''' with any promise or provide of payment, benefit/privilege or profit for a sexual intercourse, masturbation, exposure or similar behavior. This regulation was added to the old Czechoslovak penal code (140/1961 Sb.) adopted by the Czech Republic as § 217a by the amendment Czech act No. 218/2003 Sb. efficient since 2004 January 1. This also covers cases when there is any kind of trust/dependence, for example, teacher-student, employer-employee, etc.

===History===
The historic age limit in the Austrian Empire was 14 years by § 128 of the empire Penal Code from 1852.&lt;ref&gt;117/1852 Ř.z., Zákon trestní o zločinech, přečinech a přestupcích: § 128 Zprznění&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexual sexual intercourse (as well as intercourses with animals) were generally criminalized as "crime against nature" by § 131. The Austrian Penal Code was not replaced in Czechoslovakia before 1950. The Czechoslovak Penal Code 86/1950 Sb. in § 239 elevated the limit to 15 years. Almost identic regulation contained Czechoslovak penal code 140/1961 Sb., which in § 242 reads: "''A person who has coitus with a '''person younger fifteen (15) years''' of age or who sexually abuses such a person by other way shall be sentenced to imprisonment for at least one and at most eight years.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trestni.juristic.cz/489540/oddil/trzo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517051618/http://trestni.juristic.cz/489540/oddil/trzo |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Czech Penal Code (40/2009 Sb., efficient since 2010 January 1) contents a similar regulation in § 187. Around 2008 and 2009, lowering of the limits of [[criminal responsibility]] as well as sexual restriction from 15 to 14 years was proposed by the Ministry of Justice and passed in Parliament within the new Penal Code 40/2009 Sb. efficient since 2010 January 1. Both changes were criticized. Before its efficiency, the amendment act 306/2009 Sb. changed both limits back to '''15 years'''.

Until 1961, homosexual sexual intercourse was illegal in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak 140/1961 Sb. Penal Code, introduced in that year, still contained as a crime "Sexual intercourse with a person of the same sex" (§ 244) but affected only persons older 18 years who had intercourse with a person younger than '''18 years'''. Between adults, payment receipt or provision and public nuisance were reasons for criminalization. In 1990, article § 244 was removed in its entirity by the Czechoslovak act 175/2009 Sb. efficient since 2009-07-01.

==Denmark==
The age of consent in the Kingdom of Denmark is '''15'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/r0710.aspx?id=181992#idfb7ca177-33f0-4332-902c-cad2d4cb86c2|title=Bekendtgørelse af straffeloven|last=|first=|date=2016-07-04|website=www.retsinformation.dk|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as specified by Section 222:

''§ 222. Whoever has sexual intercourse with a child '''under the age of 15''', shall be punished by imprisonment for up to 8 years, unless the situation is covered by § 216 paragraph 2. In determining the penalty, it shall be an aggravating circumstance if the perpetrator has gained intercourse by exploiting his physical or mental superiority.''

Section 223, part 1, reads: "''Any person who has sexual intercourse with any child under 18, who is said person's adopted child, stepchild or foster child, or who is entrusted to said person for education or upbringing, will be liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding four years.''" This applies, e.g., to teachers. Further, part 2 of § 223 establishes that the same punishment is applicable to any person found to have grossly exploited their age- and experience based superiority over a person under the age of 18 to seduce said minor into intercourse.

The laws in the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]] are equivalent although regulated in separate penal codes for these autonomous countries.

===History===
Male homosexual acts were legalised in Denmark (lesbianism was never illegal) with an age of consent set at 18, after a major reform of the Penal Code in 1930; At the same time, the age of consent for heterosexual acts was raised from 12 to 15. In 1976, the age of consent was harmonized at 15 for all acts {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. Sex with a child under the age of 12 results in double punishment, and sex with a minor under 18 is illegal for a person in charge of this child.

Until 1866, "acts against nature" [anal intercourse] were punishable with the stakes. However, until the late 18th century the rule was never used, and, when it came into rule, the convicts were always pardoned to 7 years in jail.{{clarify|date=October 2018}} This became the punishment introduced in the Penal Code 1866, but now only for homosexual acts.

In 1969, Denmark became the first country to [[Pornography in Denmark|legalise pictorial pornography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/dk.php|title=CCIES at The Kinsey Institute: Denmark|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this did not affect laws related to the age of people participating in its production. Consequently, the legal age of consent (15) equaled the limit for pornography produced ''within'' the country, but material produced in other countries (where the Danish consent law does not apply) was not covered and therefore legal. In 1980 it became illegal to sell, spread or possess pornography involving children under the age of 15, regardless of its country of origin ([[Danish Penal Code]] §235).&lt;ref name="Straffelovens-235"&gt;Straffelovrådets betænkning om seksualforbrydelser (September 2012).

[[Ministry of Justice (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of Justice]].&lt;/ref&gt; The limit was later changed to 18 years, which is the standing law today, although it remains legal for a person over the age of 15 to take their own nude photos, as long as they are only shared with friends (for example with a boyfriend or girlfriend), the receiver explicitly has received the right to possess them, and they are not shared or spread any further.&lt;ref name="Straffelovens-235"/&gt; In the period between the legalisation of pornography and the 1980 amendment to the Danish Penal Code, some companies (infamously [[Color Climax]]) exploited the lack of age restrictions on material produced in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] (25 January 2016).

==Estonia==
The age of consent in Estonia is '''14''', as specified by Section 145 (sexual intercourse with a child), which reads: "''An adult person who engages in sexual intercourse with a person of '''less than 14 years''' of age shall be punished by up to 5 years’ imprisonment.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes|title=Criminal codes - Legislationline|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 141 defines rape as "''Sexual intercourse with a person against his or her will by using force or taking advantage of a situation in which the person is not capable of initiating resistance or '''comprehending the situation'''''"; and Section 147 reads:

Section 147. Inability of person of less than 10 years to comprehend
:''Within the meaning of the offences provided for in this Division, a person is deemed to be '''incapable to comprehend if he or she is less than 10 years of age'''''.

===History===
Until 1992, male homosexual sex was illegal, the Estonian SSR Penal Code, Article 118, forbidding "anal intercourse between men". When regaining independence from [[USSR]] in 1991, the age of consent for male homosexual intercourse was set at 16, whereas the age for heterosexual intercourse was 14. The age of consent was harmonized in 2001 when the law was amended, specifying an age of 14 for sexual intercourse.

==Finland==
The age of consent in Finland is '''16''', as specified by Section 6(1) (Sexual abuse of a child), which reads: "''A person who has sexual intercourse with a '''child younger than sixteen years''' of age ... shall be sentenced for sexual abuse of a child to imprisonment for at most four years.''"

The sexual act may not be punishable if "there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039 |title=Finnish Criminal Code |publisher=Finlex.fi |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act may be punished as the lesser crime of "aggravated sexual abuse" rather than "rape" if courts determine there was no force or fear.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/425925-finland-sex-migrant-10yo/&lt;/ref&gt;

The age is 18 when in connection with a person who has some formal power over the young person, like a school teacher.

===History===
Male homosexual acts were illegal until 1791, when the ancient sodomy laws were dropped from the Criminal Code of that year. This continued to be the case under the Napoleonic Code of 1810.

The age of consent was set at 11 in 1832 and at 13 in 1863. In 1942, the age of consent for homosexual acts was set at 21, while for heterosexual acts it was still 13. The latter was increased to 15 in 1945. In 1974, the age for homosexual acts was lowered to 18. In 1982, it was lowered to 15, in line with that for heterosexual acts.

==Georgia==
The age of consent in Georgia is '''16''' as per Georgian Penal Code Art. 140, and Art. 141.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.ge/files/crcreport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307204223/http://www.humanrights.ge/files/crcreport.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The age of consent in Germany is '''14''', as long as a person over the age of 21 does not exploit a 14- to 15-year-old person's lack of capacity for sexual self-determination, in which case a conviction of an individual over the age of 21 requires a complaint from the younger individual; being over 21 and engaging in sexual relations with a minor of that age does not constitute an offense by itself. Otherwise the age of consent is 16, although provisions protecting minors against abuse apply until the age of 18 (under Section 182(1): it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 "by taking advantage of an exploitative situation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGB_000P182 |title=German Criminal Code |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

This is specified by Sections 176 (Sexual abuse of children) and 182 (Sexual abuse of youths) of the Penal Code, which read:

§&amp;nbsp;176: "(1) Whoever commits sexual acts on a person under fourteen (14) years of age (a child) or allows them to be committed on themself by the child, shall be punished by imprisonment from six months to ten years [...]"

§&amp;nbsp;180: "(1) Whoever abets the commission of sexual acts of a person under sixteen years of age on or in front of a third person or sexual acts of a third person on a person under sixteen years of age":
# by acting as an intermediary; or
# by furnishing or creating an opportunity,
shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than three years or a fine. [...]"

§&amp;nbsp;182: "(2) A person over twenty-one years of age who abuses a person under sixteen years of age, in that he: 1. commits sexual acts on the person or allows them to be committed on himself by the person; or 2. induces the person to commit sexual acts on a third person or to allow them to be committed on the person by a third person, and thereby exploits the victim's lack of capacity for sexual self-determination, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than three years or a fine. [...] The act shall only be prosecuted upon complaint, unless the prosecuting authority considers ex officio that it is required to enter the case because of the special public interest therein. [...] The court may dispense with punishment pursuant to these provisions if, in consideration of the conduct of the person against whom the act was directed, the wrongfulness of the act is slight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/176.html|title=§ 176 StGB Sexueller Mißbrauch von Kindern - dejure.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

The current rules for age of consent in Germany were set following a [[Germany|post-reunification]] penal law reform in 1994. The ages of 14 and 16 had been relevant since the Criminal Code for the German Empire came into force in 1872: Under §&amp;nbsp;176, sexual acts with children under 14 were illegal and have been always since. Under §&amp;nbsp;182, seduction of an "unblemished girl under the age of 16" was prosecuted upon complaint of parents or legal guardian only. In [[West Germany]] the latter rule was kept, with minor changes in 1973: Unblemishedness was no longer required, and the court could refrain from punishment if the offender was under 21 years of age. The [[German Democratic Republic]], by contrast, created a new socialist criminal code in 1968. Under §&amp;nbsp;149, sexual acts with persons of the opposite sex between the ages of 14 and 16 were punishable if the victim's "moral immaturity" was exploited by using "gifts, the promise of benefits or similar" methods of persuasion "to initiate intercourse or actions similar to intercourse".

Male homosexuality had been illegal under [[Paragraph 175|§&amp;nbsp;175]] regardless of age since 1872. Female homosexuality was not prosecuted. In West Germany, male homosexuality was legalized in 1969. The age of consent was set to 21 years and reduced to 18 years in 1975. Only only men of 18 or older could be offenders and courts could refrain from punishment if the offender was not yet 21. In East Germany, the criminal code was supplemented in 1957 by a provision that allowed the waiving of prosecution if no harm had been done to socialist society by the unlawful act. Concerning §&amp;nbsp;175, this meant that male homosexual acts were prosecuted only if they involved minors, which meant persons under 18. The new criminal code of 1968 officially legalized homosexuality and in §&amp;nbsp;151, which now was gender-neutral, criminalized only homosexual acts of adults with minors. In 1987 the GDR supreme court ruled homosexuality was a variant of sexual behaviour just as heterosexuality. In 1989 §&amp;nbsp;151 was repealed and §&amp;nbsp;149 amended to include any sexual orientation.

After German reunification, according to the [[Unification Treaty (1990)|Unification Treaty]] of 1990, the §&amp;nbsp;149 code section stayed in force for the territory of the former GDR, and in West Germany, §&amp;nbsp;175 and §&amp;nbsp;182 were no longer enacted. West German law makers also saw the need for gender- and sexual-orientation-neutrality, and for rebalancing sexual self-determination with the protection of minors. In the ensuing 1994 reform, the minimum age of 14 for all of Germany was kept, and in building on legal traditions of both states, sexual acts committed by a person above 21 with a minor under 16 involving exploitation of the minor's individual lack of capacity for sexual self-determination were made punishable in new §&amp;nbsp;182. §&amp;nbsp;175 was abolished. In general, the need for a complaint from the former West German law was kept, but in the case of special public interest, the offence was made prosecutable ex officio, as had been the case in East German law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexetius.com/StGB/175 all older versions and changes of §&amp;nbsp;175] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210011422/http://lexetius.com/StGB/175 |date=10 December 2016 }} (Homosexual acts); [http://lexetius.com/StGB/176 current and all older versions and changes of §&amp;nbsp;176] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314215141/http://lexetius.com/StGB/176 |date=14 March 2016 }} (Sexual abuse of children); [http://lexetius.com/StGB/182 current and all older versions and changes of §&amp;nbsp;182] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207163904/http://lexetius.com/StGB/182 |date=7 February 2015 }} (Sexual abuse of juveniles; until 1994: Seduction).

There are also several other prohibitions regarding positions of authority and acts of lewdness, as specified by Articles 342 and 343. Furthermore, there is a close-in-age exemption of 3 years age difference for indecent acts between persons younger than 15.

==Hungary==
The age of consent in [[Hungary]] is '''14'''. A close-in-age exemption allows sexual acts from age 12 if the older party is under 18.

The new criminal code in force since 1 July 2013 reads:
"The person who has completed eighteenth year has sexual intercourse with a person who has not yet completed his/her fourteenth year, commits a felony and shall be punishable with imprisonment from one year to five years".
"The person who has sexual intercourse with a person who has not yet completed his/her twelfth year, commits a felony and shall be punishable with imprisonment from five years to ten years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Complex Kiadó Kft. |url=http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=A1200100.TV |title=2012. évi C. törvény - a Büntető Törvénykönyvről |publisher=Net.jogtar.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1961 homosexual acts were illegal. After decriminalisation the age of consent for homosexual acts was 20 and remained so until 1978. From then until 1999 the age of consent for such acts was 18, as specified by Section 199. In 2002 the Hungarian Constitutional Court repealed Section 199 and the age of consent for homosexual acts was lowered to 14 in line with heterosexual acts.

===History===
Prior to the 1922 independence of the [[Irish Free State]], the law in Ireland was that of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (see [[#UK history|the UK history section]]). Anal sex was illegal under the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], while the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] criminalised "Defilement of girl between thirteen and sixteen years of age", with more severe penalties for "Defilement of girl under thirteen years of age". The 1930 Carrigan Report into child sex abuse and underage prostitution recommended raising the age of consent to 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{jstor|30095398}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 raised the age to 17, with more severe penalties under age 15, and disallowed a defence of mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0006/print.html|title=Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law on child sex abuse, including the age of consent, was the subject of a 1989 consultation paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/cpChildSexAbuse.htm|title=Consultation Paper on Child Sexual Abuse|date=August 1989|publisher=Law Reform Commission|pages=54, 60–78, 204–5|accessdate=21 June 2013|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1990 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/Reports/rChildSexAbuse.htm|title=Report on Child Sexual Abuse|date=September 1990|publisher=Law Reform Commission|pages=34–49, 90–93|accessdate=21 June 2013|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Law Reform Commission (Ireland)|Law Reform Commission]] (LRC). The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 decriminalised male homosexual acts and created offences of "[[Buggery]] of persons under 17 years of age" and "[[Gross indecency between men|Gross indecency]] with males under 17 years of age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0020/print.html|title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the 1935 law was struck out when the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] found that its prohibition of the mistake defence violated a defendant's [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitutional]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ie/judgments.nsf/09859e7a3f34669680256ef3004a27de/877f6b6773b3dcee80257177003c6586?OpenDocument|title=C.C. -v Ireland &amp; ors [2006] IESC 33|date=23 May 2006|publisher=Irish Courts Service|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, quickly passed within the scope of the Supreme Court's judgment, replaced the 1935 and 1993 offences with the current ones.&lt;ref name="irlcitiz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irlact2006"/&gt; The exemption for girls under 17 was recommended by the LRC and the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] who felt "it would be wrong to stigmatise mothers and pregnant girls of 15 or 16 years of age as if they were either the victims of violent rape or they had committed a crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2006/06/02/00004.asp#N112|title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2006: Second Stage.|date=2 June 2006|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|pages=Vol. 621 No. 1 p.4 c.12|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was controversial, the Minister pointed out that the previous law had not criminalised any sex act by a girl under 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/2006/06/02/00005.asp#N27|title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2006: Second Stage.|date=2 June 2006|work=Seanad Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|pages=Vol. 183 No. 22 p.5 c.1786|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 report of the [[Oireachtas]] Joint Committee on Child Protection recommended changing the age of consent to 16, and 18 with a person in authority.

==Italy==
The age of consent in Italy is '''14''' years, with a close-in-age exception that allows those aged 13 to engage in sexual activity with partners who are under the age of 18, provided that the age gap between them is less than 3 years. The age of consent rises to 16 if one of the participants has some kind of influence on the other (e.g. teacher, tutor, adoptive parent, etc.). Not knowing that the victim is underage is not a legal defense, except when it was unavoidable ignorance. If the minor involved is under the age of 11, the crime can be punished even without a complaint and the punishment is aggravated. It is also illegal to perform sexual acts in the presence of a minor aged less than 14 with the intent of allowing the minor to witness the acts, even if they do not take an active part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diritto.it/codici/titolo/75-codice-penale-dei-delitti-contro-la-persona|title=Codice penale :: DEI DELITTI CONTRO LA PERSONA :: Diritto &amp; Diritti|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latvia==
The age of consent in Latvia is '''16'''.

The main legislation is specified by the Latvian Criminal Law, Section 161 ('''Acts of a sexual nature with a Person who has not Attained the Age of Sixteen Years'''), which translated reads: "''Committing a sexual, anal or oral act or another unnatural sexual act of gratification, or other acts of a sexual nature committed in physical contact with the victim's body, if it was done with a person '''who has not attained the age of sixteen years and if such offence has been committed by a person who has attained the age of majority''', is punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to five years, or short-term imprisonment, or community service, or a fine and probationary supervision for a period of up to five years.''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Krimināllikums|url=http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=88966|website=likumi.lv}} (Latvian original text)&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Until 1992, male homosexual acts were illegal under Section 124.1 of the Latvian Criminal Code. This provision was repealed by the Latvian Parliament in 1992 and the age of consent for male homosexual acts was set at 18. In 1998, the Latvian Parliament adopted a new Criminal Code that contained a complex system of sexual offences: the age of consent for all sexual acts other than vaginal intercourse was 14; for vaginal intercourse it was 16 (with a close-in-age exemption that allowed 14 and 15 year olds to have sex with a person under 18). In 2001, the law was amended to clarify the situation and confirm that the age of consent was 16 for all acts (only a person aged 18 or older can be punished for having sex with a 14–15 year old).

==Liechtenstein==
The age of consent in Liechtenstein is '''14'''. Sexual activity with 14–15 year olds is generally legal, but it can still be punished if sexual access to these children has been obtained by exploiting their lack of sexual self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/CRC/docs/study/responses/Liechtenstein.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Liechtenstein.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously the age of consent was set to 14 according to the Lithuanian Criminal Code §153 prohibiting any sexual molestation or sexual relationships with a minor under 14 years{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. The age of consent (14) was not set directly in this article of the Lithuanian criminal code, though. It has been established by the Lithuanian case law. This meant that both heterosexual and homosexual acts were allowed once a child had reached the age of 14{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. There was (and remains) an exception to this rule: §151.1(3) of the Lithuanian Criminal Code prohibits parents, guardians, or other people who are ex officio directly responsible for the upbringing and supervision of a child to have any relationships of sexual kind with the child, if he or she has not yet reached the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infolex.lt/portal/start_ta.asp?act=doc&amp;fr=pop&amp;doc=66150 |title=LR baudžiamasis kodeksas (BK) |publisher=Infolex.Lt |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Until 1993, male homosexual acts were prohibited under the Lithuanian Criminal Code, Article 1221, which was repealed in that year. The new law set an age of consent of 17 for male oral and anal intercourse, 16 for other male homosexual acts, and 14 for lesbian and heterosexual acts. In 2004, the law was amended to equalise the age of consent at 14 for all sexual acts; the age of consent was raised to 16 in 2010, regardless of gender and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154435.htm |title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Lithuania |publisher=State.gov |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luxembourg==

* ''Article 188''

''(1) A person who commits statutory rape or some other sexual act upon a child shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to five years.''

However, Article 197 prohibits an adult living in an extra-marital community with a Juvenile ''under 16''.

''Article 197''

''(1) An adult who lives in an extra-marital community with a juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen years, but not the age of sixteen, shall be punished with imprisonment of three months to three years.
''
* Article 189(2) prohibits sexual acts with a Juvenile under 18 "who was entrusted to" the offender "for study, education, custody or care".
* Article 192 prohibits both procuring a Juvenile for sexual acts and enabling the performance of sexual acts with a juvenile. This could effectively make the age of consent at '''18'''.
* Article 71 defines "Child" as a person '''under 14''', while article 72 defines "Juvenile" as a person '''under 18'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/8892/preview|title=Legislationline|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malta==
The age of consent in Malta is '''16'''.&lt;ref name=malta/&gt; Sexual activity - typically by people over 16 - with people between 12 and 16 can be considered ''defilement of minors'' ''by'' ''[[lewd]] acts'' or ''corruption of a minor'', which, at the discretion of prosecutors and the courts, depending on the circumstances, may result in a conviction.

Art 201 of Chapter 9 of the Laws of Malta (''Presumption of violence in cases of carnal knowledge and indecent assault'') states:
:''201. Unlawful [[carnal knowledge]] and any other [[indecent assault]], shall be presumed to be accompanied with violence -&lt;br /&gt;(a) when it is committed on any person under twelve years of age;&lt;br /&gt;(b) when the person abused was unable to offer resistance owing to physical or mental infirmity, or for any other cause independent of the act of the offender, or in consequence of any fraudulent device used by the offender.''&lt;ref name="maltachapter9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8574 |format=PDF |title=Criminal Code Chapter 9, 10 June 1854 - last amended III of 2004 |publisher=Ministry for Justice, Culture and Local Government  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The punishment is imprisonment from three to nine years, with or without solitary confinement, as described in Art. 198 (''Rape or carnal knowledge with violence''). The punishment can be increased in certain cases described in Art. 202, such as when the person has not attained the age of nine years.

Art. 204 of Chapter 9 of the Laws of Malta (''Defilement of minors'') reads:
:''203. (1) Whosoever, by [[lewd]] acts, defiles a minor of either sex, shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, with or without solitary confinement: [...]''&lt;ref name="maltachapter9"/&gt;
A number of aggravating circumstances exist to this blanket provision including: Abuse of parental authority or tutorship, where the victim is under the age of 12 and if the offence is committed by means of threats or deceit. There is no definition of how old the offender must be: Even another minor can be guilty of this crime,&lt;ref name="attard"/&gt; although there is no evidence that any such case has ever been prosecuted.

The age of majority is defined in Art 188 of Chapter 16 of the Civil Laws of Malta:
:''188. (1) Majority is fixed at the completion of the eighteenth year of age.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.justice.gov.mt/lom/legislation/english/leg/vol_2/chapt16.pdf |format=PDF |title=CHAPTER 16 CIVIL CODE |publisher= Docs.justice.gov.mt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To apply Art. 203, there are requirements:
:''For the completed offence and apart from the formal element of the offence, there must be the lewd act (atto di libidine) and the actual defilement. The lewd act may be committed either on the person or in the presence of the minor. All acts which, either by their very nature or of the circumstances in which they are performed, either are directed to the indulgence of the sexual appetite, either of the agent or of the victim, and are capable of arousing sexual interest of the victim, are lewd acts for the purposes of the offence in question.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.justice.gov.mt/SENTENZI2000_PDF/MALTA/TAL-MAGISTRATI%20(GUDIKATURA%20KRIMINALI)/2008/2008-09-25_568-2005_50759.PDF |format=PDF |title=IL-PULIZIJA SPETTUR LOUISE CALLEJA VS.

The interpretation of the law is situational and at the discretion of the prosecution and the courts, based on relevant factors that may be taken into account to decide whether the minor was actually "defiled". For example, in 2008 two brothers, aged 19 and 20, were found not guilty of defiling a girl, then aged 16 (until 2018 the age of consent was 18). Their sexual encounters were consensual, and it was clear that the girl had had several previous sexual adventures with several youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080428/local/brothers-acquitted-of-defiling-girl |title=Brothers acquitted of defiling girl |publisher=timesofmalta.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.justice.gov.mt/SENTENZI2000_PDF/MALTA/TAL-MAGISTRATI%20(GUDIKATURA%20KRIMINALI)/2008/2008-04-23_914-2004_48886.PDF |format=PDF |title=POLICE INSPECTOR TEREZA SCIBERRAS, INSPECTOR RAYMOND AQUILINA VS.

In the wording of the law there is no discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. However, discrimination can result from selective enforcement with regard to individual cases. "This may therefore lead to a higher incidence of cases in which the minor and the perpetrator are of the same sex, given that there may be parents who would not resort to legal proceedings should their 17-year-old child have sexual relations with another person of the opposite sex but would do so if the person is of the same sex."&lt;ref name="attard"&gt;{{cite web |first=Christian |last=Attard |url= http://www.law.leiden.edu/general/img/Malta%20-%20Summary%20of%20legislation%202006_tcm19-55172.pdf |format=PDF |title=Summary of legislation implementing "Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation" with respect to sexual orientation in Malta |year= 2005 |publisher=Law.leiden.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage is allowed as early as the age of 16, which until May 2018 theoretically would have allowed a case to arise in which a spouse press charges under this article. In practice, this problem has never arisen.

The concept of age-banding employed in for example Canada is not present in the Maltese legal system and sexual activity between one partner who is 15 years old and another who is 16 years old can constitute defilement of minors, depending on the circumstances, with no exception being allowed purely on the basis of the proximity of their ages.

In early 2018 Parliament voted in favour of the "Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence Act, 2018" which came into effect on 14 May 2018. The primary objective of the Act is to transpose the Council of Europe Convention on prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence, and it also includes amendments that lowered the age of consent to 16.&lt;ref name=malta&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=29057&amp;l=1 |format=PDF |title=Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence Act, 2018" |publisher= Docs.justice.gov.mt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Montenegro decriminalized homosexual sex in 1977, with an equal age of consent, set at 14.

==Netherlands==
The age of consent in the Netherlands is '''16''', as specified by the Dutch Criminal Code at Article 245,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/cgi-bin/deeplink/law1/title=WETBOEK%20VAN%20STRAFRECHT/article=245/ |title=wetten.nl - Wet- en regelgeving - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854 |language=nl |publisher=Wetten.overheid.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Article 247 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/cgi-bin/deeplink/law1/title=WETBOEK%20VAN%20STRAFRECHT/article=247/ |title=wetten.nl - Wet- en regelgeving - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854 |language=nl |publisher=Wetten.overheid.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which read:

Art 245: "''A person who, out of wedlock, with a person who '''has reached the age of twelve but has not reached sixteen''', performs indecent acts comprising or including sexual penetration of the body is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than eight years or a fine of the fifth category.''"

Art 247: "''A person who, with a person whom he knows to be unconscious or physically unable to resist or to be suffering from such a degree of mental defect or mental disease that he is incapable or not sufficiently capable of exercising or expressing his will in the matter or of offering resistance, performs indecent acts, or who, with a person who '''has not yet reached the age of sixteen (16) years''', out of wedlock, performs indecent acts, or by whom the latter is enticed into performing, or submitting to such acts, out of wedlock, with a third party, is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than six years or a fine of the fourth category.''"

Close-in-age exceptions (for consensual acts between adolescents close in age, within "social-ethical norms") are at the discretion of the prosecution. Acts such as a ménage-a-trois, or an unequal relationship, e.g. the perpetrator{{clarify|date=November 2017}} (17) wasn't in love while the victim{{clarify|date=November 2017}} (15) was, can also be considered outside "social-ethical norms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juridischkennisportaal.nl/wiki/strafrecht/ontucht-cq-feitelijke-aanranding/jurisprudentie-ontucht-leeftijdsverschil.htm |title=Jurisprudentie ontucht - leeftijdsverschil - Juridisch kennisportaal |publisher=Juridischkennisportaal.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
In the 1990s, the [[Netherlands]] gained international attention due to its policies regarding the age of consent. Between 1990 and 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=yit1CY_4BRMC }} |title=Regulating sex: the politics of intimacy and identity – Elizabeth Bernstein, Laurie Schaffner |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands operated what was in effect an age of consent of 12, subject to qualifications. The relevant law, passed in November, 1990, permitted sexual intercourse for young people between 12 and 16 in most circumstances, but allowed a challenge by parents or by the Child Protection Agency if there was evidence of [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, David T. (1993). ''Sexual Citizenship: The Material Construction of Sexualities'', p. 208. Routledge, London. {{ISBN|0-415-05799-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the age of consent was often reported internationally to be 12, this was partly misleading, because sexual acts up to 16 remained open to prosecution. The Netherlands has gained an international reputation of being extremely liberal on sexual issues, with some of this due to exaggerated reports in foreign media and claims by foreign politicians, rather than based on reality. For instance, during the 1980s, some conservative campaigners in the US claimed that children were sold into sexual slavery at "auctions" held in [[Amsterdam]], but did not produce any evidence to support their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Al Heigl, Webmaster |url=http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume1/j1_1_6.htm |title=IPT Journal - "Mass Hysteria in Oude Pekela" |publisher=Ipt-forensics.com |date=2014-04-15 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Cyprus==
[[Northern Cyprus]] has an age of consent of '''16''' as designated in the Penal Code (''Ceza Yasası'', Art. 153 &amp; 154).

===History===
Prior to 2014, [[sodomy]] was illegal, the age of consent only applied to females and sexual contact with a female between the ages of 13 and 16 was a misdemeanor. As of 2014, the age of consent is set at 16 for both males and females, sexual contact with any child under 16 regardless of gender is a felony and the ban on sodomy is lifted, thereby legalizing homosexual sex.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Norway==
The age of consent in Norway is '''16''', as specified by the 2005 Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lovdata.no/dokument/NLE/lov/2005-05-20-28|title=The Penal Code - Lovdata|website=lovdata.no|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; §304: which reads: "''Any person who performs a sexual act with a child '''under 16 years''' of age shall be subject to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, unless the conduct falls within the scope of section 299.''" Aggravating circumstances as recidivism, multiple perpetrators, and unusual degree of degradation and pain, or physical harm (including, specifically, sexually transmitted diseases) may raise the maximum penalty.

The penal code on the age of consent is three-tiered.

If the child is '''under 14 years''', §299 of the same penal code, reads:  "''A penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years shall be applied to any person who:
a) engages in sexual activity with a child '''under 14 years''' of age,
b) makes a child '''under 14 years''' of age perform acts corresponding to sexual activity on himself/herself, or
c) performs an aggravated sexual act with a child '''under 14 years''' of age.''" §300 and §301 of the same penal code, sets minimum penalty, of any person who engages in sexual acts with children '''under 14 years''', to 3 year of imprisonment, and up to 21 years.

If the child is '''between 14 and 16 years''', § 302, reads:
"''Any person who engages in sexual activity with a child between '''14 and 16 years''' of age shall be subject to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six years, unless the conduct also falls within the scope of other provisions. The same penalty shall be applied to any person who makes a child between '''14 and 16 years''' of age perform acts corresponding to sexual activity on himself/herself.''"

According to Chapter 1, § 5, of the penal code, §299-306 applies also if the act was committed outside Norway and by a non-Norwegian citizen or resident.

Even though one may be found guilty of violating the age of consent code, if those involved are "about equal as regards age and development", the court can exercise its own discretion to suspend passing a sentence.

===History===
Sexual relations between two women was never explicitly criminalized, but have been prosecuted under the general indecency law of the Civil Penal Code of 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apollon Postboks 1076 Blindern |url=http://www.apollon.uio.no/bokanmeldelser/2000/homoseksualitet.html |title=Homoseksualitet mellom fortielse og straff |language=no |publisher=Apollon |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 a Norwegian ministry of justice white paper recommended de-criminalization of homosexual acts in the 1903 Civil Penal Code §213, but this was rejected by the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget). The ban on sex between men, which also outlawed cohabitation&lt;ref&gt;[[:no:Konkubinatparagrafen]] {{Better source|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sex with animals, was repealed in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-023.html#196/00_Norway_Penal%20Code.asp |title=Lovdata - Sender deg til riktig side |publisher=Lovdata.no |date=1902-05-22 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ub.uio.no/ujur/ulovdata/lov-19020522-010-eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Quotations taken from the Ministry of Justice's (unofficial translation), though updated with current (September 2012) changes in the code |publisher=Ub.uio.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[bestiality]] having been recriminalized in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Ministry-of-Agriculture-and-Food/Nyheter-og-pressemeldinger/nyheter/2009/new-animal-welfare-act-.html?id=562543 |title=New Animal Welfare Act |work=regjeringen.no |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

"''Article 200. § 1. Whoever subjects a minor '''under 15 years''' of age to sexual intercourse or makes him/her submit to another sexual act or to perform such an act shall be subject to the penalty of the deprivation of liberty for a term of between 2 and 12 years.''" &lt;br&gt;

===History===
Poland never imposed laws against homosexuality. However, in 1876 homosexuality was criminalised by the laws of occupying countries (see [[Partitions of Poland]]). In 1932 the first Polish Criminal Code after regaining independence was introduced, making the age of consent of 15 for all sexual acts, regardless of [[sexual orientation]].

==Portugal==
Since September 2007, the age of consent laws of Portugal states '''14''', regardless of sexual behaviour, gender or sexual orientation, as a result of the constitutional court of Portugal ruling on constitutional protection that explicitly includes "[[sexual orientation]]", formally into the Constitution of Portugal back in 2004. Since September 2007, the age of consent was formally equalised as part of the Penal Code of September 2007. Although the age of consent is stipulated at 14 in Portugal, the legality of sexual acts with a ''minor between 14 and 16'' is open to legal interpretation since the law states that it is illegal to perform a sexual act with an adolescent between 14 and 16 years old "by taking advantage of their inexperience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/aofconsent.htm |title=Worldwide Ages of Consent |publisher=Avert.org |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Homosexual acts were legalised for the first time in Portugal in 1852, with an equal age of consent at that time - although homosexuality was again re-criminalised in 1912. They were decriminalised a second time in 1982 and an age of consent was set at 16, in line with heterosexual activities. In 1995, a new Penal Code was introduced with "different circumstances" for different sexual behaviours. Since September 2007, the age of consent, regardless of sexual behaviour, gender or sexual orientation, is '''14''' {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.

==Romania==
The new Romanian Criminal Code,&lt;ref name="avocatura.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avocatura.com/ll491-noul-cod-penal.html |title=Noul Cod Penal (2014) |language=ro |publisher=Avocatura.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came into force on 1 February 2014, sets a general age of consent of '''15'''. However, sexual acts that do not include penetration may be performed from age 13. There is also a close-in-age exemption: the sexual acts are not punished if the age difference between the partners is less than 3 years.

The law sets several other restrictions in regard to children under 13: it is illegal for an adult to perform sexual acts in view of such a child; to show pornographic materials to such a child or to induce the child to view [[sex show]]s; or to solicit such a child to meet for sexual acts (such as on-line solicitation).

In addition, it is illegal for an adult to engage in acts of sexual penetration with an adolescent under 18, if the adult abuses the authority or influence they have over the minor in order to gain the sexual access.

The relevant articles of the Criminal Code are Art. 220, Art. 221 and Art. 222. All these laws are gender neutral and apply regardless of the sexual orientation of those involved.&lt;ref name="avocatura.com"/&gt;

===History===
For a very long time, the age of consent in Romania was 14. The Penal Code of 1864, which followed shortly after the [[United Principalities|union of the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia]], and was in force between 1865 and 1936, set an age of consent of 14. Under this code, Article 263 read: "Any assault against decency, whether completed or attempted, ''without violence'', upon the person of a child, either male or female, aged ''less than 14 years'', shall be punished with imprisonment between two and three years." Article 264 defined "assault against decency with violence", the equivalent of the nowadays crime of [[rape]] (although the term "rape" was not used in that code), and stipulated that the maximum penalty should be given if the victim was under 15 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lege5.ro/Gratuit/g42tamju/codul-penal-din-1864|title=Codul Penal din 1864|first=Indaco|last=Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, a new criminal code came into force. Article 421 read: "The man who has sexual intercourse with a girl under 14 years of age commits the offense of assault against decency without violence, and is punishable by imprisonment between one and three years." However, if aggravated factors existed (such as pregnancy, a sexually transmitted disease, or committed by a person with a specific relation to the victim, or by several persons) the punishment was increased. With regard to rape (article 419) the victim being under 14 constituted an aggravating factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lege5.ro/Gratuit/heztqnzu/codul-penal-din-1936|title=Codul Penal din 1936|first=Indaco|last=Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the installation of the communist regime, the code was modified several time, and, in 1969, a new penal code came into effect. Nevertheless, the age of consent of 14 was maintained. Article 198 of the 1969 code read: "Sexual intercourse with a female person who has not attained the age of 14 is punishable by imprisonment of one to five years." In a case of rape, similarly with the previous code, the victim being under 14 constituted an aggravating factor (Article 197).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lege5.ro/Gratuit/he2demzw/codul-penal-din-1968|title=Codul Penal din 1968|first=Indaco|last=Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1990s and the early 21st century saw major modifications to the criminal code, in an effort to modify what was seen as outdated provisions, especially as Romania prepared to enter the EU. As such, homosexuality was decriminalized, the text of several criminal offences was modified by making it gender-neutral, the age of consent was lifted to 15 (applicable to both girls and boys), punishments for several sexual crimes were increased, and the stipulation that a rapist could avoid punishment after rape if he married his victim was abolished. Changes were made through Law no. 140/1996, Law No. 197/2000, Emergency Ordinance no. 89/2001, and Emergency Ordinance no. 143/2002. Nevertheless, the rapid adoption of numerous laws led to poorly drafted and contradictory texts, which have caused difficulty among the jurisprudence and doctrine, and several cases ended to the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice]] in order to clarify the interpretation of the law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Finally, a new criminal code entered into force on 1 February 2014.

==Russia==
The age of consent in Russia is '''16'''. The age of consent changed several times in Russian history: the ''Criminal Code of [[RSFSR]]'' (Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic) stated "sexual maturity" as the age of consent;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1103 |title=Soviet Medicine: Culture, Practice, and Science &amp;#124; Reviews in History |publisher=History.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk136-e.html |title=Criminal Code of the RSFSR (1934), Articles 136-161 |publisher=Cyberussr.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=Nx0gnXpMbnsC |page=14 }} |title=Soviet Criminal Law and Procedure: The RSFSR Codes - Russian S.F.S.R. |publisher= |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the ''[[Criminal Code of Russia]]'' was adopted in 1996, the age of consent was proclaimed to be the same regardless of [[sexual orientation]] and was set to 16 years old;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/?req=doc;base=LAW;n=18831;p=5#p1073 |title="Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации" от 13.06.1996 N 63-ФЗ (ред. от 27.05.1998) |publisher=Consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 it was lowered to 14 years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/?req=doc;base=LAW;n=45566#p29 |title=Федеральный закон от 25.06.1998 N 92-ФЗ (ред. от 08.12.2003) "О внесении изменений и дополнений в Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации" |publisher=Consultant.ru |date=25 June 1998 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2003 it was returned again to '''16''' years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/?req=doc;base=LAW;n=57610;p=1#p243 |title=Федеральный закон от 08.12.2003 N 162-ФЗ (ред. от 05.01.2006) "О внесении изменений и дополнений в Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации" |publisher=Consultant.ru |date=13 June 1996 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is '''the current age of consent in Russia'''). Law of early 2012 tightened the consent laws in Articles 134 and 135 considerably. However, only a person over 18 can be charged. Charges are relatively low (up to 4 years of prison) - regardless of gender - and "obscene actions" have even less charges. If the victim is not understanding the nature and consequences of the act (due to their age being under 12 or mental abilities), it will be considered rape and charged much more severely (up to 15 years of prison, or up to 20 if the victim is under 14).

==Serbia==
The age of consent in Serbia is '''14''', regardless of sexual orientation or gender. This is regulated by Chapter 18 (Sexual Offences) of the [[Penal Code]] of the Republic of Serbia and especially Article 180 (prohibiting sexual intercourse with a child). Article 112 defines a child as a person under 14 years of age.
Article 181 prohibits sexual intercourse with a juvenile (defined in Article 112 as a person under 18) if the juvenile is entrusted for learning, tutoring, guardianship or care. Article 190 furthermore forbids cohabitation with a minor (person under 18) unless a marriage is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/901/file/576c23dc41967e427086bf4c2b45.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613061222/http://legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/901/file/576c23dc41967e427086bf4c2b45.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-13 |format=PDF |title=Serbian Criminal Code in English (translated by the OSCE mission to Serbia in February 2006) |publisher=Legislationline.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
From 1977 to 1994, sexual acts between men of any age was a criminal offence in Serbia, although the law has never been applied. Then in 1994, the age of consent was 18 just for anal sex between males; ''any male performing anal sexual conduct with another male, is punishable by up to 1 year in prison'', 16 for all other sexual conduct. Since 2006, an equal age of consent came into force, regardless of sexual orientation or gender - This is regulated by the section 110 of the Penal Code of the Republic of Serbia stating that "lewd acts" between a male adult and a male under the age of 16 is punishable by imprisonment from 1 to 8 years. There is no specific reference to "lewd acts" between two females of the same offence.

The province of [[Vojvodina]], a northern province of Serbia, had decriminalized [[homosexuality]] in 1978{{Citation needed|reason=this is bold statement, any proof is needed|date=April 2016}}, thus effectively making an equal age of consent for any sexual practice regardless of sex or gender. This lasted until Vojvodina lost its law-making power in 1990.

==Slovak Republic==
The age limit of sexual acts in Slovakia is '''15''', as specified by the Slovak Criminal Code, Section 201.

''§ 201 Sexual abuse
''1. Any person, who has sexual intercourse with a person '''less than fifteen years'''
''of age or who subjects such person to other sexual abuse, shall be liable to a

===History===
The history before 1993 within Czechoslovakia is commons with the Czech Republic. Until 1961, homosexual acts were prohibited, however the Criminal Code of that year decriminalised such behaviour partially. However, under Paragraph 244, the age limit of restriction for homosexual acts was set at 18, besides the general limit 15 years. In 1990, the whole Paragraph 244 was repealed and the age limit became 15 for all.

==Slovenia==
The age of consent in Slovenia is '''15''', as specified by the Slovenian Penal Code, Article 173, Section 1, which reads: "''(1) Whoever has sexual intercourse or performs any lewd act with a person of the same or opposite sex '''under the age of fifteen (15) years''' where there is a marked discrepancy between the maturity of the perpetrator and that of the victim shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than six (6) months and not more than five (5) years.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010927175825/http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaSlovenia.asp Interpol - National Laws - Slovenia] interpol.int&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Until 1959, male homosexual acts were prohibited, as was the case in all of former Yugoslavia. A new Penal Code was introduced in 1977, which decriminalised homosexual acts and all discriminatory provisions were removed. In 1995, the age of consent was set at 14 for all acts. In 1999, the code was amended to raise the age of consent to 15 years and added the condition for "''a marked discrepancy between the maturity of the perpetrator and that of the victim'".

==Spain==
The age of consent in Spain is '''16''', under a new law which came into effect on 1 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/03/31/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-3439.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730054950/http://boe.es/boe/dias/2015/03/31/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-3439.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="radiointereconomia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiointereconomia.com/2015/07/01/las-20-claves-del-nuevo-codigo-penal/|title=Las 20 claves del nuevo Código Penal|date=1 July 2015|publisher=|access-date=25 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025235807/http://radiointereconomia.com/2015/07/01/las-20-claves-del-nuevo-codigo-penal/|archive-date=25 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish Criminal Code Article 183:

''(1). El que realizare actos de carácter sexual con un menor de dieciséis años, será castigado como responsable de abuso sexual a un menor con la pena de prisión de dos a seis años.''

:Translation: Whoever performs sexual acts with a minor '''under sixteen years''', shall be punished for sexual abuse of a minor with imprisonment of two to six years.

''(3). Cuando el ataque consista en acceso carnal por vía vaginal, anal o bucal, o introducción de miembros corporales u objetos por alguna de las dos primeras vías, el responsable será castigado con la pena de prisión de ocho a doce años, en el caso del apartado 1...''

There is a close-in-age exemption: ''El consentimiento libre del menor de dieciséis años excluirá la responsabilidad penal por los delitos previstos en este Capítulo, cuando el autor sea una persona próxima al menor por edad y grado de desarrollo o madurez''

:Translation: The free consent of the minor under sixteen excludes criminal responsibility for crimes under this chapter, if the perpetrator is a person close in age and level of development or maturity to that minor.

The age of consent rises to 18 if there is deception or abuse of a recognized position of trust, authority or influence over the minor.

Spanish Criminal Code Article 182:

''(1). El que, interviniendo engaño o abusando de una posición reconocida de confianza, autoridad o influencia sobre la víctima, realice actos de carácter sexual con persona mayor de dieciséis años y menor de dieciocho, será castigado con la pena de prisión de uno a tres años.''

:Translation: Whoever performs sexual acts with a person '''over sixteen and under eighteen''' by deception or abuse of a recognized position of trust, authority or influence, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to three years.

===History===
Historically, the age of consent was usually twelve in the Christian kingdoms of [[Iberia]]. A new Penal Code was introduced in Spain in 1995 which specified an age of consent of 12 for all sexual acts, but this was raised to 13 in 1999 and to 16 in 2015.&lt;ref name="radiointereconomia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/videos-espana/20150630/entra-vigor-llamada-mordaza-4330498762001.html|title=Entra en vigor la llamada ley mordaza|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-sex sexual acts were lawful in Spain from 1822 to 1954, with the exception of the offence of "unusual or outrageous indecent acts with same-sex persons" between the years 1928 and 1932. However, some homosexuals were arrested in the days of the Second Spanish Republic under the "Ley de Vagos y Maleantes" (Vagrants and Common Delinquents Law). Homosexual acts were made unlawful during [[Francisco Franco]]'s time in power, first by an amendment to the "Ley de Vagos y Maleantes" in 1954, and later by the "Ley de Peligrosidad y Rehabilitación Social " (Social on Danger and Social Rehabilitation) in 1970. In 1979 [[Adolfo Suarez]]'s government reversed the prohibition of homosexual acts in that law.

==Sweden==
The age of consent in Sweden is '''15''', as specified by the Swedish Penal Code, Chapter 6 (On Sexual Crimes). The age of fifteen is referred to several times, for example in Section 4, which reads: "''A person who has sexual intercourse with a child under fifteen years of age or who with such a child carries out another sexual act that, having regard to the nature of the violation and the circumstances in general, is comparable to sexual intercourse, shall be sentenced for rape of a child to imprisonment for at least two and at most six years.''"

There is a ''position of trust'' rule in which the age of consent is raised to 18. The section mentioned above continues:"''The same applies to the person who carries out an act referred to in the first paragraph to a child more than fifteen years of age but less than eighteen years of age and who is offspring to the perpetrator or in the perpetrator's care or in a similar relationship to the perpetrator, or for whose care or guardianship the perpetrator is responsible due to the decision of a government agency.''"

It is not legal to have sexual intercourse with related adults either, but the sentences for that (up to two years) are considerably milder than those for rape of a child (two to six years, four to ten years if aggravated).

There is also a ''close in age exception'' (Chapter 6, Section 14) "''...not sentenced if it is obvious that the act is no violation of the child considered the small difference in age between the person who carries out the act and the child and other circumstances.''" In a verdict of 30 March 2007, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] found that a 17-year-old boy had not committed a criminal act by having sexual intercourse with a girl 14 years and 7 months old. (Case B 415-07)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.government.se/contentassets/5315d27076c942019828d6c36521696e/swedish-penal-code.pdf Swedish penal code] sweden.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish age of consent also applies if the act takes place outside Sweden but the elder person later goes to Sweden. The elder person doesn't have to be a Swedish citizen or resident, but could be a tourist on a temporary visit. This is regardless of the age of consent in the country where the act took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lagen.nu/1962:700#K2P2S4 |title=Brottsbalk (1962:700) (BrB) |publisher=Lagen.nu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lagen.nu/1962:700#K6P6S1 |title=Brottsbalk (1962:700) (BrB) |publisher=Lagen.nu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Homosexual acts, both between men and between women, were prohibited in Sweden since 1864, then in 1944 homosexual acts became legal - but with a higher age of consent of 18 (21 if the younger part was in a situation of dependency) than for heterosexual acts, which was always set at 15. The age of consent was finally equalized to 15 regardless of sexual orientation in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Criminally queer: Homosexuality and criminal law in Scandinavia, 1842–1999. Amsterdam: Aksant 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography laws were softened in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="thelocal.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20090121/17058|title=Swedish national library in child porn scandal|date=21 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 there was a review of previous laws governing pornography depicting children as part of the "child's rights to sexuality".&lt;ref name="thelocal.se"/&gt; From 1971 to 1980 it was legal to buy, sell, and possess child pornography that featured children as young as 10 or 11.&lt;ref name="thelocal.se"/&gt;

==Switzerland==
The age of consent in Switzerland is '''16''', as specified by the Swiss Federal Criminal Code, Article 187(1). However, there exists a close-in-age exception if the difference between the ages of the participants is three years or less (Article 187(2)).

==Turkey==
The age of consent in [[Turkey]] is the age of majority (set at '''18''' as per Article 11 of the Turkish Civil Code).

According to Article 104 of the Turkish Penal Code (''Türk Ceza Kanunu''), sexual intercourse with minors aged 15, 16 and 17 can only be prosecuted upon a complaint. However, if the offender is a person who is forbidden to marry the child by law or is a person who is obliged to take care of the child due to adoption or foster care, then the prosecution doesn't require a complaint and the punishment is aggravated.&lt;ref name=turkishpenal&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish Penal Code|url=http://www.mevzuat.gov.tr/MevzuatMetin/1.5.5237.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Mevzuat.gov.tr.|accessdate=3 July 2014|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 103 regulates any kind of sexual activity with minors under 15 (or minors under 18 who lack the ability to understand the legal meanings and consequences of such actions) as [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=turkishpenal/&gt;

===History===
The [[Ottoman Empire]], a predecessor state to the Republic of [[Turkey]], decriminalized sodomy in 1858. The age of consent in Turkey was set at 15 for both heterosexual and homosexual sex in the 1926 penal code, but this was raised to 18 in 1953. The new penal code of 2004 also set the age of consent for both heterosexual and homosexual sex at 18, with some differences, such as the act of having sexual intercourse with a minor over 15 being punishable upon a complaint.

==Ukraine==
The age of consent in Ukraine appears to be '''16''', although it is not specifically set in any one statute.

Article 155 states that sexual intercourse with a sexually immature person shall be punishable. Immaturity is irrefutably presumed in those under 14 {Art. 120CC and court rulings}. Those under 14 are considered children in Ukrainian law, additionally those under 16 are considered minors (generally read from all articles and court rulings).

However, sexual acts with those under 16 that are considered debauchery can also be prosecuted under Article 156.

'''''Article 155''' – Sexual intercourse with a sexually immature person

''1. Sexual intercourse with a '''sexually immature person''','' ''–
''shall be punishable by restraint of liberty for a term up to three years or imprisonment for the same term.''''

The age of consent in [[England and Wales]] is '''16'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/advice/factfile_az/age_of_consent |title=Age of Consent according to BBC |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of sexual orientation or gender, as specified by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030042_en_2#pt1-pb5-l1g9 |title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 s. 9 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of law relating to sexual offences in the England and Wales is laid out in legislation under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, of which contains upwards of 140 sections, of which around 70 of those sections relate directly to sexual offences. The main sections of the act that relate to sexual offences regarding children are sections 5-15. The main 3 sections that relate to sexual activity with persons under 16 or under 13 are,

If the victim is at least 13, but under 16,

'''Section 1: Rape'''

"(1)A person (A) commits an offence if— (a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis, (b)B does not consent to the penetration, and (c)A does not reasonably believe that B consents. (2)Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents. (3)Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.

(4)A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life." &lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/contents|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the victim is under 13,

'''Section 5: Rape of a child under 13,'''

"(1)A person commits an offence if— (a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person with his penis, and (b)the other person is under 13.

(2)A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life." &lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"/&gt;

If the victim is under 16, and the offence does not meet the category of Section 1 "Rape",

'''Section 9: Sexual activity with a child,'''

"(1)A person aged 18 or over (A) commits an offence if— (a)he intentionally touches another person (B), (b)the touching is sexual, and (c)either— (i)B is under 16 and A does not reasonably believe that B is 16 or over, or (ii)B is under 13.

(2)A person guilty of an offence under this section, if the touching involved— (a)penetration of B’s anus or vagina with a part of A’s body or anything else, (b)penetration of B’s mouth with A’s penis, (c)penetration of A’s anus or vagina with a part of B’s body, or (d)penetration of A’s mouth with B’s penis, is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.

(3)Unless subsection (2) applies, a person guilty of an offence under this section is liable— (a)on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or both; (b)on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years." &lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"/&gt;

Any person who engages in sexual intercourse with a person under the age 16 could be prosecuted. However this therefore means that even sexual intercourse between willing people of a similar age (i.e. A 16 year old and a 15 year old) could result in the older person being liable for prosecution for committing a sexual offence. Because of this, when the Sexual Offences Act 2003 was created, separate sections of the act were put in place to be used on how to appropriately prosecute a person who had sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16, depending on exactly how young a person under the age of 16 was at time the sexual intercourse took place. This therefore maintained a "two-tier" cut off age system regarding sexual intercourse when it involved a person under the age of 16. Currently this depends on whether a younger person was ''Under 16'' or ''Under 13'' at the time of the sexual intercourse taking place, with the latter being automatically overall illegal, and the former still being illegal, but with defences due to the younger person's older age, more flexibility in sentencing and flexibility overall whether to prosecute or not based on individual case.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"/&gt;

The age of a younger person matters substantially as under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 any sexual intercourse or any type of sexual activity with a person under the age of 13 is strictly illegal, with rape, assault by penetration and incitement offences carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and other non-penetration offences carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years depending on case.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"/&gt; Where as if a younger person is aged between 13–15, the act does work more flexibly, as for example it is a reasonable defence by an older person to claim they thought a younger person aged 13–15 was aged 16 or over at the time, or for example that two teenagers over the age of 13 were in a relationship before any sexual intercourse took place. It is rare that prosecution would be brought against persons aged 13 or over engaging in sexual intercourse/activity willingly, as long as all persons involved were of similar age, and it did not involve other matters such as violence, abuse or blackmail.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"/&gt;

However, if person A is over the age of 18 and is in a [[position of trust]] to person B who is under the age of 18, it is illegal for A to engage in sexual activity with B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030042_en_2#pt1-pb6-l1g16 |title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 s. 16 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 47 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 makes it an offence to pay for or promise payment for sexual services of a person under 18 where the 'client' does not reasonably believe that person is over 18, or in any event for a person under 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/47 |title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 s. 47 |publisher=UKPGA |date= |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
{{see also|LGBT rights in the United Kingdom}}
{{anchor|UK history}} The age of consent for heterosexual acts in England was set at 12 in 1275 during the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. The wording was along the lines of{{vague|date=September 2015}} "It shall be deemed illegal to ravage a maiden who is not of age" - at the time "of age" being 12. Therefore, there was technically no age of consent for the male participant. The English law became applicable in Wales following the Laws in Wales Acts (1536 and 1543). In [[Welsh law|medieval Welsh law]] there was no actual equivalent of the concept of the age of consent as such, but a girl was marriageable at 12–14 (the onset of puberty) and a fine was payable for the taking of a girl's maidenhood by force; the rules varied according to status and may not have been applied rigidly to [[commoner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dafydd Jenkins and Morfydd E. Owen (eds.), ''The Welsh Law of Women'' (University of Wales Press, 1980), pp. 48, 71, ''et seq.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concern that young girls were being sold into brothels led Parliament to raise the age of consent to 13 in 1875 under the [[Offences against the Person Act 1875]]. After [[W. T. Stead]]'s [[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon|''Maiden Tribute'']] articles, the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] raised the age of consent to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} Child prostitutes: How the age of consent was raised to 16 - BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Anal intercourse, both male-male and male-female, had been illegal and punishable by death since the [[Buggery Act 1533]]. In 1861, parliament passed the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], which abolished the death penalty for anal intercourse. The [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] extended buggery laws to outlaw any kind of sexual activity between males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/the-legacy-of-1885-girls-and-the-age-of-sexual-consent|title=The legacy of 1885: girls and the age of sexual consent|last=Bates|first=Victoria|date=8 September 2015|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common [[folklore]] that an amendment that would have criminalised lesbian acts was rejected by Queen Victoria because she refused to believe that some women did such things; but it is likelier that those presenting the amendment excluded it (as did the [[House of Lords]] 40 years later) on the assumption that it would give women ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House of Commons Research Paper 99/4 21 January 1999: The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill: ‘Age of consent’ and abuse of a position of trust (Bill 10 of 1998–99) |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-004.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Parliament.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127194954/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-004.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male homosexual acts were decriminalised under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], Section 1, although the age of consent for such acts was set at 21, whereas the age of consent for heterosexual acts was 16. However, this particular legislation applied only in England and Wales.

In 1994, on the second reading of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] [[Edwina Currie]] introduced an amendment to lower the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16, in line with that for heterosexual acts; the amendment was defeated by 308 votes to 280. A compromise amendment that lowered the age of consent to 18 was accepted by 427 votes to 162. Also during the readings were motions to equalise the age of consent to 17 for all, to maintain the age of consent for homosexual acts to 21, and a further attempt to lower the age of consent to 16, all of which were rejected.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

In 1997, the European Court of Human Rights case of ''Sutherland'' v ''the United Kingdom'' held that a higher age of consent for homosexuals than for heterosexuals was a breach of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention. In response, the Government introduced the Crime and Disorder Bill that contained a provision lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16. Though accepted by the House of Commons, the provision was rejected by the House of Lords. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, introduced in 1998, contained a similar provision, but once again it was rejected by the House of Lords. The Bill was reintroduced in 2000 and, despite opposition from the House of Lords, was passed under the [[Parliament Act 1911]] (which allows the House of Commons to overrule the House of Lords under certain circumstances). As the Scottish Parliament had been established prior to the reintroduction of the Bill, and the relevant legislation was a devolved issue, the consent of that Parliament under the [[Legislative Consent Motion|Sewel Convention]] was required – had that consent not been granted, the Scottish provisions would have had to be removed and it would not have been possible to use the Parliament Act.

The [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]], became law in January 2001 throughout the UK, and thus equalized, regardless of gender, the age of consent at '''16''' for both heterosexual and homosexual acts (including, for the first time, lesbian acts), except those taking place between a 16–17 year old and someone "in a position of trust" (e.g. a teacher), where the age of consent was raised to 18.

The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] officially ended the concept of [[buggery]] in British law, as technically, heterosexual anal intercourse had still been illegal until the passing of this law. The passing of this law meant that there was no legal difference made between vaginal and anal intercourse, as well as sexual touching and newly added oral penetration and penetration by other body parts than penis or anything else. The Act also raised the legal age for pornography and prostitution from 16 to 18.

There have been various suggestions to lower the age of consent to 14 – in 1998 the New Labour government proposed this, but despite some Left wing and Youth support this had been dropped by early 2003 as lacking support, a decade later in early 2013 the suggestion by civil servants to lower the age of consent to 14 was rejected by the Conservative led coalition as ''offensive'' (at least under some circumstances) and attention was drawn to the impact of recent scandals on the reception to any proposals.

If the child is 13–15 inclusive and the other person concerned reasonably believed that she (usually she) was 16 or more no offence is committed. In practice this discourages prosecution where that defence might successfully be run. If a young woman, for example, goes willingly into a pub (saloon) where nobody under 18 can lawfully go the prosecuting authorities will probably decide that the defendant will readily be believed if he says he thought she was 18, let alone 16 or up.

===Scotland===
Since 1 December 2010, the age of consent in [[Scotland]] is '''16''', regardless of [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Sex-crimes-law--.5463821.jp | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman | title=Sex crimes law gets go-ahead | date=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2009/07/16/royal-assent-for-sexual-offences-bill |title=Royal Assent for Sexual Offences Bill |publisher=The Information Daily.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517213011/http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2009/07/16/royal-assent-for-sexual-offences-bill |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that date, it was 16 for girls (under a statutory offence)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/39/section/5 |title=Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 for boys (the common law age of [[puberty]]). However, consensual sex with a girl aged between 13 and 16 is not [[rape]], but a lesser offence; on 1 December 2010 this has been given the specific name of "having intercourse with an older child". Aged between 13 and 16 does not include 16, however.

====History====
Male homosexual acts were illegal in Scotland until 1980 when they were decriminalised by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, Section 80, which specified an age of consent of 21. The [[Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995]] lowered the age of consent to 18 and this was further lowered to 16 by the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 described above. [[Male rape]] was recognised along with a complete overhaul of sexual offences legislation under the '''[[Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009]]''' (in force from 1 December 2010, except for sections 52 and 53).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2010/357/pdfs/ssi_20100357_en.pdf Scottish Statutory Instruments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184228/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2010/357/pdfs/ssi_20100357_en.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} legislation.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of consent in [[Northern Ireland]] is '''16''', regardless of sexual orientation or gender, as specified by the [[Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/ukdsi_9780110800936_en_1 |title=The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2013-09-02 |accessdate=2014-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216064745/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/ukdsi_9780110800936_en_1 |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason the age of consent was lowered from 17 to 16 in 2008 with the Order was to bring it in line with the rest of the UK; Criminal Justice Minister [[Paul Goggins]] said there was no compelling reason for the age to be different in Northern Ireland than elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7104052.stm | work=BBC News | title=NI age of consent to be lowered | date=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Prior to 2008, the age of consent in Northern Ireland was always 17 for heterosexuals and lesbian sexual conduct.

Gay male sexual conduct was illegal in Northern Ireland until 1982, when they were decriminalised by the ''[[Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982]]'', which specified an age of consent of 21 – in line with the rest of the UK at the time. The change was a result of the judgement in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] case of [[Dudgeon v. United Kingdom|''Dudgeon'' v ''United Kingdom'' (1981)]] in which the ECHR held that a prohibition on homosexual acts was a breach of Article 8 of the Convention. The age of consent for gay male sexual conduct was lowered to 18 in 1994 when the ''[[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]'' was implemented (as to be in line with England and Wales). The age of consent in 2001 was then lowered to 17 for gay male sexual conduct - so that was in line with heterosexual and lesbian sexual conduct, by the ''[[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]]'', Section 1. Then in 2008, the Order mentioned above lowered the age of consent for all individuals to 16 so it was inline with the rest of the UK.

===Akrotiri and Dhekelia===

For both of these Sovereign Base Areas (British military enclaves) on the island of Cyprus, the age of consent is '''16'''.

===Gibraltar===
Since 2011, the [[age of consent]] is equal and [[gender-neutral]] at '''16''' in [[Gibraltar]] (a [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]]). The gender-neutral ''Crimes Bill 2011'' passed the [[Gibraltar Parliament]] and got [[Royal Assent|assented]] - implementing the 2011 Supreme Court of Gibraltar decision and by repealing and updating 140-year-old criminal laws of Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="chronicle.gi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=22526 |title=Gibraltar Chronicle - The Independent Daily First Published 1801 |publisher=Chronicle.gi |date=20 August 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103130416/http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=22526 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Male homosexual acts have been decriminalised in [[Gibraltar]] since 1993, where the age of consent was higher at 18 for gay men, 16 for lesbians and heterosexuals. Anal sex was illegal for heterosexuals regardless. An equal age of consent set at 16 and legalising heterosexual anal sex happened because of a Supreme Court decision in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21474 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327061200/http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21474 |date=27 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2011, the gender-neutral ''Crimes Act 2011'' implemented an equal and gender-neutral age of consent of 16 and legalised anal sex for heterosexuals - reflecting the Supreme Court of Gibraltar's decision and by repealing and updating 140-year-old criminal laws of Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="chronicle.gi"/&gt;

==Vatican City==
Law No. VIII of 11 July 2013, entitled "Supplementary Laws on Criminal Law Matters" establishes the present law for the State of Vatican City regarding criminal penalties for sexual acts with minors. Article 4 of Law No. VIII defines "minor" for the purposes of that law to mean "every human being below the age of eighteen years." Article 8, paragraphs 1 through 4, establish criminal penalties for anyone who engages in sexual acts with a person below the age of 18. Paragraph 5 of Article 8 provides an exception to this by stating that "the offence does not exist if the sexual acts take place within a marriage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/Law%20N.%20VIII%20-%20Supplementary%20Norms%20on%20Criminal%20Law.pdf LAW N. VIII: SUPPLEMENTARY NORMS ON CRIMINAL LAW MATTERS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805202456/http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/Law%20N.%20VIII%20-%20Supplementary%20Norms%20on%20Criminal%20Law.pdf |date=5 August 2016 }} vaticanstate.va&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 1083 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] states that "A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age and a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age cannot enter into a valid marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Y.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the context of this article, the age of consent in Vatican City may be considered 14 for married females who are having sexual relations with their husbands only, 16 for married males having relations with their wives only, but 18 for everyone else, whether married or not.

It should also be noted that the "Law of the Source of Law" of the Vatican State requires that any local laws must first defer to divine law, to Papal decrees, and to canon law. As the Vatican understands divine law, even if not sanctioned with criminal penalties by the state, all sex outside of marriage is illicit regardless of the age or willingness of those who engage in it.

When the Vatican City was first formed, it adopted the then-Italian age of consent of 12 as per the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929. Until July 2013 it had the lowest age of consent in Europe, but after that month, when the Pope made his decree, it became the highest.&lt;ref name=ODwyer/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">'''Al-Mansur Yahya''' (died 976) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]], whose tenure as imam is counted from 934 to 976.

Yahya bin Ahmad was the fifth son of the imam [[An-Nasir Ahmad (Zaidi imam)|an-Nasir Ahmad]], and the grandson of the founder-imam [[al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya]]. Even before the death of an-Nasir in 934, three of his sons quarreled bitterly among themselves. Although the Zaidi imamship was not strictly hereditary but depended on personal qualifications and descent from [[Muhammad]], succession tended to take place within particular families descended from al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860) and his grandson [[al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya]] (d. 911). Two sons of an-Nasir, [[al-Muntakhab al-Hasan]] (d. 936) and [[al-Mukhtar al-Qasim]] (d. 956), contested the dignity.&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 1216.&lt;/ref&gt; None of them is recognized as a right imam in later Zaidi chronicles. Their younger brother al-Mansur Yahya is, on the other hand, counted as imam from 934 to his death in 976. The internal dissension among the [[Zaydiyyah]] was accentuated by the behaviour of the tribal groups of the northern Yemeni highlands, which supported one side or the other according to their interests. Few details are otherwise known about al-Mansur Yahya, and the politics of highland Yemen were dominated by the rival [[Yufirids|Yu'firid Dynasty]]. Personally he was remembered as a man of learning who conveyed much of the religious tradition of his father and grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Wilferd Madelung, ''Der Imam al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim und die Glaubeslehre der Zaiditen''. Berlin 1965, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; At his demise, the imam was succeeded by his son [[ad-Da'i Yusuf]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Stookey, ''Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic''. Boulder 1978, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3872">{{unreferenced|date=May 2017}}The '''Amazigh''' (Berber) '''cuisine''' is a traditional cuisine with a varied history and influence of numerous flavours from distinct regions across North Africa. The traditional cuisine draws influences from Morocco's Atlas mountains and heavily populated Berber cities and regions, as well as Algeria's Berber cities and regions.

[[Berber people|Berber]] cuisine differs from one area to another within [[North Africa]]. For this reason, every dish has a distinct and unique identity according to the specific region it originates from in North Africa, with some dishes estimated to be more than a thousand years old. Zayanes of the region of [[Khénifra]] around the [[Middle Atlas]] have a cuisine of a remarkable simplicity. It is based primarily on corn, barley, ewe's milk, goat cheese, butter, honey, meat, and game. Popular authentic Berber preparations of [[Tunisian cuisine|Tunisian]], [[Morocco|Moroccan]], [[Algerian cuisine|Algerian]],  and [[Libyan]] cuisine include [[tajine]], [[couscous]], [[shakshouka]], [[pastilla]], [[msemen]], [[merguez]], [[asida]], [[lablabi]], [[harissa]], [[makroudh]], [[harira]], [[sfenj]], and [[ahriche]].

==Foods and dishes==

[[File:Couscous-1.jpg|thumb|[[Couscous]] with vegetables]]
[[File:Tajine 014.JPG|thumb|''[[Tajine]]'' with carrots]]

Berber foods and dishes include:

* [[Baghrir]], a Semolina pancake
* ''Bouchiar'' (fine [[wafer]] without yeast soaked with butter and natural [[honey]])
* ''Bourjeje'' ([[pancake]] made containing flour, eggs, yeast and salt)
* [[Bread]] made with traditional [[yeast]]
* [[Couscous]], a [[dish (food)|dish]] enjoyed worldwide
* [[Chakhchoukha]], a [[Chaoui]] dish made of flatbread eaten on occasions
* ''Mechoui'' or lamb [[barbecue]] - a whole [[sheep]] [[roast]]ed in artisanal [[oven]]s designed especially for this use. The sheep is coated with natural [[butter]], which makes it tastier. This dish is mainly designed to be served at festivities.
* [[Merguez]], a spicy sausage often made with lamb
* '' Mamita '' A pan full with different kinds of vegetables, meat and a lot of spices.
* ''[[Pastilla]]'' – ([[Berber language|Berber]]: ''besṭila'')
* ''[[Tajine]]'', a very diversified dish, made in various forms:
**''Tajine'' with [[chicken]], [[lemon]] and [[olive]]s
**''Tajine'' with [[tuna]]
**''Tajine'' with [[sardine]]s
**''Tajine'' with [[lamb and mutton|lamb meat]] and [[caramel]]ized [[plum]]
**''Tajine'' with [[plum]]s
**''Tajine'' with [[legume]]s and [[endive]]s
**''Tajine'' with [[domestic turkey|turkey]] and [[potato]]es
* ''Tahricht'' (containing [[offal]]: brain, tripe, lung, heart; these ingredients are rolled up with the intestines on a stick of oak and cooked on embers)

Although they are the original inhabitants of North Africa, Berbers lived in very contained communities, in spite of various incursions by [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine]]s, [[Arab]]s, [[Ottomans]] and [[France|French]]. Having been subject to limited external influences, these populations lived free from factors making for [[acculturation]].

[[Couscous]] and ''tajine'' are the principal dishes for special feasts and celebrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">The '''British Show Horse Association''' (BSHA) is the governing body for the showing and registering of [[show hack|hacks]], [[Cob (horse)|cobs]] and [[Riding Horse|riding horses]].

==Aims and Objectives==
The aims of the association are to improve the standard of horses shown under their rules, to encourage the breeding of excellent horses, to encourage shows to affiliate to the association, and to safeguard the interests of its members.  The association runs an examination and probationary scheme for new judges, and has a Panel of qualified judges, as well as holding a register of members and their equines.

==History==
The Association, known then as the British Show Hack and Cob Association, was founded in 1935 by owners of show hacks and show cobs, to provide an umbrella body which could oversee the breeding, showing and judging of these animals. Riding horses came under the remit of the Association in 1983, at which time it became known as the British Show Hack, Cob and Riding Horse Association, or BSHC&amp;RHA.  As the BSHA, it is now the governing body of showing for hacks, cobs, riding horses, and their youngstock.

==Competitions==
Affiliated competitions are run under the Association's rules for hacks, cobs, riding horses under saddle, and for broodmares and youngstock in-hand. Championships are held in various areas of the country, including the most prestigious at the Horse of the Year Show.

'''Buratino''' (Russian: Буратино) is the main character of the book ''The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino'' (1936) by [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]], which is based on the 1883 novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' by [[Carlo Collodi]]. Buratino originated as a character in the [[commedia dell'arte]]. The name Buratino is derived from the Italian ''[[burrattino|burattino]]'', which means wooden puppet or doll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reverso.net/italian-english/burattino Dictionary Translation of Burattino]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in 1936, and Buratino quickly became hugely popular among children in the [[Soviet Union]], and remains so to this day (In other words, Buratino is one of the most popular characters of [[Russian children's literature]]). The story has been made into several films, including [[The Adventures of Buratino (1959 film)|the animated 1959 film]] and [[The Adventures of Buratino (1975 film)|the live action 1975 film]] .

==Origin==
According to [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], he had read ''Pinocchio'' as a child, but, having lost the book, he started re-imagining it many years later in an attempt to come up with a series of bedside stories for his own children. The resulting story turned out to be so original and became so loved by the writer's children, that he decided to put it to paper and publish it.

==Plot==
Like [[Pinocchio]], Buratino is a long-nosed wooden puppet.  According to the story, he is carved by ''Papa Carlo'' (the story's version of Geppetto) from a log, and suddenly comes to life. Upon creation, Buratino comes out long-nosed due to Papa Carlo's sloppy woodworking. Papa Carlo tries to shorten it, but Buratino resists.

Papa Carlo then sells his only good jacket in order to buy [[textbooks]] for Buratino and sends him to school. However, the boy becomes distracted by an advertisement for a local puppet theater show, and sells his textbooks to buy a ticket to the show. There he befriends other puppets, but the evil puppetmaster ''Karabas Barabas'' (the story's Stromboli character) wants to destroy him because Buratino disrupted the show.

Karabas Barabas releases Buratino after he learns that Papa Carlo's home contains a secret door for which Karabas has been searching. A Golden Key that Karabas once possessed, but later lost, opens this secret door. Karabas releases Buratino and even gives him five gold coins, asking only that Buratino watch after his father's home and make sure they do not move.

The story proceeds to tell of Buratino and his friends' hunt for the Golden Key, and their struggle against the evil Karabas, his loyal friend Duremar, as well as a couple of crooks: Alice the [[Fox]] and Basilio the [[Cat]] (based on the [[Fox and Cat]]), who are after Buratino's coins. Many of Buratino's further adventures are, however, derived from Collodi's ''Pinocchio'', but are reworked to fit into Tolstoy's story.

==Deviations from Collodi's story==
{{unreferenced-section|date=December 2017}}
* The Fairy with the Turquoise Hair is in Tolstoy's version another puppet from Karabas's theatre, named Malvina. She retains the blue colour of her hair, her poodle servant (called Artemon in Tolstoy) and her function of saving Buratino from the fox and the cat who hanged him on a tree. To explain her presence in the forest, it is stated that she had escaped from the theatre earlier. She is represented as somewhat over-protective and less likable than Collodi's Fairy, yet finally befriends Buratino.
* The character of [[Pierrot]] is introduced. He is in love with Malvina. Pierrot is represented as an archetypal poet (his poems are actually cited).
* Tolstoy omits most details which in the 20th century would be considered too gruesome or too moralistic, such as: Pinocchio having burned his feet; black rabbits pretending to be about to bury him; the whole story of the Toyland; the shark swallowing Pinocchio and his father etc.
* Unlike Pinocchio in the original story, Buratino never shifts to right behaviour (however he is much kinder than Pinocchio) and does not become a real human. Quite the contrary, he is rewarded for not following the rules of what is assumed to be right behaviour (while he was never as cruel as Pinocchio) and being nonconformist. In the finale, we see him playing in a new puppet theatre of Carlo's.
* Buratino's nose does not grow when he lies.

==Characters==
*'''Buratino''' is a wooden puppet with a long nose.
* '''Papa Carlo''' ({{lang-ru|Папа Карло}}) is a [[barrel organ]] player of little means, who created Buratino.
* '''Giuseppe''' (Джузеппе), nicknamed "Giuseppe the Blue Nose" for always being drunk, is a [[woodworker]] and a friend of Carlo. He wanted to make a [[Table (furniture)|table]] leg from the talking log, but got scared and finally gave the log as a present to Papa Carlo.
* '''Karabas Barabas''' (Карабас-Барабас) is an evil puppeteer. He owns a [[puppet theater]] with lots of [[marionette]]s, including [[Malvina]], [[Pierrot]], and [[Harlequin]].
* '''Malvina''' (Мальвина) is a beautiful female puppet with blue hair.
* '''Artemon''' (Артемон) is Malvina's loyal [[poodle]].
* '''Pierrot''' (Пьеро) is a sad puppet and a [[poet]] who is deeply in love with Malvina.
* '''Harlequin''' (Арлекино) is Pierrot's scene partner in Karabas's theatre. He usually mocks and beats Pierrot.
* '''Alice the Fox''' (Лиса Алиса) and '''Basilio the Cat''' (Кот Базилио), two swindlers.
* '''Tortila the [[Turtle]]''' (Черепаха Тортила) gives the Golden Key to Buratino, the same key that was lost by Karabas.
* '''Duremar''' (Дуремар) is a partner of Karabas Barabas who catches leeches for a living and so disturbs Tortilla's pond.

==In popular culture==
The name Buratino has and continues to be used as branding for a variety of products and stores marketed to children in the ex-Soviet Union and Russia — most notable of these are the {{ill|Buratino (drink)|lt=Buratino|ru|Буратино (напиток)}} brand soft drink, of [[caramel]] taste and the "Golden Key" (''Zolotoy klyuchik'') [[toffee]].

[[File:ТОС-1А Буратино на репетиции парада 4.5.2010.jpg|thumb|[[TOS-1]]A Buratino]]
Buratino is also the nickname of the [[TOS-1]] multiple launch rocket system, due to the big "nose" of the launcher.

A location in the story, Поле чудес [в Стране́ Дурако́в], literally "The Field of Wonders [in the Land of Fools]", is used as the name of the [[Pole Chudes|Russian adaptation]] of the [[United States of America|American]] [[game show]] ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.

'''Caucasus Germans''' ({{lang-de|Kaukasiendeutsche}}) are part of the [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|German minority in Russia and the Soviet Union]]. They migrated to the [[Caucasus]] largely in the first half of the 19th century and settled in the [[North Caucasus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]] and the region of [[Kars]] (present-day northeastern [[Turkey]]). In 1941, the majority of them were subject to deportation to [[Central Asia]] and [[Siberia]] during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[population transfers in the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="polian"&gt;{{cite book|last=Polian|first=Pavel Markovich|authorlink=Pavel Polian|translator=Anna Yastrzhembska|title=[[Against Their Will (Polyan's book)|Against Their Will: The History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR]]|publisher=[[Central European University Press]]|place=Budapest|date=2004|isbn=9789639241688|pages=330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Stalin's death in 1953 and the beginning of the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], the Caucasus Germans were allowed to return, though few did.&lt;ref name="mukhina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mukhina|first=Irina|title=The Germans of the Soviet Union|publisher=Routledge|place=London|date=2007|isbn=9780415407311|pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many assimilated and, after 1991, emigrated to [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhina, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the community today is a fraction of what it once was, many German buildings and churches are still extant, with some turned into museums.

==History==
===Origins===
The victory of the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Catherine the Great]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774]] ensured its [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus|expansion into the Caucasus]]. It also created a need in populating these lands with [[Russians|Russian]] subjects in order to hasten their exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Mukhina, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century, the government permitted families of [[Volga Germans]] to settle in the [[Kuban]]. However, poor [[infrastructure]], lack of organization of the officials responsible for the settlement and the refusal of the military personnel to have these lands populated by non-Russians were an obstacle to steady and constant migration of the Germans. In 1815, while participating in the [[Congress of Vienna]], Russian [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] visited [[Stuttgart]], a city in his mother's native [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]. Upon witnessing the oppression that local peasants were undergoing either due to belonging to different non-Lutheran Protestant sects or to their participation in separatist movements, he arranged for their settlement in [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Russian Transcaucasia]] in order to form agricultural colonies.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Alex|title=The Caucasus Under Soviet Rule|publisher=Routledge|place=London|date=2010|isbn=9780415410120|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Katharinenfeld.jpg|thumb|300px|Katharinenfeld (now [[Bolnisi]], Georgia)]]

===Early 19th century===
On September 21, 1818, the first German settlement in Transcaucasia, Marienfeld, was established by a group of [[Swabia]]n Germans near the Georgian capital Tiflis ([[Tbilisi]]), along the [[Kakheti]] highway, now part of [[Sartichala]]. Two months later, another group of colonists founded another settlement in Georgia on the bank of the Asureti River and named it Elisabethtal, after the Emperor's wife [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Elizabeth Alexeievna]] (now Asureti in the Georgian province of [[Kvemo Kartli]]). Within the next year, five more colonies were established in eastern Georgia: New Tiflis (later Mikhailovsky Avenue, now part of [[David Agmashenebeli Avenue]] in Tbilisi), Alexandersdorf on the left bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]] (now the vicinity of Akaki Tsereteli Avenue in Tbilisi), Petersdorf (near Marienfeld, now part of Sartichala) and Katharinenfeld (now [[Bolnisi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikaberidze|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Mikaberidze|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|place=Lanham, Maryland|date=2015|edition=2nd|isbn=9781442241459|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more colonies were founded in [[Abkhazia]]: Neudorf, Gnadenberg and Lindau.

By the late 1840s, there were five German colonies in the [[North Caucasus]]. The migration waves (especially to the [[Don Host Oblast]]) grew beginning in the second half of the 19th century with the capitalist influence on farming in Russia. Germans would immigrate not only from the regions adjacent to the [[Volga River]] but also from the [[Black Sea Germans|Black Sea region]] and Germany. The majority of these Germans adhered to various branches of [[Protestantism]], most commonly [[Lutheranism]], [[Mennonitism]] and [[Baptism]]. [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] formed a minority and lived in six colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} ''The Arrival of Germans in the North Caucasus'' by Anzor Ostakhov. Previously available online at [https://web.archive.org/web/20071007201054/http://eiprd.ru/information/doc.php?id_a=61&amp;id_sec=6 Eirpd.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1818–1819, 194 Swabian families primarily from [[Reutlingen]] arrived in Elisabethpol ([[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]) in eastern Transcaucasia from Tiflis. They were granted land 6 kilometres to the west of the city and founded the town of Helenendorf ([[Goygol (city)|Goygol]]) in the summer of 1819. Another German settlement, the town of Annenfeld (later merged with the city of [[Şəmkir|Shamkir]]) was founded almost simultaneously 40 kilometres away from Helenendorf.

[[File:Friedrich Parrot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Baltic German explorer Friedrich Parrot visited Katharinenfeld and Elisabethtal during his expedition to Mount Ararat in 1829.]]
Germans became an active and well-integrated community in Russian Transcaucasia. Unlike the settlement of Russian religious minorities, German colonies were located in "places that were more economically advantageous, close to cities or important transportation routes."&lt;ref name="tsutsiev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsutsiev|first=Arthur|translator=Nora Seligman Favorov|title=Atlas of the Ethno-Political History of the Caucasus|year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=9780300153088|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became "typical for Caucasian administrative centers to have a satellite agrarian German colony."&lt;ref name="tsutsiev" /&gt; According to [[Charles King (professor of international affairs)|Charles King]], "rows of trees lined the main streets" of the German colonies near Tiflis. "Schools and churches, conducting their business in German, offered education and spiritual edification. Beer gardens provided the main entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles King (professor of international affairs)|title=The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195177756|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Transcaucasia, German colonists learned [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], while [[Russian language|Russian]] was formally taught in schools starting in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Zimmer (1901).

The [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] naturalist and explorer [[Friedrich Parrot]] encountered Swabian settlers near Tiflis on his expedition to [[Mount Ararat]] in 1829. He listed their settlements and personally visited Katharinenfeld and Elisabethtal, describing them:

{{Quote frame|text=These colonies may be known to be German at first sight from their style of building, their tillage, their carts and wagons, their furniture and utensils, mode of living, costume, and language. They contrast, therefore, strongly with the villages of the natives, and very much to their advantage, particularly in the eyes of one who has lived for some time, as was the case with us, wholly among the latter. [...] At last, after riding for five hours, I espied, high on the left bank of the river [i.e. the [[Khrami]]], symptoms not to be mistaken of the German colony: these were, regularly-built white houses, with good windows, doors, and ridge stone on the roof. I joyfully rode up, and found that this was Katharinenfeld.&lt;ref name="parrot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrot|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Parrot|translator=[[William Desborough Cooley]]|others=Introduction by Pietro A.

[[File:Tatar attack on Katherinenfeld on 14 August 1826..jpg|thumb|left|300px|Attack on [[Katharinenfeld|Katherinenfeld]] on 14 August 1826 during the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Russo-Persian War]]]]
The colonies suffered during the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|Russo-Persian War of 1826–28]]. Many of the settlements had been raided by marauding [[Kurds]] in 1826 who, according to Parrot, killed 30 people of Katharinenfeld's 85 families and captured 130 more. Half of those had not yet returned at the time of the naturalist's visit in 1829. While visiting the great bazaar in Erivan ([[Yerevan]]) with [[Khachatur Abovian]] (the [[Armenians|Armenian]] writer and national public figure), Parrot encountered "two Württemberg women, with five children" who "talked to one another in true [[Swabian German|Swabian dialect]]."&lt;ref name="parrot2"&gt;Parrot, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; They were from Katharinenfeld and Parrot resolved to tell their relatives back home about their location.&lt;ref name="parrot2" /&gt; When Parrot visited the village and told the colonists the news, he was very well received. The two women who he met in Erivan returned from comparably benign captivity with a "wealthy Tatar chief" where they had been pressured to convert to Islam. Parrot surmised that others might have been sold into [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slavery]] deeper into Turkish territory. Furthermore, he told of a case where a man received a letter from his wife who had married a Persian cleric in captivity and therefore allowed him to remarry.&lt;ref name="parrot" /&gt;

During his travels to the Caucasus during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]], the celebrated Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin|Aleksandr Pushkin]] visited one of the German colonies near Tiflis and recorded his experience in his ''[[A Journey to Arzrum|Journey to Arzrum]]''. He ate dinner there, but was unimpressed by the food and the beer. "We drank beer which is made there, with a very unpleasant taste, and paid very much for a very bad dinner," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Aleksandr|last=Pushkin|authorlink=Alexander Pushkin|translator=Birgitta Ingemanson|title=A Journey to Arzrum|location=Ann Arbor|publisher=Ardis|year=1974|isbn=9780882330679|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, during his visit to Russian Transcaucasia, German Baron [[August von Haxthausen]] also visited the German colonies of Georgia and the Tiflis region and extensively described their agricultural practices. He related an account from Moritz von Kotzebue about an unsuccessful religious pilgrimage of German colonists to [[Jerusalem]], led by a woman who "knew the whole Bible by heart, from beginning to end" and who "exercised a kind of magical influence on all around her."&lt;ref&gt;Haxthausen, pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels in the Caucasus, Haxthausen was accompanied by Peter Neu, a Swabian colonist from the Tiflis area who had "a remarkable genius for languages and knew a dozen European and Asiatic tongues,—German, [[French language|French]], Russian, [[Circassian language|Circassian]], Tatar, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], etc." In addition, he "possessed a rich gift of poetical imagination and had an inexhaustible treasury of ''märchen'', legends and popular songs, gleaned from all the countries he had visited."&lt;ref&gt;Haxthausen, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Neu accompanied Haxthausen, Khachatur Abovian and Abovian's uncle Harutiun on a visit to the [[Yazidis in Armenia|Yazidi community of Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Haxthausen, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Haxthausen, Abovian and Neu also visited the center of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] at [[Vagharshapat|Etchmiadzin]] and Neu accompanied Haxthausen on an excursion to the area of present-day [[South Ossetia]].&lt;ref&gt;Haxthausen, pp. 197 and 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Germanazerbaijanis.gif|thumb|200px|right|Germans from Helenendorf (present-day [[Goygol (city)|Goygol]], Azerbaijan) in the 19th–early 20th century]]

===Late imperial era===
Additional German colonies were established in eastern Transcaucasia during the latter half of the 19th century. Beginning in the 1880s six more German colonies were formed in the [[Elisabethpol Governorate]]: [[Çinarlı, Shamkir|Georgsfeld]] in 1888, [[Alekseyevka, Agstafa|Alexejewka]] in 1902, [[Həsənsu|Grünfeld]] and [[İrmaşlı|Eichenfeld]] in 1906, [[Tovuz, Azerbaijan|Traubenfeld]] in 1912 and [[Agstafa|Jelisawetinka]] in 1914. They became populated mostly by the descendents of the Germans from the two older colonies of Helenendorf and Annenfeld. By 1918 according to the German consul in [[Constantinople]], there were 6,000 Germans living in these colonies overall. Helenendorf became the primary spiritual center for the Germans of the eight colonies. The oldest Lutheran church in present-day Azerbaijan, St. John's Church, was built in this town in 1857. Other Lutheran churches were built in [[Gadabay]], [[Shamakhi]], Elisabethpol, [[Baku]] and Annenfeld in 1868, 1869, 1885, 1897 and 1911 respectively. The ceremony of laying the first stone of Baku's [[Church of the Saviour, Baku|German Church of the Saviour]] was attended by [[Emanuel Nobel]], brother of [[Alfred Nobel]], and other members of the city's elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.azerbaijan-irs.com/irs/viewer.php?id=000220 Pages of History: German Settlers in Azerbaijan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222956/http://www.azerbaijan-irs.com/irs/viewer.php?id=000220 |date=September 27, 2007 }} by Jeyla Ibrahimova.

Baku's booming oil industry attracted many people from all over the Caucasus. By 1903, the German population of the city had grown to 3,749 (2.4% of the city's entire population at the time) and consisted mostly of natives of the original German colonies.&lt;ref&gt;V.M. Karev (ed.). The ''Germans of Russia'' Encyclopedia. ERN, 1999; v. 4, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolaus von der Nonne, an ethnic German who had been working in Baku since 1883, was the mayor of Baku from 1898 to 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Oriana Kraemer: Die Stadt, wo der Wind sich dreht, in: Bauwelt 36/2009 (=Stadt Bauwelt 183), Berlin 25. September 2009/100. Jahrgang, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, [[Richard Sorge]], the famous ethnic German Soviet [[Espionage|spy]], was born in a suburb of Baku in 1895. His father was a German mining engineer who worked for the Caucasus Oil Company. Sorge is considered to have been one of the best Soviet spies in [[Japan]] before and during [[World War II]] and he was posthumously declared a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. The city of Baku dedicated a monument and park to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} {{cite news |url=https://www.kommersant.ru/gallery/2604888|title=Доктор Зорге|work=[[Kommersant]]|date=4 October 2017|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly referred to as ''nemsə'' (from the Russian ''немец'' – "German") by the local [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] population, Germans in the Elisabethpol Governorate were traditionally engaged in farming. However, starting from 1860, [[viticulture]] was becoming more and more important in the life of the German agricultural communities. By the end of the 19th century, 58% of [[Azerbaijani wine|the region's wine production]] was manufactured by the Vohrer Brothers and the Hummel Brothers of Helenendorf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai122_folder/122_articles/122_helenendorf_khanlar.html|title=Wine and Wagons.

In 1865 and 1883, [[Siemens]] built two [[copper smelting|copper smelteries]] in Gadabay and a hydroelectric station in [[Qalakənd|Galakand]]. In the 1860s, it initiated cobalt extraction in [[Dashkasan]] and built two power stations in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;Rauf Huseynzadeh. [http://www.ksam.org/index.php?mtype=news1&amp;mid=413 Germans of Azerbaijan]. IRS magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The Siemens smelteries were officially closed down in 1914 when the Russian Empire entered [[World War I]] fighting against Germany and the tsarist government banned all German businesses in Russia.&lt;ref name="gadabay"&gt;Kamal Ali. [http://echo-az.com/index.php?aid=20274 Spirit of Departed Germans in Gadabay]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Echo''. 31 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], Imperial Russia annexed the Kars region from the Ottoman Empire. The tsarist government launched a campaign to populate the newly established [[Kars Oblast]] with perceived "reliable" populations, including Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Tsutsiev, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, a number of German families were resettled in Kars from the colony of Alexandershilf near Tiflis and established the village of Petrovka.&lt;ref&gt;American Historical Society of Germans from Russia. The Society, 1986; p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Its population remained relatively low and consisted of about 200 people by 1911. Another two colonies in the province, [[Kümbetli|Vladikars]] and Estonka, were founded between 1911 and 1914. These settlements were short-lived. Due to the [[Caucasus Campaign|Russian-Ottoman military confrontation]] at the start of World War I, most of the remaining German settlers from the Kars Oblast were evacuated to Eichenfeld. The Kars region itself was eventually annexed by Turkey in the treaties of [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Moscow]] and [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsutsiev, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1906 to 1922, Baron Kurt von Kutschenbach published the German-language newspaper ''[[Kaukasische Post]]'' in Tiflis. It called itself the "only German newspaper in the Caucasus." The editor-in-chief was the writer, journalist and Caucasus scholar [[Arthur Leist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} {{cite news |url=http://www.kaukasische-post.com/?page_id=44|title=Geschichte|work=Kaukasische Post|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outbreak of World War I, Russian government attempts to [[Russification|Russify]] the German colonies in the Caucasus created a local backlash.&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt; Following [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolutions of 1917]] and the formation of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federation]], German colonists formed the Transcaucasian German National Council (''Transkaukasischer Deutscher Nationalrat''), with its seat in Tiflis. In May 1918, the Transcaucasian Federation dissolved and the short-lived republics of [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]] and [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]] were established. The German colonists strove to maintain their communities amid the upheaval of the [[Russian Civil War]] in the Caucasus. In the short-lived [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], the centenary of Helenendorf was marked by a public celebration within the community. The German community was also represented in the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|parliament of the republic]] by Lorenz Kuhn, a Helenendorf-born oil industry businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.konkordia-az.com/?Hronika Chronology of the German Settlement of Azerbaijan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725132028/http://www.konkordia-az.com/?Hronika |date=2009-07-25 }}. ''Konkordia-az.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet era===
Following the victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the Russian Civil War and the [[Sovietization]] of the Caucasus, the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet government]] initially demonstrated a favorable attitude toward [[multiculturalism]] in the era of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP). The cultural and linguistic rights of ethnic groups were promoted by Soviet authorities in accordance with the ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' (nativization) policy of Soviet nationalities. In 1926, there were seven public primary schools in Soviet Azerbaijan with German as the language of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.preslib.az/pdfbooks/rubooks/nkao_create.pdf Network of Primary Schools in the Azerbaijan SSR for the School Year 1926/27 by Language of Instruction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209171224/http://ebooks.preslib.az/pdfbooks/rubooks/nkao_create.pdf |date=2012-12-09 }} (p. 192)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]] in 1926 showed that 93,915 Caucasus Germans lived in the North Caucasus region of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhina, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]], 13,149 lived in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]], 12,047 in the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]] and 104 in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_26.php?reg=2314 The All-Union Population Census of 1926]. ''Demoscope.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed with the rise of Joseph Stalin. The Soviet government gradually ordered all German-sounding place-names to be changed by the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="audit"&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.auditorium.ru/books/469/p_55.htm Russian State Archive: РЦХИДНИ. ф. 644. оп. 1. д. 11. л. 195] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213154/http://www.auditorium.ru/books/469/p_55.htm |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]] of agriculture under the [[first five-year plan]] and the resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|famine of 1932-33]] hit the North Caucasus and the local German community very hard.&lt;ref&gt;Mukhina, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in June 1941, the Caucasus Germans were internally deported by Soviet authorities to Central Asia and Siberia on the pretext that their loyalties were with Germany, even though this was not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Mukhina, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar [[Pavel Polian]], most of the Caucasus Germans (approximately 190,000 people) were deported from the North and South Caucasus to [[Kazakhstan]] and Siberia from September 1941 to June 1942.&lt;ref name="polian" /&gt;

The deportees were allowed to take very little luggage, hardly any food and then had to undergo a voyage across the [[Caspian Sea]] to the camps of Central Asia. They were told the voyage would only be for several days but many ships went back and forth for months, resulting in mass death from starvation and the climate, especially among children, the elderly and the sick. On one ship carrying deportees, about 775 Germans froze to death. Evidently, maritime officials had no clear instructions to land the deportees at a particular destination and were prohibited from landing them anywhere else. They eventually arrived by rail in the [[Lake Balkhash]] area, in Kazakhstan. This torment can be ascribed, in part, to the confusion caused by the war, but also, more importantly, to the typical callous treatment of political prisoners by the Stalin regime, which did not care if prisoners lived or died. The following eye-witness report relates a harrowing story of evacuation by ship:

{{Quote frame|text=For two months ethnic Germans from the Caucasus were pointlessly dragged back and forth on the Caspian Sea, and more people, especially children, were dying of starvation. They were just thrown overboard. My four-year-old son was thrown there as well. My other son, seven years of age, saw that. He grabbed my skirt and begged me with tears in his eyes: 'Mummy, don't let them throw me in the water. I beg you, leave me alive, and I will always be with you and take care of you when I grow up'... I always cry when I remember that he also died of starvation and was thrown overboard, which he feared so much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voices from the Gulag: The Oppression of the German Minority in the Soviet Union|last=Merten|first=Ulrich|publisher=American Historical Society of Germans from Russia|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-60337-6|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|pages=180, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The only ones not subject to deportation were German women who were married to non-Germans. Soon after Stalin's death in 1953 and the rise of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to the Soviet leadership, the ban for the majority of the deported peoples to return to their homes was lifted. However, relatively few Germans returned to the Caucasus region.&lt;ref name="mukhina" /&gt; By 1979, there were only 46,979 Germans living in both North and South Caucasus.&lt;ref name="1979census"&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_79.php?reg=13 The All-Union Population Census of 1979]. ''Demoscope.ru''&lt;/ref&gt;

===History since 1991===
There has been renewed interest in the Caucasus German community in the [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet space]] since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. In Georgia, there were approximately 30 older women of German ancestry left in Bolnisi as of 2002. The German town cemetery was leveled under Stalin and is marked today by a memorial honouring the memory of the German colonists. Recently, there has been increasing interest in Georgia on the part of local youth to find out more about their German heritage. Often this desire is closely related to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] beliefs, so as a result the [[New Apostolic Church]] works intensively with these young people as part of its regular youth programs.

In Azerbaijan, the remaining Germans are concentrated in the capital city of Baku, and many belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Community restored and officially registered in the early 1990s. The last German resident of Goygol (Helenendorf), Viktor Klein, died in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215524/http://www.echo-az.com/archive/2007_08/1637/tochka01.shtml On the Deportation of Germans from Azerbaijan] by Tamara Humbatova. ''Echo''. #1637. 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The city has nowadays over 400 buildings whose construction dates back to the German period. In 2015, according to Klein's will, his familial house, built by his grandfather in 1886, was turned into the Museum of Caucasus German History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vesti.az/news/254676 Unique Caucasus German Museum to Be Established in Azerbaijan].

The Lutheran church of the town was razed by the Soviet government in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="gadabay"/&gt;

Already small compared to the historical German communities of the neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan, Armenia's remaining German population declined following the country's independence in 1991 due to economic factors. Many of the country's Germans emigrated to Germany.&lt;ref name="arm-minorities" /&gt; In recent years, the German community has been working closely with the German Educational and Cultural Center of Armenia to help organize German language schools and cultural events.&lt;ref name="arm-minorities" /&gt;

The last German resident of the Estonka colony (the present-day village of Karacaören in the [[Kars Province]] of Turkey), Frederik Albuk, died in 1999 in his native village, survived by his wife Olga Albuk of Russian-Estonian ancestry, who died there in August 2011. The 150-grave Lutheran cemetery where they were buried is the only remnant of the German community's presence in northeastern Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{tr icon}} [http://www.dogukultur.com/Default.asp?Cmd=HaberOku&amp;ID=15058 August Albuk: "It is Good to Live in Turkey, but Bad to Die"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223075519/http://www.dogukultur.com/Default.asp?Cmd=HaberOku&amp;ID=15058 |date=2011-12-23 }}.

'''Citizen sourcing''' is the government adoption of [[crowdsourcing]] techniques for the purposes of (1) enlisting citizens in the design and execution of government services and (2) tapping into the citizenry’s [[collective intelligence]] for solutions and [[situational awareness]]. 
Applications of citizen sourcing include:
*The use of [[ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] tools by government agencies to collect ideas and suggestions from the public
*The use of problem-solving tools that allow citizens to identify and evaluate solutions to problems proposed.
*The adoption of citizen reporting platforms, such as for crime or emergency response information
*The government monitoring of [[social media]], such as [[Twitter]], for situational awareness, such as with regard to natural disasters
Citizen sourcing has gained prominence as part of the Obama administration’s [[Open Government Initiative]] and is seen, in the words of [[Vivek Kundra]], as a way of driving “innovation by tapping into the ingenuity of the American people”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=White House Open Government Blog|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/01/23/why-open-gov-matters-you|title=How Open Gov Datasets Affect Parents and Consumers|date=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to solve those problems that are too big for government to solve on its own. Similarly, [[David Cameron]] of the British Conservatives believes that citizen sourcing mechanisms and the advent of [[Web 2.0]] technologies will help usher in “the next age of government” by truly enabling citizens to act on John Kennedy’s historic call to “ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=TED|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/david_cameron.html|title=David Cameron: The next age of government|date=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Citizen sourcing is a derivative of the term [[crowdsourcing]]. “Citizen” is used instead of “crowd” to emphasis its governmental application and civic purpose. Citizen sourcing is a new take on the concept of the [[coproduction (public services)|coproduction]] of public services by service users and communities enabled by the maturation of [[Web 2.0]] participatory technologies.

==Examples==

===Online Ideation Platforms for Government===
[http://www.granicus.com Granicus] is an example of a solution that has been implemented in a number of cities like [http://speakupaustin.org/ The City of Austin] that allows the public to submit ideas for government services, improve upon these ideas with the help of government employees that moderate the discussions online, and ultimately design solutions in a crowdsourcing fashion that can be implemented by the city. [[hunchbuzz.com|HunchBuzz]] is another example which has been implemented by New Zealand's central government and is being rolled out to local city councils. [http://citizenlab.co CitizenLab] is a more European-oriented ideation platform on which the citizens co-create their city through ideation and citizensourcing challenges. Their approach to civic engagement is through gamification, in order to incentivise citizens to share their input.

===Citizen reporting===
The City of [[Boston]] provides a Citizens Connect iPhone App that allows constituents to report various services requests, including for removing graffiti, filling potholes, and fixing traffic lights. A similar system, [[SeeClickFix]], has been adopted in a number of cities across the United States.

===Disaster response===
Online communities of citizens such as the Crisis Commons (see [[Crisis camp]]) and the International Network of Crisis Mappers provide assistance to professional responders on the ground by performing data-driven tasks, such as locating missing persons (see, for instance, [[Person finder]]), converting satellite imagery into street maps (see, for instance, [[OpenStreetMap]]), and reporting and processing actionable citizen reports of needs and damage (see, for instance, the [[Ushahidi]] platform).

===Patent examination===
The [[Peer-to-Patent]] system enables citizens to assist the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) in evaluating the validity of patent applications. Following the implementation of Peer-to-Patent, the USPTO started exploring how to further integrate citizens into the patent application review process.  They invited experts to present at two roundtables on using citizen submissions in prior art.  Presenters at the roundtables included experienced representatives from Peer-to-Patent,  Ask Patents, [[Patexia]], and [[Article One Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Roundtable on the Use of Crowdsourcing and Third-Party Preissuance Submissions to Identify Relevant Prior Art|url = http://www.uspto.gov/patents/init_events/crowdsourcing_roundtable_04-2014.jsp|website = www.uspto.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30|language = en|first = patent|last = announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Roundtable on USPTO Use of Crowdsourcing to Identify Relevant Prior Art|url = http://www.uspto.gov/page/roundtable-uspto-use-crowdsourcing-identify-relevant-prior-art-examination-application|website = www.uspto.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30|language = en|last = Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USPTO also opened the process up to citizens by requesting public comments and suggestions on how to proceed following each of the two roundtables.

===Citizen problem solving===
The City of [http://www.mimedellin.org Medellin], Colombia uses the power of the citizens' collective intelligence to identify potential solutions for important problems the city faces. The platform structures problems as open challenges; citizens can ideate, propose, identify, filter and vote on solutions, and the Mayor´s office reviews and implements solutions of its choosing.

'''Crime in Peru''' is investigated by the [[Law enforcement in Peru|Peruvian police]].

== Crime by type ==
=== Murder ===
{{See|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, Peru had a murder rate of 9.6 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 2,865 murders in Peru in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, this had declined to 7.16 per 100,000, with 2,247 murders recorded.&lt;ref&gt;https://data.unodc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{See|Corruption in Peru}}

Peru's most prominent political corruption scandal is probably the case of [[Alberto Fujimori]], [[Peru]]'s ex-President. Fujimori has been convicted of having ordered killings, embezzlement of public funds, abuse of power and corruption during his 10 years of presidency (1990-2000).

A '''cuckold''' is the husband of an [[adulterous]] wife. In evolutionary biology, the term is also applied to males who are unwittingly investing [[parental investment|parental effort]] in offspring that are not genetically their own.&lt;ref name="Steven M 2006"&gt;Steven M. Platek and Todd K. Shackelford (Eds.), Female Infidelity and Paternal Uncertainty: Evolutionary Perspectives on Male Anti-Cuckoldry Tactics.  Cambridge University Press: New York, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==
[[File:Order-cuckoldry-ca1815-French-satire.jpg|thumb|c. 1815 French satire on cuckoldry, which shows both men and women wearing horns]]

The word ''cuckold'' derives from the [[cuckoo]] bird, alluding to its habit of laying its eggs in other birds' nests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cuckold|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC_2009&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Janet|title=Cuckolds, Horns and Other Explanations|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8133615.stm|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is common in medieval [[folklore]], literature, and [[iconography]].

English usage first appears about 1250 in the [[medieval debate poem]] ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]''. It was characterized as an overtly blunt term in [[John Lydgate]]'s "Fall of Princes", c. 1440.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=O3-sBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191&amp;lpg=PT191&amp;dq=Nightingale#v=onepage&amp;q=Nightingale&lt;/ref&gt;  Shakespeare's poetry often referred to cuckolds, with several of his characters suspecting they had become one.&lt;ref name=BBC_2009 /&gt;

One often-overlooked subtlety of the word is that it implies that the husband is deceived, that he is unaware of his wife's unfaithfulness and may not know until the arrival or growth of a child plainly not his (as with cuckoo birds).&lt;ref name=BBC_2009 /&gt;

The female equivalent ''[[cuckquean]]'' first appears in English literature in 1562,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lfSC4fpiW64C&amp;pg=PA301&amp;dq=Cuckquean#v=onepage&amp;q=Cuckquean|title=Love, Sex, and Marriage: A Historical Thesaurus|first=Julie|last=Coleman|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Rodopi|accessdate=22 November 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2XtWDhgljvkC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=Cuckquean#v=onepage&amp;q=Cuckquean|title=A Dictionary of Sexual Language and Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature: Three Volume Set Volume I A-F Volume II G-P Volume III Q-Z|first=Gordon|last=Williams|date=13 September 2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|accessdate=22 November 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding a female suffix to the ''cuck''.

A related word, first appearing in 1520, is ''wittol'', which substitutes ''wit'' (in the sense of knowing) for the first part of the word, referring to a man aware of and reconciled to his wife's [[infidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metaphor and symbolism ==
[[File:A flag used in the English Civil War referring to the Earl of Essex's notorious marital problems.jpg|thumb|A flag used in the English Civil War by Horatio Cary referring to the Earl of Essex's notorious marital problems]]
In Western traditions, cuckolds have sometimes been described as "wearing the horns of a cuckold" or just "wearing the horns". This is an allusion to the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|mating habits of stag]]s, who forfeit their mates when they are defeated by another male.&lt;ref&gt;E. Cobham Brewer 1810–1897. Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Italy]] (especially in [[Southern Italy]], where it is a major personal offence), the insult is often accompanied by the [[sign of the horns]]. In [[French language|French]], the term is "{{lang|fr|porter des cornes}}", which is used by [[Molière]] to describe someone whose consort has been unfaithful.
In German, the term is "{{lang|de|jemandem Hörner aufsetzen}}", or "{{lang|de|Hörner tragen}}", the husband is "{{lang|de|der gehörnte Ehemann}}". [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] wrote the ''Tiers Livers'' of [[Gargantua and Pantagruel]] in 1546, by which time the symbol of the horns was "so well-known and over-used that the author could barely avoid making reference to it".&lt;ref&gt;LaGuardia, David P., ''Intertextual Masculinity in French Renaissance Literature'', Ashgate Publishing (Franham, UK 2008) p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molière]]'s ''[[The School for Wives|L'École des femmes]]'' (1662) is the story of a man who mocks cuckolds and becomes one at the end. In [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1372–77), "[[The Miller's Tale]]" is a story that humorously examines the life of a cuckold. In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] usage, an altogether different allusion is used, when the cuckold (or wittol) is said to be "{{lang|zh|戴綠帽子}}" (wearing the green hat), which derives from the [[sumptuary law]]s used in China from the 13th to the 18th centuries that required the males in households with prostitutes to wrap their heads in a green scarf (or later a hat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==The term ''cuck'' in politics==
{{further|Cuckservative}}

An [[abbreviation]] of ''cuckold'', the term ''cuck'' has been used by the [[alt-right]] to attack the [[masculinity]] of an opponent. It was originally aimed at other [[conservatism|conservatives]], whom the alt-right saw as ineffective.&lt;ref name=TNYT&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Alt-Right, Alt-Left, Antifa: A Glossary of Extremist Language |last=Stack |first=Liam |date=August 15, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/alt-left-alt-right-glossary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cuckoldry as a fetish ==
Unlike the traditional definition of the term, in fetish usage a '''cuckold''' or '''wife watching''' is complicit in his (or her) partner's sexual "infidelity"; the wife who enjoys ''cuckolding'' her husband is called a '''[[swinging (sexual practice)|cuckoldress]]''' if the man is more submissive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ley |first=David |title=Insatiable Wives: Women Who Stray and the Men Who Love Them |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4422-0031-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-kort-phd/the-expanding-phenomenon-_b_11968830.html|title=The Expanding Phenomenon Of Cuckolding: Even Gay Men Are Getting Into It|first1=Joe|last1=Kort|first2=Ph D.|last2=Psychotherapist|first3=Certified|last3=Sex|first4=Relationship Therapist at Joe|last4=Kort|first5=|last5=Associates|first6=P.

The fetish fantasy does not work at all if the cuckold is being humiliated against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Donald C.|date=1 Dec 1999|title=The humiliation dynamic: An overview|journal=The Journal of Primary Prevention|volume=12|issue=2|pages=93–121|doi=10.1007/BF02015214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Psychology regards cuckold fetishism as a variant of [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], the cuckold deriving pleasure from being humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/07/29/cuckolding-the-sex-fetish-for-intellectuals.html |title=The Intellectual Sex Fetish |author=Rufus, Anneli |date=Jul 29, 2010 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Cuckolding can also be mixed with other non-monogamous relationship arrangements with which it has substantial overlap such as swinging, open relationships, and polyamory. Again, it is distinguished from these concepts in that cuckold's thrill in their partner's acts is specifically masochistic.",  Betchen, Stephen J.,  Magnetic Partners blog post, 11/18/14&lt;/ref&gt; In Freudian analysis, cuckold fetishism is the eroticization of the fears of infidelity and of failure in the man's competition for procreation and the affection of females.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In his book ''Masochism and the Self,'' psychologist [[Roy Baumeister]] advanced a ''Self Theory'' analysis that cuckolding (or specifically, all masochism) was a form of escaping from self-awareness, at times when self-awareness becomes burdensome, such as with perceived inadequacy. According to this theory, the physical or mental pain from masochism brings attention away from the self, which would be desirable in times of 'guilt, anxiety, or insecurity', or at other times when self-awareness is unpleasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Masochism and the self|last=Baumeister|first=Roy|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1138876064|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Crown Jewels''' encompass the [[Imperial Regalia]] of the [[German Kingdom]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until 1806. From 1871 until 1918 the Prussians kings redenominated the [[Prussian Crown Jewels]] as Crown jewels of the [[German Emperor|German Emperors]]. Formally the [[German Empire]] had no physical Crown jewels, though a model of a [[German State Crown]] was created and used in emblems. 

The term may also be used in reference to regalia of the various constitutive [[List of historic states of Germany|German monarchies]] that sprang from the Holy Roman Empire and later were unified in the German Empire.

Since the end of the German monarchies in 1918, the regalia and jewels of the different states have been kept in museums since all of Germany remains under republican rule.

''This page discusses the Ghanaian kingdom of Gonja; for uses for the word Ganja, see [[Ganja (disambiguation)]]''

'''Gonja''' (also '''Ghanjawiyyu''') was a kingdom in northern [[Ghana]] founded in 1675 by [[Sumaila Ndewura Jakpa]].&lt;ref name="relatives"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures and Contemporary Issues |last=Danver |first=Steven L. |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=9781317464006 |publication-date=10 Mar 2015 |pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word can also refer to the people of this kingdom.

==Origin==
The Gonja are a [[Guan people]] who have been influenced by Akan, Mande and Hausa people. With the fall of the [[Songhai Empire]] (c. 1600), the [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] [[Ngbanya]] clan moved south, crossing the [[Black Volta]] and founding a city at [[Yagbum]]. The Gonja kingdom was originally divided into sections overseen by male siblings of Sumaila Ndewura Jakpa including their children and grandchildren.&lt;ref name="relatives"/&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Naba'a]], the Ngbanya dynasty of Gonja was founded. The capital was established at [[Yagbum]].&lt;ref name="Bakewell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilks,Ivor. Wangara, Akan, and Portuguese in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|editor1-last=Bakewell|editor1-first=Peter|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|date=1997|publisher=Variorum, Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ngbanya expanded rapidly, conquering several neighbors in the [[White Volta]] valley and beginning a profitable gold trade with the [[Akan people|Akan states]] through nearby [[Begho]].  By 1675, the Gonja established a [[paramount chief]], called the [[Yagbongwura]], to control the kingdom.  The Ngbanya dynasty has controlled this position from its founding to the present day, with only two brief [[interregnum]]s.  The current Yagbongwura, ''Tuntumba Sulemana Jakpa Bore Essa'', has held his position since 2010.
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-43-87-1-001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gonja chiefs and elders at the Volta River project travelling exhibition(1950)]]
Precolonial Gonja society was stratified into [[caste]]s, with a ruling class, a [[Islam|Muslim]] trader class, an [[animist]] commoner class, and a [[slavery|slave]] class.  Its economy depended largely on trade in [[African slave trade|slaves]] from Central Africa&lt;ref&gt;The Evolution of War: A Study of Its Role in Early SocietiesBy Maurice R. Davie&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kola nut]]s, particularly through the market town of [[Salaga]], sometimes called the "[[Timbuktu]] of the South."

The [[Gonja language]] is a [[Tano languages|Tano language]] within the [[Kwa languages]] family, closely related to [[Akan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w8vzkqDsv-IC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Central+Tano+languages&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TwJdTdHBH8jKgQea3fm2DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Central%20Tano%20languages&amp;f=false Aspect and Modality in Kwa Languages]. books.google.com.

'''''Hinterland Who's Who''''' is best known as a series of 60-second [[public service announcement]]s profiling [[Canada|Canadian]] animals, produced by [[Environment Canada]] Wildlife Service and the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) in the 1960s and 70s, and re-launched by the [[Canadian Wildlife Federation]] in the 2000s. While the word "[[hinterland]]" refers to an area near a coast line or river bank, the series explores wildlife throughout Canada in general, regardless of location.

==Format==
The ''Hinterland Who's Who'' series was commissioned in 1962 by the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]], as a way to generate interest in Canada's wildlife through a series of short, one-minute vignettes, broadcast during commercial breaks.&lt;ref name=HWWhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hww.ca/en/about-us/50th/history.html|title=Hinterland Who's Who - History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series, produced for the CWS by the [[National Film Board]], has been airing on Canadian television since 1963.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Hinterland Who's Who beaver vignette found in CBC Archives|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2013/07/29/bc-hinterland-whos-who-beaver.html?cmp=rss|accessdate=July 29, 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original announcements, a distinctive refrain of [[flute music]] ([[John Cacavas]]' ''Flute Poem'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hww.ca/en/about-us/hww-profile.html|title=Hinterland Who's Who - HWW Profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; opens the ad, and is accompanied by the low-key style of the narrator, [[John Livingston (naturalist)|John Livingston]] (originally the executive director of the Canadian Audubon Society),&lt;ref name=HWWhistory/&gt; describing the animal over footage of it taken in the wild.

The end of each message, where viewers were reminded to contact the Canadian Wildlife Service for additional information, varied. The earliest instalments from 1963 concluded with, "For a more complete story on the [animal], why not contact the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa?"&lt;ref name=YouTubeLoon&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr4szXuxEPk&amp;feature=share|title=The Loon, 1963 original version!|date=11 July 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the series was introduced in color, it concluded with, "For more information on the [animal], contact the Canadian Wildlife Service, in Ottawa." Newer segments in the late-1970s and 1980s ended with, "For more information on the [animal], why not contact the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa?", with later instalments including its [[Postal codes in Canada|postal code]], K1A 0H3. Viewers requesting information received a four-page, illustrated brochure providing more details on the featured animal.&lt;ref name=HWWhistory/&gt;

By the early-1990s, the series received about $3.6 million in free publicity, and over a million leaflets were sent out to inquiring viewers.&lt;ref name=HWWhistory/&gt;

A [[French language|French]] version of this series was also produced, as '''''Merveilles de la faune''''' (''Wonders of Wildlife'') or  '''''Faune et flore du pays''''' (''The country's fauna and flora'').

In 2003 the [[Canadian Wildlife Federation]], in cooperation with the [[Government of Canada]], began producing new episodes of ''Hinterland Who's Who'', featuring two versions:
* those containing the quiet narrative of the original series of commercials
* those containing modern background music, directed at younger viewers

These versions, now available as 30- or 60- second instalments,&lt;ref name=HWWhistory/&gt; are often hosted on-camera and voiced by a female Canadian Wildlife Service worker, concluding with, "To learn more about [subject], and how you can protect it, visit "hww.ca".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hww.ca|title=Hinterland Who’s Who|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial animals featured in the new series included the [[polar bear]], the [[monarch butterfly]], the [[leatherback sea turtle]], and the [[loon]].&lt;ref name=HWWhistory/&gt;

In both cases, the new ''Hinterland Who's Who'' narrative includes suggestions for conservation along with the description of the animal and its behaviour.

==Lost instalments==
In July 2013, it was announced that the first four instalments of ''Hinterland Who's Who'', released in the Summer of 1963, were presumed lost, as the Canadian Wildlife Federation and the Canadian Wildlife Service were unable to locate any copies for the series' 50th anniversary, despite extensive searches of various sources, including the NFB, [[Library and Archives Canada]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] archives, and even [[YouTube]]. These segments, filmed in black and white with versions in English and French,&lt;ref name="VanSun071113"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Long+lost+loon+from+1963+Hinterland+vignettes/8647764/story.html|title=Long-lost loon from 1963 Hinterland Who is Who vignettes lands in Vancouver|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=vancouversun.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325174901/http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Long+lost+loon+from+1963+Hinterland+vignettes/8647764/story.html|archive-date=2016-03-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured the [[beaver]], the loon, the [[gannet]] and the [[moose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/07/09/hibernating-or-extinct-original-black-and-white-hinterland-whos-who-tv-spots-missing-on-50th-anniversary/|title=Hibernating or extinct? Original black-and-white Hinterland Who’s Who TV spots missing on 50th anniversary|author=Randy Boswell, Postmedia News|date=9 July 2013|work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the problem of the search was made public, one of the missing instalments, an English-language version featuring the loon, were found in the [[CBUT-DT|CBC Vancouver]] archives a few days later, as part of a commercial break during a broadcast of the 1932 [[Laurel and Hardy]] classic comedy, ''[[Helpmates]]'' on July 1, 1969, a holiday then known as [[Canada Day|Dominion Day]]. According to Colin Preston, library coordinator at the CBC Vancouver Media Archives, the 1969 recordings were saved by a former CBC employee, who later donated them to the archives for posterity.&lt;ref name=YouTubeLoon/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanSun071113/&gt; The footage for the 1963 loon instalment was originally filmed in colour, but converted to black and white for the instalment.&lt;ref name=VanSun071113/&gt; The colour film and soundtrack would be recycled in later versions of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lninX4Nsvfo&amp;feature=share|title=Hinterland Who's Who - The Loon|date=11 June 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the missing four, the original beaver vignette, was subsequently found by Preston as well,&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; as was the moose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4xdI5GrjJs&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UUpXaXOmAPcfDuGjrOnRTQig|title=The Moose, 1963 original version!|date=18 July 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gannet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaWcLUGccQY|title=The Gannet, original 1963 version!|date=12 December 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the French language versions of all four animals remain missing.

==Re-airings==

Starting in August 2016, the local Mountain View, California television show [[John Wants Answers]] started airing the original Hinterland Who's Who vignettes in high definition.  The show obtained digital high definition copies converted from the original film from the Canadian Film Board.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnwantsanswers.com|title=John Wants Answers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
These announcements became a widely recognized and often-parodied feature of Canadian pop culture.

*''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' episode 142 featured a spoof of the ''Hinterland Who's Who'' "Woodchuck" episode, voiced by [[John Candy]]. The [[woodchuck]] also makes a brief appearance in episode 143.
* A spoof ''Hinterland Who's Who'' episode entitled "The Wood Spider" credited to "First Church of Christ, Filmmaker" was released on YouTube in 2006 and has garnered over 33 million views as of May 2013. The video purported to show the behavior of [[Huntsman spider|wood spiders]] given various drugs, such as alcohol, caffeine, and [[THC]], a mocking reference to the 1940s research of [[Peter N. Witt|Dr. Peter N. Witt]], who showed that giving drugs to spiders alters their web building behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/17/science/spiders-seduced-into-yielding-secrets-of-web.html|title=SPIDERS SEDUCED INTO YIELDING SECRETS OF WEB|date=17 September 1985|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Double Exposure (comedy series)]] on CBC Radio repeatedly sent up the series with a number of 'Political Hinterland Who's Who' sequences in the late 1980s and 1990s.  With no visuals, the narrator's elaborate punning compared bureaucratic affairs to the struggle for survival in nature. "On the depression north of Lake Ontario, the Great Blue [[Mike Harris|Harris]], or in Latin, ''Attila Foraqueensparkicus'', has stirred up a hornets' nest with its fellow creatures living off a diet of bologna and tuna. The Great Blue Harris, not concerned with the welfare of others, has stirred the left wing back into full flight."
* The PSA "[[House Hippo]]" by [[Concerned Children's Advertisers]] was a parody of the series. It features a voice over and footage of a small hippo. The narration was similar in style to "Hinterland Who's Who".
* The  game ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', produced by Canadian video game developer [[BioWare]], features a sub-quest named "Hinterland Who's Who".

'''Institutional trust''' is a dynamic relationship between an [[individual]] and an [[institution]].  It is a form/sub-type of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and is distinguished by the potential magnitude of its effect.

The relationship can be analyzed through techniques developed for the analysis of [[interpersonal ties]].  The form of the relationship may be explicit (or implicit) and internal (or external) to an institution in both perception and reality.  The disposition of the relationship can be qualified as positive, neutral or negative.  The strength of the relationship is quantifiable through a relative percentage from 0% (weak) to 100% (strong) and a degree of separation (for example, 1 degree of separation means the trust relationship is direct, see [[Six degrees of separation]]).

The characteristics of the relationship may change over variable periods of time (from instantaneously to slowly).

Institutional trust is often expressed through a [[value judgment]].  It has major implications in all fields of study, especially power dynamics, including (but not limited to) forms of [[power (social and political)]].

'''Irula''' are an [[Adivasi]] group inhabiting the area of the [[Nilgiri mountains]], in the states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Perialwar, R.

== Etymology ==
''Irular'' means "dark people" in Tamil and Malayalam, from the root word ''irul'', meaning "darkness", in reference to their dark skin complexion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irular in India|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/16971/IN|work=Joshua Project|publisher=[[Frontier Ventures]]|accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribe numbers 189,621 in significant region of [[Tamil Nadu]] and 23,721 in [[Kerala]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Anthropology ==
[[File:Irula girl Australoid India.png|thumb|right|An Irula girl.]]
Early 20th century [[anthropology|anthropological]] literature classified the Irular under the [[Negrito]] ethnic group. They belong to the [[Australoid race]] but are influenced from [[Caucasoid race|Caucasoids]].&lt;ref name="ashanet_irula_project"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/us/2000/aug/08us.htm Giving Irulas their due]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

Unlike the Negrito tribes in the [[Andaman Islands]] who have retained their language, Irular speak the [[Irula language]], a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] that is closely related to [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Yerukala language|Yerukala]], [[Sholaga language|Sholaga]] and other [[Tamil languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Keystone Foundation (2006) "''People of the [[Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve]]''" retrieved 3/26/2007(NBR)[http://keystone-foundation.net/web/nbr/ "''People of the [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiri]] Biosphere Reserve''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929230456/http://keystone-foundation.net/web/nbr/ |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
Irular live in two [[south India]]n states – [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]. In Tamil Nadu they live in the [[Nilgiris district|Nilgiris]], [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore]] and [[Erode district|Erode]] districts. In Kerala they live in the [[Palakkad district]] and [[Attapady]] and [[Walayar]] [[panchayat]]s.

They live in four [[taluk]]s in Coimbatore district, namely [[Coimbatore-South taluk|Coimbatore South]], [[Coimbatore-North taluk|Coimbatore North]], [[Avinashi taluk|Avinashi]] and [[Madathukulam taluk|Madathukulam]]. The Coimbatore district houses 4254 Irulas in 40 settlements comprising 139 villages. Nearly 100 Vettakada Irula settlements are found in the forest areas or in the deep mountainous jungles.  There are 4 tribal settlements in the Siruvani Hills comprising 14 villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-criterion.com/V4/n2/Das.pdf Dr. Pauline Das, The Irula Language and Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census of Kerala identified 756 Irulan individuals from 189 families, who lived in 9 settlements covering .23&amp;nbsp;km² in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forest.kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=90|title=Tribal Settlements in the Forests of Kerala|date=2009-09-18|publisher=[[Department of Forests and Wildlife (Kerala)|Kerala Department of Forests and Wildlife]]|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
[[File:எலி பிடிக்கும் இருளர் சமூகத்தினர் படம் 2.JPG|thumb|170px|Irula man and woman tilling the soil.]]
Traditionally, the main occupation of the Irulas has been [[snake]] and [[rat]] catching. They also work as labourers ([[coolie]]s) in the fields of the [[landlords]] during the sowing and harvesting seasons or in the rice mills. Fishing is also a major occupation.

Rats destroy a quarter of the grain grown on [[Tamil Nadu]]-area farms annually. To combat this pest, Irula men use a traditional earthen pot [[fumigation]] method. Smoke is blown through their mouths, which leads to severe respiratory and heart problems.&lt;ref name="worldbank_rat"/&gt;

In January 2017, Masi Sadaiyan and Vadivel Gopal from the Irula tribe of [[Tamil Nadu]] were brought in, along with two translators, to work with detection dogs to track down and capture invasive [[Burmese pythons]] in [[Key Largo]], Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/01/26/florida-is-deploying-snake-hunters-from-india-to-catch-invasive-pythons/ Snake hunters from India are the latest weapons in Florida’s war on pythons]&lt;/ref&gt; The Irula men and their translators were paid $70,000 by the State of [[Florida]], and captured 14 pythons in less than two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/one-florida-agency-put-out-a-want-ad-for-python-killers/ar-AAogQhZ?li=BBmkt5R&amp;ocid=spartanntp One Florida agency put out a want ad for python killers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karachays''' ({{lang-krc|Къарачайлыла, таулула}} ''Qaraçaylıla, tawlula'') are a [[Turkic people]] of the [[North Caucasus]], mostly situated in the [[Russia]]n [[Karachay–Cherkessia|Karachay–Cherkess Republic]].

==History==
The Karachays (Къарачайлыла, Qaraçaylıla) are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people descended from the [[Kipchaks]], and share their language with the [[Kumyks]] from [[Republic of Dagestan|Daghestan]]. 

The Kipchaks (Cumans) came to the [[Caucasus]] in the 11th century [[Common Era|CE]].
The state of [[Alania]] was established prior to the [[Mongol]] invasions and had its capital in [[Maghas]], which some authors locate in [[Arkhyz]], the mountains currently inhabited by the Karachay, while others place it in either what is now modern [[Ingushetia]] or [[North Ossetia]]. In the 14th century, Alania was destroyed by [[Timur]] and the decimated population dispersed into the mountains. Timur's incursion into the [[North Caucasus]] introduced the local nations to [[Islam]].

In the nineteenth century Russia took over the area during the [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus]]. On October 20, 1828 the {{ill|Battle of Khasauka|ru|Хасаукинское сражение}} took place, in which the Russian troops were under the command of General [[Georgy Emanuel]]. The day after the battle, as Russian troops were approaching the ''[[aul]]'' of {{ill|Kart-Dzhurt|ru|Карт-Джуртское сельское поселение}}, the Karachay elders met with the Russian leaders and an agreement was reached for the inclusion of the Karachay into the Russian Empire.

After the annexation, the self-government of Karachay was left intact, including its officials and courts. Interactions with neighboring [[Muslim]] peoples continued to take place based on both folk customs and [[Sharia law]]. In Karachay, soldiers were taken from Karachai Amanat, pledged an oath of loyalty, and were assigned arms.

From 1831 to 1860, the Karachays joined the anti-Russian struggles carried out by the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian peoples]]. Between 1861 and 1880, to escape reprisals by the Russian army, large numbers of Karachays migrated to [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]].

In 1942 the Germans permitted the establishment of a [[Karachay National Committee]] to administer their "autonomous region"; the Karachays were also allowed to form their own police force and establish a brigade that was to fight with the Wehrmacht.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Rich: Hitler's War Aims. The Establishment of the New Order, page 391.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship with [[Nazi Germany]] resulted, when the Russians regained control of the region in November 1943, with the Karachays being charged with collaboration with Nazi Germany and deported.&lt;ref&gt;In general, see {{Cite book|author=Pohl, J. Otto |year=1999 |title=Ethnic Cleansing in the USSR, 1937-1949 |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-30921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the total population of about 80,000 were forcibly deported and resettled in Central Asia, mostly in [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] and [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghizia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pohl lists 69,267 as being deported {{harv|Pohl|1999|page=77}}; while [[Valery Tishkov|Tishkov]] says 68,327 citing Bugai, Nikoli F. (1994) ''Repressirovannie narody Rossii: Chechentsy i Ingushy'' citing [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]], ({{Cite book|author=Tishkov, Valery |author-link=Valery Tishkov|year=2004 |title=Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society |publisher=University of California Press| page=25}}); and Kreindler says 73,737 ({{Cite journal|author=Kreindler, Isabelle |year=1986 |title=The Soviet Deported Nationalities: A summary and an update |journal=Soviet Studies |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=387–405 |doi=10.1080/09668138608411648 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two years of the deportations, disease and famine caused the death of 35% of the population; of 28,000 children, 78%, or almost 22,000 perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Grannes, Alf |year=1991 |title=The Soviet deportation in 1943 of the Karachays: a Turkic Muslim people of North Caucasus |journal=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=55–68 |doi=10.1080/02666959108716187 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diaspora===
Many Karachays migrated to [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] after the Russian annexation of the Karachay nation in the early 19th century.  Karachays were also forcibly displaced to the [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asia]]n republics of [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] and [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghizia]] during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s relocation campaign in 1944.  Since the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] era in the [[Soviet Union]], many Karachays have been repatriated to their homeland from [[Central Asia]].  Today, there are sizable Karachay communities in [[Turkey]] (centered on [[Afyonkarahisar]]), [[Uzbekistan]], the [[United States]], and [[Germany]].

==Geography==
The Karachay nation, along with the [[Balkars]] and [[Nogays]] occupy the valleys and foothills of the Central Caucasus in the river valleys of the [[Kuban River|Kuban]], [[Big Zelenchuk River]], [[Malka River|Malka]], [[Baksan River|Baksan]], [[Cherek River|Cherek]] and others.

The Karachays are very proud of the symbol of their nation, [[Mount Elbrus]], the highest mountain in Europe, with an altitude of 5,642 meters.

==Culture==
Like other peoples in the mountainous [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], the relative isolation of the Karachay allowed them to develop their particular cultural practices, despite general accommodation with surrounding groups.&lt;ref name="Richmond-NW"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Richmond, Walter |year=2008 |title=The Northwest Caucasus: Past, Present, Future |series=Central Asian studies series, 12|location=London |publisher=Routledge |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=E6Z5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 20] |isbn=978-0-415-77615-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karachay people live in communities that are divided into families and clans ([[Tukkhum|''tukums'']]). A ''tukum'' is based on a family's lineage and there are roughly thirty-two Karachay ''tukums''. Prominent ''tukums'' include: Aci, Batcha (Batca), Baychora, Bayrimuk (Bayramuk), Bostan, Catto (Jatto), Cosar (Çese), Duda, Hubey (Hubi), Karabash, Laypan, Lepshoq, Ozden (Uzden), Silpagar, Tebu, Teke, Toturkul, Urus.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Karachay people are very independent, and have strong traditions and customs which dominate many aspects of their lives: e.g. weddings, funerals, and family pronouncements. They are fiercely loyal to both their immediate family and their "tukum".  They will never offend a guest. Cowardice is the most serious shame for a male.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Language and religion===
The Karachay dialect of the [[Karachay-Balkar language]] comes from the northwestern branch of [[Turkic languages]]. The [[Kumyks]], who live in northeast [[Dagestan]], speak a closely related language, the [[Kumyk language]]. The majority of the Karachay people are followers of Islam.

The '''Khamseh''' ({{lang-fa|ایلات خمسه}}) is a tribal confederation in the province of [[Fars Province|Fars]] in southwestern [[Iran]]. It consists of five tribes, hence its name ''Khamseh'', "''the five''". The tribes are partly nomadic, Some are Persian speaking [[Basseri]], some are Arabic speaking Arabs, and some are Qashqai Language speaking (Inalu, Baharlu and Nafar). They are sheep breeders, which they herd mounted on camels.

The history of the Khamseh confederation of tribes starts in 1861–1862 when [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] created the Khamseh Tribal Confederation. He combined five existing nomadic tribes, the Arab, Nafar, Baharlu, Inalu, and the [[Basseri]] and placed them under the control of the Qavam ol-Molk family. The pattern of forcibly uniting tribes was not a new idea, as the Safavid Shahs previously created homogenous [[Qizilbash]] confederations to temper the increasing strength of the Qashqai, who were gaining so much power.
The Khamseh tribes were a mixture of Persians, Turks, and Arabs.

'''''l''-diversity''' is a form of group based anonymization that is used to preserve privacy in data sets by reducing the granularity of a data representation. This reduction is a trade off that results in some loss of effectiveness of data management or mining algorithms in order to gain some privacy. The ''l''-diversity model is an extension of the [[k-anonymity|''k''-anonymity]] model which reduces the granularity of data representation using techniques including generalization and suppression such that any given record maps onto at least ''k-1'' other records in the data.   The ''l''-diversity model handles some of the weaknesses in the ''k''-anonymity model where protected identities to the level of ''k''-individuals is not equivalent to protecting the corresponding sensitive values that were generalized or suppressed, especially when the sensitive values within a group exhibit homogeneity. The ''l''-diversity model adds the promotion of intra-group diversity for sensitive values in the anonymization mechanism.

==Attacks on ''k''-anonymity==

While ''k''-anonymity is a promising approach to take for group based anonymization given its simplicity and wide array of algorithms that perform it, it is however susceptible to many attacks. When background knowledge is available to an attacker, such attacks become even more effective. Such attacks include:

* '''Homogeneity Attack''': This attack leverages the case where all the values for a sensitive value within a set of ''k'' records are identical. In such cases, even though the data has been ''k''-anonymized, the sensitive value for the set of ''k'' records may be exactly predicted.
* '''Background Knowledge Attack''': This attack leverages an association between one or more quasi-identifier attributes with the sensitive attribute to reduce the set of possible values for the sensitive attribute. For example, Machanavajjhala, Kifer, Gehrke, and Venkitasubramaniam (2007) showed that knowing that heart attacks occur at a reduced rate in Japanese patients could be used to narrow the range of values for a sensitive attribute of a patient's disease.

==Formal definition==

Given the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred for ''k''-anonymity data, the ''l''-diversity method was created to further ''k''-anonymity by additionally maintaining the diversity of sensitive fields.  The book ''Privacy-Preserving Data Mining – Models and Algorithms'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privacy-Preserving Data Mining – Models and Algorithms|last = Aggarwal|first = Charu C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-387-70991-8|location = |pages = 11-52 |url = http://charuaggarwal.net/generalsurvey.pdf|chapter = A General Survey of Privacy-Preserving Data Mining Models and Algorithms|last2 = Yu|first2 = Philip S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ''l''-diversity as being:

{{quote|Let a q*-block be a set of tuples such that its non-sensitive values generalize to q*. A q*-block is ''l''-diverse if it contains ''l'' "well represented" values for the sensitive attribute S. A table is ''l''-diverse, if every q*-block in it is ''l''-diverse.}}

The paper ''t''-Closeness: Privacy beyond ''k''-anonymity and ''l''-diversity (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = t-Closeness: Privacy Beyond k-Anonymity and l-Diversity|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4221659|journal = IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering, 2007. ICDE 2007|date = April 2007|pages = 106–115|doi = 10.1109/ICDE.2007.367856|first = Ninghui|last = Li|first2 = Tiancheng|last2 = Li|first3 = S.|last3 = Venkatasubramanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ''l''-diversity as being:

{{quote|'''The ''l''-diversity Principle''' – An equivalence class is said to have ''l''-diversity if there are at least ''l'' “well-represented” values for the sensitive attribute. A table is said to have ''l''-diversity if every equivalence class of the table has ''l''-diversity.}}

Machanavajjhala et. al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = L-diversity: Privacy Beyond K-anonymity|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1217299.1217302|journal = ACM Trans. Knowl. Discov.

Alice has a pen-friend named Umeko who is admitted to the same hospital as Bob and whose patient records also appear in the table shown in Figure 2. Alice knows that Umeko is a 21-year-old Japanese female who currently lives in zip code 13068. Based on this information, Alice learns that Umeko’s information is contained in record number 1,2,3, or 4. Without additional information, Alice is not sure whether Umeko caught a virus or has heart disease. However, it is well known that Japanese have an extremely low incidence of heart disease. Therefore Alice concludes with near certainty that Umeko has a viral infection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; define “well-represented” in three possible ways:
# '''Distinct ''l''-diversity''' – The simplest definition ensures that at least ''l'' distinct values for the sensitive field in each equivalence class.
# '''Entropy ''l''-diversity''' – The most complex definition defines ''Entropy'' of an equivalent class ''E'' to be the negation of summation of ''s'' across the domain of the sensitive attribute of ''p''(''E'',''s'')log(''p''(''E'',''s'')) where ''p''(''E'',''s'') is the fraction of records in ''E'' that have the sensitive value ''s''. A table has entropy ''l''-diversity when for every equivalent class ''E'', ''Entropy''(''E'') ≥ log(''l'').
# '''Recursive (''c''-''l'')-diversity''' – A compromise definition that ensures the most common value does not appear too often while less common values are ensured to not appear too infrequently.

Aggarwal and Yu (2008) note that when there is more than one sensitive field the ''l''-diversity problem becomes more difficult due to added dimensionalities.

'''Leti''' is an [[Austronesian]] language spoken on the island of [[Leti Islands|Leti]] in [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]]. Although it shares a lot of vocabulary with the neighboring [[Luang language]], and is marginally [[mutually intelligible]].

Fewer than 1% of Leti speakers are literate in Leti, though between a quarter and a half are literate in another language.

== Varieties ==
[[File:Karta ID Maluku isl.PNG|thumb|220px|left|Map of Maluku archipelago. Leti is located in southwestern part of the archipelago.]]

The main dialectological division in Leti is between eastern varieties, spoken in the domains of Laitutun and Luhuleli, and western varieties, spoken in the domains of Batumiau, Tutukei, Tomra, and Nuwewang.  This article focusses on the Tutukei variety and is based on a descriptive study by Aone van Engelenhoven (2004), a Dutch linguist of Leti descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = van Engelenhoven
 | first = Aone
 | title = Leti, a language of Southwest Maluku
 | publisher = KITLV Press
 | location = Leiden
 | year = 2004
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Tutukei itself divides into two sociolects, ''lirlèta'' (&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''lèta'' language', ''lèta'' meaning '(walled) village') and ''lirkòta'' ('city language').

Leti also has two literary or ritual varieties, ''lirmarna'' ('royal language') and ''lirasnïara'' ('sung language').  Both of them prominently feature [[Leti language#Lexical parallelism|lexical parallelism]].

Per van Engelenhoven 2004, "the major issue in formal Leti discourse is to keep speaking as long as possible.  Indeed, the important element in 'royal speech' is not what is said, but rather how it is said and how long it takes to be said".  In particular ''lirmarna'' features formulaic pairs of clauses which are syntactically identical, each pair of corresponding words in the two clauses forming a lexical pair.

''Lirasnïara'' is the sung form of ''lirmarna''.  It employs a repertoire of approximately 150 Luangic-Kisaric words with distinctive sound changes: e.g. {{IPA|/βuna/}} 'flower' and {{IPA|/tutu/}} 'point' are {{IPA|/βɔe/}} and {{IPA|/kukie/}} in ''lirasniara''. Often borrowings from [[Malay language|Malay]] are inserted as well. Again per van Engelenhoven 2004, "in Southwest Malukan society [[turn-taking]] in singing is ritualized and as such a fixed strategy, which makes it a powerful rhetoric device in Leti discourse.   [...] [A] song may not be interrupted when performed.  Singing is thus a means to prevent interruption in a speech event or an instrument to surpass the other speech participants".

These vowels can also occur [[vowel length|long]]; the phonemic status of long vowels hangs on the interpretation of Leti's pervasive metathetic processes.

The mid vowels {{IPA|/e, o, ɛ, ɔ/}} are restricted to the penult of lexical morphemes, which is stressed.  The majority of these morphemes provide no evidence for the height contrast — {{IPA|/ɛ, ɔ/}} are found before an ultimate {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/e, o/}} in other positions — and diachronically there was no contrast.  However, the contrast is set up synchronically on account of certain exceptions ({{IPA|/ea/}} 'he, she', {{IPA|/msena/}} 'refuse', {{IPA|/dena/}} 'stay'), and the fact that when suffixed the conditioning vowel can disappear: 
:{{IPA|/kɛrna/}} 'dry' → {{IPA|/ŋkɛrnulu/}} 'it dries first'
:{{IPA|/kernu/}} 'descend' → {{IPA|/ŋkernulu/}} 'he descends first'

=== Phonological processes ===

[[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] and [[apocope]], together ''binding'' processes, are pervasive in Leti as a feature of combinations of morphemes.  The preferred "flow of speech" in Leti seems to involve chains of CCV units.

The [[free morpheme|free form]] of any Leti morpheme always features a final vowel, so those whose [[bound form]]s end in consonants feature two allomorphs which are related by CV metathesis. Thus 'skin, fly (n.), fish, bird' have bound forms {{IPA|/ulit, llaran, iina, maanu/}} (the latter two with long vowels) but free forms {{IPA|/ulti, llarna, ian, maun/}}.

When a morpheme whose bound form ends in a vowel is prefixed to another component, that final vowel may apocopate or metathesise into the following component.  CV metathesis happens when the metathesising vowel is high and it's followed by at most one consonant and a nonhigh vowel. The metathesised vowel is realised as a glide, {{IPA|[j w]}} written as ''ï ü''.  Thus ''sivi + ternu'' 'chicken + egg' becomes ''sivtïernu'' 'chicken egg', ''au + laa'' 1st sing. pronoun + 'go' becomes ''alüaa'' 'I go'.  In other contexts apocope happens, unless this would leave an illicit three-consonant cluster. So ''sivi + ruri'' 'chicken + bone' becomes ''sivruri'' 'chicken bone', ''kusa + nama'' 'cat + tongue' becomes ''kusnama'' 'cat's tongue'.

A similar metathesis is found with the nominaliser, historically an infix ''-in-'', but now taking the form ''-nï-'' among many other allomorphs (detailed more below): thus ''sora'' 'sew' derives ''snïora'' 'needle'.

== Grammar ==

=== Morphology ===

Human nouns pluralise with the third person plural pronominal clitic ''-ra'', which must follow another suffixed element: ''püata'' 'woman', ''püat=e'' 'the woman', ''püat=e=ra'' 'the women'.  Nonhuman nouns pluralise by repetition: ''kuda'' 'horse', ''kuda kuda'' 'horses'.

Leti has four [[possessive suffix]]es, which undergo binding. 
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! 1st
| ''-ku''
| ''-n''V
|-
! 2nd
| ''-mu''
| ''-mi''
|-
! 3rd
| colspan="2" | ''-n''V
|}
The vowel V in the first person plural and third person suffix copies the last vowel of its base.

Nouns can be [[zero derivation|zero-derived]] to verbs: e.g. ''rita'' 'roof' → ''na-rita'' 'he roofs' or 'it has a roof'.

Nominal [[compounding]] is highly productive as a derivational process.  Some examples are ''rai + lavna'' 'king' + 'big' → ''ralïavna'' 'emperor', ''pipi + ïadmu'' 'goat' + 'shed' → ''pipïadmu'' 'goat shed', ''vutu + müani'' 'ribbon' + 'man' → ''vutumüani'' 'man's ribbon', ''vika + papa'' 'buttocks' + 'cucumber' → ''vikpapa'' 'cockroach', ''kapla + nèma'' reduplicated 'ship' + 'fly' → ''kapalnèmnèma'' 'airplane'.

Verbs fall into two classes according to whether their subject prefixes exhibit binding or not: those of Class I do not, those of Class II do.  By default verbs are in Class II.  Certain verbs are lexically in Class I (like ''nòa'' 'advise'), together with all verbs with complex onsets (''ssòrna'' 'cough') and denominal or causativised verbs
(''veli'' 'buy', from the noun ''veli'' 'price').  The subject prefixes are as follows. 
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! 1st exclusive
| ''u-''
| ''ma-''
|-
! 1st inclusive
| style="background-color: #bbbbbb" |
| ''ta-''
|-
! 2nd
| ''mu-''
| ''mi-''
|-
! 3rd
| ''na-''
| ''ra-''
|-
! relative
| colspan="2" | ''ka-''
|}
Verbs with first person singular inflection necessarily take the pronoun ''a='' 'I' as a proclitic.

Some causatives are marked only by class change: ''pali'' means 'float' in class II and 'make float' in class I.

The [[nominalization|nominalising]] affix productively derives nouns from verbs.  It takes several different forms, most of which are [[infix]]es, depending on the phonological shape and the class of its base.  
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left"
! Form
! Example
! Class
! Conditions
|-
| ''nïa-''
| ''na-ltïeri'' 'he speaks' → ''nïaltïeri'' 'speaking'
| I
| general
|-
| ''i-'' + ''-ï-''
| ''na-nòa'' 'he advises' → ''inïòa'' 'advising'
| I
| only three verbs, all starting in ''n''
|-
| ''ï-''
| ''n-odi'' 'he carries' → ''ïodi'' 'load, carrying-pole'
| II
| vowel-initial
|-
| ''nï-''
| ''n-odi'' 'he carries' → ''nïodi'' 'act of carrying'
| II
| vowel-initial, nominalises the act when ''ï-'' yields an instrument sense
|-
| ''-nï-''
| ''m-pali'' 'it floats' → ''pnïali'' 'floating'
| II
| non-nasal non-alveolar initial consonant
|-
| ''-n-''
| ''m-pupnu'' 'he shuts' → ''pnupnu'' 'shutting'
| II
| form of ''-nï-'' before high vowels
|-
| ''-ï-''
| ''n-mai'' 'he comes' → ''mïai'' 'arrival'
| II
| nasal or alveolar initial consonant
|}

[[Reduplication]], which usually copies a root-initial CV or CVCV sequence with binding, has a variety of functions, among them adjectivisation of nouns (''üau'' 'idiot' → ''üa-üau'' 'idiotic') and verbs (''mèra'' 'redden' → ''mèr-mèra''), derivation of nouns, especially instruments (''sòra'' 'sew' → ''sòr-sòra'' 'needle'), marking [[atelic]]ity, and [[relativizer|relativising]] on an object (''n-vèèta'' 'he pulls' → ''(n-)vèvèèta'' 'which he pulls').

== Vocabulary ==

=== Lexical parallelism ===
Many of Leti's lexical items are organised into '''lexical pairs''',
which are always deployed as fixed combinations in a fixed order.  
A few pairs involve adjectives or numerals, but the
vast majority consist of nouns (e.g. ''püata // müani'' 'woman // man', 
''üèra // vatu'' 'water // stone') or verbs
(e.g. ''kili // toli'' 'look // see', ''keri // kòi'' 'scratch / scrape').

Some words are confined to lexical pairs, 
such as ''tirka'' in ''tirka // llena'' 'lightning', 
or both ''dupla'' and ''mavla'' in ''dupla // mavla'' 'witchcraft';
these pairs are restricted to ''lirmarna''.
In ''lirmarna'' the function of lexical pairs is to
highlight particular elements of a sentence, or simply to mark formality.  
When used in ordinary speech, the meanings of
lexical pairs can relate in various ways to those of their components:
: ''leli // masa'' 'ivory // gold', meaning 'treasure'
: ''lòi // spou'' '[[proa]] // sailing boat', meaning 'traditional fleet'
: ''nusa // rai'' 'island // mainland', meaning 'archipelago'
: ''ili // vatu'' 'hill // stone', meaning 'fort'
: ''püata // müani'' 'woman // man', meaning either 'married couple' or 'gender'
Or they can simply have the sense of a conjunction, e.g.
''asu // vavi'' 'dog // pig' = 'the dog and the pig';
these are the only sort of conjoined phrases that do not require
the conjunction ''na''.

== History ==

The phones of Luangic-Kisaric continue those of 
[[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]] according to the following sound changes (based on Mills 2010).&lt;ref&gt;R. Mills, ''Three common misconceptions about Proto-Lettic (Luangic-Kisar)'', in Fedorchuk &amp; Chlenova (eds.), ''Studia Anthropologica: a festschrift in honour of Michael Chlenov'' (2010), pp. 284–296. [https://www.scribd.com/doc/49379918/michael-chlenov-jubileum-volume]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Western Leti, LK {{IPA|*/ʔ/}} has vanished and
LK {{IPA|*/a/}} from MP *e is manifested as {{IPA|/o/}}.
In Eastern Leti, LK {{IPA|*/s/}} becomes {{IPA|/h/}}
and LK {{IPA|*/u/}} becomes {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in the penult before a low vowel.

Roger Mills suggests that Luangic-Kisaric retained distinct reflexes of PMP *ŋ, on the basis of other languages in the family, and *Z.  Moreover, although the status of *Z as a PMP phoneme is unclear — Mills along with [[John U. Wolff]] and [[Robert Blust]] no longer admit it, realigning it with *z — the Luangic languages have no clear examples of inherited *z, despite numerous examples of *Z &gt; {{IPA|/t/}}.

Mills explains the metathesis found in consonant-final basis
as arising from an original [[echo vowel]] added to consonant-final forms,
e.g. *''kúlit'' 'skin' &gt; ''kúliti'', after which the original
post-tonic vowel was deleted, e.g. yielding ''kúlti'' &gt; Leti ''ulti''.

Jonker (1932) was the first full-scale investigation of Leti, based on a native informant and the few 19th-century works on the language then available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Examples ==
The following paragraph is the opening of the Sailfish story as told by Upa S. Manina of ''Talvunu // Resïara'' house in the Ilwiaru quarters in Tutukei and reproduced in van Engelenhoven (2004). The Sailfish story is of great importance to Leti society: it provides an origin story for the Leti 'boat owner clans' of Luang origin, describing the destruction of the mythical former Luang continent and the migrations that brought its inhabitants to Leti.

'''Leti'''
# ''Ululude müani ida mpatròme püata idalo Lïòno.''
# ''Apo rasaamme.''
# ''Rasaappo raorïaambo ira aanne ria vòruo.''
# ''Kòkkòi müani vòrupo nïaulu nvava Retïelüai, üari nvava Sairmòraso.''
# ''Apo kòkkòi rmapo rapninmüaato.''
# ''Ne rakkusalkaitmaato.''
# ''Ne inne nmatio.''

'''English'''
# In olden times a man begot a woman on Luang.
# So they married.
# They married and begot two children.
# It was two boys and the firstborn was named Retieluai, the youngest was named Sairmoras.
# So the children did not know anything yet.
# They were still very little.
# And their mother died.

[[Crisis hotline|Suicide crisis lines]] can be found in many countries worldwide. Many are geared to a general audience while others are specific to a select demographic such as [[LGBT]] youth, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Aboriginal Canadian]] youth. There have been studies in the United States&lt;ref&gt;Gould MS, Kalafat J, Harrismunfakh JL, ''et al.'' An evaluation of crisis hotline outcomes. Part 2: Suicidal callers. Suicide Life Threat Behav. 2007 Jun;37(3):338-52. {{PMID|1757954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia&lt;ref&gt;King R, Nurcombe B, Bickman L, Hides L, ''et al.'' Telephone counselling for adolescent suicide prevention: changes in suicidality and mental state from beginning to end of a counselling session. Suicide Life Threat Behav. 2003 Winter;33(4):400-11. {{PMID|14695055}}&lt;/ref&gt; which show that suicide crisis lines may help people who feel like killing or hurting themselves and may make them feel better.
One of the first suicide crisis lines was the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], founded in the United Kingdom in 1953 by the Rev. [[Chad Varah]], the then Rector of the former St. Stephen's Church in London. He decided to start a 'listening service' after reading a sermon at the grave of a 13-year-old girl who had committed suicide. She was in distress prior to her death and had no one to talk to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samaritans.org/media_centre/latest_press_releases/chad_biography.aspx Samaritans:Chad Varah{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209033628/http://www.samaritans.org/media_centre/latest_press_releases/chad_biography.aspx |date=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feudal status}}
A '''mesne lord''' was a [[lord]] in the [[feudal]] system who had [[vassal]]s who held land from him, but who was himself the vassal of a higher lord. A mesne lord did not hold land directly of the [[monarch|king]], that is to say he was not a [[tenant-in-chief]]. His [[subinfeudation|subinfeudated]] estate was called a "mesne estate" or ''[[Afterlehen]]'' in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He was thus an intermediate or "middle" tenant, which status is reflected in the medieval French word ''mesne'', in modern French ''moyen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=An historical introduction to the land law page 105 &amp; page 106| author=Sir William Searle | work=Google Books Preview| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NscKQr-aqNIC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=mesne+lord&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hgjzUJlaII&amp;sig=kcA1p8sAx4037Hn5imxTY5RCg1A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tKxMTMPuLJKy0gSYoOmECw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgK#v=snippet&amp;q=mesne%20lord&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mesne lords continued to exist after the abolition of any further [[subinfeudation]] by the statute of [[Quia Emptores]], with time and the loss of records (except in the case of former [[copyhold]] land), it came to be assumed that most land was held directly of the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry, Wade and Harpum (2012), ''The Law of Real Property (8th Edition)'', 2-018 (p.29)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/3855/1/1413-1612-1-SM.pdf Does feudalism have a role in 21st century land law? (Charles Harpum)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Escheat]] in want of heirs to mesne lords was abolished by the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Estates Act 1925 s. 45(1)(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile phone overuse''' ('''smartphone addiction''', '''mobile-phone addiction''',  '''problem mobile phone use''', or '''mobile phone dependency''') is a [[Psychological dependence|dependence syndrome]] seen among [[mobile phone]] users. Some mobile phone users exhibit problematic behaviors related to [[substance use disorder]]s. These behaviors can include preoccupation with mobile communication, excessive money or time spent on mobile phones, use of mobile phones in socially or physically inappropriate situations such as driving an automobile. Increased use can also lead to increased time on mobile communication, adverse effects on relationships, and [[anxiety]] if separated from a mobile phone or sufficient signal.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
&lt;!-- Please don't rename the article to "Mobile phone addiction" or "Smartphone addiction". Not all overusers are addicts. —User:Unforgettableid --&gt;

==Definition==

Overuse is often defined as a "dependence syndrome", which is the term used by the World Health Organization (WHO Expert Committee, 1964) to replace ''addiction'' or ''habituation.''&lt;ref name="WHO, substance"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=WHO |title= Management of substance abuse: Dependence Syndrome |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |year= |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/definition1/en }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is categorized either as substance abuse, such as from psychoactive drugs, alcohol and tobacco under ICD-10, or a behavioral addiction, such as a mobile phone addiction.&lt;ref name=Davey,2014&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Davey S, Davey A |title= Assessment of Smartphone Addiction in Indian Adolescents: A Mixed Method Study by Systematic-review and Meta-analysis Approach |journal= J Prev Med  |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=1500–1511 |year=2014 |pmid=25709785 |doi= |pmc=4336980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substance use disorders can be defined by 11 factors, according to the DSM-5, including: (1) use in larger quantities or for longer than initially intended, (2) a desire to cut down or control use, (3) spending a great deal of time obtaining, using, or recovering from the substance, (4) craving, (5) use in situations in which it is physically hazardous, (6) continued use of the substance despite adverse physical or psychological consequences associated with use, and (7) withdrawal symptoms.&lt;ref name="AMA,2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|author= American Psychiatric Association |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |journal= American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC, USA |volume=5th edition |issue= |pages= |year=2013 |pmid= |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphone addiction can be compared to substance use disorders in that smartphones provide the drug (entertainment and connection) while acting as the means by which the drug is consumed. A study conducted at Alabama State University on the effects of smartphones on students, defines the issue by stating that we are not addicted to smartphones themselves, but that we "are addicted to the information, entertainment, and personal connections [that a smartphone] delivers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emanuel|first=Richard|date=2015|title=The Truth about Smartphone Addiction|journal=College Student Journal|volume=49|pages=291|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Emanuel/publication/281243425_The_truth_about_smartphone_addiction/links/55dcc25008ae591b309ab7ae.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have an affinity for constant entertainment, and smartphones provide the quickest, most easily accessible route to it.

==Prevalence==
[[File:壁向きカウンター席 (23432952720).jpg|thumb|Customers using their smartphones at a restaurant in [[Japan]]]]

Prevalence of mobile phone overuse depends largely on definition and thus the scales used to quantify a subject's behaviors. Two scales are in use, the 20-item self-reported Problematic Use of Mobile Phones (PUMP) scale,&lt;ref name=Merlo,2013&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Merlo LJ, Stone AM, Bibbey A |title= Measuring Problematic Mobile Phone Use: Development and Preliminary Psychometric Properties of the PUMP Scale |journal= J Addict. |volume= 2013|issue= |pages= 912807|year=2013 |pmid=24826371 |doi=10.1155/2013/912807 |url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jad/2013/912807/ |pmc=4008508}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS), which have been used both with adult and adolescent populations. There are variations in the age, gender, and percentage of the population affected problematically according to the scales and definitions used. The prevalence among British adolescents aged 11–14 was 10%.&lt;ref name= Lopez-Fernandez,2014&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lopez-Fernandez O, Honrubia-Serrano L, Freixa-Blanxart M, Gibson W |title= Prevalence of problematic mobile phone use in British adolescents |journal= Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=91–98 |year=2014 |pmid=23981147 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0260 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, addiction is stated at 39-44% for this age group.&lt;ref name="Davey,2014"/&gt; Under different diagnostic criteria, the estimated prevalence ranges from 0 to 38%, with self-attribution of mobile phone addiction exceeding the prevalence estimated in the studies themselves.&lt;ref name="Pedrero_Pérez,2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Pedrero Pérez EJ, Rodríguez Monje MT, Ruiz Sánchez De León JM |title= Mobile phone abuse or addiction. A review of the literature |journal= Adicciones |volume=24 |issue= |pages=139–152 |year=2012 |pmid=22648317 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of the related problem of Internet addiction was 4.9-10.7% in Korea, and is now regarded as a serious public health issue.&lt;ref name=Koo,2014&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Koo HJ, Kwon JH |title=Risk and protective factors of internet addiction: a meta-analysis of empirical studies in Korea |journal=Yonsei Med J  |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=1691–1711 |year=2014 |pmid=25323910 |doi=10.3349/ymj.2014.55.6.1691|pmc=4205713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviors associated with mobile-phone addiction differ between genders.&lt;ref name=Roberts,2014&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Roberts JA, Yaya LH, Manolis C |title= The invisible addiction: cell-phone activities and addiction among male and female college students |journal=J Behav Addict. |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=254–265 |year=2014 |pmid=25595966 |doi=10.1556/JBA.3.2014.015|pmc=4291831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are more likely to develop addictive mobile phone behavior than men. Men experience less social stress than women and use their mobile phones less for social purposes. Older people are less likely to develop addictive mobile phone behavior because of different social usage, stress, and greater self-regulation.&lt;ref name=van_Deursen,2015&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=van Deursen AJAM |author2=Bolle CL |author3=Hegner SM |author4=Kommers PAM |title=Modeling habitual and addictive smartphone behaviour: The role of smartphone usage types, emotional intelligence, social stress, self-regulation, age, and gender |journal= Computers in Human Behavior |volume=45 |issue= |pages=411–420 |year=2015 |pmid= |doi= 10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.039|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214007626 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social===

There is an enormous impact of the mobile phone on contemporary society from a social scientific perspective. In his 2002 book ''Perpetual contact: mobile communication, private talk, public performance'',&lt;ref&gt;James E. Katz, and M. Akhus, ''Perpetual contact: Mobile communication, private talk, public performance'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the author, James Katz, writes: "They [mobile phones] have transformed social practices and changed the way we do business, yet surprisingly we have little perception on their effect in our [lives]."

Some people are replacing face-to-face conversations with cybernetic ones. Clinical psychologist Lisa Merlo says, "Some patients pretend to talk on the phone or fiddle with apps to avoid eye contact or other interactions at a party."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, E. (27 July 2011). Smartphone dependency: a growing obsession with gadgets. Retrieved 27 September 2013 from USA Today website: http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/medical/health/medical/mentalhealth/story/2011/07/Smartphone-dependency-a-growing-obsession-to-gadgets/49661286/1 {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey made by Gazelle, "More than 25% of respondents reported that they 'almost always' use their smartphone while in a social setting such as during a meal or during a party. In addition, 58% said they use it 'usually' or 'occasionally' during these settings."&lt;ref&gt;Belardi, B. (Ed.). (18 June 2012). Consumers Crave iPhone More Than Facebook, Sex. Retrieved 15 October 2013 from PR Newswire website: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumers-crave-iphone-more-than-facebook-sex-according-to-gazelle-159430685.html {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore,
*70% check their phones in the morning within an hour of getting up.
*56% check their phones before going to bed.
*48% check their phones over the weekend.
*51% constantly check their phones during vacation.
*44% reported they would feel very anxious and irritable if they did not interact with their phones within a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perlow|first=Leslie A.|title=Sleeping with your smartphone : how to break the 24/7 habit and change the way you work|date=2012|publisher=Harvard Business Review Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=9781422144046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This change in style from face-to-face to text-based conversation has also been observed by [[Sherry Turkle]]. Her work cites connectivity as an important trigger of social behavior change regarding communication;&lt;ref name="Turkle 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Turkle |first=Sherry |date=2011|title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from each Other|publisher=Basic Books, Inc., New York, NY, USA.|page=241|ISBN=9780465010219}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, this adaptation of communicating is not caused only by the phone itself. In her book, ''Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other'', Turkle argues that we now find ourselves in a state of "continual co-presence."&lt;ref name="turkle 161"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other|last=Turkle|first=Sherry|publisher=Basic Books|year=2011|isbn=9780465010219|location=New York|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that digital communication allows the occurrence of two or more realities in the same place and time. Subsequently, we also live in a "world of [[Continuous partial attention|continual partial attention]],"&lt;ref name="turkle 161"/&gt; the process of paying simultaneous attention to a number of sources of incoming information, but at a superficial level. Bombarded with an abundance of emails, texts, messages, we not only find ourselves divesting people of their human characteristics or individuality, but also increasingly treating them as digital units. This is often referred to as depersonalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/depersonalize|title=the definition of depersonalize|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Elliot Berkman, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon, the constant checking of our phones is caused by reward learning and the [[fear of missing out]]. Berkman explains that, “Habits are a product of reinforcement learning, one of our brain's most ancient and reliable systems,” and we tend, thus, to develop habits of completing behaviors that have rewarded us in the past.&lt;ref name="Baral"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/164230/how-to-break-the-habit-of-checking-your-phone-all-the-time#.3hArQiBBa|title=How to Break the Habit of Checking your Phone all the Time|last=Baral|first=Susmita|date=January 4, 2017|website=Mic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many, using our mobile phone has been enjoyable in the past, leading us to feel excited and positive when we receive a notification from our phones. Berkman also iterates that we often check our smartphones to relieve the social pressure we place upon ourselves to never miss out on exciting things. As Berkman says, “Smartphones can be an escape from boredom because they are a window into many worlds other than the one right in front of you,” helping us feel included and involved in society.&lt;ref name="Baral"/&gt; When we do not check our mobile phones, we are unable to satisfy this “check habit” or suppress the [[fear of missing out]]''',''' leading us to feel anxious and irritable. A survey conducted by Hejab M. Al Fawareh and Shaidah Jusoh also found that people also often feel incomplete without their smartphones. Of the 66 respondents, 61.41% strongly agreed or agreed with the statement, “I feel incomplete when my smartphone is not with me.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al Fawareh|first=Hejab M.|date=November 6, 2017|title=The Use and Effects of Smartphones in Higher Education|url=https://login.libproxy.scu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aci&amp;AN=126437395&amp;site=eds-live|journal=International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies|volume=11|pages=103–111|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other implications of cell phone use in mental health symptoms were observed by Thomée et al. in Sweden. This study found a relationship between report of mental health and perceived stress of participants' accessibility, which is defined as the possibility to be disturbed at any moment of day or night.&lt;ref name="Thomée 2011 66"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomée|first=Sara|author2=Härenstam, Annika |author3=Hagberg, Mats |title=Mobile phone use and stress, sleep disturbances, and symptoms of depression among young adults - a prospective cohort study|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=66|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence supporting the claim that excessive mobile phone use can cause or worsen health problems.

Germs are everywhere, and considering the number of times people interact with their cellphone under different circumstances and places, germs are very likely to transfer from one place to another. Research from the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] at Queen Mary in 2011 indicated that one in six cell phones is contaminated with fecal matter. Under further inspection, some of the phones with the fecal matter were also harboring lethal bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', which can result in fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Britt|first=Darice|title=Health Risks of Using Mobile Phones|url=http://source.southuniversity.edu/health-risks-of-using-mobile-phones-137310.aspx|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=South Carolina University|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article ''Mobile Phones and Nosocomial Infections,'' written by researchers at Mansoura University of Egypt, it states that the risk of transmitting the bacteria by the medical staff (who carry their cellphones during their shift) is much higher because cellphones act as a reservoir where the bacteria can thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ijic.info/article/view/9933/7114|title = Mobile phones and nosocomial infections|date = 2012|accessdate = 2015-04-21|website = |publisher = International Journal of Infection Control}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mobile phones and nosocomial infections|url = http://www.ijic.info/article/view/9933|journal = International Journal of Infection Control|date = 2012-03-26|access-date = 2015-04-21|issn = 1996-9783|volume = 8|issue = 2|first = Rawia Ibrahim|last = Badr|first2 = Hatem ibrahim|last2 = Badr|first3 = Nabil Mansour|last3 = Ali|doi=10.3396/ijic.v8i2.014.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancer, specifically brain cancer, and its correlation with phone use, is under ongoing investigation. Many variables affect the likelihood of hosting cancerous cells, including how long and how frequently people use their phones. There has been no definitive evidence linking cancer and phone use if used moderately, but the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the [[World Health Organization]] said in 2011 that radio frequency is a possible human carcinogen, based on heavy usage increasing the risk of developing [[glioma]] tumors.&lt;ref name="WHO, 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=World Health Organization: International Agency for Research on Cancer |title=IARC Classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans |journal= Press Release no. |volume=208 |issue= |pages= |year=2011 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a relationship has not been fully established, research is continuing based on leads from changing patterns of mobile phone use over time and habits of phone users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sinhna|first=Kounteya|title=Cell overuse can cause brain cancer|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Cell-overuse-can-cause-brain-cancer/articleshow/5942804.cms|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=The Times of India|date=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low level radio frequency radiation has also been confirmed as a promoter of tumors in mice.&lt;ref name="Lerchl,2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lerchl A, Klose M, Grote K, Wilhelm AF, Spathmann O, Fiedler T, Streckert J, Hansen V, Clemens M |title=Tumor promotion by exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields below exposure limits for humans |journal= Biochem Biophys Res Commun |volume= 459|issue= |pages= 585–90|year= |pmid=25749340 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.151|url= |date=Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Minor acute immediate effects of radio frequency exposure have long been known such as the [[Microwave auditory effect]] which was discovered in 1962.&lt;ref name="Frey,1962"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Frey AH |title=Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy |journal=J Appl Physiol |volume= 17 |issue= 4|pages= 689–692 |year=1962 |pmid=13895081 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a cell phone before bed can cause [[insomnia]], according to a study by scientists from the [[Karolinska Institute]] and [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden and from [[Wayne State University]] in Michigan. The study&lt;ref&gt;Arnetz, Bengt B.; Hillert, Lena; Åkerstedt, Torbjörn; Lowden, Arne; Kuster, Niels; Ebert, Sven; Boutry, Clementine; Moffat, Scott D.; Berg, Mats; Wiholm, Clairy.

Additional adverse health effects attributable to smartphone usage include a diminished quantity and quality of sleep due to an inhibited secretion of melatonin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janssen|first1=D.|title=Smartphone-induced sleep deprivation and its implications for public health|url=http://www.europeanpublichealth.com/news-and-opinion/smartphone-induced-sleep-deprivation-and-its-implications-for-public-health/|website=Europeanpublichealth.com|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, 58% of World Health Organization states advised the general population to reduce radio frequency exposure below heating guidelines. The most common advice is to use hands-free kits (69%), to reduce call time (44%), use text messaging (36%), avoid calling with low signals (24%) or use phones with low [[specific absorption rate]] (SAR) (22%).&lt;ref name="Dhungel,2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dhungel A, Zmirou-Navier D, van Deventer E |title=Risk management policies and practices regarding radio frequency electromagnetic fields: results from a WHO survey |journal=Radiat Prot Dosimetry |volume=164 |issue=1–2 |pages=22–27 |year=2015 |pmid=25394650 |doi=10.1093/rpd/ncu324 |pmc=4401037}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Taiwan banned toddlers under the age of two from using mobile phones or any similar electronic devices, and France banned WiFi from toddlers' nurseries.&lt;ref name="Le_Hir,2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pierre Le Hir |title=Une loi pour encadrer l'exposition aux ondes |journal=Le Monde |volume= |issue=29 January 2015 |pages= |year=2015 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2015/01/29/une-loi-pour-encadrer-l-exposition-aux-ondes_4565339_3244.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powerwatch,2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Powerwatch |title=Wifi banned from nurseries in France |journal= |volume= |issue=05/02/2015 |pages= |year=2015 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.powerwatch.org.uk/news/2015-02-05-france-wifi-restrictions.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the market increases to grow, more light is being shed upon the accompanying behavioural health issues and how mobile phones can be problematic. Mobile phones continue to become increasingly multifunctional and sophisticated, which this in turn worsens the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, L. and Liang, J., 2015. Mobile Phone Addiction. In Encyclopedia of Mobile Phone Behavior (pp. 640-647). IGI Global&lt;/ref&gt;

According to optician Andy Hepworth, blue violet light, a light that is transmitted from the cell phone into the eye is potentially hazardous and can be "toxic" to the back of the eye.  He states that an over exposure to blue violet light can lead to a greater risk of macular degeneration which is a leading cause of blindness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/26780069/smartphone-overuse-may-damage-eyes-say-opticians|title=Smartphone overuse may 'damage' eyes, say opticians - BBC Newsbeat|date=2014-03-28|website=BBC Newsbeat|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===

There are concerns that some mobile phone users incur considerable debt, and that mobile phones are being used to violate privacy and harass others.&lt;ref name="Psychological Predictors"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bianchi|first1=Adriana|last2=Phillips|first2=James G.|title=Psychological Predictors of Problem Mobile Phone Use|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/cpb.2005.8.39|journal=Cyberpsychology &amp; Behavior|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.|location=New York|year=2005|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1089/cpb.2005.8.39|pages=39–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is increasing evidence that mobile phones are being used as a tool by children to [[Cyber Bullying|bully]] other children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/article/cyberbullying-increases-in-line-with-mobile-phone-usage-infographic/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a large amount of research on mobile phone use, and its positive and negative influence on the human's psychological mind and social communication. Mobile phone users may encounter stress, sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression, especially young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Are Smartphones Bad For Our Youth? |url=https://www.theperspective.com/perspectives/living/smartphones-bad-youth/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=6 September 2017 |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consistent phone use can cause a chain reaction, affecting one aspect of a user's life and expanding to contaminate the rest. It usually starts with social disorders, which can lead to depression and stress and ultimately affect lifestyle habits such as sleeping right and eating right.&lt;ref name="Thomée 2011 66"/&gt;

According to research done by Jean M. Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, there is a correlation between mobile phone overuse and depression. According to Twenge and her colleagues, at the same time that smartphones were on the rise, there was also an increase seen in depressive symptoms and even suicides among adolescents in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/|title=Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?|last=Twenge|first=Jean|date=|website=The Atlantic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory behind this research is that adolescents who are being raised as a generation of avid smartphone users are spending so much time on these devices that they forgo actual human interaction which is seen as essential to mental health, “The more time teens spend looking at screens, the more likely they are to report symptoms of depression.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M. |last2=Joiner |first2=Thomas E. |last3=Rogers |first3=Megan L. |last4=Martin |first4=Gabrielle N. |title=Increases in Depressive Symptoms, Suicide-Related Outcomes, and Suicide Rates Among U.S. Adolescents After 2010 and Links to Increased New Media Screen Time |journal=Clinical Psychological Science |date=14 November 2017 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=3–17 |doi=10.1177/2167702617723376}}&lt;/ref&gt; While children used to spend their free time outdoors with others, with the advancement of technology, this free time is seemingly now being spent more on mobile devices.

Psychologist Nancy Colier makes the point that we all have lost sight of what is truly important to us in life. She says that people have become “disconnected from what really matters, from what makes us feel nourished and grounded as human beings.” &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/well/live/hooked-on-our-smartphones.html|title=Hooked on Our Smartphones|last=Brody|first=Jane E.|date=|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our addiction to technology has deterred neurological and relationship development because tech is being introduced to people at a very young age. People have become so addicted to their phones that they are almost dependent on them. Our bodies are not meant to be constantly staring at a screen as we need time to relax our eyes and more importantly our minds. Colier states,  “Without open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down — it’s in constant fight-or-flight mode. “We’re wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we’re not doing it.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The amount of time spent on screens appears to have a correlation with happiness levels. A nationally-representative study of American 12th graders funded by the ''National Institute on Drug Abuse''  titled ''Monitoring the Future Survey'' found that “teens who spent more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on non screen activities are more likely to be happy.'''”''' One of the most important findings of this study is how the amount of time spent on non screen activities versus on screen activities affects the happiness levels of teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/|title=Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|date=September 2017|website=The Atlantic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while it is easy to see a correlation between cell phone overuse and these symptoms of depression, anxiety, and isolation, it is much harder to prove that cell phones themselves cause these issues. Studies of correlations cannot prove causation because there are multiple other factors that increase depression in people today. Although parents and other figures share these concerns, according to Peter Etchells, a psychologist at Bath Spa University in England, other possible variables must be reviewed as well. Etchells proposes two possible alternative theories: depression could cause teens to use iphones more or teens could be more open to discussing the topic of depression in this day and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-investors-iphone-kids-depression-suicide-evidence|title=Apple investors say iPhones cause teen depression. Science doesn't|last=Turk|first=Victoria|date=|website=Wired|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey done by a group of independent opticians reviled that 43% of people under the age of 25 experienced anxiety or even irritation when they were not able to access their phone whenever they wanted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This survey shows the psychological effect that cell phones have on people, specifically young people.  Checking a cell phone has become a normal daily event for many people over the years just as getting dressed in the morning is, people don't feel right when they don't do it.

=== Distracted driving ===
Mobile phone overuse can be especially dangerous in certain situations such as texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving. Over 8 people are killed and 1,161 are injured daily because of distracted driving.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/dangers-texting-while-driving|title=The Dangers of Distracted Driving|date=2011-02-14|work=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At any given daylight moment across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or electronic devices while driving.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The significant number of injuries and accidents from distracted driving can be contributed at least partially to mobile phone overuse. There is currently no national ban on texting while driving, but many states have implemented laws to try to prevent these accidents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Tools==
German psychotherapist and online addiction expert Bert te Wildt recommends using tools such as Offtime and Menthal to help prevent mobile phone overuse.&lt;ref name="ZDF,2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=ZDF |title=Einfach mal abschalten -Suchtfaktor Smartphone |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |year= |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.zdf.de/volle-kanne/das-smartphone-abschalten-40149508.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many smartphone addiction activists (such as Tristan Harris) recommend turning one's phone screen to grayscale mode, which helps reduce time spent on mobile phones by making them boring to look at.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115015334/https://gogray.today/|title=Drop your Smartphone Addiction {{!}} Go Gray|date=2017-11-15|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many apps available on Android and iOS stores which help track mobile usage. For example, in iOS 12 Apple added a function called "Screen Time" that allows users to see how much time they have spent on the phone.&lt;ref name="Cnet,2018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/ios-12-screen-time-and-stronger-parental-controls/|title=iOS 12: Getting to know Screen Time and stronger parental controls|date=2018-09-17|work=CNET|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Winged Circle 7 of the Moorish Orthodox Church.jpg|350px|thumb|right|The generally-accepted flag of the Moorish Orthodox Church of America.]]

'''The Moorish Orthodox Church of America''' is a [[syncretism|syncretic]], [[religious pluralism|non-exclusive]], and [[religious anarchism|religious anarchist]] movement espousing a vast array of liturgical and devotional traditions laid over a theology that includes teachings gleaned from [[Moorish Science Temple of America|Moorish Science]], [[Five Percenters]], [[Theosophical mysticism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Episcopi vagantes]] movement, the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]], [[Western esotericism]], [[Discordianism]], the teachings of [[Noel Ignatiev]], [[Neotantra]], [[Nizari|Nizari Islam]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Sufism]] (particularly from the [[Sufi Order Ināyati]], [[Chishti]], [[Bektashi]] and [[Uwaisi]] traditions), [[Taoism]], and [[Vedanta]] teachings.

==History and development==
A lineage group of the [[Moorish Science Temple of America]], the Moorish Orthodox Church was founded in [[New York City]] in 1962 primarily by [[Warren Tartaglia]],&lt;ref name="Bowen2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick D. Bowen|title=A History of Conversion to Islam in the United States, Volume 1: White American Muslims before 1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYljCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320|date=17 August 2015|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]|isbn=978-90-04-30069-9|page=320|quote=Then, in 1962 one of the Baltimore group's young members, Warren Tartaglia, left the city to attend New York University, where he introduced the organization to Manhattan's white hipsters, including the man who would become one of the US' most influential non-orthodox Muslims: Peter Lamborn Wilson (Hakim Bey). The New York Group, which was named the Moorish Orthodox Church, would soon adapt other elements of Sufism...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[beatniks]], spiritual seekers, [[anarchists]] and members of the Noble Order of Moorish Sufis (a group that grew out of the Moorish Science Temple #13 in Baltimore on July 7, 1957).&lt;ref name="Gallagher2004"&gt;{{citation|author=Eugene V. Gallagher|title=The New Religious Movements Experience in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXoUYS4H1GsC&amp;pg=PA135|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32807-7|page=135|quote=Another group that traces its origins to the work of Noble Drew Ali is the Moorish Orthodox Church of America. Despite its claim to Orthodoxy, the group, which was started by a handful of white poets and jazz musicians in the 1950s in Washington, D.C., developed a thoroughly eclectic theology.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moorish Orthodox Church of America published a journal entitled the ''Moorish Science Monitor'' from 1965-1967, which has been revived at times over the next few decades, including its most recent revival in 2017.&lt;ref name="McCloud2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aminah Beverly McCloud|title=African American Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfkJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201|date=16 July 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-64937-0|page=201|quote=The last ''Moorish Science Monitor'', according to Peter Lamborn Wilson, appeared in 1966, but the journal was revived in 1986. It is the publication of the Moorish Orthodox Church of America which was "founded in the late 1950s by Europeans who (according to oral sources) had obtained Moorish Science Temple passports as 'Celts' or 'Persians." (''Sacred Drift'', 49).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moorish Orthodoxy was founded to explore the more esoteric dimensions of Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science teachings, but quickly developed into a movement of spiritual exploration beyond its intended purpose, though it maintains Moorish Science as its core. After a long period of quiescence, the Moorish Orthodox Church of America experienced a small renaissance in the mid-1980s owing to the involvement of former members of the [[Beat generation|beat]]/[[beatnik]] movement, the counter-cultural [[hippie]] community, and the [[gay liberation]] movement, along with the continued involvement of [[Sultan Rafi Sharif Bey]] (who founded the Moorish League) and the prolific writings of [[Hakim Bey]].

==Modern revival==
After the death of Sultan Rafi Sharif Bey and the disassociation and controversy involving [[Hakim Bey]], membership decreased substantially to only a handful of members internationally. In 1991, the Khalwat-i-Khidr Lodge of Moorish Orthodox Church was founded in [[Dallas, Texas]] by a disparate coalition of artists, musicians, rocket scientists, cybermeticists, alternative mystics, and the like. Yehoodi El and Mustafa al-Layla are regarded to be the "leaders" of this new revival of Moorish Orthodoxy through their founding of Khalwat-i-Khidr Lodge, the re-publishing of the Moorish Science Monitor, the establishment of a Dallas radio segment known as the Moorish Radio Flyer on the Mansion of Madness radio show, and by bringing the Moorish Orthodox Church of America to social media, which has been its main avenue of promulgation to this day. Modern Moorish Orthodoxy has been further influenced by and has influenced different movements such as [[Chaos Magic]], [[Punk subculture]], [[Rave]], [[Thelema]], and other non-conformist seekers desiring to embrace a spiritual tradition with an anarchist ethos. 

==Structure==
Moorish Orthodoxy embraces an anarchist model of organization, believing strongly in the concept that "you are, each one, a priest, just for yourself" as proclaimed in the Circle 7 Koran. As such, temples are mostly self-declared and/or choose to affiliate themselves and derive their "authority" through another temple and/or an autonomous charter-granting body. These temples also range in size (from one person to near a hundred), focus (Judaism, Christianity, Moorish Science, Zoroastrianism, Islam, etc.), membership credentials (the most popular being the "spiritual passport"), and name (lodge, temple, ashram, church, chapel, etc.) The most "organized" portions of Moorish Orthodoxy tend to be its Adept Chamber, in which bodies are established for the formal study and exploration of both the core and fringes of various spiritual systems. The current bodies of the Adept Chamber are the Order of the Paraclete (Christian), the Fatamid Order (Islam), the Order of Jerusalem (Judaism), the Sabian Order (Paganism and Western Esotericism), with their own initiation rites and rituals.

The '''Italian honours system''' is a means to reward achievements or service to the [[Italian Republic]], formerly the [[Kingdom of Italy]] including the [[Italian Social Republic]].

== Orders of chivalry ==

=== Current ===
There are five [[orders of knighthood]] awarded in recognition of service to the [[Italian Republic]]. Below these sit a number of other decorations, associated and otherwise, that do not confer knighthoods. However, the Royal [[House of Savoy]], Italy's former Royal Family, also continues to bestow knighthoods in three orders of chivalry previously recognised by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

The degrees of knighthood, not all of which apply to all orders, are Knight (''Cavaliere'' abbreviated ''Cav.''), Officer (''Ufficiale'' abbreviated ''Uff.''), Commander (''Commendatore'' abbr. ''Comm.''), Grand Officer (''Grand'Ufficiale'', abbr. ''Gr. Uff.''), Knight Grand Cross (''Cavaliere di Gran Croce'', abbr. ''Cav. Gr. Croce'') and Knight Grand Cross with cordon (''Cavaliere di Gran Croce con cordone''). Italian citizens may not use within the territory of the Republic honours or distinctions conferred on them by non-national orders or foreign states, unless authorised by decree of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]]. The use of awards of the [[Holy See]] (including the [[Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre]]) is subject to permission,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See Royal Decree No. 974 of 10 July 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; while the use of those of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] is unregulated.

The Order of Merit of the Italian Republic effectively replaced as national orders the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (1362), the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1572) and the Order of the Crown of Italy (1868), which the sovereign, as ''[[fons honorum]]'', did not abdicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnicg.net/regno.asp?strRefUrl=http://www.cnicg.net/orders.asp&amp;strRefNome=Ordini%20Cavallereschi%20Italiani |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mvz65POp?url=http://www.cnicg.net/regno.asp?strRefUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnicg.net%2Forders.asp&amp;strRefNome=Ordini%20Cavallereschi%20Italiani |archivedate=20 January 2010 |title=Ordini Cavallereschi del Regno d'Italia |publisher=[[Corpo della Nobiltà Italiana]] |language=Italian |accessdate=10 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today these continue merely as dynastic orders of the Royal House in exile. While their bestowal is suppressed by law in Italy, the use of those decorations conferred prior to 1951 is recognised, exclusive of any right of precedence in official ceremonies.&lt;ref name=OMRI&gt;[http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/cerimoniale/onorificenze_araldica/onorificenze/normativa/legge178_1951.html Law No. 178 of 3 March 1951] ''Istituzione dell'Ordine "Al Merito della Repubblica Italiana" e disciplina del conferimento e dell'uso delle onorificenze'' (Institution of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic and discipline of the conferment and the use of honours), published in [[Gazzetta Ufficiale]] No. 73, 30 March 1951 (in Italian).&lt;/ref&gt;

|The ''Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana'' (OMRI), instituted in 1951, is the highest ranking honour and most senior order of the Republic. It is awarded in five degrees for "merit acquired by the nation" in the fields of literature, the arts, economy, public service, and social, philanthropic and humanitarian activities and for long and conspicuous service in civilian and military careers.&lt;ref name=OMRI/&gt; Save in exceptional circumstances, no one may be awarded a rank higher than Knight in the first instance.

[[Investiture]] normally takes place on 2 June, the anniversary of the [[Birth of the Italian Republic|foundation of the Republic]] (celebrated in Italy as [[Festa della Repubblica]]) and on 27 December, the anniversary of the promulgation of the [[Italian Constitution]]. The badge bears the inscription ''Al Merito della Repubblica'' encircling the [[Coat of arms of Italy|national emblem]] on the obverse and ''Patriae Unitati'' and ''Civium Libertati'' encircling the head of [[Italia Turrita]] on the reverse. The order is bestowed by decree of the [[President of the Italian Republic]], as head of the orders of knighthood, on the recommendation of the President of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/cerimoniale/onorificenze_araldica/documentazione/sistema_onorifico_rep_it.pdf| title= The Italian Honours Procedure| publisher= Presidency of the Council of Ministers, Department of Protocol| accessdate=5 October 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest of its five degrees may also be awarded for peacetime actions.

An '''outer bailey''' or '''outer ward''' is the defended outer enclosure of a [[castle]].&lt;ref name=SF&gt;Friar, Stephen (2003). ''The Sutton Companion to Castles'', Sutton Publishing, Stroud, 2003, p. 22. {{ISBN|978-0-7509-3994-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It protects the [[inner bailey]] and usually contains those ancillary buildings used for the management of the castle or the supply of its occupants. These domestic buildings could include [[workshops]], [[livestock]] stalls and [[stables]]; storage facilities such as [[barn]]s, [[shed]]s and [[granaries]], as well as quarters for [[servant]]s such as [[maids]], [[farm worker]]s, and even the castle governors or [[castellan]]s. In many cases there was also a [[brewery]], a [[bakehouse]] and a [[kitchen]], if the latter was not located in the hall or ''[[palas]]''.&lt;ref name="caboga33" /&gt; An outer bailey was often called a '''base court''' in England. Depending on topography it could also be referred to as a '''lower bailey''' or '''lower ward''', the keep being in the [[upper bailey]] or ward. [[Chepstow Castle]] has lower, middle and upper baileys.&lt;ref name=SF/&gt;

The domestic buildings of the continental ''[[schloss]]'', often a stately home or palace, may also be referred to as an outer ward (German: ''Vorburg''). These frequently contained a [[carriage house]] or a [[cavalier house]], buildings that were not common in medieval castles. Large castles often have more than one bailey; examples include [[Monschau Castle|Monschau]] and [[Bürresheim Castle|Bürresheim]]. At some larger castles, markets were held in the outer bailey (c.f. ''[[suburbium]]'').

Outer baileys were usually enclosed and protected by a [[ring wall]] and separated from the actual living area of the castle – the inner ward and keep – by a [[moat]], a wall and a gate.

In [[lowland castle]]s, the outer bailey is usually arranged in a half-moon shape around the main castle. In the case of [[hill castle]]s, the topographic features of the terrain had to be taken account of, with the result that the outer bailey was usually slightly lower than the inner ward, hence the alternative names of "lower bailey" or "lower ward". [[Rudelsburg Castle]] in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] is one of the rare cases of a hill castle where both baileys are at the same level.

In many cases the main entrance to the inner living quarters led through the outer bailey, which thus formed a kind of defensive buffer and often also served as refuge for the villagers who lived outside the castle walls. This explains why the [[castle chapel]] was often found in the bailey: it served as the parish church for the [[commoner]]s.

The '''Pamunu''' people were [[tenant farmers]] of [[rice paddy|rice paddies]] in [[Sri Lanka]]'s history. They are sometimes referred to as a sub-caste of the [[Govigama]] [[caste]].

==History==
Ancient rock inscriptions of Sri Lanka and historical literature refer to this community as ''Pamunu Parapuru'' in contexts such as ''vahal, sarak, pamunu parapuru'', which translates into English as "slaves, oxen and heritable agricultural labour" (EZ III.87,105,126&amp; 132).

Based on their region of residence these communities have now been mostly absorbed by the [[Bathgama]] or [[Govigama]] [[Caste in Sri Lanka|castes]]. The word Pamunu still survives in Sri Lankan family names and place names such as ''Pamunugama'', ''Pamunuvita'', and Pamunuva''. However, in the 20th century many of these have been changed to ''Bamunu'', to convey an association with [[Brahmin]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61462">The '''platform economy''' is economic and social activity facilitated by platforms. Such platforms are typically online [[Matchmaking|matchmakers]] or technology frameworks. Sometimes are refereed as digital platform, two sided market (see recent review paper on digital platform &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Asadullah |first1=Ahmad |last2=Faik |first2=Isam |last3=Kankanhalli |first3=Atreyi |title=Digital Platforms: A Review and Future Directions |journal=PACIS Proceedings |date=2018 |url=https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2018/248/}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  By far the most common type are "transaction platforms", also known as "digital matchmakers". Examples of transaction platforms include [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Airbnb]], [[Uber]] and [[Baidu]]. A second type is the "innovation platform", which provides a common technology framework upon which others can build, such as the many independent developers who work on [[Microsoft]]'s platform.

Forerunners to contemporary digital economic platforms can be found throughout history, especially in the second half of the 20th century. Yet it was only in the year 2000 that the "platform" metaphor started to be widely used to describe digital matchmakers and innovation platforms. Especially after the financial crises of 2008, companies operating with the new "platform business model" have swiftly came to control an increasing share of the world's overall economic activity, sometimes by disrupting traditional business. Examples include the decline of [[BlackBerry Limited|BlackBerry]] and [[Nokia]] due to competition from platform companies, the closing down of [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] due to competition from the [[Netflix]] platform, or the many other [[brick and mortar]] retailers that have closed in part due to competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Platform expert [[David S. Evans]] wrote that in 2015, three of the top five companies in the world used the platform business model, as did seven of the ten top start up companies. Traditional businesses need not always be harmed by platforms however; they can even benefit by creating their own or making use of existing third party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by [[Accenture]] "81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years." In the year 2000 there were only a handful of large firms that could be described as platform companies. As of 2016, there were over 170 platform companies valued at US$1 billion or more. The creation and usage of digital platforms is also increasing in the government and [[NGO]] sectors.

The rise of platforms has been met by a mixed response from commentators. Many have been enthusiastic, arguing that platforms can improve productivity, reduce costs, reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, provide flexibility and accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Arguments against platforms include that they may worsen [[technological unemployment]], that they contribute to the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection, that they can worsen declining tax revenues, and that excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. Since the early 2010s, the platform economy has been the subject of many reviews by academic groups and [[NGO]]s, by national governments and by trans national organisations like the [[EU]]. Early reviews were generally against the imposition of heavy regulation for the platform economy. Since 2016, and especially in 2017, some jurisdictions began to take a more interventionist approach.

==Platform definition==
The 'platform' metaphor has long been used in a variety of ways. In the context of ''platform economy'', 21st century usage of the word platform sometimes refers solely to online matchmakers{{spaced endash}} such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit etc. Academic work and some business books often use the term in a wider sense, to include non-digital matchmakers like a business park or a nightclub, and also to other entities whose function is not primarily to support transactions. Platforms scholars Professor Carliss Y. Baldwin and Dr C. Jason Woodard have offered a generalised definition of economic platforms where the focus was on the technical side of the platform: "a set of stable components that support variety and evolvability in a system by constraining the linkages among the other components".&lt;ref name="Gawer 2010 loc= Chpt. 2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gawer|2010|loc= Chpt. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodard and Baldwin have stated that at a high level of abstraction, the architecture of all platforms is the same: a system partitioned into a set of core components with low variety and a complementary set of peripheral components with high variety.&lt;ref name="Gawer 2010 loc= Chpt. 2"/&gt;. Others define it based on the ecosystem perspective where the focus was on the actors around the platform ecosystem (e.g., buyers, sellers). To view all available definitions see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Asadullah |first1=Ahmad |last2=Faik |first2=Isam |last3=Kankanhalli |first3=Atreyi |title=Digital Platforms: A Review and Future Directions |journal=PACIS Proceedings |date=2018 |url=https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2018/248/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The platform economy==
Also known as the ''digital platform'' or ''online platform economy'', the '''platform economy''' is the economic and social activity facilitated by platforms. Such activity is wider than just commercial transactions, including for example online collaboration on projects such as Wikipedia. While scholarship on platforms sometimes includes discussion of non digital platforms, the term "platform economy" is often used in a sense that encompasses only online platforms.

===Relationship with similar digital economy terms===
"Platform economy" is one of a number of terms aiming to capture subsets of the overall economy which are now mediated by digital technology. The terms are used with diverse and sometimes overlapping meanings; some commentators use terms like "sharing economy" or "access economy" in such a broad sense they effectively mean the same thing. Other scholars and commentators do attempt to draw distinctions and use the various terms to delineate different parts of the wider digital economy. The term "platform economy" can be viewed as narrower in scope than "digital economy", but wider in scope than terms like "on demand economy", "sharing economy" or "gig economy". Several scholars have argued that "platform economy" is the preferable term for discussing several aspects of emergent digital phenomena in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name = "Implications"&gt;

====Digital economy==== 
The term [[Digital economy]] generally refers to all or nearly all economic activity relying on computers. As such it can be seen as having the widest scope; encompassing the platform economy, and also digital activities not mediated by actual platforms. For example, economic transactions completed solely by email, or exchanges over [[Electronic data interchange|EDIs]], some of which operate between only two companies so are too closed off to be considered platforms. Some scholars draw a distinction between platforms and earlier websites, excluding even sites such as [[Craigslist]] that are used to support economic transactions. Such sites can be considered outside the platform economy, not because they are too closed off, but as they are too open to be classed as platforms.&lt;ref name = "webDead"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====On-demand economy==== 
The terms "On-demand" or [[access economy]] are sometimes used in a broad sense, which would capture all activity from transaction platforms, and much else. Some commentators however assign the access economy a narrower definition, so that it excludes platforms in the sharing economy. Even when sharing and on-demand platforms are distinguished in this way however, they are still both included in the "platform economy".&lt;ref name ="perspective"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sharing economy====
The term [[sharing economy]] is also used with a broad range of scopes. Due to the positive connotations of the word "sharing", several platforms that don't involve sharing in the traditional sense of the word have still liked to define themselves as part of the sharing economy. Yet academic and some popular commentators define the sharing economy as only including activity that involves peer to peer transactions; in these narrow definition most of the platform economy is outside of the sharing economy.&lt;ref name ="perspective"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gig economy====
The ''Gig economy'' refers to various forms of temporary employment. The phrase is sometimes used with a broad scope, to include traditional offline temporary and contract work. In the narrow sense of the phrase, the gig economy refers solely to work mediated by online labour market platforms, for example [[PeoplePerHour]]. In this narrow sense, an important sub division is between physical jobs where the worker needs to be present in person{{spaced endash}} like Uber or most TaskRabbit work, and the so-called global "human cloud", where tasks can be done anywhere in the world (e.g. as with much [[Amazon Mechanical Turk|Mechanical Turk]] work.&lt;ref name ="allNames"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "neither"&gt;{{Cite news

Examples of innovation platforms also predate the internet era. Such as geographic regions famous for particular types of production, institutions like [[Harvard Business School]], or the [[Wintel]] technology platform that became prominent in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gawer 2010 loc= Chpt. 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gawer|2010|loc= Chpt. 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Internet===
The viability of large scale transaction platforms was vastly increased due to improvements in communication and connectedness brought about by the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc= Chpt. 1, pp. 19, 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online market platforms such as [[Craigslist]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some commentators on the platform economy draw a distinction between "web 1.0" sites such as Craigslist and modern platforms, but generally Craigslist is included as a platform.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[eBay]] were launched in the 1990s. Forerunners to modern social media and online collaboration platforms were also launched in the 1990s, &lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example [[Friends Reunited]] or [[Nupedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; with more successful platforms such as [[Myspace]] and [[Wikipedia]] emerging in the early 2000s. After the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], new types of online platforms have rose to prominence, including asset-sharing platforms such as [[Airbnb]], and labour market platforms such as [[TaskRabbit]].

==Scholarship==
According to the [[OED]], the word "platform" has been used since the 16th century, both in the concrete sense to refer to a raised surface, and as a metaphor. However it was only in the 1990s that the concept of economic platforms began to receive significant attention from academics. In the early 90s, such work tended to focus on innovation or product platforms, defined in a broad sense that did not focus on online activity. Even as late as 1998, there was little focus on transaction platforms, and according to professors [[David S. Evans]] and [[Richard L. Schmalensee]], the platform business model as it would be understood in the 21st century was not then recognised by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc= pp. 14, 15; Chpt 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawer 2010 loc= Chpt. 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gawer|2010|loc=pp. 20-23; Chpt. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first academic paper to address the platform business model and its application to digital matchmakers is said to be ''Platform Competition in Two-Sided Markets'' by Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean Tirole. &lt;ref group="note"&gt;While not published until 2003, the paper began circulating among academics in 2000. More recent academic work on platforms typically calls them 'multisided' rather than two sided, as some platforms have more than two distinct groups of users. See Evans(2016), Chap1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; One of the academics most responsible for connecting those working in the emerging field of platform scholarship was professor Annabelle Gawer; in 2008 she held the first international conference on platforms at London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gawer|2010|loc= Chpt. 1, p.8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The platform business model==
The platform business model involves profiting from a platform that allows two or more groups of users to interact. The model predates the internet; for example, a newspapers with a [[classified ads]] section effectively uses the platform business model. The emergence of digital technology has "turbocharged" the model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc=p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is by no means a sure path to success. While the most successful "born-social" firms can in just a few years achieve multibillion-dollar valuations, along with brand loyalty comparable to the largest traditional companies, most platform business start ups fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc=  Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Regulating"&gt;

Some companies are dedicated to the platform business model; for example, many so called born-social startups. Other companies can operate their own platform(s) yet still run much of their business on more traditional models. A third set of firms may not run their own platform, but still have a platform strategy for utilising third party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by Accenture, "81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years."

Some of the principles governing the operations of matchmaking platforms differ sharply when compared with traditional business models. The selling of products or services is central to most traditional businesses, whereas for transaction platforms, connecting different groups of users is the key focus. For example, a traditional mini cab company sells taxi services, whereas a platform company might connect drivers with passengers.&lt;ref name="welcome"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another distinguishing feature of the platform business model is that it emphasises [[network effects]], and the inter-dependence of demand between the different groups that use the platform. So with a platform business, it often makes sense to provide services free to one side of the platform, e.g. to the users of a social media service like Facebook. The cost of this subsidy is more than offset by the extra demand a large user base generates for the revenue generating side(s) of the platform (e.g. advertisers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc=  Chpt 1 &amp; 3; esp. pp.32-33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to authors Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson, [[BlackBerry Limited]] (formerly RIM) and [[Nokia]] lost massive market share to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]]'s Android in the early 2010s, as RIM and Nokia were acting as product companies in a world now best suited to platforms. As former Nokia CEO [[Stephen Elop]] wrote in 2011 "We’re not even fighting with the right weapons, ... The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems."&lt;ref name = "wipe out"&gt;{{Cite news

==Creating a digital platform==
Many books covering the platform economy devote chapters to the challenges involved in creating platforms: both for new platform startups, and for traditional organisations wishing to adopt a platform strategy. Some books are even dedicated just to certain aspects of operating a platform, such as nurturing ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tiwana|2013|loc= ''passim'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work involved in creating a platform can be broadly divided into elements relating to technical functionality and network effects; for many but not all platforms, a great deal of effort also needs to go into the cultivation of ecosystems.&lt;ref name = "How much"&gt;

|author= [[Courtney Boyd Myers]] 
|date= 2 December 2013
|accessdate=15 March 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical functionality===
Developing the core technical functionality can sometimes be unexpectedly cheap. [[Courtney Boyd Myers]] wrote in 2013 that a platform with the core functionality of Twitter could be developed almost for free. A person who already had a laptop could take a $160 [[Ruby on Rails]] course, spend about 10 hours writing the code, and then host the Twitter clone on a free [[Web hosting service]]. A service that would have a chance of attracting a good user base however, would need to be developed to at least the level of being a [[Minimum viable product]] (MVP). An MVP requires development well beyond a core set of technical functionality, for example it needs to have a well polished [[user experience]] layer. Boyd Meyers reported estimates that to develop a MVP for a platform like Twitter, the cost could range from $50,000 to $250,000, whereas for a platform needing more complex functionality such as Uber, the cost could range from $1 to $1.5 million.&lt;ref name = "How much"/&gt; This was in 2013, considerably more has since been spent on technical development for the Uber platform. For other platforms however, developing the needed technical functionality can be relatively easy. The more difficult task is to attract a large enough user base to ensure long term growth, in other words to create sufficient network effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc= Chp 2, Chpt 7, ''passim'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "How much"/&gt;

===Network effects===
{{Main|Network effects}}
Platforms tend to be a strong beneficiary of network effects; phenomena which can act to increase the value of a platform to all participants as more people join. Sometimes it makes sense for a platform to treat different sides of their network differently. For example, a trading platform relies on both buyers and sellers, and if there is say a shortage of buyers compared to the number of sellers, it might make sense for the platform operator to subsidize buyers, at least temporarily. Perhaps with free access or even with rewards for choosing to use the platform. Sometimes the benefits of network effects can be overestimated, such as with the so-called "grab all the eyeballs fallacy", where a large audience is attracted to a platform, but there proves to be no profitable way to monetise it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc= Chp 2, ''passim'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tiwana|2013|loc= Chpt. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosystems===
In the context of digital platforms, ecosystems are collections of economic actors not controlled by the platform owner, yet who add value in ways that go beyond being a regular user. A common example is the community of independent developers who create applications for a platform, such as the many developers (both individuals and companies) that create apps for Facebook. With Microsoft, significant components of their ecosystem include not just developers, but computer and hardware peripheral manufactures, as well as maintenance and training providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc= Chp 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A traditional company embarking on a platform strategy has a head start in creating an ecosystem if they already have a list of partners, alliances and / or resellers. A startup company looking to grow an ecosystem might expose elements of its platform via publicly available [[API]]s. Another approach is to have an easily accessible partnership sign up facility, with the offer of free or subsidised benefits for partners.&lt;ref name="Tiwana 2013 loc= Chpt. 1, passim"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tiwana|2013|loc= Chpt. 1, ''passim'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platform owners usually attempt to promote and support all significant actors in their ecosystems, though sometimes there is a competitive relationship between the owner and some of the companies in their ecosystem, very occasionally even a hostile one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =[[CRN Magazine|CRN]]|title =Sources: VMware Sets Sights On Startup VMTurbo As Cloud Management Battle Heats Up|url =http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/300078670/sources-vmware-sets-sights-on-startup-vmturbo-as-cloud-management-battle-heats-up.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Regulating"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiwana 2013 loc= Chpt. 1, passim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2016|loc=Chpt. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
Scholars have acknowledged platforms are challenging to categorise, due to their variety.&lt;ref name = "Implications"/&gt; A relatively common approach is to divide platforms into four types, based on the principle ways they add utility, rather than being concerned with which particular sectors they server. These four types are transaction, innovation, integrated and investment.&lt;ref name ="risePE"/&gt;. To view different ways to categorize digital platforms see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Asadullah |first1=Ahmad |last2=Faik |first2=Isam |last3=Kankanhalli |first3=Atreyi |title=Digital Platforms: A Review and Future Directions |journal=PACIS Proceedings |date=2018 |url=https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2018/248/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transaction platforms===
Also known as [[two-sided market]]s, multisided markets, or digital match making firms, transaction platforms are by far the most common type of platform. These platforms often facilitate various forms of online buying and selling, though sometimes most or all transactions supported by the platform will be free of charge.&lt;ref name ="risePE"/&gt;

===Innovation platforms===
{{see also|Innovation intermediary}}
Innovation platforms provide a technological foundation, often including a set of common standards, upon which an ecosystem of third parties can develop complementary products and services to resell to consumers and other businesses. Examples of platform companies include Microsoft and Intel.&lt;ref name ="risePE"/&gt;

===Integrated platforms===
Integrated platforms combine features of both transaction and innovation platforms. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]] and [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] have been classified as integrated platforms. Several integrated platform companies operating multiple discreet platforms and could also be described as "platform conglomerates".&lt;ref name ="risePE"/&gt; An alternative meaning for 'integrated platform' involves providers supporting different X2X relationships to the market, which target value add among A (administration), B (business) and C (consumer) platform users.

==Global distribution, international development and geostrategy==
Platforms are sometimes studied through the lens of their differing distributions and impact across the world's geographic regions. Some early work speculated that the rise of the ''platform economy'' could be a new means by which the United States could maintain its hegemony. While the largest platform companies by market capitalisation remain US based, platforms based in India and Asia are fast catching up, and several authors writing in 2016 and later took the opposite view, speculating that the platform economy will help accelerate a shift of economic power towards Asia.&lt;ref&gt;

===Africa===
[[File:M-Pesa Agent in Tanzania - from Flickr 3490240213.jpg|thumb|An M-Pesa Agent in Tanzania. The M-Pesa platform provides a form of [[Financial inclusion]] for people without bank accounts. They can send and receive credit on cheap SMS mobile phones, then exchange the credit for cash or goods at numerous shops and kiosks, which are far more common than bank branches in much of Africa.]]

Numerous successful platforms have been launched in Africa, several of which have been home grown. In the early 2010s, there were reports by journalist, academics and development workers that Africa has been leading the world in some platform related technologies, such as by "leapfrogging" traditional fixed line internet applications and going straight to developing mobile apps. In the field of [[mobile money]] for example, it was the success of Kenya's [[M-Pesa]] that brought the technology to global attention. &lt;ref group="note"&gt;It was [[Smart Communications]] that achieved the first launch of a formal mobile money system, which occurred in the Philippines in 2001, about 6 years before the launch of M-Pesa. But it wasn't until the success of mobile money in Africa that the technology received widespread global attention. There are unconfirmed reports that Africans invented mobile money independently, without knowing about the Philippines system.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siona"&gt;{{Cite news

Similar systems have been introduced elsewhere in Africa, for example m-Sente in Uganda. M-Pesa itself has expanded out of Africa to both Asia and Eastern Europe. The system allows people who only have cheap SMS capable mobile phones to send and receive money. This and similar platform services have been enthusiastically welcomed both by the end users, and by development workers who have noted their life enhancing effects. [[Ushahidi]] is another set of technologies developed in Africa and widely used on platforms to deliver various social benefits. While many platforms in Africa are accessible just by SMS, uptake of smartphones is also high, with the FT reporting in 2015 that mobile internet adoption is happening at double the global rate.&lt;ref name = "ahead"/&gt; Compared to other regions, there may have been less negative effects caused by platforms in Africa, as there has been less legacy economic infrastructure to disrupt, which also has provided an opportunity to build new systems from "ground zero".&lt;ref name="Siona"/&gt; Though some legacy businesses have still been disrupted by the rise of platforms in Africa, with sometimes only the more productive firms being able to overcome barriers to adopting digital technologies.&lt;ref name = "Leapfrogging"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="WDR2016"/&gt;

By 2017, some of the excitement concerning home grown platform technology and the wider [[Africa Rising]] narrative has cooled, in line with recent falls in commodity prices reducing the short term economic prospects for much of the continent. Yet optimism remains that the continent is heading in the right direction. A global survey identified 176 platform companies with a valuation over one billion dollars, yet only one was based in Africa. This was [[Naspers]], which is headquartered in [[Cape Town]], a city that also hosts many other smaller platform companies. A survey focused on smaller platforms based in Africa found few are either wholly foreign or indigenously owned, with most being a mixture.&lt;ref name ="riseA"&gt;

The global tech landscape changes rapidly, and all comparative data here should be regarded as a historical snapshot.&lt;ref name = "ECLAC2016"/&gt;]]
North America, in particular the United States, is home to the world's top 5 global platform companies{{spaced endash}} Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and IBM. A 2016 global survey of all platform companies with a market cap over $1bn, found 44 such companies headquartered in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] alone, with those companies having a total value of $2.2 trillion{{spaced endash}} 52% of the total worldwide value of such platform companies. Overall, the United States had 63 platform companies valued over $1bn, with Canada having one. While North America has less large platform companies than Asia, it is the clear leader in terms of overall market capitalisation, and in having platform companies with a global reach.&lt;ref name ="risePE"/&gt;

===Asia===
The 2016 global survey found that Asia was home to the largest number of platform companies having a market capitalisation over $1bn. Asia had 82 such companies,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;64 were in China, 8 in India and 5 in Japan. The other 5 
Asian platforms were split across Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea.&lt;/ref&gt; though their combined market value was only $719, second to the United States. Much of Asia's platform companies are concentrated in hubs located in [[Bangalore]] and [[Hangzhou]].&lt;ref name ="risePE"/&gt; Within China, home grown platforms tend to dominate across the whole platform economy, with most of the big American platforms being banned. eBay is allowed to trade in China, but has a relatively small market share compared to Chinese eCommerce platforms. Outside of China, Asian-based platforms have been enjoying rapid growth in areas relating to eCommerce, but not so much in social media and search. Facebook for example is the most popular social media platform even in India, a country with several large home grown platforms, while in Myanmar, the ''New York Times'' described Facebook as "so dominant that to many people it is the internet itself."&lt;ref name = "Myanmar"&gt;

===Europe===
Europe is home to a large number of platform companies, but most are quite small. In terms of platform companies that were valued over $1bn, Europe was found to have only 27 in the 2016 global survey. So far ahead of Africa and South America, but lagging well behind Asia and North America.&lt;ref name ="risePE"/&gt;

===South America===
According to data from early 2016, only three home grown platform companies with a market capitalisation greater than $1bn had emerged in South America: these are [[MercadoLibre]],  [[Despegar.com]] and [[B2W]].&lt;ref name = "ECLAC2016"&gt;

The continent is however home to many start up companies. In Brazil, the Portuguese language gives an advantage to home grown companies, with an especially active start up scene existing in [[São Paolo]]. Argentina has been the most successful in creating platforms used outside its own borders, with the countries relatively small home market encouraging a more global outlook from its start up platform companies.&lt;ref&gt;

With a high proportion of workers already employed on an informal bases, the platform based gig economy has not grown as fast in South America as elsewhere. Though from a progressive perspective, scholars such as Adam Fishwick have noted that Latin America's tradition of worker organised activism may have valuable lessons for workers elsewhere seeking ways to mitigate the sometimes adverse effects of platforms on their economic security.&lt;ref&gt;

==Platforms by ownership==

===Private sector===
Most of the widely used platforms are owned by the private sector. In the 2016 GCE survey of platform companies valued over $1 billion, a total of 107 privately owned companies were found, versus 69 public companies (public in the sense of being private sector, but [[publicly traded]] ). While more numerous, the privately owned companies tended to be smaller, having a total market value of $300 billion, compared to $3,900 billion for the publicly traded companies.&lt;ref name ="risePE"/&gt;

===Public sector===
Some digital platforms are run by multilateral institutions, by national governments, and by local municipal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===NGO===
Over 90% of NGOs maintain a presence on the large privately owned social media platforms such as Facebook, with some also operating their own platforms.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Platform cooperatism===
{{Main|Platform cooperative}}
Platform cooperatism involves mutually owned platforms, being run "bottom up" by the people involved. Sometimes these platforms can effectively be competing for business with the privately owned platforms. In other cases, platform cooperatism seeks to help ordinary people have their say about political questions of the day, possibly supporting interaction with local government.&lt;ref&gt;

With the increasingly centrality of digital platforms to the global economy following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], there was an intensification of interest in assessing their impact on society and the wider economy. Many hundreds of reviews have been carried out: some by individual scholars, others by groups of academics, some by think tanks bringing together folk from a range of backgrounds, and yet others overseen by governments and trans national organisations such as the EU. Many of these reviews focussed on the overall platform economy, others on narrower areas such as the gig economy or the psychological impact of social media platforms on individuals and communities.&lt;ref name = "Implications"/&gt;

Much early assessment was highly positive, sometimes even taking a "utopian" view on the benefits of platforms.&lt;ref name = "Implications"/&gt; It's been argued and to some extent demonstrated that platforms can enhance the supply of services, improve productivity, reduce costs, reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, increase flexibility and labour market accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Both the IMF and World Bank for example have suggested that it's the countries and industries that are quickest to adopt new platform technologies that achieve the fastest and most sustainable growth,&lt;ref name ="gap"&gt;{{Cite news

Various arguments have been made against platforms. They include that platforms may contribute to [[technological unemployment]]. That they accelerate the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection. That they may contribute to declining tax revenues. That excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. That they can increase inequality. That they can reproduce patterns of racism. That platforms have a net negative impact on the environment.&lt;ref name="robot"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Implications"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Post 2017 backlash===
Until 2017, most mainstream assessments of the platform economy were largely positive about its benefits to wider society. There were some exceptions, a general hardening of attitudes towards platforms from some commentators and regulators had been detectable from at least early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There had been a few highly critical views, e.g. from [[Evgeny Morozov]], who in 2015 described most platforms as "parasitic: feeding off existing social and economic relations.&lt;ref name="welcome"/&gt; But such negative assessments were rare, especially from prominent commentators who had the attention of policy makers. This began to change in 2017. Across the world, the larger privately owned platforms were subject to increasing questioning about their expanding role and responsibilities.&lt;ref name = "Myanmar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coders"/&gt;

In the US, the [[Financial Times]] reported a marked change of attitudes towards online platforms across the American political spectrum, triggered by their "sheer size and power".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

There has also been growing hostility towards the large platform companies from  some members of the American right. High-profile figures such as [[Steve Bannon]] and [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer]] have argued for the break up of the large tech companies, and more mainstream Republicans are reported to be running for the 2018 congressional elections on anti big-tech tickets.&lt;ref name = "reset"&gt;{{Cite news

2017 also saw increased critical attention towards the larger platforms from both European and Chinese regulators. In the case of China where several of the larger US owned platforms were already banned, the focus was on their biggest home grown platforms, with commentators expressing concerns that they have become too powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Much recent criticism focusses on major platforms being too big; anti competitive; damaging to democracy, such as with the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian meddling in the 2016 election]]; and bad for users mental health. In December 2017 Facebook itself admitted passive consumption of social media could be harmful to mental health, though said active engagement can be helpful. In January 2018 Facebook made major changes to increase user engagement. In February 2018, [[Unilever]], one of the world's leading spenders on advertising, threatened to pull adverts from digital platforms if they "create division, foster hate or fail to protect children." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Despite recent criticism from media figures and politicians, the large privately owned platforms tend to remain "wildly popular" among ordinary consumers.&lt;ref name = "techlash"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "siren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coders"/&gt; After leading US platform companies revealed high Q1 revenue growth in late April 2018, the ''Financial Times'' reported they are untouched by the backlash, in a "stunning demonstration of their platform power".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Regulation==
During their early years, digital platforms tended to enjoy light regulation, sometimes benefiting from measures intended to help fledgling internet companies. The "inherently border-crossing" nature of platforms has made it challenging to regulate them, even when a desire has been there.&lt;ref name = "Regulating"/&gt; Yet another difficulty has been lack of consensus about what exactly constitutes the platform economy.&lt;ref name ='coreg'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; With most large platforms concentrated in China or the U.S., two contrasting approaches to regulation. In the U.S., platforms have largely been left to develop free of state regulation. In China, while large platform companies like [[Tencent]] or Baidu are privately owned and in theory have much more freedom than [[State-owned enterprise|SOE]]s, they are still tightly controlled, and also protected by the state against foreign competition, at least in their home market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

As of 2017, there has been talk of a "third way" being developed in Europe, less [[Laissez-faire]] than the approach in the U.S., but less restrictive than the approach in China. Possibilities for Co-regulation, where public regulators and the platform companies themselves cooperative to design and enforce regulation, are also being explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The '''Radio Society of Great Britain''' ('''RSGB'''), first founded in 1913 as the London Wireless Club,&lt;ref name=X/&gt; is the United Kingdom's recognised national society for [[amateur radio operator]]s. The society's patron is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] and it claims to represent the interests of the UK's 80,000 licensed radio amateurs. A long recognised amateur radio organisation, the society is the national member society representing the United Kingdom and certain [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] of the United Kingdom in the [[International Amateur Radio Union]]. It also acts as a medium for communication between the licensed operators and the UK government.

== Role ==
The RSGB has traditionally acted as the organisation through which its members interact with the telecommunications regulatory authority of the United Kingdom, [[Ofcom]].  Although Ofcom has used its web site to solicit opinions directly from all amateur radio enthusiasts and other interested parties, the RSGB continues to advise and to seek to influence Ofcom on the likely impact of proposed changes in many areas – from decisions on licensing and bandwidth controls through to the use of broadband over power lines [[Power line communication|PLT]] (which it is thought would cause large amounts of [[Electromagnetic interference|electromagnetic noise]]).

RSGB also acts as a parent organisation to oversee and govern many smaller groups and societies. Some of these societies unite local areas (such as [[amateur radio repeater|repeater]] groups) or groups of individuals (such as Forces service groups, or old timer groups) or even people interested in a particular amateur radio band (such as [[2-metre band]] groups).

The society publishes a monthly magazine called ''[[RadCom]]'', along with a range of technical books.

== History ==
The roots of the Radio Society of Great Britain can traced back to the formation of the London Wireless Club, inaugurated in West Hampstead on 5 July 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Amateur Notes |journal=Wireless World |date=August 1913 | volume=1 | issue=5 | page=340 |publisher=The Marconi Press Agency, Limited.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first President was [[Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton]] who was succeeded in 1920 by [[James Robert Erskine-Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/James_Robert_Erskine-Murray&lt;/ref&gt;

At its first meeting in September 1913, it was decided that the name should change from the London Wireless Club to the Wireless Society of London.&lt;ref&gt;Clarricoats 1967, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1922, the name of the Society was changed to that it holds to this day, the substitution of the term 'Great Britain' for 'London' being made with the view to extend the perceived scope of the Society's work.&lt;ref&gt;Clarricoats 1967, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSGB made the first radio transmission across to the United States, but failed to have any receiving equipment. Many members were slightly annoyed by this fact and so formed other sections of the RSGB which were later absorbed into the RSGB itself.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

During [[World War II]], the entire RSGB Council and many of its members were recruited into [[MI8]], also known as the Radio Security Service. Its mission was to intercept clandestine enemy transmissions.&lt;ref name=MI8-2&gt;{{cite book|last=West |first=Nigel |title=GCHQ: The Secret Wireless War 1900–1986 |isbn=0-340-41197-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MI8-3&gt;{{cite web |publisher=CLUTCH Club |url=http://clutch.open.ac.uk/schools/emerson00/rss_page1.html |title=Radio Security Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the RSGB cooperated with Ofcom to revise the [[amateur radio license|amateur radio licence]] in the United Kingdom.  Changes included removing the annual licence fee and removing the requirement to [[Logbook|log]] all transmissions. [[Amateur radio operator]]s gained permission to operate one's [[amateur radio station]] remotely, and the changes increased the spectrum available to the lower classes of licensees.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==2011 Expenses Scandal==

On 28 March 2011, the Board announced that the RSGB's general manager, Peter Kirby G0TWW, had left the Society's employment after the discovery of financial irregularities, allegedly to the tune of £41,000.&lt;ref name="BedsOnSunday_2011-04011"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Ham radio society chief leaves after ‘financial irregularities’ | newspaper = [[Bedfordshire on Sunday]] | date = 17 April 2011 | accessdate = 2017-01-04 | url = http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/ham-radio-society-chief-leaves-afterfinancial-irregularities/story-21717535-detail/story.html | archive-date = 4 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170104162552/http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/ham-radio-society-chief-leaves-afterfinancial-irregularities/story-21717535-detail/story.html | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; RSGB Director, Don Beattie G3BJ, acted as general manager until the appointment of a new general manager, Graham Coomber G0NBI, in May 2012.

The following notice appeared on the RSGB website on 16 October 2013:
“The Board is pleased to be able to report to Members that the debt owed to the Society by its previous General Manager, who left the Society in early 2011, has been repaid in full, together with statutory interest and the Society’s court fees.  This will be reflected in the 2013 accounts as a write-back of the provision taken against the debt in the 2011 accounts. Details will be in the annual report and accounts which will be published in time for the AGM in 2014. The Board expresses its thanks to the Society team which has brought about the recovery of this debt and now regards the matter as closed. No further comment will be made.”

==RSGB Centenary 2013==
In 2013 the RSGB celebrated its centenary with a programme of events including a special callsign G100RSGB, the RSGB Centenary Award 2013 and a construction competition.  The special callsign G100RSGB travelled around the 13 RSGB regions and was operated by groups in each area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=RSGB Centenary 2013 | url=http://rsgb.org/main/publications-archives/rsgb-centenary-2013/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==
There are competing demands from more and more non-amateur uses of radio (for example mobile operators and wireless devices). Despite this, the RSGB has been able to maintain existing amateur radio allocations and negotiate some new ones.

With the formation of the [http://rsgb.org/youth-committee Youth Committee] the society is catering for the demands of the younger licensees. In 2014, The society took part in the [[International Amateur Radio Union|International Amateur Radio Union's]] Youngsters on the Air event in Finland. The RSGB will be hosting YOTA in 2017. The Youth Committee is chaired by [http://www.qrz.com/db/M0ILO Milo Noblet, M0ILO], who acts as Youth Coordinator for the UK for the International Amateur Radio Union  {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

'''Sān''' or '''Saan peoples''' (also, ''Sākhoen'', ''Sonqua'', and in [[Afrikaans]]: ''Boesmans'', or in English: ''Bushmen'',&lt;ref&gt;"University of Utah anthropologist [[Henry Harpending]], who has lived with the famous tongue-clicking hunter-gatherers said, 'In the 1970s the name "San" spread in Europe and America because it seemed to be politically correct, while 'Bushmen' sounded derogatory and sexist.' Unfortunately, the hunter-gatherers never actually had a collective name for themselves in any of their own languages. 'San' was actually the insulting word that the herding Khoi people called the Bushmen. [...] one did not call someone a San to his face. I continued to use Bushman, and I was publicly corrected several times by the righteous.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Africa]]. There is a significant linguistic difference between the northern peoples living between the [[Okavango River]] in Botswana and [[Etosha National Park]] in northwestern [[Namibia]], extending up into southern [[Angola]]; the central peoples of most of [[Namibia]] and Botswana, extending into Zambia and Zimbabwe; and the southern people in the central [[Kalahari Desert|Kalahari]] towards the [[Molopo River]], who are the last remnant of the previously extensive indigenous Sān of South Africa.&lt;ref name=Barnard&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Alan|title=Anthropology and the Bushman|year=2007|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847883308|pages=4–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3MihaaJ314C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestors of the hunter-gatherer Sān are considered to have been the first inhabitants of what is now Botswana and South Africa. The historical presence of the San in Botswana is particularly evident in northern Botswana's [[Tsodilo Hills]] region.  In this area, [[stone tools]] and [[rock art]] paintings date back over 70,000 years and are by far the oldest known art.&lt;ref name=Coulson&gt;{{cite report |author=Coulson, Sheila |date=12 February 2012 |title=Worlds Oldest Ritual Discovered. Worshipped the Python 70,000 Years Ago.|publisher=Apollon Research Magazine|url=https://www.apollon.uio.no/english/articles/2006/python-english.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sān were traditionally [[semi-nomadic]], moving seasonally within certain defined areas based on the availability of resources such as water, [[game animals]], and edible plants. As of 2010, the Sān populations in Botswana number about 50,000 to 60,000.&lt;ref name=Anaya&gt;{{cite report |author=Anaya, James |date=2 June 2010 |title=Addendum – The situation of indigenous peoples in Botswana |publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council.

From the 1950s through the 1990s, Sān communities switched to farming because of government-mandated modernisation programs. Despite the lifestyle changes, they have provided a wealth of information in [[anthropology]] and [[genetics]]. One broad study of African [[genetic diversity]] completed in 2009 found that Sān people were among the five populations with the highest measured levels of genetic diversity among the 121 distinct African populations sampled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connor|first=Steve|title=World's most ancient race traced in DNA study|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/worlds-most-ancient-race-traced-in-dna-study-1677113.html|accessdate=19 January 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;{{cite news |author=Gill, Victoria |date=1 May 2009 |title=Africa's genetic secrets unlocked |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8027269.stm |format=online edition |work=BBC World News |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-09-03|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090701001654/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8027269.stm|archivedate = 1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1172257| title = The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans| journal = Science| volume = 324| issue = 5930| pages = 1035–44| year = 2009 | pmid=19407144|pmc=2947357| last1 = Tishkoff | first1 = S.

That is, "groups of populations with common genetic ancestry, who share ethnicity and similarities in both their culture and the properties of their languages".&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Despite some positive aspects of government development programs reported by members of Sān and [[Bakgalagadi]] communities in Botswana, many have spoken of a consistent sense of exclusion from government decision-making processes, and many Sān and Bakgalagadi have alleged experiencing [[ethnic discrimination]] on the part of the government.&lt;ref name=Anaya/&gt;{{rp|8&amp;ndash;9}} The [[United States Department of State]] described ongoing discrimination against San, or ''Basarwa'', people in Botswana in 2013 as the "principal human rights concern".&lt;ref name=StateDept&gt;{{cite publication |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor |title=Botswana 2013 Human Rights Report |publisher=United States Department of State |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220296.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

Both designations "Bushmen" and "San" are [[Exonym and endonym|exonyms]] in origin, but ''San'' had been widely  adopted as an endonym by the late 1990s.
''San'' originates as a [[Khoekhoe]] appellation used by pastoralists to refer to foragers, from a 
root ''saa'' "picking up from the ground" + plural ''-n'' in the [[Haiǁom dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WIMSA Annual Report 2004-05|url=http://evan.oribi.cc:50080/index.php?option=com_rokdownloads&amp;view=file&amp;task=download&amp;id=19%3Awimsa-annual-report-04-05&amp;Itemid=79|publisher=WIMSA|accessdate=18 March 2014|page=58|quote=the term 'San' comes from the Haiǁom language and has been abbreviated in the following way ...

Adoption of the Khoekhoe term ''San'' in Western anthropology dates to the 1970s, and this remains the standard term in English-language ethnographic literature, although some authors have later switched back to ''Bushmen'',&lt;ref name=Barnard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sailer|first=Steve|title=Feature: Name game – 'Inuit' or 'Eskimo'?|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/06/20/Feature-Name-game-Inuit-or-Eskimo/UPI-43191024597290/|accessdate=12 January 2014|newspaper=UPI|date=20 June 2002}}
"The fashion of renaming the Bushmen of Southwestern Africa as the 'San' exemplifies many of the problems with the name game. University of Utah anthropologist [[Henry Harpending]], who has lived with the famous tongue-clicking hunter-gatherers said, 'In the 1970s the name "San" spread in Europe and America because it seemed to be politically correct, while 'Bushmen' sounded derogatory and sexist.' Unfortunately, the hunter-gatherers never actually had a collective name for themselves in any of their own languages. 'San' was actually the insulting word that the herding Khoi people called the Bushmen. [...] Harpending noted, 'The problem was that in the Kalahari, "San" has all the baggage that the "N-word" has in America. Bushmen kids are graduating from school, reading the academic literature, and are outraged that we call them "San." [...]  one did not call someone a San to his face. I continued to use Bushman, and I was publicly corrected several times by the righteous. It quickly became a badge among Western academics: If you say "San" and I say "San," then we signal each other that we are on the fashionable side, politically. It had nothing to do with respect. I think most politically correct talk follows these dynamics.'"&lt;/ref&gt; 
The compound '''[[Khoisan]]''', used to refer to the pastoralist Khoi and the foraging San collectively, was coined by Leonhard Schulze in the 1920s and popularised by [[Isaac Schapera]] in 1930, and anthropological use of ''San'' was detached from the compound ''Khoisan''.&lt;ref&gt;"Schapera is the author of the convenient term Khoisan, compounded of the Hottentot's name for themselves (Khoi) and their name for the Bushmen (San)." [[Joseph Greenberg]], ''[[The Languages of Africa]]''  (1963), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The San [[kinship system]] reflects their interdependence as traditionally small mobile foraging bands. San kinship is comparable to [[Eskimo kinship]], with the same set of terms as in European cultures, but also uses a name rule and an age rule. The age rule resolves any confusion arising from kinship terms, as the older of two people always decides what to call the younger. Relatively few names circulate (approximately 35 names per sex), and each child is named after a grandparent or another relative.

Children have no social duties besides playing, and leisure is very important to San of all ages. Large amounts of time are spent in conversation, joking, music, and sacred dances. Women have a high status in San society, are greatly respected, and may be leaders of their own family groups. They make important family and group decisions and claim ownership of water holes and foraging areas. Women are mainly involved in the gathering of food, but may also take part in hunting.

Water is important in San life. Droughts may last many months and waterholes may dry up. When this happens, they use sip wells. To get water this way, a San scrapes a deep hole where the sand is damp. Into this hole is inserted a long hollow grass stem. An empty [[ostrich]] egg is used to collect the water. Water is sucked into the straw from the sand, into the mouth, and then travels down another straw into the ostrich egg.

Traditionally, the San were an egalitarian society.&lt;ref name=shostak&gt;Marjorie Shostak, 1983, ''Nisa: The Life and Words of a ǃKung Woman''. New York: Vintage Books. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they had hereditary chiefs, their authority was limited. The San made decisions among themselves by [[consensus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://orvillejenkins.com/profiles/kung.html The ǃKung Bushmen]. Orvillejenkins.com (22 May 2006). Retrieved 2012-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; with women treated as relative equals.&lt;ref&gt;Shostak 1983: 13&lt;/ref&gt; San economy was a [[gift economy]], based on giving each other gifts regularly rather than on trading or purchasing goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Shostak 1983: 9, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsistence===
Villages range in sturdiness from nightly rain shelters in the warm spring (when people move constantly in search of budding greens), to formalised rings, wherein people congregate in the dry season around permanent waterholes. Early spring is the hardest season: a hot dry period following the cool, dry winter. Most plants still are dead or dormant, and supplies of autumn nuts are exhausted. Meat is particularly important in the dry months when wildlife can not range far from the receding waters.

Women gather fruit, berries, tubers, bush onions, and other plant materials for the band's consumption. [[Ostrich]] eggs are gathered, and the empty shells are used as water containers. Insects provide perhaps 10% of animal proteins consumed, most often during the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Morris |title=Insects and human life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ok-3NLX_8GQC&amp;pg=PA57 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |year=2004 |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-1-84520-075-6 |pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on location, the San consume 18 to 104 species, including grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, and termites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ok-3NLX_8GQC&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Brian Morris (2005).

Women's traditional gathering gear is simple and effective: a hide sling, a blanket, a cloak called a ''kaross'' to carry foodstuffs, firewood, smaller bags, a digging stick, and perhaps, a smaller version of the [[kaross]] to carry a baby.

Men hunt in long, laborious [[Tracking (hunting)|tracking]] excursions. They kill their game using [[arrow]]s and [[spear]]s tipped in [[diamphotoxin]], a slow-acting [[arrow poison]] produced by beetle [[larva]]e of the genus ''[[Diamphidia]]''.&lt;ref name=biodiversity&gt;[http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/beetles/chrysomelidae/alticinae/arrows.htm "How San hunters use beetles to poison their arrows"], Biodiversity Explorer website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--does this mean only the men who were in the hunt, or all men and those women who were hunting or something else entirely?--&gt;

A set of tools almost identical to that used by the modern San and dating to 44,000 BCE was discovered at [[Border Cave]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19069560 Earliest' evidence of modern human culture found], Nick Crumpton, BBC News, 31 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical evidence shows that certain San communities have always lived in the desert regions of the Kalahari; however, eventually nearly all other San communities in southern Africa were forced into this region. The Kalahari San remained in poverty where their richer neighbours denied them rights to the land. Before long, in both Botswana and Namibia, they found their territory drastically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartofafrica.co.za/serv/moderntimes.jsp "The modern day Bushmen / San"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618001626/http://www.theartofafrica.co.za/serv/moderntimes.jsp |date=18 June 2011 }}.

The most divergent (oldest) mitochondrial haplogroup, [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]]d, has been identified at its highest frequencies in the southern African San groups.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/302848|title=MtDNA Variation in the South African Kung and Khwe—and Their Genetic Relationships to Other African Populations|year=2000|last1=Chen|first1=Yu-Sheng|last2=Olckers|first2=Antonel|last3=Schurr|first3=Theodore G.|last4=Kogelnik|first4=Andreas M.|last5=Huoponen|first5=Kirsi|last6=Wallace|first6=Douglas C.|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=66|issue=4|pages=1362–83|pmid=10739760|pmc=1288201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/molbev/msm155|title=History of Click-Speaking Populations of Africa Inferred from mtDNA and Y Chromosome Genetic Variation|year=2007 |last1=Tishkoff|first1=S.

In a study published in March 2011, Brenna Henn and colleagues found that the ǂKhomani San, as well as the [[Sandawe people|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza people]]s of [[Tanzania]], were the most genetically diverse of any living humans studied. This high degree of genetic diversity hints at the origin of [[anatomically modern humans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henn |first1=Brenna |last2=Gignoux |first2=Christopher R. |last3=Jobin |first3=Matthew |year=2011 |title=Hunter-gatherer genomic diversity suggests a southern African origin for modern humans |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=108 |issue=13 |pages=5154–62 |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.1017511108 |pmid=21383195 |pmc=3069156|url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/44431/1/1017511108.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Matt |year=2011 |title=Gene Study Challenges Human Origins in Eastern Africa |journal=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |doi= |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gene-study-challenges-human-origin-africa/ |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent analysis suggests that the San may have been isolated from other original ancestral groups for as much as 100,000 years and later rejoined, re-integrating the human gene pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7358868.stm|title= Human line 'nearly split in two'|publisher=BBC News|date=24 April 2008 | accessdate=2009-12-31 | first=Paul | last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A DNA study of fully sequenced genomes, published in September 2016, showed that the ancestors of today's San hunter-gatherers began to diverge from other human populations in Africa about 200,000 years ago and were fully isolated by 100,000 years ago, well before the first archaeological evidence of modern behaviour in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/science/ancient-dna-human-history.html?_r=0|title= A Single Migration From Africa Populated the World, Studies Find'|publisher=New York Times, by Zimmer, Karl|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestral land conflict in Botswana==
{{main article|Ancestral land conflict in Botswana}}

Much [[aboriginal people]]'s land in Botswana, including land occupied by the San people (or ''Basarwa''), was lost during colonization, and the pattern of loss of land and access to natural resources continued after Botswana's independence.&lt;ref name=Anaya/&gt;{{rp|2}}  
The San have been particularly affected by encroachment by majority peoples and non-indigenous farmers onto land traditionally occupied by San people. Government policies from the 1970s transferred a significant area of traditionally San land to [[White people|White]] settlers and majority [[agro-pastoralist]] tribes.&lt;ref name=Anaya/&gt;{{rp|15}} Much of the government's policy regarding land tended to favor the dominant [[Tswana people|Tswana]] peoples over the minority San and [[Bakgalagadi]].&lt;ref name=Anaya/&gt;{{rp|2}} Loss of land is a major contributor to the problems facing Botswana's indigenous people, including especially the San's eviction from the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]].&lt;ref name=Anaya/&gt;{{rp|2}} The government of Botswana decided to relocate all of those living within the reserve to settlements outside it. Harassment of residents, dismantling of infrastructure, and bans on hunting appear to have been used to induce residents to leave.&lt;ref name=Anaya/&gt;{{rp|16}} The government has denied that any of the relocation was forced.&lt;ref name="Forced Evictions-- Towards Solutions?: Second Report of the Advisory Group on Forced Evictions to the Executive Director of UN-HABITAT"&gt;{{cite book|last=Advisory Group on Forced Evictions, United Nations Human Settlements Programme|title=Forced Evictions-- Towards Solutions?: Second Report of the Advisory Group on Forced Evictions to the Executive Director of UN-HABITAT |year=2007 |publisher=UN-HABITAT|isbn=978-92-1-131909-5 |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbpwMRxCsegC&amp;dq=%22C.S+Maribe%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legal battle followed.&lt;ref name=LandsBack&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/12/13/bushmen.reut/index.html |title=Botswana's bushmen get Kalahari lands back |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2006-12-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061220110621/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/12/13/bushmen.reut/index.html|date=13 December 2006 |archivedate = 20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relocation policy may have been intended to facilitate [[diamond mining]] by [[Gem Diamonds]] within the reserve.&lt;ref name=Anaya/&gt;{{rp|18}}

==''Hoodia'' traditional knowledge agreement==
''[[Hoodia gordonii]]'', used by the San, was patented by the South African [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) in 1998, for its presumed appetite suppressing quality. A licence was granted to [[Phytopharm]], for development of the active ingredient in the ''Hoodia'' plant, [[p57 (glycoside)]], to be used as a pharmaceutical drug for dieting. Once this patent was brought to the attention of the San, a benefit-sharing agreement was reached between them and the CSIR in 2003. This would award royalties to the San for the benefits of their indigenous knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1747-1796.2004.tb00231.x| title = Rhetoric, Realism and Benefit-Sharing| journal = The Journal of World Intellectual Property| volume = 7| issue = 6| pages = 851| year = 2005| last1 = Wynberg | first1 = R. |url=http://www.icimod.org/resource/2248}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the case, the San people were represented and assisted by the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA), the South African San Council and the South African San Institute.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;&lt;ref name=WynbergChennells/&gt;

This benefit-sharing agreement is one of the first to give royalties to the holders of traditional knowledge used for drug sales. The terms of the agreement are contentious, because of their apparent lack of adherence to the Bonn Guidelines on Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing, as outlined in the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-9388.00346| title = The Bonn Guidelines on Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing| journal = Review of European Community and International Environmental Law| volume = 12| pages = 84| year = 2003| last1 = Tully | first1 = S. |url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/articles/2003/A-00457.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San have yet to profit from this agreement, as P57 has still not yet been legally developed and marketed.

===Early representations===
The San of the [[Kalahari]] were first brought to the globalized world's attention in the 1950s by South African author [[Laurens van der Post]]. In 1955, Van der Post was commissioned by the [[BBC]] to go to the Kalahari desert with a film crew in search of the San. The filmed material was turned into a very popular six-part television documentary a year later. Driven by a lifelong fascination with this "vanished tribe", Van der Post published a 1958 book about this expedition, entitled ''The Lost World of the Kalahari''. It was to be his most famous book. In 1961, he published ''The Heart of the Hunter'', a narrative which he admits in the introduction uses two previous works of stories and mythology as "a sort of Stone Age Bible", namely ''[[Specimens of Bushman Folklore]]''' (1911), [[folkloristics|collected]] by [[Wilhelm Bleek|Wilhelm H. I. Bleek]] and [[Lucy Lloyd|Lucy C. Lloyd]], and [[Dorothea Bleek]]'s ''Mantis and His Friend''. Van der Post's work is largely discredited, as it is the subjective view of a European in the 1950s and 1960s. His opinions branded the San as simple "children of Nature" or even "mystical ecologists".
That record was set straight in 1992 by John Perrot and team with the publication of the book [http://www.khoisanpeoples.org/sites/book-site.htm "Bush for the Bushman"] - a [http://savethesan.org "desperate plea"] on behalf of the aboriginal San addressing the international community and calling on the governments throughout Southern Africa to respect and reconstitute the ancestral land-rights of all San.

===Documentaries and non-fiction===
[[John Marshall (filmmaker)|John Marshall]], the son of [[Harvard University|Harvard]] anthropologist [[Lorna Marshall]], documented the lives of San in the [[Nyae Nyae]] region of [[Namibia]] over a more than 50-year period. His early film ''The Hunters'', released in 1957, shows a giraffe hunt. ''A Kalahari Family'' (2002) is a five-part, six-hour series documenting 50 years in the lives of the ''Juǀʼhoansi'' of Southern Africa, from 1951 to 2000. Marshall was a vocal proponent of the San cause throughout his life.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Elizabeth Marshall|title=The Old Way: A Story of the First People|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429954518|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtHR8_gK_WwC|pages=xiii,45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister [[Elizabeth Marshall Thomas]] wrote several books and numerous articles about the San, based in part on her experiences living with these people when their culture was still intact. ''The Harmless People'', published in 1959 (revised in 1989), and ''The Old Way: A Story of the First People'', published in 2006, are the two primary works. John Marshall and Adrienne Miesmer documented the lives of the !Kung San people between the 1950s and 1978 in ''[[Nǃai, the Story of a ǃKung Woman]]''. This film, the account of a woman who grew up while the San lived as autonomous hunter-gatherers, but who later was forced into a dependent life in the government-created community at Tsumkwe, shows how the lives of the [[!Kung people]], who lived for millennia as hunter gatherers, were forever changed when they were forced onto a reservation too small to support them.&lt;ref&gt;Kray, C. (1978) [http://people.rit.edu/cakgss/nai.html "Notes on 'N!ai: The Story of a !Kung Woman'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714061158/http://people.rit.edu/cakgss/nai.html |date=14 July 2008 }}. RIT. n.d. Web. 5 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

South African film-maker Richard Wicksteed has produced a number of documentaries on San culture, history and present situation; these include ''In God's Places''/''Iindawo ZikaThixo'' (1995) on the San cultural legacy in the southern Drakensberg; ''Death of a Bushman'' (2002) on the murder of San tracker Optel Rooi by South African police; ''The Will To Survive'' (2009), which covers the history and situation of San communities in southern Africa today; and ''My Land is My Dignity'' (2009) on the San's epic land rights struggle in Botswana's [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]].

A documentary on San hunting entitled, ''The Great Dance: A Hunter's Story'' (2000), directed by Craig and Damon Foster. This was reveiewed by [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] for the ''[[New York Times]]'', who said that the film "constitutes an act of preservation and a requiem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Gelder|first1=Lawrence|title=A Hunter's Story|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/movies/film-in-review-the-great-dance.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=p|accessdate=18 April 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=29 Sep 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spencer Wells]]'s 2003 book ''[[The Journey of Man]]''—in connection with [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'s [[Genographic Project]]—discusses a [[Genetics|genetic]] analysis of the San and asserts their [[genetic markers]] were the first ones to split from those of the ancestors of the bulk of other ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. The [[PBS]] documentary based on the book follows these markers throughout the world, demonstrating that all of humankind can be traced back to the [[African continent]] (see [[Recent African origin of modern humans]], the so-called "out of Africa" hypothesis).

The BBC's ''[[The Life of Mammals#10. .22Food for Thought.22|The Life of Mammals]]'' (2003) series includes video footage of an indigenous San of the Kalahari desert undertaking a [[persistence hunt]] of a [[kudu]] through harsh desert conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Attenborough|first=David|title=Human Mammal, Human Hunter (video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o|work=[[The Life of Mammals]]|publisher=BBC |accessdate=10 February 2011|date=5 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an illustration of how early man may have pursued and captured prey with minimal weaponry.

The BBC series ''[[How Art Made the World]]'' (2005) compares [[Rock art of the Bushmen|San cave paintings]] from 200 years ago to [[Ice Age art|Paleolithic European paintings]] that are 14,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/howartmadetheworld/episodes/pictures/san/|title=How Art Made the World . Episodes . The Day Pictures Were Born . The San People of South Africa {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their similarities, the San works may illustrate the reasons for ancient cave paintings. The presenter [[Nigel Spivey]] draws largely on the work of Professor [[David Lewis-Williams]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}, whose PhD was entitled "Believing and Seeing: Symbolic meanings in southern San rock paintings". Lewis-Williams draws parallels with prehistoric art around the world, linking in shamanic ritual and trance states.

Paul John Myburgh wrote [https://www.penguinrandomhouse.co.za/book/bushman-winter-has-come/9780143530664 The Bushmen Winter has Come] after spending seven years with the ‘People of the Great Sand Face’, a group of /Gwikwe Bushmen in the Kalahari Desert. For Paul, they were years of physical and spiritual immersion into a way of life of which only an echo remains in living memory. It is a true story of exodus, the inevitable journey of the last of the First People, as they leave the Great Sand Face and head for the modern world and cultural oblivion.



===Films and music===
A 1969 film, ''[[Lost in the Desert]]'', features a small boy, stranded in the desert, who encounters a group of wandering San. They help him and then abandon him as a result of a misunderstanding created by the lack of a common language and culture. The film was directed by [[Jamie Uys]], who returned to the San a decade later with ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'', which proved to be an international hit. This comedy portrays a Kalahari San group's first encounter with an [[Cultural artifact|artifact]] from the outside world (a [[Coca-Cola]] bottle). By the time this movie was made, the ǃKung had recently been forced into sedentary villages, and the San hired as actors were confused by the instructions to act out inaccurate exaggerations of their almost abandoned hunting and gathering life.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nǃai, the Story of a ǃKung Woman]]''. Documentary Educational Resources and Public Broadcasting Associates, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Eh Hee]]" by [[Dave Matthews Band]] was written as an evocation of the music and culture of the San. In a story told to the [[Radio City Music Hall|Radio City]] audience (an edited version of which appears on the DVD version of ''[[Live at Radio City]]''), Matthews recalls hearing the music of the San and, upon asking his guide what the words to their songs were, being told that "there are no words to these songs, because these songs, we've been singing since before people had words". He goes on to describe the song as his "homage to meeting... the most advanced people on the planet".

===Memoirs===
In [[Peter Godwin (writer)|Peter Godwin]]'s biography ''When A Crocodile Eats the Sun'', he mentions his time spent with the San for an assignment. His title comes from the San's belief that a solar eclipse occurs when a crocodile eats the sun.

===Novels===

[[Laurens van der Post]]'s two novels, ''A Story Like The Wind'' (1972) and its sequel, ''A Far Off Place'' (1974), made into a [[A Far-Off Place|1993 film]], are about a white boy encountering a wandering San and his wife, and how the San's life and survival skills save the white teenagers' lives in a journey across the desert.

[[James A. Michener]]'s ''[[The Covenant (novel)|The Covenant]]'' (1980), is a work of [[historical fiction]] centered on South Africa. The first section of the book concerns a San community's journey set roughly in 13,000 BC.

In [[Wilbur Smith]]'s novel ''[[The Burning Shore]]'' (an installment in the [[Courtneys of Africa book series]]), the San people are portrayed through two major characters, O'wa and H'ani; Smith describes the San's struggles, history, and beliefs in great detail.

[[Norman Rush]]'s 1991 novel [[Mating (novel)|Mating]] features an encampment of Basarwa near the (imaginary) Botswana town where the main action is set.

[[Tad Williams]]'s epic ''[[Otherland]]'' series of novels features a South African San named ǃXabbu, whom Williams confesses to be highly fictionalised, and not necessarily an accurate representation. In the novel, Williams invokes aspects of San mythology and culture.

In 2007, [[David Gilman (writer)|David Gilman]] published ''The Devil's Breath''. One of the main characters, a small San boy named ǃKoga, uses traditional methods to help the character Max Gordon travel across Namibia.

[[Alexander McCall Smith]] has written a series of [[episodic fiction|episodic novels]] set in [[Gaborone]], the capital of Botswana. The protagonist of ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'' series, a [[Tswana people|Motswana]] woman, adopts two San children, sister and brother Motholeli and Puso.

==Name and status==
In [[Malaysia]] they are officially called '''[[Negrito]]''' (''Orang Negrito'' in [[Malay language]]) or Semang (''Orang Semang'' in [[Malay language]]). The first term has an outright racial context, as Negrito in [[Spanish language]] means "little negro". In the past, eastern groups of Semang people have been called '''Pangan'''. Lowland Semang tribes are also known as Sakai, although this term is considered to be derogatory by the Semang people.&lt;ref name=Hajek&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Hajek | first = John | title = Unraveling Lowland Semang | journal = Oceanic Linguistics | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–141  |date=June 1996  | doi = 10.2307/3623034 | jstor=3623034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian Semang people are included as part of the [[Orang Asli]]; where various groups of indigenous peoples of the country that still maintain a tribal way of life. [[Orang Asli]] includes 18 officially recognized tribes that are divided into 3 ethnic groups namely the Negrito, [[Senoi]] and [[Proto-Malay]] (Aboriginal Malay). The group of Negrito consists of 6 tribes that are known as the Kensiu people, Kintaq people, [[Lanoh people]], [[Jahai people]], Mendriq people and [[Batek people]]. All [[Orang Asli]] are under the care of the state government, namely the Department of Orang Asli Development (''Jabalan Kemajuan Orang Asli'', JAKOA); whose goal is to integrate indigenous populations into the wider Malaysian society.

The three category division of the indigenous population was inherited by the Malaysian government from the British administration of the colonial era. It is based on racial concepts, according to which the [[Negrito]] were seen as the most primitive race leading the vagrant way of life of [[hunter-gatherer]]s. The [[Senoi]] were considered more developed, and the [[Proto-Malay]] were placed at almost the same level with the [[Malaysian Malay]] Muslims.

'''The American College of Correctional Physicians (ACCP), formerly the Society of Correctional Physicians (SCP),''' a [[physician]]'s membership organization formed in 1992, is the professional voice for physicians who practice medicine in [[jail]]s, [[prison]]s, and juvenile facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = American College of Correctional Physicians|url = http://www.accpmed.org|website = www.accpmed.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACCP is the only membership organization committed solely to meeting the needs of correctional physicians. It promotes professional excellence in the following ways:

* Disseminates vital medical information at educational conferences, in professional publications, and through peer networking;
* Advocates for adherence to a [[Code of Ethics]] that ensures physicians practice the profession responsibly and with the greatest degree of integrity;
* Advocates for medical research and the professional education of students and residents to develop and maintain future excellence in correctional medicine;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8606">A '''Stock exchange''' is a [[corporation]] or [[mutual organization]] which provides facilities for [[stockbroker]]s and [[trader (finance)|trader]]s to trade [[stock]]s and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. It may be a physical [[trading room]] where the traders gather, or a formalised communications network.
Creation of a stock exchange is a strategy of [[economic development]]: it provides a means of raising capital for investment. 
Stock markets may enhance economic activity through the creation of [[liquidity]]: a liquid equity market makes investment more attractive because it allows individuals to acquire equity and when required to sell it quickly and cheaply. At the same time, companies enjoy permanent access to capital raised through equity issues.
It has been found that countries that open stock markets grow faster, on average, than the control groups.&lt;ref&gt;Opening a Stock Exchange. Jenny A. Minier. University of Miami. January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view is that [[market liquidity]] may also hurt economic growth, because it encourages short-termism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/equity/fdstock.htm|title=Stock Markets: A Spur to Economic Growth|first=  ROSS LEVINE |publisher=World Bank's Policy Research Department.|accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A downside of raising capital on a stock exchange is that it may result in loss of company control, typically to powerful large investors.

'''''t''-closeness''' is a further refinement of [[l-diversity|''l''-diversity]] group based anonymization that is used to preserve privacy in data sets by reducing the granularity of a data representation. This reduction is a trade off that results in some loss of effectiveness of data management or mining algorithms in order to gain some privacy. The ''t''-closeness model extends the ''l''-diversity model by treating the values of an attribute distinctly by taking into account the distribution of data values for that attribute.

==Attacks on ''l''-diversity==
This is useful because in real data sets attribute values may be skewed or semantically similar. However, accounting for value distributions may cause difficulty in creating feasible ''l''-diverse representations. The ''l''-diversity technique is useful in that it may hinder an attacker leveraging the global distribution of an attribute's data values in order to infer information about sensitive data values. Not every value may exhibit equal sensitivity, for example, a rare positive indicator for a disease may provide more information than a common negative indicator. Because of examples like this, ''l''-diversity may be difficult and unnecessary to achieve when protecting against attribute disclosure.  Alternatively, sensitive information leaks may occur because while ''l''-diversity requirement ensures “diversity” of sensitive values in each group, it does not recognize that values may be semantically close, for example, an attacker could deduce a stomach disease applies to an individual if a sample containing the individual only listed three different stomach diseases.

==Formal definition==
Given the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred based upon the distribution of values for ''l''-diverse data, the ''t''-closeness method was created to further ''l''-diversity by additionally maintaining the distribution of sensitive fields. The original paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Ninghui Li, Tiancheng Li, and [[Suresh Venkatasubramanian]] defines ''t''-closeness as:

{{quote|'''The ''t''-closeness Principle:''' An equivalence class is said to have ''t''-closeness if the distance between the distribution of a sensitive attribute in this class and the distribution of the attribute in the whole table is no more than a threshold ''t''. A table is said to have ''t''-closeness if all equivalence classes have ''t''-closeness.}}

Charu Aggarwal and [[Philip S. Yu]] further state in their book on [[differential privacy|privacy-preserving]] [[data mining]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Privacy-Preserving Data Mining – Models and Algorithms
| url = http://charuaggarwal.net/generalsurvey.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;that with this definition, threshold ''t'' gives an upper bound on the difference between the distribution of the sensitive attribute values within an anonymized group as compared to the global distribution of values. They also state that for numeric attributes, using ''t''-closeness anonymization is more effective than many other privacy-preserving data mining methods.

[[Image:San Sebastian-Tamborrada Festival.jpg|thumb|227px|Tamborrada. [[Donostia-San Sebastián]]]]
'''Tamborrada of Donostia''' (in [[Basque language|Basque]] '''Donostiako Danborrada''') is a celebratory [[drum]] [[festival]] held every year on January 20 in the city of [[San Sebastián]], [[Spain]]. At midnight, in the Konstituzio Plaza in the "Alde Zaharra/Parte Vieja" (Old Town), the mayor raises the flag of San Sebastián. The festival lasts for 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donquijote.org/culture/spain/society/holidays/la-tamborrada "La Tamborrada (May 2015) on don Quijote"]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants, dressed as cooks and soldiers, march in companies across the city. The celebration ends at midnight, when people congregate at the Konstituzio Plaza and the 
city flag is simultaneously lowered at various locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DANBORRADA{{!}}TAMBORRADA: Feastday of St. Sebastian|url=http://www.nabasque.org/Astero/tamborrada.htm|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
The last [[Carlist Wars|Carlist War]] in Spain took place between the end of the 18th century and the [[Second Carlist War]] (Literal translation from Catalan/Spanish: The War of the Matiners or Madrugadores) (1846-1849) and the [[Third Carlist War]] (in Spanish: Tercera Guerra Carlista) (1872–1876). As a walled military stronghold, the city of San Sebastián was subject to heavy property damage due to military activity, sometimes with dire consequences. This was especially true during the [[Siege of San Sebastián]] (1813), in which international powers (Spain, France, Great Britain, and Portugal) were involved. The war caused between 7,000 and 50,000 casualties.&lt;ref name=SadaSada/&gt;{{rp|107}}

The festival is said to originate from the 1830s custom of locals using buckets and hardware from the water pump to mock the soldiers stationed in the city by aping their daily procession from the San Telmo headquarters to the Main Gate at the city walls ("Puerta de Tierra"). The comic procession in carnival mood may have developed into a youth music group, the Carnival of Donostia, which started on the 20th of January, followed by the [[Donostia Caldereros|Caldereros]] at the beginning of February.

In the early days, the procession also heralded the ox run event, held on the same day. At this stage, the members of the procession dressed in everyday clothes, as they had not adopted uniforms yet.&lt;ref name=SadaSada /&gt; The procession further developed when local tradesman Vicente "Txiki" [[Buenechea]] donated barrels to be used as drums. In 1881, unused military outfits were discovered in the San Telmo headquarters. These were donated to the council, which in turn gave them to the Union Artesana [[txoko|club]] (the oldest in existence) for use in the Tamborrada. By 1886, barrels were added to the formations in attendance. Other ''sociedades gastronómicas'' ("[[Txoko|gourmet clubs]]") joined the Union Artesana in following years, thus expanding the festival attendance.&lt;ref name=SadaSada&gt;{{cite book|first=Javier Ma |last=Sada|title=Historia de la ciudad de San Sebastián a través de sus personajes|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=JKlL9XvHiE0C}}|year=2002|publisher=Alberdania|isbn=978-84-95589-55-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|110}}
[[File:Tamborrada infantil en San Sebastián (8 de 9) - Fondo Marín-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Children's tamborrada practice in 1962]]
According to an urban legend, a baker was fetching water from a fountain during a drought in San Sebastián in 1720. As he began to sing, local women around him started pounding on their water basins to accompany him. To his surprise, the water kept on flowing and they kept on drumming with glee. Soon a crowd gathered. As the legend has it, there has not been a drought ever since, nor has the music of the barrels ever stopped playing.

The event was cancelled in 1902 and was revived in 1906, but remained the same way even up to the years of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, which banned Carnival statewide, but maintained the two iconic festivals of the city, the Tamborrada and the Caldereros. To ensure the continuity of the city's traditions the first Children's Tamborrada was held in 1962, and has now become a permanent part of the festivities. From just only 3 in the 1920s, today there are over 125 clubs and organizations that have formations for the event.

==Music==
In 1861, local musician Raimundo Sarriegui&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Raimundo Sarriegui|"Raimundo Sarriegui"]] Retrieved on 13 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; composed the occasion's iconic marches, including the "March of San Sebastian",&lt;ref name=SadaSada /&gt;{{rp|110}} which caught on and gained popularity. Other works of his include "Erretreta", "Tatiago", "Diana" and "Iriyarena." Additional pieces have been added more recently. The traditional lyrics sung to the marches were composed by local writer [[Serafin Baroja]].

The old city march, composed by José Juan Santesteban, was added to the official songlist in 2013, marking the bicentennial year since the historic siege of 1813. The Old March was played in the 1830s as part of the festivities during those times.

==Current celebration==
Adults usually have dinner in ''sociedades gastronómicas'' ("[[Txoko|gourmet clubs]]"), which provide elements of the procession, and traditionally admitted only males. Even the strictest ones now allow women on the "Noche de la Tamborrada". They eat sophisticated meals, mostly composed of seafood (traditionally [[elver]], now no longer served due to its exorbitant price) and drink the best wines.

Depending on the time the company is marching, parade-goers take to the streets and are sometimes offered drinks between the musical performances. Nowadays the Tamborrada is made up of mixed sex companies for the most part, while proportions may vary a lot from one to the other. For "Donostiarras" this is the most celebrated festival of the year. These drummer groups often have [[marching band]]s playing along with them.

After hearing drums all night, children wake up with a version of the Tamborrada for children. They dress traditionally as soldiers from Napoleonic times and march around the city. Children from all the schools of San Sebastián march that day. They wear costumes that usually represent a particular country (such as England, Germany, or Romania). More recently, the parade has been pushed back to days before the festival proper, thus Children's Tamborrada is the first activity of the festival. 2018 marks the 57th anniversary of the Children's Tamborrada, which launched in 1961 to promote the cultural legacy of the festival to the younger generations. A repeat performance is held at noon of the festival day. 52 contingents from schools in the city join the celebrations beating their [[snare drum]]s while honoring the heroes of the defense of the city and its patron.

== Formation ==
Each of the contingents are formed by and sponsored by traditionally the txokos, and today by a variety of organizations sanctioned by the city council to form delegations for the festival. These also send liaisons to coordinate with a city council representative on the route of the march and on what district/s and/or borough/s of the city they will have to hold their festivities for the year.

Most of these are of company size save for one - the Peña Anastasio association - with 400 men and women, the size of a small battalion, and split into 3 formations. It is also affiliated with the local football team in the area.

Each for the formations are composed of:

* Markers
* [[Color guard]]
* ''Cantineras''
* [[Drum major]]
* Drum section, using snare drums
* Marching band
* Barrel drum section

Formed in 1934, the Gaztelubide association's contingent serves as the official band for the opening and closing ceremonies. By 2015 they are joined by the Coro Easo in singing the San Sebastian March.

== Overseas commemorations ==
Given San Sebastián's status as one of the two cities chosen to be the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2016, it is no surprise, however, that [[Wroclaw]], [[Poland]], the other ECC city, has begun celebrating the festival as well in 2015 - as the ''Wroclaw Tamborrada''. The 2016 event even had [[Polish Armed Forces]] bands in attendance. Just like in San Sebastián, children also take part in the event as well.

{{Roman government}}
The term "'''tetrarchy'''" (from the {{lang-el|τετραρχία}}, ''tetrarchia'', "leadership of four [people]"){{efn|Historian [[David Potter (historian)|David Potter]] translates the term as "[[Gang of Four|gang of four]]". See idem., ''Constantine the Emperor'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 1.}} describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] in 293, marking the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] and the recovery of the [[Roman Empire]]. This tetrarchy lasted until c.&amp;nbsp;313, when mutually destructive conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in control of the western half of the empire, and [[Licinius]] in control of the eastern half.

==Terminology==
Although the term "tetrarch" was current in antiquity, it was never used of the imperial college under Diocletian. Instead, the term was used to describe independent portions of a kingdom that were ruled under separate leaders.  The [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarchy of Judaea]], established after the death of [[Herod the Great]], is the most famous example of the antique tetrarchy.  The term was understood in the Latin world as well, where [[Pliny the Elder]] glossed it as follows: "each is the equivalent of a kingdom, and also part of one" (''regnorum instar singulae et in regna contribuuntur'').&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. and tr. Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As used by the ancients, the term describes not only different governments, but also a different system of government from the Diocletianic arrangements.  The Judaean tetrarchy was a set of four independent and distinct states, where each tetrarch ruled a quarter of a kingdom as they saw fit; the Diocletianic tetrarchy was a [[college]] led by a single supreme leader.  When later authors described the period, this is what they emphasized: [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] had Constantius II admonish Julian for disobedience by appealing to the example in submission set by Diocletian's lesser colleagues; Julian himself compared the Diocletianic tetrarchs to a chorus surrounding a leader, speaking in unison under his command.  Only [[Lactantius]], a contemporary of Diocletian and a deep ideological opponent of the Diocletianic state, referred to the tetrarchs as a simple multiplicity of rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much modern scholarship was written without the term.  Although [[Edward Gibbon]] pioneered the description of the Diocletianic government as a "New Empire", he never used the term "tetrarchy"; neither did [[Theodor Mommsen]].  It did not appear in the literature until used in 1887 by schoolmaster Hermann Schiller in a two-volume handbook on the Roman Empire (''Geschichte der Römischen Kaiserzeit''), to wit: "''die diokletianische Tetrarchie''".  Even so, the term did not catch on in the literature until [[Otto Seeck]] used it in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation&lt;!--Linked from 'Byzantine Empire'--&gt;==
The first phase, sometimes referred to as the [[diarchy]] ("rule of two"), involved the designation of the general [[Maximian]] as co-emperor—firstly as ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' (junior emperor) in 285, followed by his promotion to ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' in 286. [[Diocletian]] took care of matters in the eastern regions of the empire while Maximian similarly took charge of the western regions. In 293, Diocletian thought that more focus was needed on both civic and military problems, so with Maximian's consent, he expanded the imperial college by appointing two ''Caesars'' (one responsible to each ''Augustus'')—[[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus]].&lt;ref&gt;The chronology has been thoroughly established by Kolb, ''Diocletian'', and Kuhoff, ''Diokletian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 305, the senior emperors jointly abdicated and retired, allowing Constantius and Galerius to be elevated in rank to ''Augustus''. They in turn appointed two new Caesars — [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus II]] in the west under Constantius, and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] in the east under Galerius — thereby creating the second Tetrarchy.

== Regions and capitals ==
&lt;!--Linked from [[Roman Empire]]--&gt;
[[File:Tetrarchy map3.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy, showing the dioceses and the four tetrarchs' zones of influence.]]

The four tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire against bordering rivals (notably [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanian Persia]]) and [[barbarian]]s (mainly Germanic, and an unending sequence of nomadic or displaced tribes from the eastern steppes) at the Rhine and Danube. These centres are known as the tetrarchic capitals. Although Rome ceased to be an operational capital, Rome continued to be nominal capital of the entire Roman Empire, not reduced to the status of a province but under its own, unique Prefect of the City ([[praefectus urbi]], later copied in Constantinople).

The four tetrarchic capitals were:

*[[Nicomedia]] in northwestern Asia Minor (modern [[Izmit]] in Turkey), a base for defence against invasion from the Balkans and Persia's Sassanids was the capital of Diocletian, the eastern (and most senior) Augustus; in the final reorganisation by Constantine the Great, in 318, the equivalent of his domain, facing the most redoubtable foreign enemy, [[Sassanid Persia]], became the pretorian prefecture Oriens, 'the East', the core of later Byzantium.
*[[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]] in the [[Vojvodina]] region of modern [[Serbia]], and near [[Belgrade]], on the [[Danube]] border) was the capital of Galerius, the eastern Caesar; this was to become the Balkans-Danube prefecture Illyricum.
*[[Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]], near the Alps) was the capital of Maximian, the western Augustus; his domain became "Italia et Africa", with only a short exterior border.
*[[Augusta Treverorum]] (modern [[Trier]], in Germany) was the capital of Constantius Chlorus, the western Caesar, near the strategic Rhine border; it had been the capital of Gallic emperor [[Tetricus I]]. This quarter became the prefecture Galliae.

[[Aquileia]], a port on the Adriatic coast, and [[Eboracum]] (modern [[York]], in northern England near the Celtic tribes of modern Scotland and Ireland), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively.

In terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division among the four tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a 'war theater'. Each tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective [[Pretorian Prefect]], each supervising several [[Vicarii]], the governors-general in charge of another, lasting new administrative level, the civil [[Roman diocese|diocese]]. For a listing of the provinces, now known as [[eparchy]], within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see [[Roman province]].

In the West, the Augustus Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his Caesar, Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the Augustus Diocletian and his Caesar, Galerius, were much more flexible.

However, it appears that some contemporary and later writers, such as the Christian author [[Lactantius]], and [[Sextus Aurelius Victor]] (who wrote about fifty years later and from uncertain sources), misunderstood the tetrarchic system in this respect, believing it to have involved a stricter division of territories among the four emperors.

==Public image==
Although power was shared in the tetrarchic system, the public image of the four emperors in the imperial college was carefully managed to give the appearance of a united empire (''patrimonium indivisum''). This was especially important after [[Crisis of the Third Century|the numerous civil wars of the 3rd century]].

The tetrarchs appeared identical in all official portraits. Coinage dating from the tetrarchic period depicts every emperor with identical features—only the inscriptions on the coins indicate which one of the four emperors is being shown. The Byzantine sculpture ''[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs]]'' shows the tetrarchs again with identical features and wearing the same military costume.

==Military successes==
One of the greatest problems facing emperors in the Third Century Crisis was that they were only ever able to personally command troops on one front at any one time. While [[Aurelian]] and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] were prepared to accompany their armies thousands of miles between war regions, this was not an ideal solution. Furthermore, it was risky for an emperor to delegate power in his absence to a subordinate general, who might win a victory and then be proclaimed as a rival emperor himself by his troops (which often happened). All members of the imperial college, on the other hand, were of essentially equal rank, despite two being senior emperors and two being junior; their functions and authorities were also equal.

Under the Tetrarchy a number of important military victories were secured. Both the Dyarchic and the tetrarchic system ensured that an emperor was near to every crisis area to personally direct and remain in control of campaigns simultaneously on more than just one front. After suffering a defeat by the [[Persia]]ns in 296, Galerius crushed [[Narseh]] in 298—reversing a series of Roman defeats throughout the century—capturing members of the imperial household and a substantial amount of booty and gaining a highly favourable peace treaty, which secured peace between the two powers for a generation. Similarly, Constantius defeated the British usurper [[Allectus]], Maximian pacified the Gauls, and Diocletian crushed the revolt of [[Domitius Domitianus|Domitianus]] in [[Egypt]].

==Demise==
[[File:Raphael-Constantine at Milvian Bridge.jpg|thumb|200px|''Constantine at the [[battle of the Milvian Bridge]]'', fresco by [[Raphael]], Vatican Rooms.]]
{{Main|Civil wars of the Tetrarchy}}
When in 305 the 20-year term of Diocletian and Maximian ended, both abdicated. Their Caesares, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus, were both raised to the rank of Augustus, and two new Caesares were appointed: [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] (Caesar to Galerius) and [[Flavius Valerius Severus]] (Caesar to Constantius). These four formed the second tetrarchy.

However, the system broke down very quickly thereafter. When Constantius died in 306, Galerius promoted Severus to Augustus while [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], Constantius' son, was proclaimed Augustus by his father's troops. At the same time, [[Maxentius]], the son of Maximian, who also resented being left out of the new arrangements, defeated Severus before forcing him to abdicate and then arranging his murder in 307. Maxentius and Maximian both then declared themselves Augusti. By 308 there were therefore no fewer than four claimants to the rank of Augustus (Galerius, Constantine, Maximian and Maxentius), and only one to that of Caesar (Maximinus).

In 308 Galerius, together with the retired emperor Diocletian and the supposedly retired Maximian, called an imperial "conference" at [[Carnuntum]] on the River Danube. The council agreed that [[Licinius]] would become Augustus in the West, with Constantine as his Caesar. In the East, Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar. Maximian was to retire, and Maxentius was declared an usurper. This agreement proved disastrous: by 308 Maxentius had become ''de facto'' ruler of Italy and Africa even without any imperial rank, and neither Constantine nor Maximinus—who had both been Caesares since 306 and 305 respectively—were prepared to tolerate the promotion of the Augustus Licinius as their superior.

After an abortive attempt to placate both Constantine and Maximinus with the meaningless title ''filius Augusti'' ("son of the Augustus", essentially an alternative title for Caesar), they both had to be recognised as Augusti in 309. However, four full Augusti all at odds with each other did not bode well for the tetrarchic system.

Between 309 and 313 most of the claimants to the imperial office died or were killed in various civil wars. Constantine forced Maximian's suicide in 310. Galerius died naturally in 311. Maxentius was defeated by Constantine at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312 and subsequently killed. Maximinus committed suicide at [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in 313 after being defeated in battle by Licinius.

By 313, therefore, there remained only two emperors: Constantine in the West and Licinius in the East. The tetrarchic system was at an end, although it took until 324 for Constantine to finally defeat Licinius, reunite the two halves of the Roman Empire and declare himself sole Augustus.

=== 3. Tetrarchy until 16 May 307 ===

After the death of Constantius his legions proclaim his son Constantine the new ''Augustus'', but Galerius elevates Severus to be the new ''junior Augustus'' and compensates Constantine with the rank of ''Caesar''.

|}

=== 4. Tetrarchy from 18 November 308 to the beginning of May 311 ===

After the death of Severus, Constantine does not succeed him. At the council of Carnutum, Diocletian decides that 
Licinius will be the new ''Augustus'' of the West.

|}

=== 5. Tetrarchy from May 311 ===

After the death of Galerius he was succeeded by Maximinus Daia in as ''Augustus'' of the East, but is crowded by Licinius, who wants to have the status of the ''senior Augustus''. Maximinus appoints no new ''Caesar'', although it was assumed that this position should later on be filled out with the son of Severus, [[Flavius Severianus]], or at least that he was scheduled for this position.

|}

=== (6.) Tetrarchy after 8 October 316 to the end of 316 ===

Shortly before the turn of the year 316/317, Constantine, now ''Augustus'' in the West, appointed a ''Caesar'', while Licinius briefly appointed one of his officers, [[Valerius Valens]], as the third ''Augustus''. This was apparent from coins, though Valens was apparently inferior to Licinius, who soon executed him. Even the chronology is unclear, as the date stamping could also be the turn of the year 314/315.

|}

=== (7.) Tetrarchy from 1 March 317 to 18 September 324 ===

The tetrarchic system is at its end. Both ''Augusti'' appoint their own sons as co-emperors, restoring a dynastic system. However, before his death, Licinius appoints the General [[Martinianus]] on 3 July 324 as ''Augustus'' in name only, as Martinianus was intended to replace Constantine in the west.

|}

==Legacy==
Although the tetrarchic system as such only lasted until 313 CE, many aspects of it survived. The fourfold regional division of the empire continued in the form of [[Praetorian prefecture]]s, each of which was overseen by a [[praetorian prefect]] and subdivided into administrative [[Roman diocese|dioceses]], and often reappeared in the title of the military supra-provincial command assigned to a [[magister militum]].

The pre-existing notion of ''[[consortium imperii]]'', the sharing of imperial power, and the notion that an associate to the throne was the designated successor (possibly conflicting with the notion of hereditary claim by birth or adoption), was to reappear repeatedly.

The idea of the two halves, the east and the west, re-emerged and eventually resulted in the permanent de facto division into two separate Roman empires after the death of [[Theodosius I]], though it is important to remember that the empire was never formally divided, the emperors of the eastern and western halves legally ruling as one imperial college until the fall of Rome's western empire left Byzantium, the "second Rome", sole direct heir.

*Tetrarchies in the ancient world existed in both [[Thessaly]] (in northern Greece) and [[Galatia]] (in central [[Asia Minor]]; including [[Lycaonia]]) as well as among the British [[Cantiaci]].
*The constellation of Jewish principalities in the [[Herodian kingdom]] of [[Judea]] was known as a tetrarchy; see [[Tetrarchy (Judea)]].

==Personal life== 
She was born to a poor [[Hari caste|Hari]] agricultural labourer's family in Allahdino Shah village in Jhudo, [[Sindh]] province, and was married at the age of 16 into a family bonded to their landlord.&lt;ref name=dawn&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/801647 "Veeru Kohli: From bonded labourer to election hopeful"], Dawn.com, 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1006973/a-brick-solid-activist A brick-solid activist, ''Express Tribune'', 13 Dec 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; She is now a widow with 11 children.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt; Her name is sometimes written as Veero Kohli.

==Campaigning==

In 2013, she ran as an independent candidate in the [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] provincial elections.&lt;ref name="oxfam_070413"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Repila|first1=Jacky|title=Veeru Kohli – the ultimate outsider|url=http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/blog/2013/07/veeru-kohli-the-ultimate-outsider|publisher=Oxfam|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank_072313"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Duncan|title=Women's Leadership Groups in Pakistan – Some Good News and Inspiration|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/womens-leadership-groups-pakistan-some-good-news-and-inspiration|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She had previously been a slave in southern Pakistan but escaped her captors.&lt;ref name="aljazeera_112114"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehmood|first1=Rabia|title=Home of the Free: Starting a New Life in Pakistan's Azad Nagar, A Colony of Ex-Slaves|url=http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/village-of-slaves/|publisher=Aljazeera America|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After being forced back into bondage and suffering beatings she stood up to the authorities and gained her freedom,&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; with help from the [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]] in [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt; Her experiences inspired her to campaign for freedom for others. This meant she, as a [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]] speaker, had to learn [[Urdu]] to enable her to communicate with a wide range of people. [[Oxfam]] have helped her promote her ideas and develop her confidence.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt;

In 2009 she was given the [[Frederick Douglass]] Freedom Award by the [[Free the Slaves]] organisation.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetheslaves.net/slavery-survivor-fts-freedom-award-winner-runs-for-parliament-in-pakistan/ Free the Slaves]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viennese German''' ({{lang-bar|Weanarisch, Weanerisch}}, {{lang-de|Wienerisch}}) is the city dialect spoken in [[Vienna]], the capital of [[Austria]], and is counted among the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialects. It is distinct from written Standard German in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Even in [[Lower Austria]], the [[States of Austria|state]] surrounding the city, many of its expressions are not used, while farther to the west they are often not even understood.

== Features ==
Viennese differs from the Austrian form of [[Standard German]], as well as from other dialects spoken in Austria (''see also [[Austrian German]] and [[Austro-Bavarian|Bavarian]]'').

At the beginning of the 20th century, one could differentiate between four Viennese dialects (named after the districts in which they were spoken): ''Favoritnerisch'' ([[Favoriten]], 10th District), ''Meidlingerisch'', ([[Meidling]], 12th District), ''Ottakringerisch'' ([[Ottakring]], 16th District), and ''Floridsdorferisch'' ([[Floridsdorf]], 21st District). Today these labels are no longer applicable, and one speaks of a single Viennese dialect, with its usage varying as one moves further away from the city.

Besides the locational dialects of Old Vienna, there were also class-based dialects. For example, ''Schönbrunnerdeutsch'', or German as spoken by the courtiers and attendants of the Habsburg Imperial Court at Schönbrunn Royal Palace, was a manner of speech with an affected bored inflection combined with overenunciation{{clarify|date=September 2016}}. The nasal tonality was akin to German spoken with a French accent. While far less used today, educated Viennese are still familiar with this court dialect.

All in all, speaking Viennese masterly by intonating sentences with distinctive ups and downs creates a very warm, melodic sound  - particularly in said "Schönbrunn" variant.

=== Phonology ===
Features typical of Viennese German include:
* [[Monophthongization]]: Compared to Standard German and to other Bavarian dialects, [[diphthongs]] are often monophthongized, somewhat as some [[Southern American English|Southern US accents]] turn ''oil'' into ''o-ol''.&lt;br /&gt;For example:
** Standard German ''heiß'' – Bavarian ''hoaß'' – Viennese ''haaß'' {{IPA|[haːs]}}
** Standard German ''weiß'' – Viennese ''wääß'' {{IPA|[væːs]}}
** Standard German ''Haus'' – Viennese ''Håås'' {{IPA|[hɒːs]}}
* It is typical to lengthen vowels somewhat, often at the end of a sentence. For example: ''Heeaasd, i bin do ned bleeed, wooos waaasn ii, wea des woooa'' (Standard German ''Hörst du, ich bin doch nicht blöd, was weiß denn ich, wer das war''): "Listen, I'm not stupid; what do I know, who it was?"
* The "Meidlinger L", i.e. {{IPA|/l/}} pronounced with [[velarization]] {{IPAblink|ɫ}} found in the [[working class]] dialect, which reflects the [[Czech language|Czech]] pronunciation.
* Inserting vowels into consonant clusters ([[epenthesis]]): Likewise depending on the social class, a speaker, every now and then, may insert a vowel {{IPAblink|ɐ}} between two following consonants. That usually results in an additional syllable, which "intensifies" the word and usually has a negative feeling to it. &lt;br /&gt;Examples:
** Standard German ''Verschwinde!'' – Viennese ''Vaschwind!'' – intensified ''Vasch'''a'''wind!''
** Standard German ''Verbrecher!'' – Viennese ''Vabrecha!'' – intensified ''Vab'''a'''recha!''
** Standard German ''abgebrannt'' – Viennese ''oobrennt'' – intensified ''oob'''a'''rennt''
** Standard German ''Geradeaus!'' – Viennese ''Groodaus!'' – intensified ''G'''a'''roodaus!''

The following Viennese German characteristics are also found in other [[Austro-Bavarian|Bavarian]] dialects:

* [[Fortis and lenis|Consonant tenseness]]: Voiceless [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] consonants {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become [[fortis and lenis|lenis]] {{IPA|[b̥, d̥, ɡ̊]}}. The {{IPA|[k]}}, however, usually remains fortis when it follows a vowel.
* [[L-vocalization|Vocalization]] of {{IPA|/l/}} within a word after a vowel,&lt;br&gt;e.g. ''also'' → ''oeso'' {{IPA|[ˈɔe̯so]}}, ''Soldat'' → ''Soedot'' {{IPA|[sɔe̯ˈdɔːt]}}, ''fehlen'' → ''föhn'' {{IPA|[fœːn]}}, ''Kälte'' → ''Köödn'' {{IPA|[ˈkøːd̥n̩]}}
* Vocalization of {{IPA|/l/}} at the end of a word, after a vowel,&lt;br&gt;e.g. ''schnell'' → ''schnöö'' {{IPA|[ʃnœː]}}, ''viel'' → ''vüü'' {{IPA|[fʏː]}}
* Unrounding front [[vowels]] after [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] consonants,&lt;br&gt;e.g. ''Glück'' {{IPA|[ˈɡlʏk]}} → ''Glick'' {{IPA|[ˈɡlɪk]}}, ''schön'' {{IPA|[ˈʃøːn]}} → ''schee'' {{IPA|[ˈʃẽː]}}
* Rounding unrounded vowels before {{IPA|/l/}} (which may have been elided by now),&lt;br&gt;e.g. ''schneller'' → ''schnöller'' {{IPA|[ˈʃnœlɐ]}}, ''vielleicht'' → ''vülleicht'' {{IPA|[fʏˈlæːçt]}}, ''wild'' → ''wüüd'' {{IPA|[vyːd̥]}}

=== Grammar ===
There are not many grammatical differences from other Bavarian dialects, but the following are typical:
* The avoidance of the [[genitive case]]
* The use of the preposition ''ohne'' (without) with the [[dative]] case instead of the [[accusative case]]
* The replacement of "ihn" or "ihm" with "eam", for instance: "Hast du ihn gesehen?" ("Have you seen him?") would be "Host eam gsehn?" in Viennese
* The replacement of "wir" with "mia"

=== Vocabulary ===
The dialect is distinct mostly in its vocabulary.

==== Influences ====
Vocabulary displays particular characteristics. Viennese retains many [[Middle High German]] and sometimes even [[Old High German]] roots. Furthermore, it integrated many expressions from other languages, particularly from other parts of the former [[Habsburg Monarchy]], as Vienna served as a [[melting pot]] for its constituent populations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Because transcription of Viennese has not been standardised, the rendering of pronunciation here is incomplete:

==== Examples ====
* from [[Old High German]]:
** ''Zähnd'' (Standard German ''Zähne'', English ''teeth'', from ''zand'')
** ''Hemad'' (''Hemd'', = English ''shirt'', from ''hemidi'')
* from [[Middle High German]]:
** ''Greißler'' (=''small grocer'', from ''griuzel'' - [[diminutive]] of ''Gruz'' =''grain'')
** ''Baaz'' (=''slimy mass'', from ''batzen''=''being sticky'')
** ''si ohgfrettn'' (=''to struggle'', from ''vretten'')
* from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]:
** ''Masl'' (=''luck'', from ''masol'')
** ''Hawara'' (=''friend, companion'', from ''chaver'')
** ''Gannef'' (=''crook'', from ''ganav'')
** ''Beisl'' (=''bar, pub'', from ''bajser'')
* from [[Czech language|Czech]]:
** ''Motschga'' (=''unappetizing mush'', from ''močka''=''residue in a pipe'' or ''a piss'' or from ''omáčka''=''Sauce, Soup'')
** ''Pfrnak'' (=''(big) nose'', from ''frňák'')
** ''Lepschi'' (''Auf Lepschi gehen'' = ''to go out'' or ''to amuse oneself'', from ''lepší''=''better'')
* from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]:
** ''Maschekseitn'' (=''the other side'', from ''a másik'')
** ''Gattihosn'' (=''long underpants'', from ''gatya'' = ''trousers'')
* from [[Italian language|Italian]]:
** ''Gspusi'' (=''girlfriend'', from ''sposa'')
** ''[[Gstanzl]]'' (=''Stanza of a humorous song'', from ''stanza'')
** ''Gusta'' (=''appetite for something'', from ''gusto'')
* from [[French language|French]]:
** ''Trottoa'' (=''sidewalk'', from ''trottoir'')
** ''Lawua'' (=''washbowl'', from ''lavoir'')
** ''Loschie'' (from ''logis'')
* from [[Arabic]]:
** ''Hadscha'' (=''a long path'', from ''[[Hajj]]'')

=== Pragmatics ===
In Viennese, the following [[pragmatics]] peculiarities are found quite often:
* Frequent [[irony|ironic speech]] that is marked neither through [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] nor through [[nonverbal communication|gestures]]. In most cases, sarcasm must be identified through its context. Especially for foreigners, it is a source of misunderstandings. Such ironic speech is common in the Viennese sense of humour, which is better known as ''[[Wiener Schmäh]]''.
* Understatement uses recognisable [[diminutive]] suffixes, such as ''-l'' or ''-erl'', as in ''Kaffeetscherl'' or ''Plauscherl''.

== Trends ==
In more recent times Viennese has moved closer to Standard German; it has developed into a kind of Standard German spoken with a typical Viennese [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] (for example, the original Viennese ''Wos host’n fir a Notn gschriebn?'' becomes modern ''Was hast’n für eine Note gschriebn?''). The typical Viennese monophthongization, through which the dialect differentiates itself from the neighboring dialects, remains, but mostly in the form of a developing "Pseudo-Standard German" that many foreigners{{clarify|date=September 2016}}, particularly from other states, feel is ugly.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

For example: ''Waaaßt, wos mir heut in der Schule für än gråååsliches Fläääsch kriegt ham?'' (Standard German ''Weißt du, was für ein widerliches Fleisch wir heute in der Schule vorgesetzt bekamen?'') ("Do you know what disgusting meat we were served at school today?") The monopthongized [[diphthong]]s, like ''ei'' ~ ''äää'' or ''au'' ~ ''ååå''{{clarify|date=November 2011}}, are particularly stressed and lengthened.

The reason for the convergence of the typical Viennese dialects is the attitude, strengthened by the media, that ''Urwienerisch'' (old Viennese) is associated with the lower classes. With the rising standard of living, the original Viennese can further converge, as it is considered a sign of low-class origins, while the unique Viennese words (such as ''Zwutschgerl'') (cf Zwetschge/Zwetsche/Pflaume depending on dialect ("plum")) however generally remain in use.

Viennese dialects have always been influenced by foreign languages, particularly due to immigration. In the past 40 years{{when|date=September 2016}} immigrants mostly came from the former Yugoslavia, Turkey and most recently (East) Germany; but modern-day immigration has changed, which in turn has affected and created new varieties of modern-day Viennese. As an ongoing process, particularly in areas with a high percentage of first- and second-generation immigrants, new [[loanword]]s find their way into Viennese, and so do changes in pronunciation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

*{{IPA|/h/}} is found only word-initial in [[loanword]]s, and may be glottal {{IPA|[h]}} or [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] {{IPA|[ħ]}}.
*{{IPA|/t/}} is [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, [[dental consonant|dental]] otherwise.
*{{IPA|/q/}} can be ejective {{IPA|[qʼ]}}, and in some cases the ejectives appear to be in [[free variation]] with the voiceless plosives.

===Phonological processes===

====Gemination====
In positions other than word-initial, Xamtanga contrasts [[geminate]] and non-geminate [[consonant]]s. With most consonants, the difference between a geminate and a non-geminate is simply one of length, but the cases of {{IPA|/b t q/}} are more complex.  When not word-initial, non-geminate {{IPA|/b/}} is realized as a bilabial {{IPA|[β]}} or labiodental fricative {{IPA|[v]}}, and {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/q/}} are realized as affricates: {{IPA|[tθ qχ]}}. Their geminate equivalents may be realized as prolonged {{IPA|[bː tː qː]}}, or can simply be short {{IPA|[b t q]}}.

In word-initial position, geminate consonants do not occur, and /b t q/ are realized as plosives.
