{{commons category|Field camps in Antarctica}}
Many Antarctic [[research station]]s support satellite field camps which are, in general, seasonal camps. The type of field camp can vary – some are permanent structures used during the annual Antarctic summer, whereas others are little more than tents used to support short term activities. Field camps are used for many things, from logistics ([[Sky Blu]]) to dedicated scientific research ([[WAIS Divide]] Field Camp).

==Career==
During his time and a math teacher he began traveling around the Netherlands and Europe. He published his findings in about 250 articles and books. He, together with Roelof Schuiling, was the publisher of the entire Earth's School Atlas. Most of his works are considered to be the beginning of modern geography. His works are still being used to educate Dutch youth in schools across the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wereldaandewand.nl/artikel2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5245">The '''Bahamian dry forests''' are a [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forest]] ecoregion in [[the Bahamas]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], covering an area of {{convert|4800|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.  They are found on much of the northern Bahamas, including [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros]], [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]], and [[Grand Bahama]],&lt;ref name="wwf"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0203 |name=Bahamian dry forests |accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they are known as coppices.&lt;ref name="commonwealth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/BahamasWeb/VisitingTheBahamas.nsf/Subjects/Ecosystems+Of+The+Bahamas |title=Ecosystems Of The Bahamas |publisher=The Commonwealth of The Bahamas |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dry forests are distributed evenly throughout the Turks and Caicos.&lt;ref name="wwf" /&gt;

==Whiteland coppice==
Whiteland coppices are shrubby forests that occur near the ocean.  Vegetation occurring in whiteland coppice is able to withstand [[Halophyte|salt]] spray and rocky, [[calcareous]] [[soil]]. Trees that grow in whiteland coppices include cinnecord (''[[Acacia]] [[Acacia choriophylla|choriophylla]]''), brasiletto (''[[Caesalpinia]] [[Caesalpinia vesicaria|vesicaria]]''), haulback tree (''[[Mimosa]] [[Mimosa bahamensis|bahamensis]]''), autograph tree (''[[Clusia rosea]]''), [[manchineel tree]] (''Hippomane mancinella''), West Indian mahogany (''[[Swietenia mahagoni]]''), sea grape (''[[Coccoloba uvifera]]''), gumbo-limbo (''[[Bursera simaruba]]''),&lt;ref name="Whiteland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnt.bs/download-main.php?mode=download&amp;catid=4&amp;subid=39&amp;id=77 |title=Whiteland Coppice |work=Ecosystems of the Bahamas |publisher=Bahamas National Trust |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162653/http://www.bnt.bs/download-main.php?mode=download&amp;catid=4&amp;subid=39&amp;id=77 |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; cabbage palmetto (''[[Sabal palmetto]]''), and poisonwood (''[[Metopium toxiferum]]'').

==Blackland coppice==
Blackland coppice covers the interior of many of the islands, usually in elevated regions.&lt;ref name="commonwealth" /&gt;  For this reason some blackland coppice exists on hills entirely surrounded by [[Bahamian pineyards|forests]] of [[Caribbean pine]] (''Pinus caribaea'' var. ''bahamensis'').&lt;ref name="grand_bahama" /&gt; Trees found within them include West Indian mahogany (''[[Swietenia mahagoni]]''), wild tamarind (''[[Lysiloma latisiliquum]]''), red cedar (''[[Cedrela odorata]]''), false mastic (''[[Sideroxylon foetidissimum]]''), horseflesh (''[[Lysiloma]] [[Lysiloma sabicu|sabicu]]''), pigeon plum (''[[Coccoloba diversifolia]]''),&lt;ref name="commonwealth" /&gt; Jamaican dogwood (''[[Piscidia piscipula]]''), gumbo-limbo (''[[Bursera simaruba]]''), and lancewood (''[[Nectandra]] [[Nectandra coriacea|coriacea]]'').&lt;ref name="grand_bahama" /&gt; Shaded by the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]], plants such as satin leaf (''[[Chrysophyllum oliviforme]]''), Spanish stopper (''[[Eugenia foetida]]''), Bahama wild coffee (''[[Psychotria ligustrifolia]]''), Bahama strongbark (''[[Bourreria]] [[Bourreria succulenta|succulenta]]''), night-scented orchid (''[[Epidendrum nocturnum]]''), wormvine orchid (''[[Vanilla (genus)|Vanilla]] [[Vanilla barbellata|barbellata]]''), and potbelly airplant (''[[Tillandsia paucifolia]]'') grow in the [[understory]].&lt;ref name="commonwealth" /&gt;

==Rocky coppice==
Rocky coppice occurs on [[limestone]] [[outcrop]]pings between [[mangrove]]s and [[Bahamian pineyards|pineyards]]. These forests are often flooded at high [[tide]]. They are dominated by spiny black olive (''[[Bucida]] [[Bucida molinetii|molinetii]]''), but ''[[Swietenia mahagoni]]'' and ''[[Cedrela odorata]]'' also grow within them.&lt;ref name="grand_bahama" /&gt;

'''Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau''' (19 February 1846 – 15 February 1923) was a noted [[France|French]] [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] and [[archaeologist]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Biography==
Clermont-Ganneau was born in [[Paris]], son of a [[sculpture|sculptor]] of some repute.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} After an education at the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales]], he entered the [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] service as ''[[dragoman]]'' to the [[consulate]] at [[Jerusalem]], and afterwards at [[Constantinople]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He laid the foundation of his reputation by his involvement with [[Mesha Stele|stele of Mesha (Moabite Stone)]],{{Citation needed|reason=the discovery is attributed to a German scholar in the Moabite Stone article|date=December 2011}} which bears the oldest [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] inscription known.

In 1871, Clermont-Ganneau identified the biblical city of Gezer &lt;small&gt;(Joshua 16:11)&lt;/small&gt; with that of [[Abu Shusha]], formerly known as ''Tell el Jezer''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine during the Years 1873-1874'', vol. II, London 1896, pp. 251-255; 275.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he discover in Jerusalem [[Temple Warning inscription]]. In 1874 he was employed by the British government to take charge of an archaeological expedition to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Among his discoveries there was the [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut tomb]] of the Biblical [[Shebna]].&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70&gt;The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem, David Ussishkin, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 33, No. 2 (May, 1970), pp. 33-46,&lt;/ref&gt; He explored/discovered many tombs in Wady Yasul, a valley immediately south of Jerusalem, which he claimed served as an auxiliary cemetery for Jerusalem at some ancient period(s). Based on geographic and linguistic evidence he theorized that this valley was [[Azal (Bible)|Azal]] mentioned in Zechariah 14:5 in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine'', Vol. 1. pg. 420, 1899; Charles Clermont-Ganneau, Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement, April 1874, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to make archeological soundings at [[Emmaus-Nicopolis]].  He was subsequently entrusted by his own government with similar missions to [[Syria]] and the [[Red Sea]]. He was made ''chevalier'' of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1875. After serving as vice-consul at [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]] from 1880 to 1882, he returned to Paris as ''secrétaire interpréte'' for oriental languages, and in 1886 was appointed consul of the first class. He subsequently accepted the post of diiector of the École des Langues Orientales and professor at the [[Collège de France]].

In 1889 he was elected a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres]], of which he had been a correspondent since 1880. In 1896 he was promoted to be [[consul-general]], and was [[minister plenipotentiary]] in 1906.

===Crusades against archaeological forgeries===
{{further| Shapira Scroll}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
In 1873, after the [[Jerusalem]] antiquities dealer [[Moses Wilhelm Shapira]] offered a set of Moabite artifacts (known as the ''Shapira Collection'') for sale, Clermont-Ganneau attacked the collection as a forgery. In 1883, Shapira offered the so-called ''Shapira Strips'', fragments of ancient parchment allegedly found near the [[Dead Sea]], for sale to the [[British Museum]], which exhibited two of the strips. Clermont-Ganneau attended the exhibition, and was the first person in England to attack their authenticity. In 1903 he took a prominent part in the investigation of the so-called [[Tiara of Saitaferne]]. This tiara had been purchased by the [[Louvre]] for 200,000 francs, and exhibited as a genuine antique. Much discussion arose as to the perpetrators of the fraud, some believing that it came from southern [[Russia]]. It was agreed, however, that the whole object, except perhaps the band round the tiara, was of modern manufacture.

==Works==
Clermont-Ganneau's chief publications, besides a number of contributions to journals, were:
* ''L'Imagerie phénicienne et la mythologie iconologique chez les Grecs'' (1880)&lt;ref&gt;''Je m'appelle [[Byblos]]'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], H &amp; D, 2005, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Recueil d'archéologie orientale'' (1885, etc.)
*''Palestine inconnue'' (1886)

The '''Churchill Rocket Research Range''' is a former [[Spaceport|rocket launch site]] located {{convert|23|km|mi}}&lt;ref name="CNSC" /&gt; outside [[Churchill, Manitoba]].&lt;ref name="historic site listing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Churchill Rocket Research Range National Historic Site of Canada|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=12776&amp;pid=0|website=Canadian Register of Historic Places|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=March 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was used by Canada and the United States beginning in 1954 for [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital launches]] of [[sounding rocket]]s to study the upper atmosphere. The site was scientifically beneficial due to lying in the center of a zone containing high aurora activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defence &amp; Discovery: Canada's Military Space Program, 1945-74|last=Godefroy|first=Andrew B.|publisher=UBC Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7748-1959-6|location=Vancouver, B.C.|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 3,500 sub-orbital flights were launched from the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/fort_churchill.asp CSA - Fort Churchill – a landmark in Canadian space research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704224220/http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/fort_churchill.asp |date=2011-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is sometimes referred to as '''Fort Churchill''' after the nearby former military base (now [[Churchill Airport]]) and is connected by an all-weather gravel road to the town of Churchill.

==History==
[[File:Rocket launch Churchill Manitoba circa 1965 07.jpg|thumb|left|A rocket launching at the Churchill Rocket Research Range, {{circa}} 1965]]

The complex was first built in 1954 by the [[Canadian Army]]'s [[Defence Research and Development Canada|Defence Research Board]] to study the effects of [[polar aurora|auroras]] on long distance communications. The programme shut down in 1955, but the site was re-opened and greatly expanded in 1956 as part of [[Canada]]'s participation in the [[International Geophysical Year]]. Launches for the IGY experiments started in 1957, and the site was closed again in December 1958 when the IGY, which was actually two years long, ended.

The site was reopened again in August 1959 by the [[United States Army|US Army]], in collaboration with the Canadian government, as part of its network of sounding rocket stations. In September 1959 it was used to test [[CARDE]]'s new [[solid fuel]] propellant systems with '''PVT-1''', the vehicle that would evolve into the [[Black Brant rocket|Black Brant]]. However, in late 1960 a fire destroyed many of the facilities. It was announced that the Black Brant test series would be continued with an additional twelve launches at [[NASA]]'s [[Wallops Flight Facility]] during 1961-62, while the facilities at Churchill were rebuilt.

The US Army ended its involvement at Churchill in June 1970, and the site was taken over by the Canadian [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]] to support the Canadian Upper Atmosphere Research Program. The site was used sporadically during the 1970s and 1980s, and was largely deserted by 1985.

=== {{anchor|SpacePort Canada}} SpacePort Canada: 1994-1998 ===
[[Akjuit Aerospace]], a Canadian company founded in 1992, signed a 30-year lease with the Canadian government for the Churchill Rocket Research Range in 1994 with the goal of developing the world's first commercial spaceport. Akjuit assembled a "technical team" of 21 firms led by the American aerospace contractor [[Raytheon]] to plan the development of the site into SpacePort Canada, including [[polar orbit]]al launch capability.&lt;ref name="Braga 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Braga |first=Matthew |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-failed-plan-to-build-a-commercial-spaceport-in-the-subarctic |title=Before Mojave There Was A Subarctic Spaceport in Canada |work=Motherboard |date=September 25, 2014 |accessdate=2016-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Akjuit planned to launch commercial polar-orbiting payloads using [[Russia]]n-made [[Start-1]] rockets (so named as they were made of repurposed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]] [[ICBM]]s made redundant by the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Interfax|title=Agreement Reached To Launch Satellites From Canada|url=http://www.fas.org:80/news/russia/1997/drsov017_a_97029.htm|website=News|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=December 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010208171507/http://fas.org/news/russia/1997/drsov017_a_97029.htm|archivedate=February 8, 2001|date=January 24, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill's location in the western hemisphere combined with its range-safety for firing northwards made it an ideal location, with the exception of the extremely cold weather which would limit launch seasons.&lt;ref name="Braga 2014"/&gt;

Akjuit's first and only rocket launch took place at 7:10{{nbsp}}a.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]] on April 28, 1998: a suborbital [[Black Brant (rocket)#Black Brant IX|Black Brant IXB]] research rocket containing a physics payload for the [[Canadian Space Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=SpacePort Canada, the world's first privately owned spaceport, launches rocket|url=http://www.spaceport.ca:80/launch/ACTIVE_page.html|publisher=Akjuit Aerospace|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|accessdate=December 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980526005416/http://www.spaceport.ca/launch/ACTIVE_page.html|archivedate=May 26, 1998|date=April 28, 1998|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corymbia ''citriodora''''' is a tall [[tree]], growing to {{convert|35|m|ft|0}} in height (but sometimes taller), from [[temperate]] and [[Tropics|tropical]] north eastern [[Australia]]. It is also known as  '''lemon-scented gum''', '''blue spotted gum''', '''lemon [[eucalyptus]]''' and '''eucalyptus citriodora'''.

==Description==
''Corymbia citriodora'' has smooth, pale, uniform or slightly mottled [[Bark (botany)|bark]], white to coppery in summer, and a conspicuously narrow-leaved [[Crown (botany)|crown]] which smells strongly of [[lemon]]s. [[Pear]]-shaped [[bud]]s are borne in clusters of three, formed in the corner of leaf and stem junctions, whilst [[fruit]] (capsules) are [[urn]]-shaped. The bark is smooth for the entire height of the tree, often powdery, shedding in thin curling flakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/euclid3/euclidsample/html/Corymbia_citriodora.htm Factsheet - Corymbia citriodora]&lt;/ref&gt;

It prefers lighter, slightly acidic [[loam]]y soils and occurs in dry [[sclerophyll]] forest and woodlands in hilly country. ''Corymbia citriodora'' has a [[lignotuber]]. [[Flower]]ing has been recorded in January, April, May, June, July, August, October and December.

==Range==
[[File:Corymbia citriodora - shedding bark 4.jpg|thumb|left|Corymbia ''citriodora'' along Fraser Avenue, [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]], Western Australia]]
Plants of ''C. citriodora'' are [[Naturalization|naturalised]] in the [[Darling Scarp|Darling Range]] near [[Mundaring, Western Australia|Mundaring]], [[Western Australia]] and by planting to suburban [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

[[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] has a famous, beautiful avenue of this species planted many years ago, but it has spread to become a serious [[weed]].&lt;ref&gt;Hussey et al., (1997) ''Western weeds : a guide to the weeds of Western Australia '' South Perth, W.A.: Plant Protection Society of W.A. : 1997. {{ISBN|0-646-32440-3}}, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

''Corymbia citriodora'' is an important forest tree, in demand for structural timber and for [[honey]] production. It also is popular in horticulture both within Australia and overseas. The name ''Corymbia citriodora'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''citriodorus'', which means ''lemon-scented''.

Many naturalists and conservationists do not recognise the [[Corymbia]] genus and still categorise its species within [[Eucalyptus.]]&lt;ref&gt;Brooker &amp; Kleinig (2006) Field Guide to Eucalypts. 3rd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  Corymbia is a genus of about 113 species of tree that were classified as Eucalyptus species until the mid-1990s. It includes the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums. The bloodwoods had been recognised as a distinct group within the large and diverse Eucalyptus genus since 1867. Molecular research in the 1990s, however, showed that they, along with the rest of the Corymbia section, are more closely related to Angophora than to Eucalyptus, and are probably best regarded as a separate genus. All three genera—Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus—are closely related, often difficult to tell apart, and are still commonly and correctly referred to as "eucalypts".

==Essential oil==
[[File:KingsParkWesternAustralia1 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|250px|An avenue of Lemon-scented Gums in [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]]]
The [[essential oil]] of the lemon-scented gum mainly consists of [[citronellal]] (80%),&lt;ref&gt;Boland, D.J. ''et al.'', ''Eucalyptus Leaf Oils - Use, Chemistry, Distillation and Marketing'', {{ISBN|0-909605-69-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; produced largely in Brazil and China.&lt;ref&gt;Lawless, J., ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Essential Oils'', {{ISBN|1-85230-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrefined oil from the lemon eucalyptus tree is used in [[perfumery]], and a refined form of this oil is used in [[insect repellent]]s, especially against [[mosquitoes]]. The refined oil's citronellal content is turned into cis- and trans- isomers of [[p-menthane-3,8-diol]] (PMD), a process which occurs naturally as the eucalyptus leaves age. This refined oil, which includes related compounds from the essential corymbia citriodora, is known widely by its registered tradename, "Citriodiol", but also by generic names which vary by region: "oil of lemon eucalyptus" or "OLE" (USA); "PMD rich botanic oil" or "PMDRBO" (Europe); "PMD and related oil of lemon eucalyptus compounds" (Canada); Extract of Lemon Eucalyptus (Australia).  Pure PMD is synthesized for commercial production from synthetic citronellal.  Essential oil refined from the leaves of the tree can contained up to 98% citronella content.  The smell of the essential oil can vary, but mostly includes a strong odor compatible alone to citronella oil, with a slight hint of lemon scent.

A study comparing mosquito repellents found that products using the oil of lemon eucalyptus were effective at driving mosquitos away from a human hand.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy D. Rodriguez; Lisa L. Drake; David P. Price; John I. Hammond; Immo A. Hansen. 2015.

A '''direct-controlled municipality''' is the highest level classification for [[cities]] used by [[unitary state]], with status equal to that of the provinces in the respective countries. A direct-controlled municipality is similar to, but not the same as, a [[Federal district]], a common designation in various countries for a municipality that is not part of any state, and which usually hosts some governmental functions. Usually direct-controlled municipality are under central governments control with limited power.

Many countries have adopted this system with some different variations. Geographically and culturally, many of the municipalities are [[enclave]]s in the middle of provinces. Some occur in strategic positions in between provinces.

An '''ecclesiastical province''' is one of the basic forms of jurisdiction in [[Christianity|Christian Churches]] with traditional hierarchical structure, including [[Western Christianity]] and [[Eastern Christianity]]. In general, an ecclesiastical province consists of several [[diocese|dioceses]] (or [[eparchy|eparchies]]), one of them being the [[archdiocese]] (or [[archeparchy]]), headed by [[metropolitan bishop]] or [[archbishop]] who has ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all other bishops of the province.

In the Greco-Roman world, ''ecclesia'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐκκλησίᾱ}}, ''ekklēsiā'' ([[Latin]] [[wikt:ecclesia#Latin|ecclesia]]) meaning "[[wikt:congregation|congregation]], [[wikt:church|church]]") was used to refer to a lawful assembly, or a called legislative body.  As early as [[Pythagoras]], the word took on the additional meaning of a community with shared beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, 8.41 (available [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/dl/dl08.html online], retrieved 22 May 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the meaning taken in the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Scriptures]] (the [[Septuagint]]), and later adopted by the Christian community to refer to the assembly of believers.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bauer, W. Danker, ''A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other Early Christian Literature,'' third ed., (Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 2000), {{lang|grc|ἐκκλησία}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of [[Western world]] (sometimes more precisely as [[Greco-Roman world]]) adopted by the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], Christian ecclesiastical provinces were named by analogy with the secular [[Roman province]] as well as certain [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] formations of western world in early medieval times (see [[Early Middle Ages]]). The administrative seat of each province is an [[episcopal see]]. In hierarchical [[Christian]] [[Christian Church|churches]] that have [[dioceses]], a province is a collection of those dioceses (as a basic unit of administration).

Over the years certain provinces adopted the status of [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]] and have a certain degree of self-rule. A [[bishop]] of such province is called the [[metropolitan bishop]] or metropolitan. The [[Catholic Church]] (both Latin and Eastern Catholic), the [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Churches and the [[Anglican Communion]] all have provinces. These provinces are led by a [[metropolitan archbishop]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Provincial church organisation==

===Early history===
Ecclesiastical provinces first corresponded to the civil provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. From the second half of the second century, the bishops of these provinces were accustomed to assemble on important occasions for common counsel in [[synod]]s. From the end of that century the summons to attend these increasingly important synods was usually issued by the bishop of the capital or metropolis of the province, who also presided over the assembly, especially in the East. Important communications were also forwarded to the bishop of the provincial capital to be brought to the notice of the other bishops. Thus in the East during the third century the bishop of the provincial metropolis came gradually to occupy a certain superior position, and received the name of metropolitan.

At the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) this position of the metropolitan was taken for granted, and was made the basis for conceding to him definite rights over the other bishops and [[dioceses]] of the state province. In Eastern canon law since the fourth century (cf. also the [[Synod of Antioch]] of 341, can. ix), it was a principle that every civil province was likewise a church province under the supreme direction of the metropolitan, i.e. of the bishop of the provincial capital.

This division into ecclesiastical provinces did not develop so early in the Western Empire. In North Africa the first metropolitan appears during the fourth century, the [[Bishop of Carthage]] being recognized as primate of the dioceses of Northern Africa; metropolitans of the separate provinces gradually appear, although the boundaries of these provinces did not coincide with the divisions of the empire. A similar development was witnessed in Spain, Gaul, and Italy. The migration of the nations, however, prevented an equally stable formation of ecclesiastical provinces in the Christian West as in the East. It was only after the fifth century that such gradually developed, mostly in accordance with the ancient divisions of the Roman Empire. In Italy alone, on account of the central ecclesiastical position of Rome, this development was slower. However, at the end of Antiquity the existence of church provinces as the basis of ecclesiastical administration was fairly universal in the West. In the Carolingian period they were reorganized, and have retained their place ever since.

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
Historical development of ecclesiastical provinces in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was influenced by strong tendencies of internal administrative centralization. Since the [[First Ecumenical Council]] (325), the Archbishop of Alexandria was given supreme jurisdiction over all provinces of Egypt. Similar authority was also granted to Archbishop of Antioch regarding jurisdiction over provinces of Orient. Since the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council]] (451), Patriarch of Constantinople was given right to consecrate metropolitan bishops in all regions that were placed under his supreme jurisdiction.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989}} In time, previous administrative autonomy of original ecclesiastical provinces was gradually and systematically reduced in favor of patriarchal centralization. Ancient practice of annual councils of provincial bishops, headed by their local metropolitans, was also abandoned in favor of centralized councils, headed by patriarchs and attended by metropolitan bishops. 

Creation of new autonomous and autocephalous jurisdictions was also marked by tendencies of internal centralization. The newly created [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]] (1018) was structured as a single ecclesiastical province, headed by archbishop who had jurisdiction over all of his suffragan bishops. In 1219, autocephalous [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] was also organized as one ecclesiastical province, headed by archbishop with direct jurisdiction over all Serbian bishops.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=40-46}} By the end of [[Middle Ages]], each autocephalous and autonomous church in Eastern Orthodoxy was functioning as a single, internally integrated ecclesiastical province, headed by local patriarch or archbishop.

Only in modern times, some Eastern Orthodox Churches have revived the ancient practice by creating internal ecclesiastical provinces on the middle (regional) level of church administration. In [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] there are six regional metropolitanates, headed by local metropolitans who are presiding over regional synods of local bishops, and have special duties and privileges. For example, [[Metropolis of Oltenia|Metropolitan of Oltenia]] has regional jurisdiction over four local dioceses. On the other hand, majority of Eastern Orthodox Churches remain to function as highly centralized church bodies, each of them functioning as a single ecclesiastical province.{{sfn|Kiminas|2009}}

===Catholic Church===
{{Hatnote|Further information: [[List of Catholic dioceses (structured view)|List of Catholic dioceses]]}}
====In general====
In the [[Catholic Church]], a province consists of a metropolitan archdiocese and one or more [[suffragan diocese]]s headed by diocesan bishops. The [[archbishop]] of the metropolitan see is the [[metropolitan bishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan]] of the province. The [[delimitation]] of church provinces in the [[Latin Church]] is reserved to the [[Holy See]].

However, there have always been individual dioceses which do not belong to any province but are [[Exemption (church)|directly subject]] to the Holy See, such as the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg]]. There are also some archdioceses that are not metropolitan sees and some that are suffragan to another archdiocese; their [[archbishop]]s do not receive the [[pallium]].

The authority of a Latin-Church metropolitan over the other sees within his province is now very limited. During a [[sede vacante|vacancy]] in a [[Suffragan Diocese|suffragan see]], the metropolitan is to name a temporary [[vicar capitular|diocesan administrator]] if the College of [[Consultor]]s of the diocese fails to elect one within the prescribed period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law: Canon 421]&lt;/ref&gt;  A metropolitan generally presides at the installation and consecration of new bishops in the province, and the tribunal of the metropolitan see generally serves as the first court of appeal regarding canonical matters of provincial diocesan tribunals. The metropolitan's insignia is the pallium. The article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1911 on "metropolitan" shows that the metropolitan then had scarcely any power more than now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10244c.htm |title=Metropolitan |year= |work= Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the [[patriarch]]al or [[major archbishop|major archiepiscopal]] Churches may also be divided into ecclesial provinces, each headed by a metropolitan. The [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] has [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church#Current administrative division|several]], two of them in the United States and Canada. Some other Eastern Catholic Churches of a lower category and generally less populous, are known as [[Sui iuris#metropolitan churches|metropolitanates]]. They are headed by a single metropolitan, the hierarch of a fixed [[episcopal see]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 155 §1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0050551/RIC-project/BOOKS/EASTERN%20CHURCHES%20-%20CCEO/FARIS-John%20D%20-%20East%20Cath%20Churches%20ALL.PDF John D. Faris, ''The Eastern Catholic Churches: Constitution and Governance'' (Saint Maron Publications, New York 1992), p. 376]&lt;/ref&gt; As head of an autonomous Church, his name is mentioned in the [[liturgy]] of that Church immediately after that of the Pope and, in suffragan eparchies, ahead of that of the local hierarch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html#TITULUS_VI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 161]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Provincial boundary lines====
The borders of provinces have often been inspired, or even determined, by historical or present political [[border]]s; the same is often true of diocesan borders within a province. The following are some examples:

* In France, where the boundaries partly reflected later Roman provinces, most have been rearranged (2002) to fit new administrative regions.
* A comparable process to that of France occurred earlier in Spain.
* In southern [[Germany]], the diocesan boundaries follow the political boundaries that existed between 1815 and 1945.
* In Ireland, the [[List of Roman Catholic dioceses in Ireland|four ecclesiastical provinces]] fixed by the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152 reflected the contemporary boundaries of the [[provinces of Ireland|secular provinces]], but the ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses do not coincide with the present civil province and [[counties of Ireland|county]] borders. Since the [[Partition of Ireland]] in 1920–1922 six dioceses in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|province of Armagh]] straddle [[Irish border|the international border]] between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], which is part of the United Kingdom.
* In [[Scotland]], the dioceses, and subsequently the two provinces, follow both civil and geographical boundaries such as rivers.
* In geographically large nations with a sizeable Catholic population, such as the [[United States]], ecclesiastical provinces typically follow [[U.S. state|state]] [[border|lines]], with less populous states being grouped into provinces. In the United States, there are five exceptions:
** California has two metropolitan archdioceses and provinces: [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|San Francisco]].
** Texas has two metropolitan archdioceses and provinces: [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston|Galveston-Houston]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio|San Antonio]].
** Maryland is unusual in that fourteen of its 23 counties belong to dioceses whose see cities are outside Maryland: (1) the nine counties of Maryland's [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] ([[Delmarva Peninsula]]) are part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington|Diocese of Wilmington]], Delaware, and (2) the five counties adjacent to the District of Columbia and in southern Maryland are part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Archdiocese of Washington]], which is a different province. Only the remaining nine counties and the City of Baltimore are part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]].
** [[Fishers Island]], a part of Suffolk County, New York, and north of [[Long Island]], is part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]], Connecticut, which is in a different province.
** Those parts of Idaho and Montana that are within [[Yellowstone National Park]] are  part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne|Diocese of Cheyenne]], Wyoming, which is in a different province.
:In addition, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup|Diocese of Gallup]] (New Mexico) contains two Arizona [[County (United States)|counties]]—[[Apache County]] and [[Navajo County]]—and part of a third county, i.e., those parts of the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and [[Hopi Reservation|Hopi]] [[Indian reservation|reservations]] that are in [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] (Arizona). New Mexico and Arizona, however, together form one province.
* Many countries contain more than one province, except those with a small population or few Catholics.
* In at least one case, a province contains dioceses that are in more than one nation, e.g., the Province of Samoa-Apia, of which the metropolitan see (the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia|Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia]]) is in the Independent State of Samoa, and its only suffragan see (the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Samoa-Pago Pago|Diocese of Samoa-Pago Pago]]) is in American Samoa (an unincorporated territory of the United States). Even individual dioceses, let alone ecclesiastical provinces, con comprise more than one state: examples are [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro|San Marino-Montefeltro]] ([[San Marino]] and part of [[Italy]]), [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Urgell]] ([[Andorra]] and part of [[Spain]], and the [[Diocese of Rome]] itself ([[Vatican City]] and part of [[Italy]]).

===Anglican Communion===
{{Hatnote|Further information: [[Anglican Communion#Provinces|Anglican Communion § Provinces]]}}
Member churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] are often referred to as '''provinces'''.  Some provinces are coterminous with the boundaries of political states, some include multiple nations while others include only parts of a nation. Some, such as the [[Church of the Province of West Africa]], have the word "province" in their names. These member churches are known as "provinces of the Anglican Communion," and are headed by a [[primate (bishop)|primate]], who is usually also styled archbishop, but may have an alternative title such as primus (for example, the [[Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church]]), [[presiding bishop]], or [[Moderator of the General Assembly|moderator]].

The word is also used to refer to a grouping of [[diocese]]s within a member church, commonly known as a metropolitical province, metropolitan province, or internal province. The [[Church of England]] is divided into two such provinces: [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Province of York|York]]. The [[Anglican Church of Australia]] has five provinces: [[Province of New South Wales|New South Wales]], [[Province of Queensland|Queensland]], [[Province of South Australia|South Australia]], [[Province of Victoria|Victoria]] and [[Province of Western Australia|Western Australia]], and an extraprovincial diocese. The [[Anglican Church of Canada]] has four: [[Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and Yukon|British Columbia and Yukon]], [[Ecclesiastical Province of Canada|Canada]], [[Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario|Ontario]], and [[Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert's Land|Rupert's Land]]. The [[Church of Ireland]] has two: [[Province of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh]] and [[Province of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Dublin]]. The [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] (ECUSA) numbers, rather than names, its [[Ecclesiastical Provinces and Dioceses of the Episcopal Church|nine provinces]]. In all cases apart from ECUSA each metropolitan or internal province is headed by a [[Metropolitan bishop]] with the title archbishop.

===Evangelical State Church in Prussia===
The ''Evangelical State Church in Prussia'', formed in 1821 (renamed: ''Evangelical State Church in Prussia's older Provinces'' in 1875, [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] in 1922), had ecclesiastical provinces (Kirchenprovinz[en]) as administrative subsections mostly following the boundaries of those political [[Provinces of Prussia]] which formed part of the state before 1866, with some border changes after 1920 following WWI territorial cessions.

==Religious institutes==
The term ''province'', or occasionally '''religious province''', also refers to a geographical and administrative subdivision in a number of [[Catholic religious order|orders]] and [[congregation (Catholic)#Congregations as a historical category of religious institutes|congregations]]. This is true of most, though not all, religious communities founded after the year AD 1000, as well as the [[Augustinian]]s, who date from earlier.

A province of a religious institute is typically headed by a [[provincial superior]]. The title differs by each institute's tradition (provincial minister for [[Franciscan]]s; provincial prior for [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]; provincial for the Augustinians, simply "provincial" or "provincial father" for the [[Jesuit]]s and many others, for instance).

The borders of a religious institute's provinces are determined independently of any diocesan structure, and so the borders often differ from the 'secular', or diocesan, ecclesiastical provinces.  The orders' provinces are usually far larger than a diocese, a secular province, or even a country, though sometimes they are smaller in an institute's [[:wikt:heartland|heartland]].

Most [[monastic order]]s are not organized by provinces. In general, they organise their administration through autonomous houses, in some cases grouped in larger families. For example, each [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] is an independent foundation, but will often choose to group themselves into [[Congregation (Catholic)#Augustinian, Benedictine and Cistercian congregations|congregations]] based on historical connections.

==Features==
[[Paraguay]] is notable for its [[history]], [[culture]] and [[ecology]].

==National Parks/Reserves==
* Médanos del Chaco National Park
* Lagoon Inmakata National Park
* Ganso National Park
* Riacho Yacaré Ecological Reserve
* Pozo Hondo Ecological Reserve
* Scientific Pirizal Reserve
* Yacaré National Park
* Estero Milagro National Park
* Laguna Blanca Ecological Reserve
* Cerro Sarambí National Park

The country appeals to [[ecotourism]] because of its [[plant]] and [[animal]] diversity.  Paraguay offers cultural diversity, with a variety of ecosystems, shared with neighboring countries. It offers the opportunity to see a diversity of wildlife in both public and private places.

==Flora==
[[Image:Cerro Mbatovi.jpg|thumb|250px|left]]

The [[flora]] consists of an estimated 13,000 native species including [[trees]], [[shrubs]], [[herbs]] and epiphytic species as well as [[orchids]].

There are approximately 20,000 species; this includes the native and exotic and 280 native endangered species.

The most valuable tree species in the native forests are: [[lapacho]], [[Apocynaceae|perobá]], [[yvyrapytá]], [[Bay Cedar]], [[incense]]. The tree that is emblematic of [[Paraguay]] is the lapacho.

The forest zone is a major natural resource. Better controls are needed to avoid [[deforestation]], since it endangers the country's unique species; nevertheless there are several national parks such as '''National Park Ybycuí''' To 160&amp;nbsp;km [[Asunción]] 50 square kilometres of subtropical forest.

The [[National Parks in the Chaco, Paraguay|National Defensores del Chaco]] covers an area of 7400 square kilometres.

==Fauna==
There are 13000 species of [[vertebrates]] and [[fish]], [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], [[birds]], [[mammals]], [[invertebrates]], [[shellfish]] and [[shellfish]] or [[insects]].

The species of wildlife threatened with extinction are: [[Jaguar]], [[Cougar|yaguareté]], [[tapirs]], [[Tapir|mboreví]], [[bare-throated bellbird]], [[Red-rumped parrot|red parrot]], [[harpy eagle]] or taguato, [[anteater]] or jurumí, [[giant armadillo]] or tatú cart, lies and others. 
  
Rivers provide [[surubí]], [[gold]] and [[pacú]].

==Protected wildlife areas==

[[File:Flora Sinensis - Lychee.JPG|thumb|right|Drawing of a [[lychee]], in Boym's ''Flora Sinensis'']]
'''''Flora Sinensis''''' is one of the first European natural history books about China, published in Vienna in [[1656 in science|1656]]. Its author, [[Michael Boym]], was a [[Jesuit]] missionary from Poland (at that time [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]).
{{unclear|date=July 2016}}
The book was the first description of an ecosystem of the Far East published in Europe. Boym underlined the medicinal properties of the Chinese plants. The book also included pleas for support of the Catholic Chinese emperor{{who|date=July 2017}} and each page contained a chronogram pointing to the date of 1655, the date of coronation of Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] as the King of Hungary, as Boym wanted to gain support of that monarch for his mission.

It is said that the ''Flora Sinensis'' was the first book that used the name "[[Flora]]" in this meaning, a book covering the plant world of a region. However, despite its title, the book covered not only plants, it obviously includes some species that are neither plants nor Chinese.

It is part of the [[Central African Shear Zone]] (CASZ) and dates to at least 640 million years ago. 
The zone was rejuvenated several times, usually with a [[Fault (geology)|dextral]] movement, before and during the opening of the South Atlantic in the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/AInv/1986-GJRAS-Adamawa.pdf |title=A teleseismic delay time study across the Central African Shear Zone in the Adamawa region of Cameroon, West Africa |author1=C.

The Foumban shear zone is a series of faults associated with major [[mylonite]] zones, a segment of the CASZ.
The CASZ can be traced from the [[Sudan]] to the [[Adamawa plateau]], after which its path is obscured by volcanoes. Based on reconstruction of the configuration of South America before it separated from Africa, the zone can be identified with the Pernambuco fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The shear zone underlies a chain of active volcanoes, called the [[Cameroon Volcanic Line]].
In August 1986 a magnitude 5 earthquake with epicenter near [[Lake Nyos]] indicated that the shear zone may be again reactivating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Geographical Association''' (GA) is a [[United Kingdom]]-based subject association whose objects are the advancement of education for the public benefit by furthering geographical knowledge and understanding, through the promotion and dissemination of good practice in geographical teaching and learning. It is a registered charity and is wholly independent of state aid.

==Origins==
The Geographical Association was formed by five geographers, including [[Halford John Mackinder]], in 1893 as an independent, unincorporated association. The first members got together to use and exchange [[magic lantern|lantern slides]], a leading technology of the day. The history of the first hundred years of the GA was published in 1993 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Balchin | first = W.J.V | title =The Geographical Association: the first hundred years | publisher =GA | date =1993 | location =Sheffield | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a more recently a chronological list of key people, events and achievements of the association up to the present day has been produced. The current purpose remains the development of a community of practice for sharing teaching ideas, innovations and understanding about geographical education, but the GA  also serves as a voice for and represents the interests of geography teachers in policy and practice initiatives through engagement with government.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, K., 1985. Geography in the school curriculum. Geography, pp.290-297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, P., 1989. A place in the sun: the role of the Geographical Association in establishing geography in the national curriculum of England and Wales, 1975–89. Journal of Geography in Higher Education, 13(2), pp.149-157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walford, R. and Williams, M., 1985. Geography and the school curriculum: the recent role of the Geographical Association. Area, 17(4), pp.317-321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawling, Eleanor M. "The politics and practicalities of curriculum change 1991-2000: Issues arising from a study of school geography in England." British Journal of Educational Studies 49, no. 2 (2001): 137-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, D. and Hopkin, J., 2014. A possibilist analysis of the geography national curriculum in England. International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education, 23(1), pp.64-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution and Operation==

The GA has approximately 5000 members. These include primary and secondary [[teachers]], trainee teachers ([[student teachers]]), teacher educators, academics, geography students, infant, primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, academies, libraries, societies, museums and businesses. Although a UK-based organisation, there are members in more than 60 countries with strong links between geographical organisations in the USA, Australia and Europe. Its core activities are financed by membership subscriptions.

The Geographical Association was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 on 28 January 2010 as a private company limited by guarantee (company number 07139068). Charitable status was subsequently conferred by the Charity Commission on 24 March 2010, under registration number 1135148. The GA had previously existed as an unincorporated association (registered charity number 31329) since its formation in 1893. The main motivation for the change in the legal structure of the GA in 2010 was the purchase of property, in the form the land and buildings that it had been occupying since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geography.org.uk/download/GA%20Trustee%20Report%20and%20Accounts%20-%202015%20.pdf GA Trustees' Report 2014-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GA is governed by a Board of 14 Directors. They are the legal members of the Geographical Association limited company and also its Trustees. This Board is called the Governing Body. The power to appoint Members of the Governing Body rests with the Governing Body itself, but the wider membership of the GA may, by means of the election procedures set out in the By-laws, make nominations for membership of the Governing Body. The Governing Body also has the power to co-opt up to three individuals (within the total of 14) to fill specialist roles.

Members make considerable input to the work and activities of the Association through voluntary  contributions of time and expertise. Key aspects of geography education are developed through  special interest groups and phase committees.

There is a network of 41 affiliated regional branches of the GA. Each branch has an autonomous constitution, broadly similar to the national association. Branches organise lectures for post-16 students, teachers and general public and a programme of professional development activities for teachers. Many run a regional Worldwise geographical quiz competition.

The education policy of GA is formulated by a representative Education Group, which oversees the activities of its Phase Committees, Special Interest Groups and Communications BoardsGeographical Association website.

In broad terms the priorities, plans and achievement goals for the GA are set out in a 5-year strategic plan which identifies the three key aims of the Association for 2014-19. These are 1. Meet professional and educational needs, 2. Demonstrate the value of geographical education , and 3. Use (the GA's) resources efficiently and sustainably.

The GA Office and headquarters is in [[Sheffield]] with a core body of professional staff who provide day-to-day and strategic services under the leadership of an appointed Chief Executive.

==Activities==

'''Publications''':  '''Journals'''

The GA publishes three professional journals for members on a termly basis (three issues each year, based on the different phases of education viz. ''Primary Geography'', ''Teaching Geography'' (aimed at Secondary/High school teachers) and ''Geography'' - its flagship international journal for post-16 students, undergraduates, teachers and lecturers. ''Geography'' publishes articles by leading geographers and geography educators that provide summaries and reviews of contemporary geographical topics and developments in geography education. The aim is to help 'recontextualise' the discipline of geography for educational purposes and also be a means for university academics to keep in touch with the school subject.

'''Publications''':  '''Geography resources'''

The GA produces and sells a range of resources and guidance materials for teachers for Early Years through to Post-16 teachers. These include the geographical adventures of a teddy bear called 'Barnaby Bear' (A Trade Marked product)for primary-aged children, Handbooks for primary and secondary school teachers, 'Toolkits' providing curriculum planning advice and lesson ideas for secondary school teachers, and a series of 'Top Spec Geography' booklets on contemporary topics aimed at AS/A2 level students. 
In addition at a more general level, the catalogue includes a series interpretive guides to areas of  'classic' landforms and the exploration of cities and how they have been shaped.

'''Social Media for geography teachers'''

News and information for geography teachers is disseminated via the GA website, Facebook page and Twitter feed. The GA also facilitates a series of [[Ning (website)|Ning]] networks and communities for geography teachers and educators.

'''Resources for geography teachers'''

The GA website is a platform and depository for teaching ideas and resources. These are frequently updated as new geographical events occur or innovations in geography teaching approaches are developed.

'''A manifesto for geography education'''

In 2009 the GA published a document 'A Different View' describing geography as 'one of humanity's big ideas' aimed at making a compelling case for geography's place in the curriculum, demonstrating the practical importance of 'real world' geography and the value of geographical thinking.

'''Campaigning for geography'''

The Geographical Association engages with policy makers and government ministers to constantly make the case for geography, with a strong involvement in curriculum reviews and Government education consultations. From 2006- 2011 the Geographical Association and [[Royal Geographical Society|RGS-IBG]] jointly led the government-funded Action Plan for Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Action Plan for Geography. | url =http://www.geography.org.uk/projects/actionplanforgeography/ | accessdate =2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geography subject leadership'''

The Geographical Association develops geography subject leadership at all levels, from new teachers during their initial training, to geography co-ordinators in primary schools, to secondary heads of department.

'''Annual conference'''

An annual conference rotates between locations in the north, midlands and south e.g. Manchester (2016), Guildford (2017) and offers a varied programme of lectures, talks, workshops and a large exhibition of geography education resources and published materials. The conference also includes a free public lecture and an awards event.

'''Training Courses'''

The Geographical Association runs a programme of continuing professional development events in different locations around the country.

'''Quality Marks'''
 
The GA operates a scheme whereby schools or geography departments can apply to be recognised for quality and progress and creative thinking in geography leadership, curriculum development, learning and teaching in school. The scheme encourages a development process using a self-assessment framework with submitted of examples of geography planning, lessons and students' work. Awards are made by a scrutiny panel of expert teachers. The awards are available for primary and secondary schools and are offered at Bronze, Silver and Gold Standards. Successful schools can apply for recognition as a Centre of Excellence. Evidence from schools that have used the Geography Quality Mark scheme indicates they find the evaluative framework a powerful and enabling tool for curriculum development.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, P., 2013. More than just core knowledge? A framework for effective and high-quality primary geography. Education 3-13, 41(4), pp.382-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Worldwise'''

The GA operates a series of activities to engage students directly under the banner 'Worldwise'. Activities include local and online geography quizzes, photo competitions, an essay competition and a fieldwork challenge weekend.

'''Funded projects'''

Over a number of years the Geographical Association has established itself as a leading force in the development of innovative geography projects in partnership with a variety of high-profile funders, e.g. the government-funded 'Global Learning Programme' and the British Council 'Connecting Classrooms' programme aimed at developing critical thinking and problem solving in geography.
The GA has been a partner or participant in a range of Europe-wide projects e.g. GeoCapabilities Project.

The '''Guiana Shield'''&lt;ref&gt;The term  ''Guiana''  or ''The [[Guyanas|Guianas]]'' is often used as a collective name for [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[French Guiana]], and sometimes even includes the portions of [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]] which are on the Guiana Shield.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the three [[craton]]s of the [[South American Plate]]. It is a 1.7 billion-year-old [[Precambrian]] geological [[Shield (geology)|formation]] in northeast [[South America]] that forms a portion of the northern coast.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, David S. (ed.) (2005) ''Tropical Forests of the Guiana Shield'' CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK, ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; The higher elevations on the [[Shield (geology)|shield]] are called the '''Guiana Highlands''', which is where the table-like mountains called [[tepui]]s are found. The Guiana Highlands are also the source of some of the world's most spectacular waterfalls such as [[Angel Falls]], [[Kaieteur Falls]] and [[Kuquenan Falls]].

The Guiana Shield underlies [[Guyana]] (previously British Guiana), [[Suriname]] (previously Dutch Guiana) and [[French Guiana]] (or Guyane), most of [[Venezuela]], as well as parts of [[Colombia]], and [[Brazil]]. The rocks of the Guiana Shield consist of metasediments and metavolcanics ([[Greenschist|greenstones]]) overlain by sub-horizontal layers of [[sandstones]], [[quartzites]], [[shales]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] intruded by sills of younger mafic intrusives such as [[gabbro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, A.K. and Barron,C.N. (eds) (1993) ''The Geology of the Guiana Shield'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The oldest rocks in the shield consist of [[Archean]] Imataca Complex, composed of a [[quartz]]-[[feldspar]] [[gneiss]] and subordinate [[mafic]] gneiss.  The Guri [[fault (geology)|Fault]] marks the southern boundary of the complex.  South of that fault are Early [[Proterozoic]] rocks consisting of the [[metavolcanic rock|metavolcanic]] Pastora [[geological unit|Supergroup]] and the [[granitic]] [[plutonic]] Supamo Complex.  The Cuchivero Group consists of [[ash flow]] [[tuff]] and granitic plutonic rocks.  The Early to Middle Proterozoic Roraima Group consists of continental [[clastic sediment|clastic sedimentary]] rocks.  These [[Precambrian]] sediments include quartz [[sandstones]], [[quartzite]]s, and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] presumed to be 1.8 to 1.4 [[Giga annum|Ga]] in age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geology and Mineral Resource Assessment of the Venezuelan Guayana Shield, USGS Bulletin 2062|date=1993|publisher=US Government Printing Office|pages=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wray|first1=Robert|editor1-last=Migon|editor1-first=Piotr|title=The Gran Sabana: The World's Finest Quartzite Karst?, in Geomorphological Landscapes of the World|date=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789048130542|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomorphology==
There are three upland areas of the Guiana Shield:
# The Guiana Highlands proper are in Venezuela east of the Orinoco and extend across much of west-central Guyana and into the northern [[Roraima]] state in Brazil.
# The Tumucumaque Uplands which are a series of central massifs in an arc from the [[Wilhelmina Mountains]] of south-central Suriname, along the southern boundary of Suriname and Guyana, forming the Acarai Mountains of Roraima state and the [[Tumuc-Humac Mountains]] of [[Pará]] and [[Amapá]] states of Brazil. From this arc, the southern uplands slope gently downwards towards the Amazon River and the northern uplands slope gently downwards toward the [[Atlantic]].
# The [[Chiribiquete Plateau]] is a sandstone topped [[plateau]] with an elevation of {{Convert|900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} that forms the western edge of the shield. The plateau is separated from the eastern [[Andes]] by the thick [[Neogene]] sediments of the Sub-Andean Trough that runs along the northern and western rim of the Guiana Shield.

The north-central part of the Guiana Highlands is dominated by high flat-topped peaks called [[tepui]]s, of the Roraima supergroup and Quasi-Roraima formation, and the rounded granite peaks of the Parguaza and Imataca complexes to the north and southwestern edges of the area. The highest point in the shield is [[Pico da Neblina]] in Brazil at {{convert|2995|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ibge2016"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://saladeimprensa.ibge.gov.br/noticias?view=noticia&amp;id=1&amp;busca=1&amp;idnoticia=3109 |title=Geociências: IBGE revê as altitudes de sete pontos culminantes |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Geosciences: IBGE revises the altitude of seven high points | location=Brasília |publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE) |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2016-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pico da Neblina is the highest summit of the larger [[Neblina massif]], a highly eroded sandstone plateau that straddles the Venezuela-Brazil border and that has lost the typical tabletop shape of the other tepuis in the region.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Ecology==
[[File:H chimantensis2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Heliamphora chimantensis]]'', [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[Chimantá Massif]] (a [[Venezuela]]n part of the Guiana Shield)]]
The Guiana Shield is one of the regions of highest [[biodiversity]] in the world, and has many [[endemism|endemic]] species. The region houses has over 3000 [[vertebrate]] species: 1168 fresh water fish, 269 amphibians (54% endemics), 295 reptiles (29%), 1004 birds (7.7%), and 282 mammals (11%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hollowell|first= T.|first2= R.P. |last2= Reynolds|year= 2005|title= Checklist of the Terrestrial Vertebrates of the Guiana Shield|journal= Bulletin of the Biological Society of Washington|volume= 13|url= http://botany.si.edu/bdg/pdf/bswa_13_all.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Vari|first1= R.P.|first2= C.J.|last2= Ferraris Jr.|first3= A.|last3= Radosavljevic|first4= V.A.|last4= Funk|year= 2009|title= Checklist of the freshwater fishes of the Guiana Shield|journal= Bulletin of the Biological Society of Washington|volume= 17|url= http://botany.si.edu/bdg/pdf/bswa_fish-chcklst_2009-complete.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity of invertebrates remains largely undocumented, but there are several species of endemic butterflies and dung beetles.&lt;ref name="IndicativeResponse"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrer-Paris|first1=José R|last2=Lozano|first2=Cecilia|last3=Cardozo-Urdaneta|first3=Arlene|last4=Thomas Cabianca|first4=Arianna|title=Indicative response of ''Oxysternon festivum'' Linné (Coleoptera: Scarabaidae) to vegetation condition in the basin of the Orinoco river, Venezuela|journal=Journal of Insect Conservation|volume=in press|issue=3|pages=527–538|doi=10.1007/s10841-016-9886-6|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ViloriaPantepui"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=Mauro|last2=Viloria|first2=Ángel L.|last3=Hubber|first3=Otto|last4=Attal|first4=Stéphane|last5=Orellana|first5=Andrés|title=Lepidoptera del Pantepui.

Plant life is equally rich and 13,367 species of [[vascular plant]]s have been found, approximately 40% of which is considered endemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Funk|first1= V.|first2= T.|last2= Hollowell|first3= P.|last3= Berry|first4= C.|last4= Kelloff|first5= S.N.|last5= Alexander|year= 2007|title=Checklist of the Plants of the Guiana Shield (Venezuela: Amazonas, Bolivar, Delta Amacuro; Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana)|journal= Contributions from the United States National Herbarium|volume= 55|url= http://botany.si.edu/bdg/pdf/vol55web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield is overlain by the largest expanse of tropical forest on any Precambrian shield area in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, David S. (ed.) (2005) ''Tropical Forests of the Guiana Shield'' CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK, ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Guianan rain forest is similar in nature to [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] rain forest and known protected areas include the Iwokrama Forest of central Guyana, Kaieteur, [[Kanuku]] National Park of southern Guyana, the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] [[Central Suriname Nature Reserve]] of [[Suriname]], the [[Guiana Amazonian Park]] in [[French Guiana]] and the [[Tumucumaque National Park]] in the [[Amapá]] State of [[Brazil]]. In Venezuela the forests are protected by [[Canaima National Park|Canaima]], [[Parima Tapirapecó National Park|Parima-Tapirapeco]] and [[Serranía de la Neblina National Park|Serranía de la Neblina]] national parks. In 2014, the Government of Colombia designated a 250 hectare area of the Guaina Shield, as a Ramsar Wetland, thus becoming a protected area of international importance in accordance to the [[Ramsar Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ramsar.org/es/complejo-de-humedales-de-la-estrella-fluvial-in%C3%ADrida-efi | title=Colombia &amp;#124; Ramsar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to recent researches, ecosystems of the Guayana Highlands are in danger because of non-native plant species (including "a well-known [[Invasive species|invasive]] plant elsewhere" ''[[Poa annua]]'' and "one of the most aggressive weeds" ''[[Polypogon elongatus]]'') and infectious faecal bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' introduced by tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rull|first= V.|last2= Vegas-Vilarrúbia|first2= T.|last3= Safont|first3= E.|date= 2016|title= The Lost World's pristinity at risk|journal= [[Diversity and Distributions]]|volume= 22|issue= 10|pages= 995–999|doi= 10.1111/ddi.12469}}

*[[Americas]]&lt;ref name=Americas&gt;The division of the [[Americas]] into the [[continent]]s of [[North America]] and [[South America]] is somewhat arbitrary.  Most commonly, [[Panama]] is considered to be a part of North America and [[Colombia]] is considered a part of [[South America]].  [[Geology|Geologically]], the boundary between the two continents is defined by the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate]] and the [[South American Plate]].  This places the boundary roughly along the Panama-Colombia border.  Other definitions place the boundary at the lowest natural crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] near the [[Panama Canal]], or along the canal itself.  Another definition places the boundary at the lowest crossing of [[Central America]] near [[Lake Nicaragua]].  This definition splits Central America between the continents of North and South America.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[North America]]&lt;ref name=North_America&gt;Greater [[North America]] may be [[Geography|geographically]] subdivided into [[Northern America]], [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;/ref&gt;
***[[Central America]]&lt;ref name=Central_America&gt;Central America is defined as the southeasternmost extent of North America, most commonly including the seven nations of [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Panama]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8147">'''Inverse distance weighting''' ('''IDW''') is a type of [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic method]] for [[multivariate interpolation]] with a known scattered set of points. The assigned values to unknown points are calculated with a [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] of the values available at the known points.

The name given to this type of methods was motivated by the [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] applied, since it resorts to the inverse of the distance to each known point ("amount of proximity") when assigning weights.

==Definition of the problem==
The expected result is a discrete assignment of the unknown function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in a study region:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x): x \to \mathbb{R}, \quad x \in \mathbf{D} \sub \mathbb{R}^n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the study region.

The set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; known data points can be described as a list of [[tuple]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;[(x_1, u_1), (x_2, u_2), ..., (x_N, u_N)].&lt;/math&gt;

The function is to be "smooth" (continuous and once differentiable), to be exact (&lt;math&gt;u(x_i) = u_i&lt;/math&gt;) and to meet the user's intuitive expectations about the phenomenon under investigation. Furthermore, the function should be suitable for a computer application at a reasonable cost (nowadays, a basic implementation will probably make use of [[parallel computing|parallel resources]]).

== Shepard's method ==

=== Historical reference ===
At the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, beginning in 1965, a varied collection of scientists converged to rethink, among other things, what we now call [[geographic information system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chrisman |first=Nicholas |title=History of the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics: a Poster Exhibit | url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic39008.files/History_LCG.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motive force behind the Laboratory, Howard Fisher, conceived an improved computer mapping program that he called SYMAP, which, from the start, Fisher wanted to improve on the interpolation. He showed Harvard College freshmen his work on SYMAP, and many of them participated in Laboratory events. One freshman, Donald Shepard, decided to overhaul the interpolation in SYMAP, resulting in his famous article from 1968.&lt;ref name=shepardArticle&gt;{{cite conference |last=Shepard |first=Donald |year=1968 |title=A two-dimensional interpolation function for irregularly-spaced data |booktitle=Proceedings of the 1968 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] National Conference |pages = 517–524 |doi=10.1145/800186.810616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard’s algorithm was also influenced by the theoretical approach of [[William Warntz]] and others at the Lab who worked with spatial analysis. He conducted a number of experiments with the exponent of distance, deciding on something closer to the gravity model (exponent of -2). Shepard implemented not just basic inverse distance weighting, but also he allowed barriers (permeable and absolute) to interpolation.

Other research centers were working on interpolation at this time, particularly University of Kansas and their SURFACE II program. Still, the features of SYMAP were state-of-the-art, even though programmed by an undergraduate.

=== Basic form ===
[[Image:Shepard interpolation 2.png|thumb|640px|center|Shepard's interpolation for different power parameters ''p'', from scattered points on the surface &lt;math&gt;z=\exp(-x^2-y^2)&lt;/math&gt;]]

A general form of finding an interpolated value &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; at a given point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; based on samples &lt;math&gt;u_i=u(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,...,N&lt;/math&gt; using IDW is an interpolating function:

:&lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{cases}
 \dfrac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{ w_i(\mathbf{x}) u_i } }{ \sum_{i = 1}^{N}{ w_i(\mathbf{x}) } }, &amp; \text{if } d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_i) \neq 0 \text{ for all } i, \\
 u_i, &amp; \text{if } d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_i) = 0 \text{ for some } i,
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;w_i(\mathbf{x}) =  \frac{1}{d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_i)^p}&lt;/math&gt;

is a simple IDW weighting function, as defined by Shepard,&lt;ref name=shepardArticle/&gt; '''x''' denotes an interpolated (arbitrary) point, '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is an interpolating (known) point, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a given distance ([[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] operator) from the known point '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to the unknown point '''x''', ''N'' is the total number of known points used in interpolation and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a positive real number, called the power parameter.

Here weight decreases as distance increases from the interpolated points. Greater values of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; assign greater influence to values closest to the interpolated point, with the result turning into a mosaic of tiles (a [[Voronoi diagram]]) with nearly constant interpolated value for large values of ''p''. For two dimensions, power parameters &lt;math&gt;p \leq 2&lt;/math&gt; cause the interpolated values to be dominated by points far away, since with a density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of data points and neighboring points between distances &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the summed weight is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_j w_j \approx \int_{r_0}^R \frac{2\pi r\rho \,dr}{r^p} = 2\pi\rho\int_{r_0}^R r^{1-p} \,dr,&lt;/math&gt;
which diverges for &lt;math&gt;R\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\leq2&lt;/math&gt;. For ''N'' dimensions,  the same argument holds for &lt;math&gt;p\leq N&lt;/math&gt;.  For the choice of value for ''p'', one can consider the degree of smoothing desired in the interpolation, the density and distribution of samples being interpolated, and the maximum distance over which an individual sample is allowed to influence the surrounding ones.

''Shepard's method'' is a consequence of minimization of a functional related to a measure of deviations between [[tuple]]s of interpolating points {'''x''', ''u''} and ''i'' tuples of interpolated points {'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{x}, u) = \left( \sum_{i = 0}^{N}{\frac{(u-u_i)^2}{d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_i)^p}} \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} ,&lt;/math&gt;
derived from the minimizing condition:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \phi(\mathbf{x}, u)}{\partial u} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The method can easily be extended to other dimensional spaces and it is in fact a generalization of Lagrange
approximation into a multidimensional spaces. A modified version of the algorithm designed for trivariate interpolation was developed by Robert J. Renka and is available in [[Netlib]] as algorithm 661 in the toms library.

=== Example in 1 dimension ===
[[Image:Shepard interpolation 1 dimension.png|thumb|640px|center|Shepard's interpolation in 1 dimension, from 4 scattered points and using ''p'' = 2]]

=== Łukaszyk–Karmowski metric ===
Yet another modification of the Shepard's method was proposed by Łukaszyk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Computational Mechanics| volume= 33| issue=4| pages=299–304| doi=10.1007/s00466-003-0532-2| title=A new concept of probability metric and its applications in approximation of scattered data sets| author=Łukaszyk S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also in applications to experimental mechanics. The proposed weighting function had the form

:&lt;math&gt;w_k(\mathbf{x}) =  \frac{1}{(D_{**}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_k)  )^\frac{1}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_{**}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_k)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Łukaszyk–Karmowski metric]] chosen also with regard to the [[statistical error]] [[probability distribution]]s of measurement of the interpolated points.

=== Modified Shepard's method ===

Another modification of Shepard's method calculates interpolated value using only nearest neighbors within ''R''-sphere (instead of full sample). Weights are slightly modified in this case:

:&lt;math&gt;w_k(\mathbf{x}) =  \left( \frac{\max(0,R-d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_k))}{R d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_k)} \right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

When combined with fast spatial search structure (like [[kd-tree]]), it becomes efficient ''N'' log ''N'' interpolation method suitable for large-scale problems.

The '''Public Enterprise for Managing and Protection of the Multipurpose Area Jasen''' ({{lang-mk|Јавно претпријатие за управување и заштита на повеќенаменското подрачје „Јасен“}}) or just '''Reservе Jasen''' ({{lang-mk|Резерват „Јасен“}}) is a nature reserve in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It was turned into a protected nature reserve in 2010 (part of it was declared a reserve as far back as 1958) and is situated only 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Skopje]]. The park compromises around {{convert|24000|ha}} of caves, mountains, underground rivers and lakes. The lowest point is the still uncharted canyon lake Matka. The highest point is Mount Karadzica with a height of almost {{convert|2500|m}}.

The park is home to the endangered Eurasian lynx and the rare Balkan chamois.

==History==
The territory of today's Public Enterprise for Managing and Protection of the Multipurpose Area Jasen was already in the period from 1958−1960 declared to be a reserve. The declaration had as goal the protection of the fauna, floral, biological, geological, natural and hydrological rarities.

'''Kanchira''' is the biggest and densely populated [[village]] of Saptary [[District]] of [[Nepal]]. This village lies in the Banarjhula village Development [[Community]]. This village has one [[high school]], two [[Primary school|primary schools]], one [[madrasah]] (an [[Islam]]ic primary education school), one health post, one [[postal office]] and one women's and disabled children's training center which is run by the Environmental Development Forum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edfnepal.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental Development Forum==
The Everest Development Forum (EDF) is also called Sagarmatha Bikash Manch. This organisation started a buffalo program. 55 farmers are involved in this program. The program gives buffalo to farmers who are economically very weak, without taking any kind of deposits. The program is supported by Namaste e.V, Kiel, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namaste-project.de www.namaste-project.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pico Duarte.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Pico Duarte]] is the highest point in the [[Dominican Republic]], the [[Island of Hispaniola]], and the entire [[Caribbean]].]]

This article comprises four sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain summits]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Caribbean]] that are the [[Elevation|higher]] than any other point [[#Northernmost high summits|north]] or [[#Southernmost high summits|south]] of their [[latitude]] or [[#Easternmost high summits|east]] or [[#Westernmost high summits|west]] their [[longitude]] in the region.

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in Alaska is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in Nicaragua, {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3534">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Saint Pierre and Miquelon'''. There are 2 mammal species in [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], both of which are dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt; There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to either species.

==Subclass: [[Theria]]==

===Infraclass: [[Eutheria]]===

====Order: [[Cetacea]] (whales)====
----
[[Image:Rundkopfdelfin.jpg|thumb|[[Risso's dolphin]]]]

'''Madagascar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|æ|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|æ|s|k|ər}}; {{lang-mg|Madagasikara}}), officially the '''Republic of Madagascar''' ({{lang-mg|Repoblikan'i Madagasikara|links=no}} {{IPA-mg|republiˈkʲan madaɡasˈkʲarə̥}}; {{lang-fr|République de Madagascar}}), and previously known as the [[Malagasy Republic]], is an [[island country]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the coast of [[East Africa]]. The nation comprises the island of [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]] (the fourth-[[List of islands by area|largest island]] in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the [[prehistoric]] breakup of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], Madagascar split from the [[Indian peninsula]] around 88&amp;nbsp;million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a [[biodiversity hotspot]]; over 90% of [[wildlife of Madagascar|its wildlife]] is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

The first [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence for human foraging on Madagascar may have occurred as much as 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For Thousands of Years, Humans Coexisted with the Largest Birds That Ever Lived|url=https://www.livescience.com/63568-humans-killed-elephant-birds-madagascar.html|date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350&amp;nbsp;BC and AD&amp;nbsp;550 by [[Austronesian peoples]], arriving on [[outrigger canoe]]s from [[Borneo]]. These were joined around AD 1000 by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrants crossing the [[Mozambique Channel]] from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy ethnic group]] is often divided into 18 or more [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|subgroups]] of which the largest are the [[Merina people|Merina]] of the central highlands.

Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the [[Merina Kingdom|Kingdom of Madagascar]] by a [[List of Malagasy monarchs|series]] of Merina [[andriana|nobles]]. The monarchy ended in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the [[French colonial empire]], from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at [[Antananarivo]]. However, in a [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|popular uprising in 2009]], president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to [[Andry Rajoelina]]. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when [[Hery Rajaonarimampianina]] was named president following a [[Malagasy general election, 2013|2013 election]] deemed fair and transparent by the international community. Madagascar is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]] (AU), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), and the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]].

Madagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries, according to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/|title=About LDCs |publisher=UN-OHRLLS|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and [[French language|French]] are both [[official language]]s of the state. The majority of the population adheres to [[Malagasy mythology|traditional beliefs]], [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]], or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. {{As of|2017}}, the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population.

==Etymology==
In the [[Malagasy language]], the island of Madagascar is called ''Madagasikara'' {{IPA-mg|madaɡasʲˈkʲarə̥}} and its people are referred to as ''[[Malagasy people|Malagasy]]''.&lt;ref name=NatGeo1&gt;{{cite web |last = National Geographic |title = Style Manual |url=http://stylemanual.ngs.org/home/M/madagascan-malagasy |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6053JX6vh  |archivedate = 31 August 2012 |accessdate =31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's appellation "Madagascar" is not of local origin, but rather was popularized in the [[Middle Ages]] by Europeans.&lt;ref name=Cousins&gt;Cousins (1895), pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Madageiscar'' was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer [[Marco Polo]] as a corrupted [[transliteration]] of the name [[Mogadishu]], the [[Somalia|Somali]] port with which Polo had confused the island.&lt;ref name="Room 2006, p. 230"&gt;Room (2006), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Laurence]]'s Day in 1500, Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Dias]] landed on the island and named it ''São Lourenço''. Polo's name was preferred and popularized on [[Renaissance]] maps. No single Malagasy-language name predating ''Madagasikara'' appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.&lt;ref name="Room 2006, p. 230"/&gt;

[[File:Formation of Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Madagascar separated from the landmass that would become modern India during the late Cretaceous period]]

The prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] separated the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88&amp;nbsp;million years ago during the late [[cretaceous period]] allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = University of Berkeley: Understanding Evolution |title = Where did all of Madagascar's species come from? |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/091001_madagascar |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5xIlRolGu|archivedate = 19 March 2011|date = October 2009 |accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep [[escarpment]] containing much of the island's remaining tropical [[Madagascar lowland forests|lowland forest]].

To the west of this ridge lies a [[plateau]] in the center of the island ranging in altitude from {{convert|750|to|1500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} above sea level. These [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|central highlands]], traditionally the homeland of the [[Merina people]] and the location of their historic capital at [[Antananarivo]], are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced, rice-growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the [[Madagascar subhumid forests|subhumid forests]] that formerly covered the highland region. To the west of the highlands, the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the [[Mozambique Channel]] and [[Madagascar mangroves|mangrove swamps]] along the coast.&lt;ref name=endemicstats&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vences M, Wollenberg KC, Vieites DR, Lees DC |title = Madagascar as a model region of species diversification |journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume = 24 |issue = 8 |pages = 456–465 |date = June 2009 |doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.011 |url = http://www.mvences.de/p/p1/Vences_A163.pdf |accessdate=11 February 2012 |archivedate = 11 February 2012 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/65N9YtmnD |pmid = 19500874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the east, the ''[[Canal des Pangalanes]]'' is a chain of man-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the French just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some {{convert|600|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=EBLand/&gt;

The western and southern sides, which lie in the [[rain shadow]] of the central highlands, are home to [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|dry deciduous forests]], [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny forests]], and [[deserts and xeric shrublands]]. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting is a major problem caused by [[sediment]] from the high levels of inland [[erosion]] carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.&lt;ref name=EBLand&gt;{{cite web |last = Encyclopædia Britannica|title = Madagascar |work = Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher = Eb.com |year = 2011 |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/355562/Madagascar |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/64fD1P7X2 |archivedate = 25 August 2011 |accessdate =25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Geography of Madagascar#Climate}}

The combination of southeastern [[trade winds]] and northwestern [[monsoons]] produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive [[cyclone]]s, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's [[rainforest]] ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a [[semi-arid climate]] prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.&lt;ref name=endemicstats/&gt;

Endemic fish of Madagascar include two families, 15 genera and over 100 species, primarily inhabiting the island's freshwater lakes and rivers. Although invertebrates remain poorly studied on Madagascar, researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species. All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic, as are a majority of the island's butterflies, [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]], [[lacewing]]s, spiders and dragonflies.&lt;ref name=CIHotSpot/&gt;

Invasive species have likewise been introduced by human populations.

Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350&amp;nbsp;BC and 550&amp;nbsp;AD, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250&amp;nbsp;AD.

Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal [[rainforest]]s for cultivation.

===Arab and European contacts===
[[File:Pirates Cemetery Ile Ste Marie Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|A pirate cemetery at [[Île Sainte-Marie]]]]
Madagascar was an important transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the Indian Ocean in the early centuries following human settlement. The [[recorded history|written history]] of Madagascar began with the Arabs, who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced [[Islam]], the [[Arabic script]] (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as ''[[sorabe]]''), Arab astrology, and other cultural elements.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; European contact began in 1500, when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sea captain [[Diogo Dias]] sighted the island.&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt; The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade|trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. The small island of [[Île Sainte-Marie|Nosy Boroha]] off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of [[Libertalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver (1886), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them [[Robert Drury (sailor)|Robert Drury]], whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1976), pp.&amp;nbsp;65–71&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/madg_1/hd_madg_1.htm |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604iN3JCP |archivedate = 10 July 2011 |title=Kingdoms of Madagascar: Maroserana and Merina |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] alliance of the eastern coast and the [[Sakalava]] chiefdoms of [[Menabe]] and [[Boina Kingdom|Boina]] on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the [[Rova of Antananarivo|royal palace]] of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.&lt;ref name="Ogot"&gt;Ogot (1992), p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of Madagascar===
{{Main|Merina Kingdom}}
[[File:Andrianampoinimerina.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787–1810)]]
Upon its emergence in the early 17th century, the highland kingdom of Imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms&lt;ref name="Ogot"/&gt; and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when King [[Andriamasinavalona]] divided it among his four sons. Following almost a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787–1810).&lt;ref name="Hodder"&gt;Hodder (1982), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; From his initial capital [[Ambohimanga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/950 |title=Royal Hill of Ambohimanga |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=30 April 2011|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604iRR1dZ|archivedate = 10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later from the [[Rova of Antananarivo]], this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King [[Radama I]] (1810–28), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of [[Mauritius]] to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the [[London Missionary Society]] began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as [[James Cameron (missionary)|James Cameron]], [[David Jones (missionary)|David Jones]] and [[David Griffiths (missionary)|David Griffiths]], who established schools, transcribed the [[Malagasy language]] using the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]], translated the Bible, and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island.&lt;ref name="Ade Ajayi 1998, pp. 413–422"&gt;Ade Ajayi (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;413–422&lt;/ref&gt;

Radama's successor, Queen [[Ranavalona I]] (1828–61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of [[Christianity in Madagascar]] and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. She made heavy use of the traditional practice of ''[[Corvée|fanompoana]]'' (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 [[Merina]] soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the Kingdom of Merina to encompass most of Madagascar. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of ''[[tangena]]'' was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the ''tangena'' ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Stats"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Campbell | first = Gwyn | date = October 1991 | title = The state and pre-colonial demographic history: the case of nineteenth century Madagascar | journal = Journal of African History | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Campbell |first = Gwyn |date = October 1991 |title = The state and pre-colonial demographic history: the case of nineteenth century Madagascar |journal = Journal of African History |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |pages = 415–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were [[Jean Laborde]], an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and [[Joseph-François Lambert]], a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince [[Radama II]] signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II (1861–63) attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies, but was [[Radama II#Assassination plot|overthrown]] two years later by Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]] (1852–1865) and an alliance of ''[[Andriana]]'' (noble) and ''[[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]]'' (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen [[Rasoherina]] (1863–68) the opportunity to rule, if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister—a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver (1886), pp. 124–126&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Rasoherina accepted, first wedding Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and wedding his brother, Prime Minister [[Rainilaiarivony]] (1864–95), who would go on to marry Queen [[Ranavalona II]] (1868–83) and Queen [[Ranavalona III]] (1883–97) in succession.&lt;ref&gt;Uwechue (1981), p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government.&lt;ref name=TA910/&gt; Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved, and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers.&lt;ref name=FFO522&gt;Fage, Flint &amp; Oliver (1986), pp. 522–524&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polygamy]] was outlawed and Christianity, declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace.&lt;ref name=TA910&gt;Thompson &amp; Adloff (1965), pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British [[common law]] and three European-style courts were established in the capital city.&lt;ref name=FFO522/&gt; In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.&lt;ref name=FFO522/&gt;

===French colonization===

[[File:Colonie de Madagascar 1897.jpg|thumb|Bond of the French colony Madagascar, issued 7. May 1897]]
Primarily on the basis that the Lambert Charter had not been respected, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first [[Franco-Hova War]].&lt;ref name="Boogaerde p7"&gt;Van Den Boogaerde (2008), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, Madagascar ceded the northern port town of [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) to France and paid 560,000 francs to Lambert's heirs.&lt;ref name="Randier p400"&gt;Randier (2006), p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the British accepted the full formal imposition of a French [[protectorate]] on the island, but French authority was not acknowledged by the government of Madagascar. To force capitulation, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of [[Toamasina]] on the east coast, and [[Mahajanga]] on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.&lt;ref name=Disease&gt;Curtin (1998), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

A French military [[flying column]] then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from [[Algeria]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Upon reaching the city in September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Fage &amp; Sanderson (1985), p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on [[Réunion|Réunion Island]] and to Algeria. A two-year [[Menalamba rebellion|resistance movement]] organized in response to the French capture of the royal palace was effectively put down at the end of 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Fage &amp; Sanderson (1985), p. 532&lt;/ref&gt;

Under colonial rule, plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2005), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery]] was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 878&lt;/ref&gt; or as sharecroppers; in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today.&lt;ref&gt;Regnier (2015), pp. 152–154&lt;/ref&gt; Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo&lt;ref&gt;Fournet-Guérin (2007), pp. 45–54&lt;/ref&gt; and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum.&lt;ref name="Frémigacci"&gt;Frémigacci (1999), pp. 421–444&lt;/ref&gt; Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on French language and practical skills.&lt;ref&gt;Gallieni (1908), pp. 341–343&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merina royal tradition of [[Corvée|taxes paid in the form of labor]] was continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo.&lt;ref&gt;Reinsch (1905), p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; Malagasy troops fought for France in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt; In the 1930s, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] political thinkers developed the [[Madagascar Plan]] that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe's Jews.&lt;ref name="contemplation"&gt;Browning (2004), pp. 81–89&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]], the island was the site of the [[Battle of Madagascar]] between the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] and the British.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2007), pp. 511–512&lt;/ref&gt;

The occupation of France during the Second World War tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the [[Malagasy Uprising]] of 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Lehoullier (2010), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the ''[[Loi Cadre]]'' (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence.&lt;ref name="Kitchen 1962, p. 256"&gt;Kitchen (1962), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Malagasy Republic]] was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] state within the [[French Community]]. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1990), pp. 209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent state===

Since regaining independence, Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The [[Malagasy Republic|First Republic]] (1960–72), under the leadership of French-appointed President [[Philibert Tsiranana]], was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this "neo-colonial" arrangement inspired a [[rotaka|series of farmer and student protests]] that overturned his administration in 1972.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

[[Gabriel Ramanantsoa]], a major general in the army, was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel [[Richard Ratsimandrava]], appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General [[Gilles Andriamahazo]] ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral [[Didier Ratsiraka]], who ushered in the socialist-Marxist [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Second Republic]] that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.

This period saw a political alignment with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, [[World Bank]] and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.&lt;ref name=ISS/&gt;

Ratsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of [[Albert Zafy]] (1993–96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the [[Third Republic of Madagascar|Third Republic]] (1992–2010).&lt;ref name="crisisgroup"/&gt; The new [[constitution of Madagascar|Madagascar constitution]] established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, [[Norbert Ratsirahonana]], was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.&lt;ref name=ISS&gt;{{cite journal |last = Marcus |first = Richard |title = Political change in Madagascar: populist democracy or neopatrimonialism by another name? |issue = Occasional Paper no. 89 |publisher = Institute for Security Studies |date = August 2004 |url = http://www.issafrica.org/publications/papers/political-change-in-madagascar-populist-democracy-or-neopatrimonialism-by-another-name |accessdate =15 February 2012 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040907223329/http://www.iss.org.za/pubs/papers/89/Paper89.htm |archivedate = 7 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contested [[Malagasy presidential election, 2001|2001 presidential elections]] in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7&amp;nbsp;percent per year under his administration. In the later half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.&lt;ref name=ISS/&gt;

Opposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led a [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|movement in early 2009]] in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a ''coup d'état''. In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the [[High Transitional Authority]], an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2010|adopted by referendum]], establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution.&lt;ref name="crisisgroup"/&gt; [[Hery Rajaonarimampianina]] was declared the winner of the [[Malagasy general election, 2013|2013 presidential election]], which the international community deemed fair and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/newsFr/storyF.asp?NewsID=31715&amp;Cr=Madagascar&amp;Cr1=#.UrVg67Sp6RM |title=Centre d'actualités de l'ONU – Madagascar : l'ONU salue le bon déroulement du deuxième tour des élections présidentielles |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=10 February 2014|date=2013-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
===Structure===
{{Main|Government of Madagascar}}
[[File:Antananarivo06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Antananarivo]] is the political and economic capital of Madagascar.]]
Madagascar is a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Diversity (politics)|multi-party]] republic, wherein the popularly elected president is the head of state and selects a [[Prime Minister of Madagascar|prime minister]], who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the [[Constitution of Madagascar|constitution]], executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet, the [[Senate of Madagascar|Senate]] and the [[National Assembly of Madagascar|National Assembly]], although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt;

The public directly elects the president and the 127 members of the National Assembly to five-year terms. All 33 members of the Senate serve six-year terms, with 22 senators elected by local officials and 11 appointed by the president.

At the local level, the island's 22 provinces are administered by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further subdivided into regions and communes. The judiciary is modeled on the French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance.&lt;ref name=justiceMada&gt;Nalla (2010), pp. 122–128&lt;/ref&gt; The courts, which adhere to [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in the judicial system, often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.&lt;ref name=mediainfo/&gt;

Antananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of Madagascar.&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt; It is located in the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Analamanga|Analamanga]].&lt;ref name=vazimbadjp/&gt; As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/madagascar-population/cities/|title=Population of Cities in Madagascar (2017)|website=worldpopulationreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next largest cities are [[Antsirabe]] (500,000), [[Toamasina]] (450,000) and [[Mahajanga]] (400,000).&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt;

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Madagascar|Foreign relations of Madagascar|Human rights in Madagascar}}
Since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with detrimental effects on the local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=47721 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604iepG98 |archivedate = 10 July 2011|title=MADAGASCAR: Former president sentenced to five years in prison |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= 17 December 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2009 Malagasy protests|A series of protests]] led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83838 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604j587uf |archivedate = 10 July 2011 |title=Madagascar: Appeal launched despite political uncertainty |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= 7 April 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century.

Madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being a founding member of the [[Organisation of African Unity]], which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the [[African Union]]. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|unconstitutional transfer of executive power]] to Rajoelina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Pressure grows on Madagascar coup |publisher=BBC News |date = 20 March 2009 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7954356.stm |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604XDz2yB |archivedate = 10 July 2011 |accessdate =30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madagascar is a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States military]].&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt; Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Numéros utiles |publisher=AirMadagascar.com |date=28 January 2012 |url=http://www.airmadagascar.com/contact/numeros-utiles |accessdate=28 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/651QcKNqa |archivedate=28 January 2012 |language=fr |deadurl=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Madagascar has [[List of diplomatic missions of Madagascar|embassies in sixteen other countries]].

Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.&lt;ref name=CrossroadsMarcus/&gt;

===Security===
{{Main|Military of Madagascar}}
The rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava, Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island's first standing armies by the 16th century, initially equipped with spears but later with muskets, cannons and other firearms.&lt;ref&gt;Barendse (2002), pp. 259–274&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000.&lt;ref name="army"&gt;Freeman &amp; Johns (1840), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; French attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the Merina monarchy's army. Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers, the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo. Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Chapus &amp; Mondain (1953), p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The political independence and sovereignty of the Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Military Balance 2010 |publisher = [[International Institute of Strategic Studies]] |pages = 314–315, 467 |url = http://moorishwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/2010_report.pdf |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5xceWrXPC |archivedate = 1 April 2011 |accessdate =1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp (2002), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strakes (2006), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The armed forces are under the direction of the Minister of the Interior&lt;ref name=justiceMada/&gt; and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.&lt;ref name=CrossroadsMarcus/&gt;

The Minister of the Interior is responsible for the national police force, paramilitary force (''gendarmerie'') and the secret police.&lt;ref name=justiceMada/&gt; The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps.&lt;ref name=INSTAT/&gt; Traditional community tribunals, called ''dina'', are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island.&lt;ref name=CrossroadsMarcus/&gt; Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing.&lt;ref name=justiceMada/&gt; Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.&lt;ref name=CrossroadsMarcus/&gt;

===Administrative divisions===

===Largest cities and towns===
Madagascar Agriculture-dominated economy has long influenced settlement on the island. Thus there are crowded cities in the country especially Antananarivo, the capital, only 15% of the nation's 24,894,551 population live in the 10 largest cities and towns which start at the top with Antananarivo and end with Amparafaravola at the bottom. The biggest cities and towns and their population are: Antananarivo, the capital (1,299,080), Toamasina, the country's principal seaport (274,667), Antsirabe (238,478), Mahajanga (220,629), Fianarantsoa (190,318), Toliara (156,710), Antsiranana (115,015), Ambovombe (111,700), Antanifotsy (70,626), and Amparafaravola (47,000).

=== United Nations involvement ===
Madagascar became a Member State of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its independence on 26 June 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/org1469.doc.htm|title=United Nations Member States {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti as part of the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/contributors/2017/jan17_5.pdf|title=UN Mission's Contributions by Country|last=United Nations |date=31 January 2017|website= www.un.org |access-date= 27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.wfp.org/operations/200733-madagascar-country-programme-2015-2019|title=Madagascar Country Programme (2015–2019) {{!}} World Food Programme|website=www1.wfp.org|language=en|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both the quantity and quality of their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily influenced Madagascar's economic planning and policy and served as its key trading partner. Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75&amp;nbsp;percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50&amp;nbsp;percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.&lt;ref name=EBLand/&gt;

The IMF forced Madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration. Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the [[Millennium Challenge Account]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt;

Madagascar's GDP in 2015 was estimated at 9.98 billion USD, with a per capita GDP of $411.82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:MDG:MUS:MOZ&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en|title=World Bank|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:MDG:MUS:MOZ&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:MDG:MUS:MOZ&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=World Development Indicators – Google Public Data Explorer|website=www.google.com|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 69&amp;nbsp;percent of the population lives below the national poverty line threshold of one dollar per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Madagascar at a glance |publisher = World Bank |date = 25 February 2011 |url =  http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/mdg_aag.pdf |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/65E3A2dF3 |archivedate = 4 February 2012 |accessdate =4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last five years, the average growth rate has been 2.6% but is expected to have reached 4.1% in 2016, due to public works programs and a growth of the service sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/madagascar/overview|title=Madagascar Overview|website=www.worldbank.org|language=en|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agriculture sector constituted 29&amp;nbsp;percent of Malagasy GDP in 2011, while manufacturing formed 15&amp;nbsp;percent of GDP.

===Infrastructure and media===
{{Main|Transport in Madagascar|Telecommunications in Madagascar|List of newspapers in Madagascar}}
[[File:Antananarivo Madagascar people reading news.JPG|thumb|A news stand in Antananarivo]]
In 2010, Madagascar had approximately {{convert|7,617|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of paved roads, {{convert|854|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of railways and {{convert|432|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of navigable waterways.&lt;ref name="Bradtp2"/&gt; The majority of roads in Madagascar are unpaved, with many becoming impassable in the rainy season. Largely paved national routes connect the six largest regional towns to Antananarivo, with minor paved and unpaved routes providing access to other population centers in each district.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

There are several rail lines. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used due to their remoteness.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.&lt;ref name = RioTinto/&gt; Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

Running water and electricity are supplied at the national level by a government service provider, [[Jirama]], which is unable to service the entire population. {{As of|2009}}, only 6.8&amp;nbsp;percent of Madagascar's ''fokontany'' had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5&amp;nbsp;percent had access to its electricity services.&lt;ref name=INSTAT/&gt; 56% of Madagascar's power is provided by hydroelectric power plants with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Production Electricité |publisher = Jirama |year = 2011  |url =http://www.jirama.mg/index.php?w=scripts&amp;f=Jirama-page.php&amp;act=pdcelec |accessdate = 28 August 2013 |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30&amp;nbsp;percent of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.&lt;ref name=INSTAT/&gt;

Radio broadcasts remain the principal means by which the Malagasy population access international, national and local news. Only state radio broadcasts are transmitted across the entire island. Hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting.&lt;ref name=mediainfo/&gt; In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar.

[[File:Madagascar woman with child.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Maternal mortality declined after 1990 but rose sharply after 2009 due to political instability.&lt;ref name=INSTAT/&gt;]]
Medical centers, dispensaries and hospitals are found throughout the island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Legrip-Randriambelo|first1=Olivia|last2=Regnier|first2=Denis|title=The place of healers-diviners (ombiasa) in Betsileo medical pluralism|journal=Health, Culture &amp; Society|volume=7|issue=1|pages=28–37|url=http://hcs.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/hcs/article/viewFile/188/219|doi=10.5195/hcs.2014.188|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000&amp;nbsp;people and a total of 3,150&amp;nbsp;doctors, 5,661&amp;nbsp;nurses, 385&amp;nbsp;community health workers, 175&amp;nbsp;pharmacists and 57&amp;nbsp;dentists for a population of 22&amp;nbsp;million. 14.6&amp;nbsp;percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70&amp;nbsp;percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30&amp;nbsp;percent originated with international donors and other private sources.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.&lt;ref name=INSTAT/&gt;

Despite these barriers to access, health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years. Child immunizations against such diseases as [[hepatitis B]], [[diphtheria]] and [[measles]] increased an average of 60&amp;nbsp;percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6&amp;nbsp;children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8&amp;nbsp;percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth.&lt;ref name=WHO2011&gt;{{cite book | title = World Health Statistics 2011 | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 2011 | location = Paris | url = http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/resources/docs/main_report/en_SOWMR_Full.pdf | isbn = 978-92-4-156419-9 | accessdate =21 January 2012| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/64qsWUjYm | archivedate = 21 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Madagascar}}
[[File:Diego Suarez Antsiranana urban public primary school (EPP) Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Students working in groups in classroom as teacher observes|[[Education in Madagascar|Education]] access and quality were prioritized under [[Marc Ravalomanana|Ravalomanana]].]]
Prior to the 19th century, all education in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills as well as social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at [[Toamasina]] by members of the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I (1810–28) to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835&lt;ref name="Ralibera"&gt;Ralibera (1993), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.

By the end of the 19th century Madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; Consequently, under the socialist Second Republic, French instructors and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared the language of instruction and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Ranaivoson |first = Samuel|title = La formation du personnel enseignant de l'éducation de base à Madagascar: Une etude de cas.

This policy, known as ''malgachization'', coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Mukonoweshuro |first = E.G. |title = State "resilience" and chronic political instability in Madagascar |journal = Canadian Journal of African Studies |volume = 24 |issue = 3 |pages = 376–398 |year = 1990 |doi = 10.2307/485627|jstor = 485627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary school fees were eliminated and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students.&lt;ref name=WBeducation/&gt;

Government school construction initiatives have ensured at least one primary school per ''fokontany'' and one lower secondary school within each commune. At least one upper secondary school is located in each of the larger urban centers.&lt;ref name=INSTAT/&gt; The three branches of the national public university are located at Antananarivo (founded in 1961), Mahajanga (1977) and Fianarantsoa (1988). These are complemented by public teacher-training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

As a result of increased educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education quality is weak, producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout.&lt;ref name=WBeducation/&gt; Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Ministère de l'Education Secondaire et l'Education de Base |title = Curriculum de formation des élèves-maîtres |publisher = Government Printing Office |location = Antananarivo, Madagascar |year = 2005 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public expenditure on education was 13.4&amp;nbsp;percent of total government expenditure and 2.9&amp;nbsp;percent of GDP in 2008.

[[Chinese people in Madagascar|Chinese]], [[Indians in Madagascar|Indian]] and [[Comoros|Comorian]] minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily [[French people|French]]) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of [[Comoros|Comorans]] in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples.&lt;ref name=EBLand/&gt; The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958&lt;ref name="Kitchen 1962, p. 256"/&gt; to 17,000 three decades later.

===Languages===
[[File:Madagascar Kids 5 (4814978342).jpg|thumb|A Malagasy child]]
{{Main|Malagasy language|Languages of Madagascar}}
The Malagasy language is of [[Malayo-Polynesian]] origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible,&lt;ref&gt;Rajaonarimanana (2001), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; can be clustered under one of two subgroups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a [[francophone]] country, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

No official languages were recorded in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/mg/cases/MGHCC/2000/1.html |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604mI1Vre |archivedate = 10 July 2011 |title=Haute Cour Constitutionnelle De Madagascar, Décision n°03-HCC/D2 Du 12 avril 2000 |publisher=Saflii.org |date=12 April 2000 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language Policy

Over the years, Madagascar has had different language policies under different influences of authority. The indigenous language of Madagascar, Malagasy, was the predominant language on the island until the French colonization in 1897. Malagasy has developed throughout the decades from an oral language to a language that has a written system (Latin orthography), a change that was enforced by King Radama I, in 1823.
Following the French colonization, the language of instruction and media changed from Malagasy to almost exclusively French. Moreover, the first French governor-general, Gallieni, also encouraged the French officials to learn Malagasy as well. After the advent of the Malagasy independence, the Madagascans tried to reinstate Malagasy as a language of instruction especially in secondary schools. However, the language policy was inadequately planned and Malagasy was struggling to surpass French as the language of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAShwSYLbUYC&amp;pg=PP2|title=The Austronesian Languages of Asia and Madagascar|first1=K.

Today, Madagascar has two official languages: Malagasy and French. Madagascar managed to maintain the indigenous language, Malagasy, in society and in schools despite the colonizing power. Malagasy and French are both the language of instruction in primary and secondary schools in Madagascar. The inclusion of the African language as a medium of instruction is usually uncommon in other colonized African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/languages_2004/languageinstruction_africa.pdf |title=Preliminary Information and Comments |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the US Department of State in 2011, 41% of Madagascans practiced Christianity and 52% adhered to traditional religions,&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt; which tends to emphasize links between the living and the ''razana'' (ancestors). But according to the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2010, 85% of the population practiced [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]], while just 4.5% of Madagascans practiced folk religions; among Christians, practitioners of Protestantism outnumbered adherents of [[Roman Catholicism in Madagascar|Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;

The [[Veneration of the dead|veneration of ancestors]] has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the ''[[famadihana]]'', whereby a deceased family member's remains are exhumed and re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds, before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a [[hiragasy]] troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.&lt;ref name=famadihana&gt;{{cite news |last = Bearak |first = Barry |title = Dead Join the Living in a Family Celebration |newspaper = New York Times |page = A7 |date = 5 September 2010 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/world/africa/06madagascar.html|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/64fFKK5JL |archivedate = 13 January 2012 |accessdate =13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'', taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra.&lt;ref name=Bradtbeliefs&gt;Bradt (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1818, the [[London Missionary Society]] sent the first Christian missionaries to the island, where they built churches, translated the Bible into the Malagasy language and began to gain converts. Beginning in 1835, Queen [[Ranavalona I]] persecuted these converts as part of an attempt to halt European cultural and political influence on the island. In 1869, a successor, Queen [[Ranavalona II]], converted the court to Christianity and encouraged Christian missionary activity, burning the ''[[sampy]]'' (royal idols) in a symbolic break with traditional beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Ade Ajayi (1989), p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, many Christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a [[minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]] to consecrate a ''famadihana'' reburial.&lt;ref name=famadihana/&gt; The Malagasy Council of Churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent Christian denominations of Madagascar (Roman Catholic, [[Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar]], [[Malagasy Lutheran Church|Lutheran]], and [[Anglican]]) and has been an influential force in Malagasy politics.&lt;ref name=USSD&gt;{{cite web |last = Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |title = International Religious Freedom Report: Madagascar |publisher = U.S. Department of State |year = 2006 |url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71310.htm |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/64rJD9LRN |archivedate = 22 January 2012 |accessdate =22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] is also practiced on the island. Islam was first brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Muslim]] traders, who established several Islamic schools along the eastern coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed to take hold in all but a handful of southeastern coastal communities. Today, [[Islam in Madagascar|Muslims]] constitute 3–7&amp;nbsp;percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of [[Mahajanga]] and [[Antsiranana]]. The vast majority of [[Muslim]]s are [[Sunni]]. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, [[Demographics of India|Indians]], [[Demography of Pakistan|Pakistanis]] and [[Comoros|Comorians]]. More recently, [[Hinduism]] was introduced to Madagascar through [[Gujarati people]] immigrating from the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region of [[India]] in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] or [[Hindi]] at home.&lt;ref name="id"&gt;{{cite web |title = Report of the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora |publisher = Ministry of External Affairs, India |year = 2004 |url = http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf  |accessdate =22 January 2012 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AJxU0geu |archivedate = 31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Madagascar}}
Each of the many ethnic subgroups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize ''fihavanana'' (solidarity), ''vintana'' (destiny), ''tody'' (karma), and ''[[Hasina (Madagascar)|hasina]]'', a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradtbeliefs/&gt;

Although social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity and roles within the community.&lt;ref&gt;Middleton (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;259–262, 272, 309&lt;/ref&gt; Malagasy people traditionally consult ''Mpanandro'' ("Makers of the Days") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or ''famadihana'', according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ''ombiasy'' (from ''olona-be-hasina'', "man of much virtue") of the southeastern [[Antemoro people|Antemoro]] ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Ames (2003), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the ''[[valiha]]'', is a [[bamboo]] tube [[zither]] carried to Madagascar by early settlers from [[South Kalimantan|southern Borneo]], and is very similar in form to those found in [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and the [[Music of the Philippines|Philippines]] today.&lt;ref name="Blench, R. 1982 pp. 81-93"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Blench |first = Roger |title = Evidence for the Indonesian origins of certain elements of African culture |journal = African Music |volume = 6 |issue = 2 |pages = 81–93 |year = 1982 |subscription=yes |jstor = 30249759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[Architecture of Madagascar|houses in Madagascar]] are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kus |first1 = Susan |last2 = Raharijaona |first2 = Victor |title = House to Palace, Village to State: Scaling up Architecture and Ideology |journal = American Anthropologist |series=New Series |issue = 102 |volume = 1 |pages = 98–113 |year = 2000 |doi = 10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis."&gt;Acquier (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;143–175&lt;/ref&gt; The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven ''[[lamba (garment)|lamba]]'', has evolved into a varied and refined art.&lt;ref&gt;Kusimba, Odland &amp; Bronson (2004), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in [[Malagasy cuisine]], in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.&lt;ref name="Antal"/&gt; African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. [[Cattle raiding|Cattle rustling]], originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.&lt;ref name=Camp93/&gt;

==Arts==
[[File:Hira gasy dancer Madagascar.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Hiragasy]] dancer.]]
A wide variety of oral and written [[Literature of Madagascar|literature]] has developed in Madagascar. One of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its [[hainteny|oratory]], as expressed in the forms of ''hainteny'' (poetry), ''kabary'' (public discourse) and ''ohabolana'' (proverbs).&lt;ref&gt;Fox (1990), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madatana"&gt;{{cite web |last = Ravalitera |first = P |title = Origine Confuse des Vazimba du Betsiriry |work = Journal Express |publisher = Madatana.com |url=http://www.madatana.com/article-origine-confuse-des-vazimba-du-betsiriry.php |archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/604hJwBma |accessdate =11 November 2010 |archivedate = 10 July 2011|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the ''[[Ibonia]]'', has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Ibonia: the text in 17 sections |last = Unknown |publisher = University of Virginia |accessdate =15 November 2010 |url = http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Public/Ibonia/text.html |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604h5KUmV |archivedate = 10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as [[Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo]], who is considered Africa's first modern poet,&lt;ref&gt;Rabearivelo (2007), p. x&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elie Rajaonarison]], an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Auzias &amp; Labourdette (2007), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Madagascar has also developed a rich [[Music of Madagascar|musical heritage]], embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal ''[[salegy]]'' or highland ''[[hiragasy]]'' that enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves.&lt;ref name="Randrianary"&gt;Randrianary (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;109–137&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Madagascar also has a growing culture of classical music fostered through youth academies, organizations and orchestras that promote youth involvement in classical music.

The plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island. In addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of [[Raffia palm|raffia]] and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats.&lt;ref name=handicrafts/&gt; Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, ''aloalo'' funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.&lt;ref name=Terrible&gt;Heale &amp; Abdul Latif (2008), pp.&amp;nbsp;108–111&lt;/ref&gt; The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the [[Zafimaniry]] people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|list of Intangible Cultural Heritage]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Woodcrafting Knowledge of the Zafimaniry |publisher = UNESCO |accessdate = 24 August 2012 |url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00080 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AA5SHVms |archivedate = 24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Antaimoro people, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.&lt;ref name=Terrible/&gt; [[Embroidery]] and [[drawn thread work]] are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.&lt;ref name=handicrafts/&gt; A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title = Des nouveaux talents mis en relief  |newspaper = L'Express de Madagascar |publisher = l'expressmada.com  |date = 7 August 2009  |url = http://www.lexpressmada.com/4376/hosotra-2009-madagascar/284-des-nouveaux-talents-mis-en-relief.html  |accessdate = 24 August 2012 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AACBykvX|archivedate = 24 August 2012|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport and recreation===
[[File:Moraingy fighting Madagascar sport.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|''[[Moraingy]]'' is a traditional martial art of Madagascar.]]
A number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar. ''[[Moraingy]]'', a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Ratsimbazafy (2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;14–18&lt;/ref&gt; The wrestling of [[zebu]] cattle, which is named [[savika]] or ''tolon-omby'', is also practiced in many regions.&lt;ref name=lambatradition&gt;Kusimba, Odland &amp; Bronson (2004), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is ''[[fanorona]]'', a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King [[Andrianjaka]] after his father [[Ralambo]] was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing ''fanorona'' to the detriment of his other responsibilities.&lt;ref name="iarivo"&gt;{{cite web |last=City of Antananarivo |title=Antananarivo: Histoire de la commune |url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZeOMH4e |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archivedate=17 February 2011|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Malagasy cuisine}}
Malagasy cuisine reflects the diverse influences of Southeast Asian, African, Indian, [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and European culinary traditions. The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs. Throughout almost the entire island, the contemporary cuisine of Madagascar typically consists of a base of rice (''vary'') served with an accompaniment (''laoka''). The many varieties of laoka may be [[vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] or include animal proteins, and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger, onion, garlic, tomato, vanilla, coconut milk, [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[curry powder]], green peppercorns or, less commonly, other spices or herbs. In parts of the arid south and west, [[pastoralism|pastoral]] families may replace rice with maize, [[cassava]], or [[curd]]s made from fermented zebu milk. A wide variety of sweet and savory [[fritter]]s as well as other street foods are available across the island, as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits. Locally produced beverages include fruit juices, coffee, [[herbal tea]]s and [[tea]]s, and alcoholic drinks such as [[rum]], wine, and beer.&lt;ref name=Antal&gt;Bradt (2011), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Three Horses Beer]] is the most popular beer on the island&lt;ref name = THBpilsner&gt;{{cite web  | title = THB Pilsener | url= http://www.brasseries-star.com/produits/bieres/thb-pilsener |publisher = Brasseries Star | year = 2015 | accessdate = 5 June 2015 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered emblematic of Madagascar.&lt;ref name =promos&gt;{{cite web | last = Marsaud | first = Olivia | title = THB, star de la bière à Madagascar | url=http://www.afrik.com/article10089.html  |publisher = Afrik.com | date = 12 July 2008 | accessdate = 5 June 2015 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island also produces some of the world's finest chocolate; [[Chocolaterie Robert]], established in 1940, is the most famous chocolate company on the island.&lt;ref name = prize&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Chocolaterie Robert | title = Un peu d'histoire | url= http://www.chocolaterierobert.com/un-peu-dhistoire/ | year = 2016 | accessdate = 26 February 2017 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martian regolith simulant''' (or '''Martian soil simulant''') is a terrestrial material that is used to simulate the chemical and mechanical properties of [[Martian regolith]] for research, experiments and [[prototype]] testing of activities related to Martian regolith such as dust mitigation of transportation equipment, advanced [[life support system]]s and [[in-situ resource utilization]].

==Variations==

===JSC Mars-1 and JSC Mars-1A===
After the [[Viking program|Viking landers]] and the [[Sojourner (rover)|Mars Pathfinder's rover]] landed on Mars, the onboard instruments were used to determine the properties of the [[Martian soil]] at the landing sites. The studies of the [[Martian soil]] properties led to the development of JSC Mars-1 Martian regolith simulant at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dielectric Properties of Martian Soil Simulant|url=http://empl.ksc.nasa.gov/Publications/Dielectric%20Properties%20of%20Martian%20Soil%20Simulant.pdf|publisher=NASA Kennedy Space Center|accessdate=10 May 2014|author=J.G.

The palagonitic tephra, which is [[Volcanic glass|glassy]] [[volcanic ash]] altered at low temperature, was mined from a quarry at the Pu'u Nene [[cinder cone]]. The studies of the cone, which is located between [[Mauna Loa]] and [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]], indicate that the tephra is a close spectral analog to the bright regions of Mars.&lt;ref name=jscmars1&gt;{{cite book|title=JSC Mars-1: Martian regolith simulant|date=March 1997|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Exploration XXVIII|author=Allen, C.

When the original supply of JSC Mars-1 ran out, there were needs for additional material. NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] contracted Orbital Technologies Corporation to supply 16 [[tonne|metric tons]] of lunar and Martian simulants. The company also made an additional eight tons of Martian simulant available for other interested parties to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JSC-1A Lunar and Martian Soil Simulants|url=http://www.spacefoundation.org/programs/space-certification/certified-products/space-educational-product/jsc-1a-lunar-and-martian|publisher=Planet LLC|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orbitecpr&gt;{{cite news|title=Get Hands-on with Another Planet: Martian Soil Simulant Now Available|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/10/prweb563991.htm|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Orbitec Press Release|date=26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, as of 2017 JSC Mars-1A is no longer available.

After milling to reduce its particle size, JSC Mars-1A can [[geopolymer]]ize in alkaline solutions forming a solid material. Tests show that the maximum [[Compressive strength|compressive]] and [[flexural strength]] of the 'martian' geopolymer is comparable to that of common clay bricks.&lt;ref name=Alexiadis2016/&gt;

Space Res. (2017) 59:490–495, {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===MMS===
MMS or Mojave Mars Simulant was developed in 2007 to address some issues with JSC Mars-1. While JSC Mars-1 did simulate the color of Martian regolith, it performed poorly in many qualities, including its [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] tendencies—it had undergone [[weathering]] that attracts water, making it more [[clay]]-like. MMS, however, was hygroscopically inert due to minimal weathering and the way it was crushed, which allowed it to better simulate that feature of Martian regolith, among others. MMS was found naturally as whole rocks in a volcanic formation near the town of [[Boron, California]], in the western [[Mojave desert]]. After crushing, [[basalt]] sands were processed and graded into particular sizes, MMS Coarse and MMS Fine. MMS Dust consists of smaller basalt particles matching the particle size distribution of [[Martian dust]]. A separate volcanic event created red-colored [[cinder]] which is mined and crushed to create MMS Cinder.&lt;ref name=mojave/&gt; As of 2017, MMS is no longer available outside of NASA centers.

===MGS-1===
MGS-1 or Mars Global Simulant was developed in 2018 as the first mineralogically accurate Martian regolith simulant&lt;ref name="mgs1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cannon |first1=Kevin |title=Mars global simulant MGS-1: A Rocknest-based open standard for basaltic martian regolith simulants |journal=Icarus |date=January 2019 |volume=317 |issue=1 |pages=470-478 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2018.08.019 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103518303038}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is based on the Rocknest soil in [[Gale (crater)|Gale crater]] on Mars that has been analyzed extensively by the [[Curiosity (rover)|NASA Curiosity rover]]. MGS-1 is produced by mixing pure minerals together in accurate proportions, then binding the minerals together and re-grinding to achieve an accurate particle size distribution. The simulant is available from the not-for-profit [https://sciences.ucf.edu/class/exolithlab/ Exolith Lab] at the [[University of Central Florida]]. MGS-1 does not include perchlorates, so cannot be used to test the effects of that aspect of the Martian regolith.&lt;ref name="mgs1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toxicmars"&gt;{{cite web |title=Toxic Mars: Astronauts Must Deal with Perchlorate on the Red Planet |url=https://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html |website=space.com |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martian regolith simulant - dust.JPG|thumb|Fine dusts of JSC MARS-1A inside a container&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Holly|title=SEEING RED: Mars exhibit coming to Brazosport Planetarium (091012 mars 3)|url=http://thefacts.com/news/article_a4087982-fb05-11e1-994a-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=image&amp;photo=|publisher=The Facts, Clute, TX|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Exposure to regolith simulants may pose some health risks due to the fine particles and the presence of crystalline silica. JSC Mars-1A has slight hazard on inhalation and eye contact which may cause irritation to eyes and [[respiratory tract]]. There has been research into the toxicity of the simulants to the body cells. JSC MARS-1 is considered to have dose-dependent [[cytotoxicity]]. Therefore, it is recommended for precautions to minimize fine dust exposure in large-scale engineering applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Latch|first=JN |author2=Hamilton RF, Jr |author3=Holian, A |author4=James, JT |author5=Lam, CW |title=Toxicity of lunar and Martian dust simulants to alveolar macrophages isolated from human volunteers.|journal=Inhalation toxicology |date=January 2008 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=157–65 |pmid=18236230 |doi=10.1080/08958370701821219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although percholorates were discovered on Mars in 2008 by the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]], it should be noted that none of the simulants include percholorates. This reduces the health risk posed by the simulants compared to actual [[Martian soil]].  Early simulants predated this discovery, but the latest simulant, MGS-1, still does not include them.&lt;ref name="mgs1"/&gt;.

==Structural use==
A study at [[University of California, San Diego|UCSD]] showed that Martian regolith could be formed by itself into very strong bricks, with application of pressure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170427091723.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monaco Cemetery''' (French: "Cimetière de Monaco") is the only [[cemetery]] in [[Monaco]].&lt;ref name=villecimetiere&gt;{{cite web|title=Le cimetière|url=http://www.mairie.mc/poles/pratique/cimetiere/le-cimetiere|website=Ville de Monaco|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The cemetery contained 2350 tombs until 2014, when 198 more were built.&lt;ref name=villecimetiere/&gt; It is open to the public from 8am to 7pm in the summer and from 8am to 6pm in the winter.&lt;ref name=villecimetiere/&gt;

Many sculptures in the cemetery were designed by [[Umberto Bassignani]].&lt;ref name="mairieumberto"&gt;{{cite web|title=La Mairie de Monaco rend hommage à Umberto Bassignani, sculpteur|url=http://www.mairie.mc/actualites/2017/5/la-mairie-de-monaco-rend-hommage-a-umberto-bassignani-sculpteur-02-05-2017|website=Mairie de Monaco|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, two computer screens at the entry gate enable visitors to locate specific tombs before they go in.&lt;ref name=desbornesmonacocimetiere/&gt;

On 27 August 2015 [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] dedicated a memorial [[stele]] in honour of foreign Jews who were taken from Monegasque hotels by the Nazis during the night of 27–28 August 1942.&lt;ref name=demandepardon20min&gt;{{cite news|last1=Floux|first1=Florence|title=Le prince Albert demande pardon pour l'arrestation de juifs à Monaco|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/monde/1674215-20150827-prince-albert-demande-pardon-arrestation-juifs-monaco|accessdate=December 26, 2015|work=20 Minutes|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NIMBY''' (an [[acronym]] for the phrase "'''Not In My Back&lt;!-- Do Not Remove This Space.--&gt;  &lt;!--It is correct, and otherwise would be NIMB, which would clearly be wrong--&gt;Yard'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/nimby |title= Cambridge Dictionaries Online - meaning of NIMBY |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Nimby |title= Oxford Dictionaries - definition of Nimby |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''Nimby''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/nimby |publisher= Macmillan Dictionary |title= Definition of Nimby |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a characterization of opposition by residents to a proposed development in their local area. It often carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them, and that they would tolerate or support it if it was built further away. The residents are often called '''Nimbys''', and their viewpoint is called '''Nimbyism'''.

Examples of projects likely to be opposed include any sort of [[housing development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/london-mayor-election/mayor-of-london/10984944/Boris-Johnson-Nimbies-pretend-to-care-about-architecture-to-block-developments.html |title= Boris Johnson: Nimbies pretend to care about architecture to block developments |author=Matthew Holehouse |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cycling infrastructure|bicycle]] and [[Pedestrian crossing|pedestrian]] [[Sidewalk|infrastructure]], [[skyscraper]]s, [[homeless shelters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://digitalissue.ocweekly.com/article/News/1800742/223650/article.html |title= Anywhere but here |date= 28 August 2015 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |author= Andrew Galvin |newspaper= OC Weekly |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160130210045/http://digitalissue.ocweekly.com/article/News/1800742/223650/article.html |archive-date= 30 January 2016 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[oil well]]s, [[chemical plant]]s, [[industrial park]]s, [[military base]]s, [[fracking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/04/fracking-resistance-southern-nimbys-minister |title= Fracking will meet resistance from southern nimbys, minister warns |author= Patrick Wintour |date= 4 August 2013 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wind turbines]], [[desalination plant]]s, [[Landfill|landfill sites]], [[Incineration|incinerators]], [[power plant]]s, [[Quarry|quarries]], [[prison]]s,&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web |url= http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nimby |title= Dictionary and Thesaurus - Merriam-Webster |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pub]]s, [[Strip club|adult entertainment clubs]], [[Music venue|concert venues]], [[Gun shop|firearms dealers]], [[Cell site|mobile phone masts]], [[Transmission Tower |electricity pylons]], [[abortion clinic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/24/what-north-dakota-and-mississippi-reveal-about-anti-choice-nimbyism-and-hypocrisy/ |title=What North Dakota and Mississippi Reveal About Anti-Choice NIMBYism and Hypocrisy |first=Amanda |last=Marcotte |work=RH Reality Check |date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orphanage|children's homes]], [[Nursing home care|nursing homes]], [[youth hostel]]s, [[Stadium|sports stadiums]], [[shopping mall]]s, [[retail park]]s, [[Rail transport|railways]], [[road]]s, [[airport]]s, [[Port|seaports]], [[Deep geological repository|nuclear waste repositories]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/business/businessspecial3/07nuke.html?_r=0 |title= Radioactive Nimby: No one wants nuclear waste |author= James Kanter |date=7 November 2007 |newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weapons of mass destruction|storage for weapons of mass destruction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13176440.Trident_removal_is_a_Nimby_position/ |title= Trident removal is a Nimby position |date=24 August 2014 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Herald |author=Mick Common |location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannabis dispensaries in the United States|cannabis dispensaries]], [[Cannabis shop|recreational cannabis shops]] and the accommodation of persons applying for asylum, refugees (e.g. of war) and displaced persons (e.g. Jews during/after [[the Holocaust]]).

The NIMBY concept may also be applied to people who advocate some proposal (e.g., budget cuts, tax increases, layoffs, immigration or energy conservation) but oppose implementing it in a way that might affect their lives or require any sacrifice on their part.

==Claimed rationale==
Developments likely to attract local objections include:

* Infrastructure development, such as new roads and [[motorway service areas]], [[light rail]] and [[rapid transit|metro]] lines, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, airports, [[power plant]]s, retail developments, sales of public assets, [[Electric power transmission|electrical transmission lines]], [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]], [[landfill]]s, [[sewage treatment|sewage outfalls]] and [[prison]]s;
* The extraction of mineral resources including ore, aggregates and hydrocarbons from [[mining|mines]], [[quarries]] and [[oil well]]s or [[gas well]]s, respectively;
* [[renewable energy]] generators, such as [[wind farm]]s and [[solar panel]]s;
* businesses trading in goods perceived as [[immoral]], such as [[pornographic film|adult video]], [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] [[liquor store|stores]], and [[medical cannabis|medical]] [[marijuana|cannabis]] [[dispensaries]];
* accommodations perceived as primarily benefitting disadvantaged people, such as [[subsidized housing]] for the [[poverty|financially disadvantaged]], [[supportive housing]] for the [[mental illness|mentally ill]], [[halfway house]]s for drug addicts and [[criminal]]s, and [[homeless shelter]]s for those with [[homeless|no fixed address]];
* services catering to certain stigmatised groups (for example, [[addiction|injection drug users]]), such as [[methadone clinic]]s, [[syringe exchange programme]]s, [[drug detoxification]] facilities, [[supervised injection site]]; 
* large-scale developments of all kinds, such as [[big-box store]]s and housing [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]s.

The claimed reasons against these developments vary, and some are given below.

* ''Increased traffic:''  More jobs, more housing or more stores correlates to increased traffic on local streets and greater demand for parking spots. Industrial facilities such as warehouses, factories, or [[landfill]]s often increase the volume of truck traffic.
* ''Harm to locally owned [[small business]]es:''  The development of a big box store may provide too much competition to a locally owned store; similarly, the construction of a new road may make the older road less travelled, leading to a loss of business for property owners. This can lead to excessive relocation costs, or to loss of respected local businesses.
* ''Loss of residential property value:''  Homes near an undesirable development may be less desirable for potential buyers. The lost revenue from property taxes may, or may not, be offset by increased revenue from the project.
* ''[[Environmental pollution]] of land, air, and water:''  Power plants, factories, chemical facilities, [[crematorium]]s, [[sewage treatment facilities]], airports, and similar projects may, or may be claimed to, contaminate the land, air, or water around them. Especially facilities assumed to smell might cause objections.
* ''[[Light pollution]]:''  Projects that operate at night, or that include security lighting (such as street lights in a parking lot), may be accused of causing light pollution.
* ''[[Noise pollution]]:''  In addition to the noise of traffic, a project may inherently be noisy. This is a common objection to [[Windmill syndrome|wind power]], [[Mitigation of aviation's environmental impact#Methods of mitigating aviation's noise emissions|airports]], roads, and many industrial facilities, but also stadiums, [[music festival|festivals]], and [[nightclub]]s which are particularly noisy at night when locals want to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_nightclub-music-needs-restricting-to-reduce-noise-pollution-say-environmentalists_215054.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518102034/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_nightclub-music-needs-restricting-to-reduce-noise-pollution-say-environmentalists_215054.html |archivedate=18 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Visual blight and failure to "blend in" with the surrounding architecture:''  The proposed project might be ugly or particularly large, or cast a [[shadow]] over an area due to its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2014/2/20/10141252/hundreds-fret-about-superscrapers-shadows-as-extell-rebuts|title=Hundreds Fret About Superscrapers' Shadows As Extell Rebuts|first=|last=Curbed|date=20 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Loss of a community's [[new urbanism|small-town feel]]:'' Proposals that might result in new people moving into the community, such as a plan to build many new houses, are often claimed to change the community's character.
* ''Strain of public resources and schools:''  This reason is given for any increase in the local area's population, as additional school facilities might be needed for the additional children, but particularly to projects that might result in certain kinds of people joining the community, such as a [[group home]] for people with disabilities, or immigrants.
* ''Disproportionate benefit to non-locals:'' The project appears to benefit distant people, such as investors (in the case of commercial projects like factories or big-box stores) or people from neighboring areas (in the case of regional government projects, such as airports, highways, sewage treatment, or landfills).
* ''Increases in crime:'' This is usually applied to projects that are perceived as attracting or employing low-skill workers or racial minorities, as well as projects that cater to people who are thought to often commit crimes, such as the mentally ill, the poor, and drug addicts. Additionally, certain types of projects, such as [[Bar (establishment)|pubs]] or [[medical marijuana]] dispensaries, might be perceived as directly increasing the amount of crime in the area.
*''Risk of an (environmental) disaster'', such as with drilling operations, chemical industry, [[dams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esydBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=dam&amp;f=false|title=Nimby Is Beautiful: Cases of Local Activism and Environmental Innovation Around the World|first1=Carol|last1=Hager|first2=Mary Alice|last2=Haddad|date=30 March 2015|publisher=Berghahn Books|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; or nuclear power plants.
* ''Historic areas:'' The affected area is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], because of its many older properties that are being preserved as such.

Generally, many NIMBY objections are guessed or feared, because objections are more likely to be successful before the construction start. It is often too late to object to the project after its completion, since new additions are unlikely to be reversed.
As hinted by the list, protests can occur for opposite reasons. A new road or shopping center can cause increased traffic and work opportunities for some, and decreased traffic for others, harming local businesses.

People in an area affected by plans sometimes form an organization which can collect money and organize the objection activities. NIMBYists can hire a lawyer to do formal [[appeal]]s, and contact media to gain public support for their case.

==Origin and history==

The word appears in a June 1980 newspaper article from [[Virginia]], with the origin of the phrase explanained thus: {{quote|Some call it the Nimby Syndrome.  That's Nimby, as in "Not-in-my-back-yard"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Daily Press |location=Newport News, VA |date=1980-06-29 |issue=181 |volume=85 |page=1 |title=No One Wants Backyard Nuclear Dump |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24587650/nimby_1980/ |first=Ernie |last=Gates  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The phrase '"not in my back yard" syndrome', without the acronym, is found from February of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=The 'not in my back yard' syndrome is a compound of fears about health, safety, and environmental quality |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/enviroviews2n6/page/4 |title=Hazardous Wastes |first=Gillian |last=Sniatynski |work=Environment Views |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=February-March 1980  |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' earliest citation is a ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' article from November 1980, although even there the author indicates the term is already used in the hazardous waste industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/nimby.asp|title=NIMBY - Word Spy|first=Word|last=Spy|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/1106/110653.html|title=Hazardous waste|first=Emilie Travel|last=Livezey|date=6 November 1980|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept behind the term, that of locally organized resistance to unwanted land uses, is likely to have originated earlier. One suggestion is it emerged in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorino, Al. (22 March 2011)  [http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5384/do-you-have-control-over-nimbyism/ "Do You Have Control Over NIMBYism?"] ''Biomass Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the term was popularized by British politician [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], who was [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for the Environment]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Comedian [[George Carlin]] used the term in a comedy skit, implying that people had already heard of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43Egm0j_p1A |title=George Carlin on N.I.M.B.Y. |publisher=''YouTube'' |format=video |accessdate=25 April 2012 |quote=We &lt;nowiki&gt;{{sic}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; got somethin' in this country (you've heard of it) -- it's called NIMBY -- n-i-m-b-y -- Not In My BackYard!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIMBY acronym has also been used by social scientists since the early 1980s to describe the resistance of communities to the siting of controversial facilities and land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last= Borell |first= Klas |last2= Westermark |first2= Åsa |date= 31 October 2016 |title= Siting of human services facilities and the not in my back yard phenomenon: a critical research review |journal= Community Development Journal |doi= 10.1093/cdj/bsw039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
''NIMBY'' and its derivative terms ''NIMBYism'', ''NIMBYs'', and ''NIMBYists'', refer implicitly to debates of development generally or to a specific case. As such, their use is inherently contentious. The term is usually applied to opponents of a development, implying that they have narrow, selfish, or myopic views. Its use is often [[pejorative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1968870.ece You can’t park here: it’s my retreat, says ‘Nimby’ Clooney] (''[[The Times]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Not in My Neighborhood===
The term ''Not in My Neighborhood'' (or ''NIMN'') is also frequently used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Hull
 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966534,00.html
 | work = Time | publisher = Time Inc | title = Not In My Neighborhood
 | date = 25 January 1988 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "NIMN" additionally refers to legislative actions or private agreements made with the sole purpose of maintaining racial identity within a particular neighborhood or residential area by forcefully keeping members of other races from moving into the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scharper|first1=Diane|title=Ex-Sun author traces bigotry's role in shaping Baltimore|journal=The Baltimore Sun|date=21 March 2010|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-03-21/entertainment/bal-ae.bk.neighborhood21mar21_1_blacks-and-jews-rouse-white-woman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, "Not in My Neighborhood," by author and journalist Antero Pietila, describes the toll NIMN politics had on housing conditions in Baltimore throughout the 20th century and the systemic, racially based citywide separation it caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pietila|first1=Antero|title=Not in my neighborhood : how bigotry shaped a great American city|date=2010|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=1566638437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIABY===
Opposition to certain developments as inappropriate anywhere in the world is characterised by the acronym ''NIABY'' ("Not In Anyone's Backyard"). The building of [[nuclear power plant]]s, for example, is often subject to NIABY concerns.&lt;ref name="translationconference.com"&gt;[http://www.translationconference.com/2008_eload/droth_julia_en.pdf translationconference.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''NAMBI'' ("Not Against My Business or Industry") is used as a label for any business concern that expresses umbrage with actions or policy that threaten that business, whereby they are believed to be complaining about the principle of the action or policy only for their interests alone and not for all similar business concerns who would equally suffer from the actions or policies.&lt;ref name="translationconference.com"/&gt; The term serves as a criticism of the kind of outrage that business expresses when disingenuously portraying its protest to be for the benefit of all other businesses. Such a labelling would occur, for example, when opposition expressed by a business involved in urban development is challenged by activists&amp;nbsp;– causing the business to in turn protest and appealing for support from fellow businesses lest they also find themselves challenged where they seek urban development. This term also serves as a rhetorical counter to NIMBY. Seen as an equivalent to NIMBY by those opposing the business or industry in question.

===BANANA===
''BANANA'' is an acronym for "Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything" (or "Anyone").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/23/opinion/l-absolute-banana-756593.html|title=Absolute Banana|date=23 December 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/152|title=From NIMBYs To DUDEs: The Wacky World Of Plannerese|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used to criticize the ongoing opposition of certain [[advocacy groups]] to [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/banana.asp BANANA] at Wordspy&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent opposition of some [[activist]]s to every instance of proposed development suggests that they seek a complete absence of new growth. The term is commonly used within the context of [[Land use planning|planning]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Sunderland City Council]] lists the term in their online dictionary of jargon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/apps/gobbledygook/Define.asp?ItemId=126|title=Sunderland City Council|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508043826/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/apps/gobbledygook/Define.asp?ItemId=126|archivedate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIBBY===
''PIBBY'' is an acronym for "Place In Blacks' Back Yard." This principle indicates that the people with social, racial, and economic privileges object to a development in their own back yards, and if the objectionable item must be built, then it should be built so that its perceived harms disproportionately affect poor, socially disadvantaged people. Economically disadvantaged people might not want to hire a lawyer to appeal the right way, or might have more immediate troubles than a new nearby construction project. The [[environmental justice]] movement has pointed out Nimbyism leads to [[environmental racism]]. [[Robert D. Bullard]], Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, has argued that official responses to NIMBY phenomena have led to the PIBBY principle.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James B.

===SOBBY===
''SOBBY'' is an acronym for  "Some Other Bugger's Back Yard" and refers to the state of mind which agrees that a particular project may be desirable and perhaps necessary – but only if it is placed somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walter|first1=Liz|title=Move over Yuppies - the Magpies have arrived|url=http://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/2014/03/05/move-over-yuppies-the-magpies-have-arrived/|website=dictionaryblog.cambridge.org|publisher=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points of debate==
Although often used rather pejoratively, the use of the concept NIMBY and similar terms have been critiqued. For instance, the term is frequently used to dismiss groups as selfish or ill-informed, yet these same groups may have virtues that are overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcclymont|first=Katie|last2=O'hare|first2=Paul|date=1 June 2008|title="We're not NIMBYs!" Contrasting local protest groups with idealised conceptions of sustainable communities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549830701803273|journal=Local Environment|volume=13|issue=4|pages=321–335|doi=10.1080/13549830701803273|issn=1354-9839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In favor of development ===
Frequently argued debate points in favor of development include higher employment, tax revenue, marginal cost of remote development, safety, and environmental benefits. Proponents of development may accuse locals of [[egotism]], [[elitism]], parochialism, [[drawbridge mentality]], [[racism]] and anti-[[Multiculturalism|diversity]], the inevitability of criticism, and misguided or unrealistic claims of prevention of [[urban sprawl]]. If people who don't want to be disturbed see the general need of an establishment, such as an airport, they generally suggest another location. But seen from society's perspective, the other location might not be better, since people living there get disturbed instead.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdner, A. &amp; Borell, K. 2003. Neighbourhood Reactions toward Facilities for Residential Care: A Swedish Survey Study. ''Journal of Community Practice'' 11(4):59-81&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In favor of local sovereignty ===
Those labeled as NIMBYs may have a variety of motivations and may be unified only because they oppose a particular project. For example, some may oppose any significant change or development, regardless of type, purpose, or origin. Others, if the project is seen as being imposed by outsiders, may hold strong principles of [[self-governance]], local [[sovereignty]], local autonomy, and [[Municipal home rule|home rule]]. These people believe that local people should have the final choice, and that any project affecting the local people should clearly benefit themselves, rather than corporations with distant investors or central governments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Impact of Corporations on the Commons'', Address by Mary Zepernick at the Harvard Divinity School's Theological Opportunities Program, 21 October 2004, [http://www.poclad.org/?pg=Articles&amp;show=a041021.txt poclad.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Still others may object to a particular project because of its nature, e.g., opposing a nuclear power plant over fear of radiation, but accepting a local [[waste management]] facility as a municipal necessity.

==Examples==

===Canada===

====Nova Scotia====
In July 2012, residents of Kings County rallied against a bylaw, developed over three years of consultation and hearings, allowing wind generators to be constructed nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delaney |first=Gordon |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/114564-which-way-does-the-wind-blow |title=Which way does the wind blow? |work=The Chronicle Herald |date=7 July 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar theme arose in September 2009, where residents there rallied against a wind generator in Digby Neck, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contrarian.ca/2009/09/09/nimby-neck/ |title=NIMBY Neck – updated : Contrarian |publisher=Contrarian.ca |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, residents of Lawrencetown, NS openly opposed a cell tower being built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2011/01/25/ns-lawrencetown-tower-petition.html |title=Cell tower opposed in Lawrencetown |publisher=CBC News |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed development of downtown Dartmouth in August 2012 was also contested by residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Croucher |first=Philip |url=http://metronews.ca/news/halifax/352477/public-hearing-thursday-for-planned-downtown-dartmouth-development/ |title=Public hearing Thursday for planned downtown Dartmouth development &amp;#124; Metro |publisher=Metronews.ca |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, some residents of Lunenburg County opposed wind farms being built in the area, saying, "It's health and it's property devaluation" and "This is an industrial facility put in the middle of rural Nova Scotia. It does not belong there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/03/05/ns-south-canoe-wind-project.html |title=Lunenburg County debates province's largest wind farm |publisher=CBC News |date=5 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, some residents of the community of Blockhouse opposed the building and development of a recycling plant, referred to by one business owner as a "dump." The plant would offer 75 jobs to the community of roughly 5,900 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/negative-feedback-towards-new-development-in-n-s-community-1.1191335 |title=Negative feedback towards new development in N.S. community |publisher=CTV Atlantic News |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the municipal councilors of Chester, Nova Scotia, approved the building of wind turbines in the area in a 6–1 vote, despite some local opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/03/15/ns-south-canoe-approved.html |title=Chester approves Nova Scotia's largest wind farm |publisher=CBC News |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{main|nail house}}

In China there were many famous cases of nail houses, including one property holdout who had expressways built around and completely encircled his apartment building in Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Varinsky | first=Dana | title=The owners of these defiant 'nail houses' in China refuse to give in to developers | website=Business Insider | date=2016-08-20 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-chinese-nail-houses-2016-8 | access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=China's 'nail houses': The homeowners who refused to budge | website=CNN | date=2015-05-19 | url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/asia/gallery/china-nail-houses/index.html | access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
When Christian Zheng Sheng College, a correctional school for young drug addicts, opened in 1998, several people called it an eyesore. In June 2009, residents of Mui Wo voiced objection when they announced they are planning to move their campus into an empty school building there.

===Italy===
The [[No TAV]] opposition to the [[Turin–Lyon high-speed railway]] is often characterized as a NIMBY movement.

===Japan===
The Muraiken Undō or [[No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture Movement]], was a government funded Japanese public health and social movement which began between 1929 and 1934.

In 2001, when the leprosy prevention law was ruled unconstitutional, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Welfare, and the National Diet published statements of apology to leprosy patients and their families. Several prefectural governors made apologies at public sanatoriums.

Two famous incidents where NIMBY's ruled over Greater Tokyo interests. [[Shinkansen]] have been extensively engineered to mitigate impacts of [[tunnel boom]] due to complaints by nearby residents, such that Japan is the only country with such strict regulations (and accompanying financial burdens) on tunnel and aerodynamic designs.  This is one of the key reasons there are so many Shinkansen trainset designs that have been developed.

==== Narita Airport ====
One is the farmers of [[Narita International Airport]], the metropolis' only international link to the outside world, who resisted since 1974 any tiny bit of land allocation.  Originally the plan for the airport also includes a [[Narita Shinkansen|high speed railway]] line that was scrapped.  The NIMBYs additionally prevented extension of the congested airport's very short 2nd runway (unusable for anything but short haul [[Narrow-body aircraft]]) until the late 2000s, when finally cross town [[Haneda Airport]] was opened to international traffic as additional runways on landfill were completed at many billions of dollars of extra costs, as the 2nd runway was lengthened to 2,500 meters.  The 2nd Narita runway still runs short of its original 1974 blueprints and impacts airport operational capacity.

==== Odakyu Double Tracking ====
[[Odakyu Electric Railway]], now providing transit along a corridor with 5 million people living in walking distance of its rail and feeder bus service area&lt;ref name="odakyu"/&gt;, was originally built prewar era, and as the city of Tokyo's population ballooned rail demand in suburbs exploded.  By 1960s, [[Pusher (railway station attendant)|''oshiya'' pushers]] were required to squash people into packed trains, and Odakyu Railway sought to expand its two-track lines to four&lt;ref name="jtkuchi"&gt;https://japantoday.com/category/features/kuchikomi/How-do-railways-figure-out-congestion-on-their-trains-&lt;/ref&gt;, thus allowing more passing trains and faster run times as well as less crowding and congestive wait and hold of trains.  NIMBY residents aside the line in [[Setagaya]] ward fought off attempts by the railway to acquire land, Odakyu did not want to make a scene so they attempted to buy land one by one by offering high prices.  The Setagaya Residents' opposition set the stage for a long-term and remarkable NIMBY cases in the courts and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;https://science-train.com/w/Odakyu_Electric_Railway/History.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1993, after 3 decades of trying, it was apparent this plan was failing, and the company decided to go for an multi-billion dollar solution: tunneling two lines underground, and then adding back two new lines stacked on top, to make 4 tracks in each direction for 12 stations and 10.4 km, instead of acquiring the land.&lt;ref name="odakyu"/&gt;  The company's decision began in 1993 and completed in 2004 for 1 critical section, meanwhile, for the 2nd smaller section, this same decision was made in 2003 with project completion finally approaching fruition in March 2018, nearly 6 decades later.&lt;ref name="jtkuchi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="odakyu"&gt;http://www.odakyu.jp/ir/shared/pdf/annual/2015/fukufuku.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Ashtead, Surrey====
In the affluent [[England|English]] village of [[Ashtead]], [[Surrey]], which lies on the outskirts of [[London]], residents objected in 2007&lt;ref name="ylg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/epsomnews/display.var.1558300.0.0.php|title=No heroes in my backyard|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the conversion of a large, [[Pound sterling|£]]1.7&amp;nbsp;million residential property into a family support centre for relatives of wounded British service personnel. The house was to be purchased by a registered charity, [[SSAFA|SSAFA Forces Help]].&lt;ref name="ylg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssafa.org.uk/HeadleyCourt.html ''Headley Court Families Accommodation'' (SSAFA Forces Help)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090820/http://www.ssafa.org.uk/HeadleyCourt.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=468619&amp;in_page_id=1770|title=Smart school uniforms linked to academic success of UK's schools|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents objected to the proposal out of fear of increased traffic and noise, as well as the possibility of an increased threat of terrorism. They also contended that the SSAFA charity is actually a business, thereby setting an unwelcome precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mole-valley.gov.uk/cwi/getDocument?docId=112803&amp;account=planning&amp;amp;ref=MO/2007/0863&amp;filename=Letter%20of%20Representation|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local newspapers ran articles titled "Nimby neighbours' war with wounded soldiers' families" and "No Heroes in my Backyard."

Ex-servicemen and several members of the British general public organised a petition in support of SSAFA, and even auctioned the "Self Respect of Ashtead" on [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3641566/Legless-boys-mammas-Not-in-Ashtead.html | work=telegraph.co.uk | title=Legless boys' mammas?

====High Speed 2====
Particularly in the run up to the final decision on the route of the high-speed railway known as [[High Speed 2]], BBC News Online reported that many residents of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies were launching objections to the HS2 route based on the effects it would have on them, whilst also showing concerns that HS2 is unlikely to have a societal benefit at a macro level under the current economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12037578|title=The farm lying in the path of the new rail route|date=20 December 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12002171|title=Tory vs Tory on high speed rail|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Labour MP [[Natascha Engel]]—through whose constituency the line will pass—offered a "passionate defence of nimbyism" in the House of Commons, with regards to the effects the line would have on home- and business-owning constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/chan24.pdf|date=26 June 2013|speaker=[[Natascha Engel]]|house=House of Commons|column_start=378|column_end=380|volume=565|no=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; HS2 has also been characterised by residents of the [[Chilterns]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] making arguments against the supposed lack of a business case for the line, often as a smokescreen for NIMBYism. On 17 March 2014, it was announced that Camden's NIMBYs were successful in their campaign to derail the HS1–HS2 link railway.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26604074&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heathrow Airport====
In November 2007 a consultation process began for the building of a new third runway and a sixth terminal and it was controversially&lt;ref name="Ref_2009"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/01/15/heathrow.third.runway/index.html | work=CNN | title=Britain: Third Heathrow runway approved despite opposition - CNN.com | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved on 15 January 2009 by UK Government ministers.&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7829676.stm|title=BBC News - Go-ahead for new Heathrow runway|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was then cancelled on 12 May 2010 by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron Government]].&lt;ref name=Cancelled&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8678282.stm|title=BBC News - Heathrow runway plans scrapped by new government|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wimbledon, London====

The [[London Borough of Merton]] did not have enough school places for local children who would be reaching school age in 2012 and 2013.

===United States===
Research shows that NIMBYism is bipartisan in the United States, with both conservatives and liberals opposing new housing developments in their localities. White neighborhoods and cities tend to favor more restrictive housing development policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/upshot/home-ownership-nimby-bipartisan.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&amp;smtyp=cur|title=The Bipartisan Cry of ‘Not in My Backyard’|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in ''[[Perspectives on Politics]]'' found that "individuals who are older, male, longtime residents, voters in local elections, and homeowners are significantly more likely to participate" in local government, and that "these individuals overwhelmingly (and to a much greater degree than the general public) oppose new housing construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4kzph3ynal3xai/ZoningParticipation_Perspectives_Final.pdf?dl=0|title=Who Participates in Local Government?

According to a 2017 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes available for rent to extremely low income (ELI) households in the United States.  As a result, seventy-one percent of ELI households are forced to spend over half of their income on housing costs leading to severe financial burdens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/Gap-Report_2017.pdf|title=The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Homes|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/assessing-the-severity-of-rent-burden-on-low-income-families-20171222.htm|title=Assessing the Severity of Rent Burden on Low-Income Families|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, while the need for more affordable housing is evident, opposition from “Not-in-my-backyard” or NIMBY activists present significant challenges to affordable housing developments, resulting in costly design changes, construction delays, and permit denials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2015.1013093|title=Democracy in Action?: NIMBY as Impediment to Equitable Affordable Housing Siting|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that proactive outreach and communication by affordable housing developers and proponents through the leveraging of social marketing and positive messaging can overcome common NIMBY barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beben|first=Robert|title=The Role of Social Marketing in Overcoming the NIMBY Syndrome|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2015.1013093|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rockne|first=Anna|title=Not in My Backyard: Using Communications to Shift "NIMBY" Attitudes about Affordable Housing|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/198187/ARockne%20Capstone%206.28.18.pdf?sequence=1|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
A small number of residents (mostly farmers) in [[Hanford, California]] and surrounding areas are opposed to the [[California High-Speed Rail Authority]] building high-speed rail near farmland, citing that it will bring environmental and economic problems.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Wealthy residents of southern Orange County, CA defeated a local measure that proposed to convert the decommissioned El Toro Marine Base into a commercial airport, claiming that the airport would be "unsafe" during landings and take-offs as well as create air quality issues. The real issue was the FAA planned the flight paths for the airport over expensive neighborhoods of the south Orange County and residents feared that their property values would decrease.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The airport proposal, however, was strongly supported by Northern Orange County residents. The defeat of the local measure resulted in the creation of the [[Orange County Great Park]].

National, state and local environmentalists, historic preservationists and long time residents of South [[Pasadena, California]] have been successfully opposing the completion of the highly controversial State Route 710 through the cities of Los Angeles (El Sereno), South Pasadena and Pasadena for over 60 years. There has been a federal injunction in place for 41 years stopping construction of the surface freeway. USC and UCLA urban and transportation planning students study this 80-year-old controversy because it is a classic example of sustained grass-roots opposition to a government proposal.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Now and for over a decade, a struggle has been brewing in [[San Francisco, California]] between the voting public and the influx of young professionals and tech workers. With no room to expand, construction companies can only build up in order to meet the increasing housing demand. However, NIMBYism has prevented high rise construction from spreading in San Francisco, citing restrictions on buildings' shadows and the dramatic changes proposed to the waterfront skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dineen|first=J.K.|title=NIMBYs are back: S.F. builders face growing backlash|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2013/07/nimbys-are-back-sf-builders-face.html|work=NIMBYs are back: S.F. builders face growing backlash|publisher="Biz Journals"|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition argues that new construction will increase the supply of luxury housing without creating affordable housing, thus raising the average rent while by attracting a wealthier population to the city of San Francisco and forcing middle and lower income families out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sankin|first=Aaron|title=8 Washington Luxury Waterfront Condo Development Project Vote Likely To Make It Onto November Ballot|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/8-washington_n_1690575.html|accessdate=29 January 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 2017, 15 housing bills were signed into law by [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]] to combat the state's [[California housing shortage|housing shortage]]. Many of these bills are considered direct attempts to reduce the ability of private citizens to prevent housing projects from going forward, even being referred to by some as "Anti-NIMBY" bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meyersnave.com/legislatures-year-housing-produces-broad-package-bills-stimulate-affordable-housing-construction/|title=The Legislature's "Year Of Housing" Produces Broad Package of Bills to Stimulate Affordable Housing Construction - Meyers {{!}} Nave|website=www.meyersnave.com|language=en-US|access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-housing-legislation-signed-20170929-htmlstory.html|title=Gov.

====Florida====
Similar to the situation in Nantucket Sound, Mass., a minority of residents in [[St. Lucie County]], Florida have vehemently opposed the construction of wind turbines in the county. The construction of the wind turbines was strongly supported by over 80% of county residents according to a 2008 [[Florida Power and Light]] (FPL) poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617010520/https://www.palmbeachpost.com/search/content/tcoast/epaper/2008/04/03/m1b_slwind_0402.html|title=Survey supports turbines, FPL says|last=Quinlan|first=Paul|date=2008-04-03|website=The Palm Beach Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the power company proposed building the turbines in a location on a beach near a prior existing nuclear power plant owned by the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the 1980s, a agency known as the Palm Beach County Expressway Authority was formed to develop a series of east/west highways to take people from suburban Palm Beach County into downtown [[West Palm Beach]]. This was done in anticipation of [[population growth]] that would happen over the next decades in Palm Beach County that would bring in more traffic. Many neighbors in areas such as Westgate and Lake Belvedere Estates strongly opposed this plan citing it would wipe out their neighborhoods. Ultimately the plan was revised to create [[Florida State Road 80|SR-80]] Boulevard into an express like roadway by eliminating traffic lights and overpassing other local roadways.

====Illinois====
In 1959, when [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]] officials learned that a developer building a neighborhood of large new homes planned to make houses available to [[African Americans]], they issued a stop-work order. An intense debate began about racial integration, property values, and the good faith of the residents, community officials and builders. For a brief time, Deerfield was spotlighted in the national news as "the Little Rock of the North."&lt;ref name="ros001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosen | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Rosen (author) |author2=David Rosen  | title = But Not Next Door | publisher = Astor-Honor Inc | year = 1962 | isbn = 0-8392-1007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of integration were denounced and ostracized by residents. Eventually, the village passed a referendum to build parks on the property, thus putting an end to the housing development. Two model homes already partially completed were sold to village officials.&lt;ref name="ros001" /&gt; Otherwise, the land lay dormant for years before it was developed into what is now Mitchell Pool and Park and Jaycee Park. The first black family did not move into Deerfield until much later, and in years since Deerfield has seen a greater influx of minorities, including Jews, Asians, Greeks and others. This episode in Deerfield's history is described in ''But Not Next Door'' by Harry and David Rosen, both residents of Deerfield.

==== Massachusetts ====
Opposition to two proposed freeways within the [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|MA Route 128]] beltway road around Boston—the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] and the routing of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts]] into downtown Boston via the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]]—were opposed from their proposals during the 1950s era, and finally cancelled by the actions of then-Governor [[Francis Sargent]] in 1970. The [[MBTA Orange Line]] heavy rail rapid transit line's southern route was eventually re-located along much of the Southwest Corridor right-of-way for the cancelled I-95's roadbed in the late 1980s, when the Orange Line's [[Washington Street Elevated]] tracks were torn down at the time.

Some residents and businesses of [[Cape Cod]], [[Martha's Vineyard]], and [[Nantucket Island]] have opposed construction of [[Cape Wind]], a proposed offshore [[wind farm]] in [[Nantucket Sound]]. Proponents cite the environmental, economic, and [[energy security]] benefits of clean, [[renewable energy]], while opponents are against any obstruction to the views from oceanfront vacation homes and tourist destinations based in the region.

====Minnesota====
In the late 1990s a proposal for [[commuter rail]] on the [[Dan Patch Corridor]] between [[Minneapolis]] and [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]] was studied. In 2002, due to opposition from neighborhoods along the corridor, two state representatives from the suburbs of [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]] and [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]] passed a legislative ban not allowing further study, discussion, funding, and construction of the project. While the ban is still in place despite numerous attempts to repeal it, the two suburbs that sponsored the ban are now open to the proposal. [[Lakeville, Minnesota|Lakeville]] and [[St. Louis Park]] remain opposed to the project and repealing the ban.

====New York====
In [[Long Island]], various electrification and expansion projects of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR) were substantially delayed due to the protests of people living near the railroad. For example, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] has proposed to build a [[Third Track Project|third track]] on the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] from [[Floral Park station]] to [[Hicksville station]] in order to increase capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/News/2008/MainLineCorridorImprovements.pdf|title=MTA Long Island Rail Road East Side Access and Third Track – Main Line Corridor Improvements|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=4 July 2018|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rather | first=John | title=Third-Track Project Finds Its Nemesis | website=The New York Times | date=10 July 2005 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/nyregion/thirdtrack-project-finds-its-nemesis.html | access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most communities along the route supported [[grade crossing]] eliminations as part of the project, there was fierce opposition for building a third track from the villages of [[Floral Park, New York|Floral Park]], [[New Hyde Park, New York|New Hyde Park]], and [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], which said the construction and the resulting increased train service will reduce the quality of life in their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcnews.com/news/2005/1111/Front_Page/001.html |title=Floral Park Mayor To Address LIRR Expansion |author=Stephanie Mariel Petrellese |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=The Garden City News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322080533/http://www.gcnews.com/news/2005/1111/Front_Page/001.html |archivedate=22 March 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antonnews.com/illustratednews/2005/06/24/news/ |title=Residents: MTA/LIRR Needs to Get on Right Track |author=Carisa Keane |date=24 June 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=New Hyde Park Illustrated News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195104/http://www.antonnews.com/illustratednews/2005/06/24/news/ |archivedate=27 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcnews.com/news/2006/1215/Front_Page/001.html |title=Village Meets With LIRR On "Third Track" Project |author=Stephanie Mariel Petrellese |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=The Garden City News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112195001/http://www.gcnews.com/news/2006/1215/Front_Page/001.html |archivedate=12 January 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third track project was suspended indefinitely in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/14lirrli.html |title=Third-Track Plan Isn’t Dead, L.I.R.R.

In [[Port Washington, New York]], a dispute broke out between the town of [[North Hempstead, New York|North Hempstead]] and the LIRR over a proposed yard expansion at [[Port Washington station]]. To expand the yard, a parking lot belonging to the town would need to be reduced in size, but a local councilperson stated that the addition of the tracks "will completely ruin the character of the town."&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/lirr-plan-would-run-more-trains-to-nyc-1.5263966 |title=LIRR plan would run more trains to NYC |publisher=Newsday |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LIRR was able to expand the yard without the agreement of North Hempstead by tearing up 140 parking spaces of its own parking lot, also adjacent to the station.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt;

Community opposition also led to the cancellation of a proposed extension of the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[BMT Astoria Line|Astoria Line]] (carrying the {{NYCS trains|Astoria}}) to [[LaGuardia Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2003/0716/Front_Page/002.html|title=N Train Extension To LaG Scrapped|last=Toscano|first=John|date=July 16, 2003|newspaper=Queens Gazette|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007-06-27/Features/Flashback_To_1999_001.html|title=Flashback To 1999 &amp;#124; www.qgazette.com &amp;#124; Queens Gazette|date=June 27, 2007|publisher=www.qgazette.com|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, opposition has killed any proposal to build a [[Long Island Sound link|bridge or tunnel across the Long Island Sound]] with some believing it will harm their communities with an influx of unwanted traffic as well as concerns regarding the environment and the number of homes that would be cleared as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Steve|last2=Herman|first2=Ralph|last3=Willinger|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Schlictman|first4=Paul|title=Overview: Oyster Bay-Rye Bridge (I-287, unbuilt)|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/oysterbay-rye/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noise regulation''' includes [[statute]]s or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or provincial and [[municipal]] levels of government. After the watershed passage of the United States [[Noise Control Act|Noise Control Act of 1972]],&lt;ref name="92-574"&gt;U.S. Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, P.L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234, {{Usc|42|4901}} - {{Usc|42|4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; other local and state governments passed further regulations.

A noise regulation{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} restricts the amount of noise, the duration of noise and the source of noise. It usually places restrictions for certain times of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kineticsnoise.com/industrial/noise_ordinance.html|title= Noise Ordinance
|publisher= Kinetics Noise Control, Inc|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]] enacted national laws in 1960 and 1967 respectively, these laws were not at all comprehensive or fully enforceable as to address generally rising ambient noise, enforceable numerical source limits on aircraft and motor vehicles or comprehensive directives to local government.

==History==
[[File:NIOSH Occupational Noise Exposure Criteria Document.jpg|alt=NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure|thumb|388x388px|NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Occupational Noise Exposure]]]

===United States initial legislation===
In the 1960s and earlier, few people recognized that citizens might be entitled to be protected from adverse sound level exposure.  Most concerted actions consisted of citizens groups organized to oppose a specific highway or airport, and occasionally a [[nuisance]] [[lawsuit]] would arise. Things in the United States changed rapidly with passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1969 and the Noise Pollution and Abatement Act, more commonly called the Noise Control Act (NCA), in 1972. Passage of the NCA was remarkable considering the lack of historic organized citizen concern. However, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] that 30 million Americans are exposed to non-[[occupational]] noise high enough to cause [[hearing loss]] and 44 million Americans live in homes impacted by aircraft or highway noise.&lt;ref&gt;Noise Control Act, Public Law 92-574, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 94-301,1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public law 95-609, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 100-418, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

NEPA requires all federally funded major actions to be analyzed for all physical environmental impacts including [[noise pollution]], and the NCA directed the EPA to promulgate regulations for a host of noise emissions. Many city [[local ordinance|ordinances]] prohibit sound above a threshold intensity from trespassing over property line at night, typically between 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and during the day restricts it to a higher sound level; however, enforcement is uneven. Many municipalities do not follow up on complaints. Even where a municipality has an enforcement office, it may only be willing to issue warnings, since taking offenders to court is expensive. A notable exception to this rule is the City of [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland, Oregon]], which has instituted an aggressive protection for its citizens with fines reaching as high at $5000 per infraction, with the ability to cite a responsible noise violator multiple times in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;"City of Portland Code and Charter." Title 18, Chapter 18.18 [http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=28714#cid_18511 "Title 18 Noise Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]], employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]'s role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. The same Act charges the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) with recommending occupational safety and health standards. NIOSH communicates these recommended standards to regulatory agencies (including OSHA) and to others in the occupational safety and health community through the publication and dissemination of Criteria Documents such as the Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/default.html|title=Occupational Noise Exposure|last=NIOSH|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Follow-up on initial U.S. laws===
Initially these laws had a significant effect on thoughtful study of transportation programs and also federally funded [[House|housing]] programs in the United States.  They also gave [[U.S. state|states]] and cities an impetus to consider environmental noise in their [[land use planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] decisions, and led to a host of statutes below the federal level.  Awareness of the need for noise control was rising. In fact, by 1973 a national poll of 60,000 U.S. residents found that sixty percent of people considered street noise to have a "disturbing, harmful or dangerous" impact.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development survey. As reported by Kenneth Eldred at the Fifth International Congress on Noise as an International Problem, Sweden, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend continued strongly throughout the 1970s in the U.S., with about half of the states and hundreds of cities passing substantive noise control laws. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] phased out the office's funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history/epa-history-noise-and-noise-control-act|title=EPA History: Noise and the Noise Control Act|last=EPA|first=|date=1982|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) regulates [[aircraft noise]] by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by "stage" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|last=FAA|first=|date=Jan 9, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control [[Roadway noise|highway noise]] as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/|title=Highway Traffic Noise|last=FHWA|first=|date=June 5, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some states continued to act. California carried out an ambitious plan to require its cities to establish a "Noise Element of the General Plan," which provides guidance for land planning decisions to minimize noise impacts on the public.  Many cities throughout the U.S. also have noise ordinances, which specifies the allowable sound level that can cross property lines. These ordinances can be enforced with local [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]s.&lt;ref name="Local ords"&gt;Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nonoise.org/lawlib/cities/cities.htm "Noise Regulations &amp; Ordinances of U.S. Cities, Counties and Towns."] Accessed 2010-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]] actually passed the first national noise control act, but its scope was much more limited than the U.S. law, addressing mainly workplace and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Japan. Ministry of Environment. Law No. 98 of 1968. Latest amendment by Law No. 91 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and Asia===
Several European countries emulated the U.S. national noise control law: Netherlands (1979), France (1985), Spain (1993), and Denmark (1994). In some cases unlegislated innovations have led to quieter products exceeding legal mandates (for example, hybrid vehicles or best available technology in washing machines). [[Environmental noise]] is a special definition in the [[Directive (European Union)|European directive]] 2002/49/EC article 10.1.

==Local noise ordinances in U.S. and Europe==
[[Local ordinance]]s are principally aimed at construction noise, power equipment operated by individuals and unmuffled [[industrial noise]] penetrating residential areas. Thousands of U.S. cities have prepared noise ordinances that give [[noise control]] officers and police the power to investigate noise complaints and enforcement power to abate the offending noise source, through shutdowns and fines.&lt;ref name="Local ords" /&gt; In the 1970s and early 1980s there was even a professional association for noise enforcement officers called NANCO, "National Association of Noise Control Officials."

Today only a handful of properly trained Noise Control Officers remain in the United States. A typical noise ordinance sets forth clear definitions of acoustic nomenclature and defines categories of noise generation; then numerical standards are established, so that enforcement personnel can take the necessary steps of warnings, fines or other municipal police power to rectify unacceptable noise generation.  Ordinances have achieved certain successes but they can be thorny to implement. Many European cities are still treating noise as the U.S. did in the 1960s, as a nuisance and not as a numerical standard to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* Effects of Noise on Health and Welfare
&lt;ref&gt;Kryter, K.D., "The Effects of Noise on Man”, Academic Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, B, Lindvall, T, Schwela, D. "Guidelines for Community Noise", World Health Organization, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Health and Welfare Criteria for Noise, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,  EPA 550/9-73-002, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information on levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety, US Environmental Agency, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

One obligation of a community is to protect its citizens from adverse environmental influences.  Noise is one of these factors, Noise has documented effects on people, they can be divided into three types.  The first type is a physical effect that directly and adversely effects a person's health. Hearing loss and vibration of bodily components are examples. The second type is a physiological effect that adversely effects a person's health; heightened blood pressure and general stress response are examples.  The third type is psychological that adversely effects a person's welfare; examples are distraction, annoyance, and complaint.
	The only feasible legal basis for a community’s right to control noise is based on these adverse health and welfare effects.  It is clearly easier to uphold the constitutionality of a noise ordinance in a court of law if it can be shown that it is based on health and welfare concerns.  The following is a short list of recognized effects of noise that can be addressed as a reason for a noise ordinance.
:Excess non-Occupational noise exposure, hearing loss on both public and private property, speech interference on both public and private property, audio interference on both public and private property, and sleep interference on mostly private property.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet, M.H., Arand, D.L., Heart Rate Variability: Sleep Stage, Time of Night, and Arousal Influences" Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wright State University, and Kettering Medical Center, Dayton, OH, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some legal considerations in the United States===
There are several fundamental issues that shape the legality, effectiveness and enforceability of any community noise regulation.

====Preemption====
The federal government has preempted certain areas of noise regulation. They can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations under the EPA Noise Abatement Programs;&lt;ref&gt;Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40 - Protection of Environment, Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency, Subchapter G - Noise Abatement Programs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=CFR&amp;searchPath=Title+40%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+G&amp;granuleId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25-chapI-subchapG&amp;packageId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25&lt;/ref&gt; Parts 201 to 205 and 211 cover railroads, motor carriers in interstate commerce, construction equipment, motor vehicles.  They require product labeling and prohibit tampering with noise control devices.  Communities may enact regulations that are no more strict than the federal ones so that local enforcement can be carried out.  They can enact curfews and restrict vehicle use in established zones such as residential.  Any restriction on interstate motor carriers or railroads may NOT be for the purpose of noise control.
States have police powers granted by the Constitution.  They may also enact regulations that are no more strict than federal regulations. They may also preempt local ordinances.  California &lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code 46000-46080&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;NJAC 7:29&lt;/ref&gt; have comprehensive noise codes that communities must meet. Many states required that local ordinances be no more strict than the state code whether such code exists or not.  One relatively common preemption is protection of shooting ranges from noise regulation or litigation&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Revised Statutes, Chapter 17-602&lt;/ref&gt; and right to farm laws that protect agricultural areas from nuisance litigation by encroaching residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Right to Farm Act Article, pp.823-14{{Clarify pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional vagueness====
In one case, the United States Supreme Court has said [[Void for vagueness]]
“It is a basic principle of due process (Amendment V) that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing ''fair warning''.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.  A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of ''arbitrary and discriminatory application''.  Third, but related, where a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. (the chilling effect).  In one case,&lt;ref&gt;State of New Jersey vs. Clarksburg Inn, 375 N.J. Super. 624, 868 A.2s 112, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the court declared that numerical sound levels were constitutional as well as the term ''plainly audible'' provided it was associated with a reasonable distance. Two requirements for a noise ordinance provision is that:
#provide fair warning
#avoid the possibility of arbitrary enforcement

====Free Speech====
Examples are: slander, hate speech, and [[Shouting fire in a crowded theater|falsely calling "fire" in an assembly]]. Generally, the time, place, or manner of restrictions must:
#be content neutral
#be narrowly tailored
#serve a significant government interest
#leave open alternative channels of communication
One example&lt;ref&gt;Madsen vs. Women's Health Center&lt;/ref&gt; concerned protesters outside an abortion clinic.  The US Supreme Court stated that limitations placed on noise making were necessary to ensure the well-being of patients.

====Overbreadth====
The US Supreme Court has addressed the issue of too much regulation by defining overbreadth as: ''A clear, precise enactment may nevertheless be overbroad if, in its reach, it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.'' One means to avoid being overbroad is by having provisions that are specific so that potential violators are given fair warning of what is prohibited. In one case &lt;ref&gt;Grayned vs. City of Rockford, 408 US 104 (19720&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled that the specificity of the city ordinance (Section 17-35) regulating school verbal protests was not ''constitutionally vague'', gave ''fair warning'', and was not an invitation to arbitrary enforcement and so was not overbroad, despite the implied limitation on free speech.

====Nuisance====
Nuisances are part of tort law. Torts are civil wrongs whether intentional or accidental from which injury occurs to another. Nuisances can be public or private.  A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public while a private nuisance is an interference with a person's enjoyment and use of his land. [[Black's Law Dictionary]] defines a nuisance as''... that which annoys and disturbs one in possession of his property, rendering its ordinary use and occupation physically uncomfortable to him.''  It defines a private nuisance as:..''anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another.  As distinguished from public nuisance, it includes any wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the property of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with their lawful use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which unlawfully hinders them in the enjoyment of a common or public right and causes them a special injury different from that sustained by the general public.'' The word ''nuisance'' is connected closely with the word ''disturbance'' which is used extensively in many noise ordinances. A definition below further restricts the meaning to ''noise disturbance''.  Nuisance law applies to both community noise regulation as well as private suits brought to court to reduce noise impact.

====Enforceability====
Care must be taken in writing a ''subjective'' noise provision so that it overcomes the objections listed above. Care must be taken when writing an ''objective'' noise provision to make sure that the sound levels are physically realizable.  For example, requiring the maximum sound level of an automobile to be 40&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or the maximum sound level in a residential zone to be 30&amp;nbsp;dB(A) opens the provision to an enforceability challenge

====Confiscation====
Confiscation is the taking of private property for public use without compensation. It may occur legally when the government seizes property used in illegal practices.    Confiscation may occur without an arrest of a person because it is seen as an arrest of property, rather than a person, and the necessity of finding a party guilty is not required in all cases. In many cases, the guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant and the government need not prove anything ''beyond a reasonable doubt''. In order to seize property, there must be either a warrant or a showing of probable cause. The mere showing of probable cause to support the forfeiture of an individual’s property has been a controversial issue. Court opinion varies, but probable cause most often means that the government need only demonstrate reasonable grounds for the belief that the property is properly subject to forfeiture, which can be supported by something less than prima facie proof, but more than mere suspicion. The Peoria, Illinois noise ordinance (Sections 15-75 and 15-77) allows confiscation of vehicles that emit excessive sound caused by sound producing devices. Colorado Springs, Colorado (Section 9.8.102) permits confiscation of sound producing devices.

===Four Types of Noise Regulation===
&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fixed sound sources must be treated differently than moving sources.  In the former case, the listener is normally defined while for moving sources it is not.  Historically, regulations were enforced by the subjective judgment of an enforcing officer.  With the advent of sound measuring equipment, the judgment can be based on measured sound levels. Most comprehensive noise ordinances contain four types of provisions.

'''Subjective Emission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the output of a sound source is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' terms on public property as a criterion are examples.

'''Subjective Immission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the sound received by a listener is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard for the specific sound power generated by the source.. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' or ''noise disturbance'' terms on private property as a criterion are examples.

'''Objective Emission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the output of a sound source to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with specific maximum sound output levels for motor vehicles are examples.

'''Objective Immission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the sound received by a listener to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the specific sound power generated by the source.  Regulations with maximum allowable sound levels on property lines are examples

===Some Definitions used in the United States===
many communities have definitions that are local to them, such as those defining motor vehicles and sound levels and sound level  measurements.  Some that have been added to make noise enforcement more specific are listed here.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Engine Braking Device====
A compression braking device installed on large motor vehicles to assist in reduction, or control, of vehicle speed.  When activated, the engine converts from a power source to a power absorber by converting the engine into an air compressor.

====Muffler====
Any device for the abatement of sound emission while permitting the transfer of gas.  A muffler is considered to be in good working order if the sound reduction is equal to, or greater than, that of the original equipment.

====Noise Disturbance====
Any sound or vibration which:
# may disturb or annoy reasonable persons of normal sensitivities or;
# causes, or tends to cause, an adverse effect on the public health and welfare or;
# endangers or injures people or;
# endangers or injures personal or real property.
This can also be defined as ''noise nuisance''.

====Place of Public Entertainment====
Any location, exterior, or interior, to a building that regularly permits public entrance for entertainment purposes.  For this purpose, “public” means citizens of all types, including but not limited to, children, and private or public employees.

====Plainly Audible Sound====
Any sound for which the information content is unambiguously communicated to the listener, such as, but not limited to, understandable speech, comprehension of whether a voice is raised or normal, repetitive bass sounds, or comprehension of musical rhythms, without the aid of any listening device.

====Powered Model Vehicle====
Any self-propelled airborne, water-borne, or land-borne, plane, vessel, or vehicle, which is not designed to carry persons, including, but not limited to, any model airplane, boat, car, or rocket.

====Real Property Boundary====
An imaginary line along the ground surface, and its vertical extension, which separates the real property owned by one person from that owned by another person, but not including intra-building real property divisions.

====Sound Reproduction Device====
Any device, instrument, mechanism, equipment or apparatus for the amplification of any sounds from any radio, phonograph, stereo, tape player, musical instrument, television, loudspeaker or other sound-making or sound-producing device or any device or apparatus for the reproduction or amplification of the human voice or other sound.

====Vibration Perception Threshold====
The minimum ground or structure borne vibrational motion necessary to cause a person of normal sensitivity to be aware of the motion through contact, hearing, or through visual observation of moving things.

===Ordinance Provisions for Stationary Sources in the United States===
there are three levels of regulation for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad ''subjective immission'' control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an ''objective immission'' control that uses specific levels of sound considered to be a noise disturbance.  Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation.  The concept that a potential violator should have ''fair warning'' that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems.  The sections below list those that are found in community noise ordinances.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Air Conditioning, Heating and Pool Equipment====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  An evaluation of the noise disturbance is made at the listener without a sound level meter. This provision is mostly applied in residential zones such as homes, apartments and condominiums.  Albuquerque, NM (Article 9-9) requires that such units the maximum permissible sound levels (Se section below) and recommend that those units be placed away from other residential units or on roof tops to diminish impact.

====Airport and Airport Operations====
Community control of airport created noise is limited to those sounds ''not'' related to flight operations.  The community is able to control the land use around the airport however.

====Animals====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  Most relate to barking dogs and put an upper time limit for continuous sound from them.  New Jersey (Chapter 13:1G) considers a violation if the sound is continuous for more than 5 minutes or intermittent for more than 20 minutes.  They also consider it a defense to violation if the animal is provoked to bark. Connecticut (Chapter 442)exempts animal sounds while Anchorage, AK (Chapter 15.70) requires that continual violations permit the animal to be taken and put out for adoption.

====Authorized Outdoor Discharge of Firearms and Shooting Ranges====
This provision contains only a curfew since most states protect shooting ranges from liability for noise disturbance.  It can include a curfew requirement and a requirement for a public hearing if expansion of the range is desired.  The provision may prohibit other weapons such as rocket propelled projectiles but may exempt unpowered weapons such as arrows. South Carolina (title 31 Chapter 18) requires that a sign stating '''SHOOTING RANGE-NOISE AREA''' be placed on all primary roads. Arizona (ARS 17-602) places a curfew from 10pm to 7 am.  It also allows a tradeoff between the number of events and the maximum permitted sound level. New York (Chapter 150) also trades off overall levels with the duration of the sounds. Colorado (Article 25-12-109) declared that noise restrictions on shooting ranges is a detriment to public health, welfare, and morale.

====Condominiums and Apartments====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It is designed to limit the noise disturbance between living units as defined by an enforcement official.  One criterion used to evaluate that disturbance is use of ''plainly audible'' but at the location of the listener instead of at a specific distance.  However, Charlotte, NC (Sec. 15-69) limits indoor levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) be tween 9am to 9pm and 5&amp;nbsp;dB less at other times, but only from sound reproducing devices. Salt Lake Valley Health Department (Chapter 4), Minneapolis, MN (Chapter 389), and Albuquerque, NM (Article 9) use levels to existing ambient to define a violation. Albuquerque NM and Omaha, NE (Chapter 17) require that intruding sounds not be audible. Burlington, VT (Chapter 18) requires that renters be supplied with the city noise ordinance.

====Construction====
This provision can be both a ''subjective immission'' control and an ''objective emission'' control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews.  The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community.  The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines.  There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926.  Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4)  permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays.  Albuquerque, New Mexico (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90&amp;nbsp;dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80&amp;nbsp;dB during the day for three days.

====Domestic and Commercial Power Tools====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is used in residential zones as well as in commercial areas abutting residential zones.  Portland, OR (Title 18.10.030) has several ways to handle these tools. They separate ''outdoor'' and ''indoor'' use to different maximum levels at the property line. They have a night curfew and separate 5 HP tools from higher powered tools.  Madison WI (Chapter 24.08) has similar HP restrictions.  Albuquerque, NM (Title 9-9-7) restricts locations to more than 500 feet from residential and noise sensitive zones. Dallas, TX(Sec. 30-2) exempts lawn maintenance tools during daylight hours. Green Bay, WI (Subchapter II – 27.201) exempts snow removal tools.

====Explosives, Firearms, Impulsive Sources, and Similar Devices====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is for impulsive sound sources that are not associated with construction activities or shooting ranges. Many communities use the Maximum Permissible Sound Levels criterion (see below), with a correction for the character of the sound. Illinois () sets maximum blasting levels by land use zone and in three time categories. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.010.F) limits levels to 100&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 7am to 10pm and 80&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 10pm to 7 am.

====Fracking Operations====
Hydraulic Fracturing operations generate site sound as well as vehicle sound and several different provisions are required to control it.  Federal law regulates the levels of certain site machinery.  A ''subjective immission'' control or an ''objective immission'' control can be applied to surrounding neighborhoods. See maximum Permissible Sound Levels.  Motor vehicle sound is mostly off-site so vehicle noise regulations are applicable. See Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-way.
The State of New York has announced a statewide ban on such operations. Buffalo, NY and Pittsburgh, PA have announced a ban.  Colorado has numerous activities to stop fracking.

====Funerals====
This is a ''subjective emission'' control to reduce the excessive shouting and protests that can surround funeral proceedings.  It makes use of the ''plainly audible'' term and so adds a distance criterion.  There are certain groups, particularly those that object to involvement in foreign wars, who believe it is an obligation to disrupt and picket funerals, especially those of deceased military veterans.  This provision must not infringe on Constitutionally protected free speech. Illinois h(720 ILCS 5/26 6)has a comprehensive provision covering more aspects of this event than noise.  They failed to use “plainly audible” which is narrower than “audible”.  Utah(Section 76-9-108) restricts disruptive activity to beyond 200 feet.

====Loading and Unloading Operations====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  Operations in commercial facilities can impact adjacent residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.03) places a curfew on such operations between 10pm and 7am but only if the source is within 200 feet of a residence. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2830) permits night operations unless they create a noise disturbance. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.6) prohibits noise disturbance between 7pm and 7am.

====Maximum Permissible Sound Pressure Levels====
This provision is an ''objective immission'' control.  It requires the measurement of sound levels at or beyond a property line and its vertical extension. There are several methods for implementing such a provision:
# It may not permit any exceedence or may permit exceedence only for a percentage of the measurement period. 
# It may require the measurement method to be instantaneous, such as dB(A) or time-averaged, such as Energy Equivalent Level (Leq).
# It may be a fixed level limit, such as 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A), or it may be a level relative to the ambient sound, such as 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) above the ambient.
# It may require measurement of the frequency spectrum, such as one octave bands, or A-weighting, such as dB(A).
# It may define different maximum levels based on zoning criteria, such as residential, commercial, or industrial.
# It may define different maximum levels based on time-of-day or day-of-week, such as reduced maxima during night hours or on weekends.
# It may require reduction of maximum levels based on the character of the sound, such as intermittent or impulsive.
# It may exempt certain classes of sound sources, such as shooting ranges, farm equipment, emergency equipment, railroads, or licensed activities.
most noise ordinances set maximum levels for two time periods: Day (7am to 10pm) and Night (10pm to 7am).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt; San Diego (Article 9.25)sets three periods:  Day (7am to 7pm), Evening (7pm to 10pm), and Night (10pm to 7am) and exempts industrial zones from time based restrictions.  Seattle, WA (Chapter 25.08) sets two time periods but changes 7am to 9am on weekends and holidays.  Several states have maximum permissible land use sound levels in dB(A). Most have Day and Night periods and three use categories: residential, Commercial and Industrial. Washington{{vague|state? D.C.?|date=September 2015}} (Chapter 70.107) sets maximum levels in dB(A) but allows 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) more if the sound is only 15 minutes in an hour, or 10&amp;nbsp;dB(A) for 5 minutes in an hour.  Numerous cities have fixed levels, permitting excess levels for short times (e.g., Dallas, TX, Chapter 30) while others use Leq (Lincoln, NE, Chapter 8.24). Los Angeles, CA (Chapter XI) uses a relative level with a stated but ''presumed'' ambient.  New York City, NY (Chapter 19) requires Leq measurements to be made over one hour.  Atlanta, GA (){{vague|"()"|date=September 2015}} limits impulsive sound to 100&amp;nbsp;dB(C) at property lines, while most reduce the maximum level by 5&amp;nbsp;dB for pure tones and impulsive sounds.

====Motor Vehicle or Motorboat Repairs and Testing====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  If the activity is done in a residential zone, the Domestic Tools provision can be applied for the repairs, but this provision also is used for the testing phase of any repairs. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.01) covers this violation in three ways.  The first is application of the ''noise disturbance'' provision in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The second is being ''plainly audible'' at a distance of 150 feet or more in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The third is exceeding the presumed ambient by 5&amp;nbsp;dB.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.7) prohibits this activity as a ''noise disturbance'' at any time.

====Noise Disturbance Prohibited====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. This provision is generic in that it covers all events that are considered disturbing by a listener, with or without measurement.  The strength of this provision is that it covers situations not contemplated in a noise ordinance and can be used as backup for more specific provisions. The weakness is that it may not give ''fair warning'', may lead to arbitrary enforcement on the part of the regulator, or permit unreasonable demands by a listener.

====Noise Sensitive Zones====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  It is used to reduce levels of both stationary and vehicular sound sources around hospitals, schools, and other noise sensitive locations.  To provide ''fair warning'' visible signs must be posted.  It is possible to have an extensive list. For example, if churches are on the list and the community has many of them, signage, compliance, and enforcement can be a problem. In modern hospital environments, helicopter sound is exempt.

====Places of Public Entertainment====
This provision is an ''objective immision '' control.  It regulates the site of the sound source while the Sound Reproduction Devices section regulates the devices that create the sound.  It can regulate the sound levels received by ''involuntary'' listeners in the surrounding community as well as the sound levels received by ''voluntary'' listeners.  If the latter aspect is incorporated, limiting internal sound levels often resolves community noise impact. Los Angeles (Article 2, Section 112.06)requires warning signs and limits noise exposure to 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at any position normally occupied. Seattle, WA {Section 25.08.501} considers the sound emitted to be in violation if the sound is ''plainly audible'' within a dwelling from 10 pm to 7am; the need for a sound level meter is avoided. Chicago, IL {Section 11-4-2805} limits received sound levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) inside a residential dwelling unit but if the ambient is greater, the limit is 65&amp;nbsp;dB(A).  If outdoors, the limit is ''conversational level'' at 100 feet from the property line.  If the building is set back 20 feet from the property line, the allowable level is 84&amp;nbsp;dB(A)!  Both of Chicago’s limits apply from 10 pm to 8 am.  Salt Lake health Department, UT {Section 4.5.11.(vii)} sets the limit at 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at a position that would normally be occupied by a patron and 100&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other positions. They also require a sign stating '''WARNING: SOUND LEVELS ON THIS PREMISE &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; MAY CAUSE PERMANENT HEARING DAMAGE. HEARING PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE'''.   Anchorage, AK (Section 15.70.060.B.12) sets maximum levels for any patron at 90&amp;nbsp;dB(A).

====Powered Unmanned Vehicles or Engines====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It has been used to regulate the sound of model aircraft on both private and public property.  It applies to airborne, water-borne, and land-borne, unmanned vehicles.  It makes no distinction between model vehicles and full-size unmanned vehicles.  it applies also to the engines of those vehicles. Most regulations pertained to private unmanned vehicles, normally restricted to local open fields.  The development of drones with microphones, cameras and GPS has opened the door to commercial use over wider private and public properties.  Since federal preemption of drone use will likely occur, it is important for this provision to make the distinction. Salt Lake Health Department (Section 4.5.15) limits activity to 800 feet from a dwelling between 10 pm and 7 am, or if it cases a noise disturbance. Atlanta, GA (Section 74-136(b)) uses the ''plainly audible'' criterion across a residential property line, on a public property from 10 pm to 7 am on weekdays or from 10 pm to 10 am on weekends or holidays for any sound source.

====Propane Cannons====
This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. A propane cannon is used to keep animals and birds from destroying commercial crops.  In large fields, many are used and fired as frequent intervals. The sound levels are equivalent to the firing of a small artillery cannon.  The provision may contain requirements that limit the number of cannons permitted in a specific area and the number firings per hour for each cannon.  many states have a Right to Farm Act that limits nuisance litigation.  Florida() stated that it was a purpose of their act to protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on farm land from nuisance suits.  They also added a section that limited expand of operations without consideration of noise. Fairfax County, VA (Sections 105-4-4 and 108-5-1) require agricultural operation to meet maximum land use regulations and prohibit unnecessary noise.  British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture (Farm Nuisance Noise document) have developed a comprehensive set of rules for cannon use.

====Public Address Systems====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It can contain a ''plainly audible'' term or a curfew.  It is applied to commercial facilities using a sound system to ''deliberately'' propagate mostly speech, but also music.  Most cities have provisions relevant to this subject.  Lakewood, CO (Sections 9.52.06 and 09.52.160) used ''plainly audible'' as a regulatory tool and prohibits the sounding of bells, or chimes from 10pm to 7am.  Charlotte, NC (Section 15-69(a)(4)) limits levels to 60&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet from 9am to 9pm and 50&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other times. Indianapolis, IN (Section 391-505) addresses broadcasts from aircraft. Connecticut (Section 22a-69-1.7) exempts bells, carillons, and chimes from religious facilities.

====Sound Reproduction Devices====
This provision is ''subjective immission'' control. It may contain a numerical level or a ''plainly audible'' term and a curfew. it is applied to specific sources of sound as opposed to any location at which the sound is created. It is applied primarily to ''amplified'' sound sources.  Older provisions listed several items such as televisions, phonographs, etc.  Changing the title to the above  addresses the real issue and allows for novel sound production devices.  Numerous communities have provisions for these devices; many use ''plainly audible'' as the criterion, such as Omaha, NE (Section 17-3) and Buffalo NY (Section 293-4)

====Stadiums and Outdoor Music Festivals====
This provision can be either a ''subjective or objective immission'' control with a curfew.  The subjective aspect relates to noise disturbance in the local community.  The objective aspect limits the acceptable sound level in the local community.  Illinois (Environmental Protection Act 415.25) exempts certain stadiums and exempts festivals, parades, or street fairs. Colorado Spring, CO (Section 9.8.101)  has similar exemptions, but limits the sound levels to 80&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at residential locations.

====Stationary Emergency Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control with a list of devices that are exempt. It can have a term that limits the time periods in which emergency alarms may be tested. It can have a term that limits the activation time of burglar or fire alarms.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2815) limits the time for tests to 4 minutes between 9am and 5pm. Oregon (Chapter 467) prohibits sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary.

====Stationary non-Emergency non-Safety Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control that limits the activation period of alarms and restricts activation to a specific time-of-day or day-of-week. Los Angeles, CA () prohibits the sounding if the signal can be heard at 200 feet or more. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2820) considers the sound to be a noise disturbance in residential areas if the sound exceeds 5 minutes in any hour; steam whistles are exempt.  Albuquerque, NM (Section 9-9-12) restricts levels to 5&amp;nbsp;dB over the ambient at a property line and applies maximum permissible residential level as well as ''plainly audible'' restrictions at night.

====Street Sales====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. Boston, MA (Section 16-2.2) prohibits street sales near schools or churches if there is a “disturbance of the peace”.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.4) places a curfew between 6 pm and 9 am.

====Tampering====
This provision prevents the modification of muffling devices that increase the emitted sound. It can also be used to prevent the commercial sale of such mufflers.  Most states and communities have prohibitions on tampering with noise reduction devices. whether stationary or moving.  Salt Lake County health Department (Section 4.5.10) prohibits modifications of mufflers that increase sound levels and prohibits tampering with noise rating labels.  See Section below on Adequate Mufflers.

====Vibration====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control.  Noise disturbance caused by vibration comes in three forms.  One is contact with vibrating surfaces, the second in auditory, and the third is the observation of surrounding objects movement.  Objectively regulating vibration is difficult so this provision makes use of the Vibration Perception Threshold.  Railroad caused vibration is preempted by federal law (CFR 201). Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2910) uses the perception threshold method.   Dallas, TX requires measurement of low frequency vibration.  Maryland uses the definition of ''noise'' to include sound and vibration at sub-audible frequencies.

====Wind Turbines====
The sound created by wind turbines is caused by the blade rotation similar to aircraft propellers.  Because the rotation rate is low, the frequency is also low, but the large size of many can result in disturbing sound levels, particularly in high wind areas.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A.L., Manwell, G.F., Wright, S. "Wind Turbine Acoustic Noise", University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Most local control is done by advantageous site planning.  New Hampshire (Title LXIV, Section 674:63) sets a sound level limit of 55&amp;nbsp;dB when measured at the site property line, allowing for exceptional events, such as storms. Studies have declared that wind noise can have a negative effect on health.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, "Public Health Effects of Wind Turbines", Minnesota Department of Health, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinance Provisions for Moving Vehicles in the United States===
Stationary sources have fixed positions, so it is possible to define the listeners and therefore ''immission'' controls are appropriate.  Motor vehicles are moving sources so it is not possible to define any specific listeners so ''emission'' controls are appropriate.  There are exceptions to this distinction. Construction equipment, and some recreation vehicles, move within a bounded area and can be considered to be time varying fixed sources. Standing motor vehicles can radiate sufficient sound to create noise disturbance.  These must be treated by specific provisions.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Adequate Mufflers or Sound Dissipation Devices====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control.  Unlike the Tampering provision, this is specific to motor vehicles.  It requires that a vehicle muffler not create more sound than the original equipment which has been measured.  It prohibits any modification or replacement that increases the sound emission beyond that of the original equipment. It prohibits the sale of mufflers that do not meet original equipment standards.  Many states have requirements that a muffler ''shall be in good working order'' which is not specific enough.  California (Section 27150.1)) requires that a retail seller that sells a product in violation of the muffler regulation  must install a replacement muffler that meets the regulation and must reimburse the purchaser for the expense of replacement.

====Airboats and Hovercraft====
This provision is both an "objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.  It can set a maximum sound level at a specified distance (typically 50 feet). It can have a curfew.  It can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in the community.  It can also require the use of ear protectors on passengers. Unlike motorboats, the sound generators on these vehicles are airborne, resulting in more noise impact.  Florida (Section 327.65) requires a maximum level of 90 DB(A).  Maine (Title 12 Section 13068-A)has three levels: operating, operating test and stationary test

====Engine Braking Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control. It can restrict brake use for only safety purposes and by defining restricted areas.  It can require that mufflers be maintained to keep emitted sound to that of the original equipment.  Common terminology is '''Jake brakes''' after the Jacobs Company. Milwaukee, Wi (Section 80-69) prohibits use within city limits.  Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.B.3) prohibits use within 200 feet of a residence.  Albuquerque, NM posts signs requiring proper mufflers.

====Motorboats====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.
Because they are moving sources, ''objective'' controls are appropriate for measurements on open waterways.  Many motorboats operate in bounding areas, such as small lakes or canals, with adjacent residential areas.  In this case, ''immission'' controls are appropriate. California (Section 654.05), Portland OR (Section 18.10.040), and Seattle, WA (Section 25.08.485) require ''immission'' measurements to be made at the shoreline. Many states require ''emission'' measurements to be made at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Horns or Signaling Devices====
This provision is both a prohibition and an ''emission'' control. it limits to use for safety warning only..  It limits the sound level to a specific level at a prescribed distance.  This provision is intended to limit horn use to safety and to limit the use of excessively loud air horns or ''Rumbler'' or ''Howler'' horns. California prohibits a person operating a motor vehicle to wear a headset or earplugs on both ears. . Oregon (Section 820.370) prohibits signaling sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary or returning from an emergency

====Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-Way====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It applies maximum sound levels to various categories of moving vehicles and for several vehicle speeds.  It is the backbone of vehicle sound emission regulations. It generally requires a measurement of A-weighted sound level of a moving vehicle at a specific distance from the vehicle path (normally 50 feet).  This provision has level restrictions on trucks over 10,000 GVW used locally and in interstate commerce.  It also covers motorcycles of two horsepower ratings, mopeds, and all other vehicles on public rights-of-way.  The federal government has set maximum levels for heavy trucks used in interstate commerce (40 CFR 202)and for motorcycles (40 CFR 205).  Most states and many cities  have maximum limits and they generally agree with federal standards where they apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix B&lt;/ref&gt; The most common speed division is 35&amp;nbsp;mph.

====Motor Vehicle Racing Events====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It can define the method of vehicle operation that is used to define the maximum permitted sound level.  It can have a curfew.  Some states exempt motor vehicle racing events from noise disturbance litigation or prosecution.  Arizona (Section 28-955.03) exempts racing motorcycles from maximum sound levels and muffler requirements. Illinois {Section 35.903} had detailed regulations on racing vehicles It required a 14&amp;nbsp;dB reduction in sound output, limited sound output at half mater to 115&amp;nbsp;dB(A), and no more than 105&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Sound systems====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control, a ''subjective emission'' control, and a ''subjective immission'' for vehicles on a public right-of-way.  The first part limits the system sound level at a fixed distance. The second part uses the ''plainly audible'' definition for limiting the sound output.  The third part uses the ''noise disturbance'' definition to limit the impact on neighboring properties and can be applied within public transportation. The most restrictive application of the plainly audible laws says that the sound cannot be audible to anyone other than the vehicle occupants.  There are numerous state and community restrictions on vehicle sound systems. Louisiana prohibits the system from emitting sound outside of a vehicle.  Richmond, CA also prohibits the sound from being audible outside the vehicle.  Oregon prohibits sound systems being ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet. California prohibits sound systems that can be ''heard'' at 50 feet. Colorado Springs, CO, requires a measurement at 25 feet beyond the private property line or 25 feet from the source on public property; it does not specify a limiting level.  In Lakewood, CO it must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 25 feet.  In Los Angeles, CA, it cannot be audible beyond 200 feet.  In Seattle, WA, it must not be ''plainly audible'' at 75 feet. Chicago restricts levels to less than ''clearly audible'' at 75 feet. Minneapolis, MN restricts levels to less than audible at 50 feet. Albuquerque, NM restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet, but also applies their land use limits.  Cincinnati, OH restricts ''plainly audible'' to 50 feet.  Dallas, TX prohibits sound or vibration that is detectable at 30 feet, or that violates the land use regulations.  Houston, TX applies land use restrictions. Omaha, NE states the sound must not be audible at 100 feet.  Hammond, IN restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet. New Jersey states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet between 8 am and 10 pm and not ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet between 10 pm and 8 am.  Florida states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet, but exempts business and political systems.  Oregon and Tennessee state that the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 50 feet, as does Fairbanks, AK. Rhode Island specifically addresses low frequency sound that can be heard 20 feet from a closed vehicle or 100 feet otherwise.  Salt Lake County Health Department, UT considers the sound a violation if it is ''plainly audible'' on a common carrier. Austin, TX states it must not be audible at 30 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Theft Alarms====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control with only an operational time limit. Los Angeles, CA () requires silencing in 5 minutes.  New York City, NY (Section 24.221(d)) requires automatic shut-off after 10 minutes and a prominent display of the local precinct number and telephone number.  Boston, MA (Section 16-26.2) considers it a violation if the alarm is plainly audible at 200 feet and is on more than 5 minutes.  Other states an communities have automatic shutoff times from 10 to 15 minutes.  Some communities have banned such alarms.

====Motor Vehicle Tire Squeal and Street Drag Racing====
This provision is  a ''subjective immission'' control. It is based on the ''noise disturbance'' from drag racing and tire squealing on public rights-of-way.  Illinois (625 ILCS 5/11-505) prohibits such activities.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.14) prohibits such activity if it creates a ''noise disturbance''.

====Railroads====
Railroad activity is subject to federal regulations. Most communities do not attempt to regulate train sound.  The level of train horns permitted by the Federal Railroad Administration sufficiently high that community impact occurs. One method to alleviate this sound is to have a community establish a '''quiet zone''' where the rail crossings meet federal safety standards so that horn use is not needed.

====Recreational Off-road Vehicles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance, is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate. Numerous states and cities have ''emission'' controls measured at 50 feet;  the most common level is 82&amp;nbsp;dB(A), which is similar to that for motor vehicles on public rights-of-way.  Colorado Springs, CO (Section 9.8.204.C) requires a minimum distance of 660 feet from residences. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.C) requires the area must be designated for recreational vehicle use.  Salt Lake health Department, UT (Section 4.5.10(x)) requires off-highway vehicles to be at least 800 feet from a dwelling during the day and has a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am.  They prohibit any ''noise disturbance'' and require sound levels to the less than 96&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Recreational Snowmobiles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate.  Numerous states and communities have ''objective'' controls; the most common maximum level is 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A). Federal law (36 CFR 2.18) regulates snowmobiles on federal property at 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A), so states and communities are free to regulate snowmobile sound levels on their property. Lincoln NE (Section 8.24.110) limits levels to 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A).	Maine (Section 13112, Chapter 937) exempts snowmobiles at sanctioned racing events.  Illinois (625 ILCS 40 Sec. 4-4)does also.

====Refuse Collection Vehicles====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective'' control. It can place a maximum sound level at a specific distance for the loudest operation.  It can set a curfew, or it can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 113.01) has a time limit that applies only within 200 feet of any residential building.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2900) considers any noise it a noise disturbance if the activity occurs between 8pm to 8am.  Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.6) considers it a noise disturbance if the activities occur between 10 pm to 7 am and closer than 800 feet from a dwelling.   Atlanta, GA (Section 74-137(a)(5)prohibits collection between 9pm and am on a weekend day or legal holiday, except by permit. In Maryland, refuse collection is exempt during daytime hours and must meet maximum land use levels [55&amp;nbsp;dB(A)] in residential zones at  night.

====Standing Motor Vehicles====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It sets a time limit on engine activity. It can also place a curfew on any engine activity. e. In Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.10(xi)) it is considered a ''noise disturbance'' if the operation lasts more than 15 minutes.  Dallas, TX (Section 30-3.1) applies the code to vehicles over 14,000 GVWR; they must be more than 300 feet from a residential zone and there is a 10-minute maximum.  They also provide a list of idling vehicles that are exempt from prosecution such as buses or active concrete trucks.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.10) limits operation to 3 minutes in an hour for vehicles over 14,000 GVWR in either public or private property. It exempts buses and taxis. Massachusetts allows idling no more than 5 minutes.

==Building codes==
In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals and hotels, many U.S. states and cities have stringent [[building code]]s with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants from exterior noise sources and sound generated within the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Noise Control Manual for Residential Buildings |last=Harris |first=David A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-026942-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design.

The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 [[decibel|dB]]).  The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: [[insulated glazing|glazing]] (glass thickness, double pane design, etc.), roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports and mounting of through the wall air conditioners.  A special case of building skin design arises in the case of [[aircraft noise]], where the FAA has funded extensive work in residential retrofit.

Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission. First, airborne sound travels through walls or floor/ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems.  Human activities might include voice, amplified sound systems or  animal noise.  Mechanical systems are elevator systems, [[boiler]]s, [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] systems, [[Electrical generator|generator]]s and trash compactors.  Since many of these sounds are inherently loud, the principle of regulation is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards (typically Sound Transmission Class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.

The second type of interior sound is called [[Impact insulation class|Impact Insulation Class]] (IIC) transmission.  This effect arises not from airborne transmission, but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself.  The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above.  This type of noise is somewhat more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on resilient channel.  Commonly a performance standard of IIC equal to 50 is specified in building codes.  California has generally led the U.S. in widespread application of building code requirements for sound transmission; accordingly, the level of protection for building occupants has increased markedly in the last several decades.

==U.S. occupational safety regulations==
The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established maximum noise levels for occupational exposure, beyond which mitigation measures or [[personal protective equipment]] is required.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Washington, D.C. [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 "Occupational noise exposure."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|29|1910|95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polarvortexjan211985.jpg|thumb|250px|Low pressure area over [[Quebec]] and [[Maine]], part of the northern polar vortex weakening, on the record-setting cold morning of January 21, 1985]]

A '''polar vortex''' is an upper level [[low-pressure area]] lying near the Earth's poles. There are two polar vortices in the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere, overlying the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s. Each polar vortex is a persistent, [[synoptic scale|large-scale]], low pressure zone that rotates counter-clockwise at the North Pole (called a [[cyclone]]), and clockwise at the South Pole, i.e. both polar vortices rotate eastward around the poles. The bases of the two polar vortices are located in the middle and upper [[troposphere]] and extend into the [[stratosphere]]. Beneath that lies a large mass of cold, dense arctic air. The vortices weaken and strengthen from year to year. When the vortex of the arctic is strong, it is well defined, there is a single vortex, and the arctic air is well contained; when weaker, which it generally is, it will break into two or more vortices; when very weak, the flow of arctic air becomes more disorganized and masses of cold arctic air can push equatorward, bringing with it a rapid and sharp temperature drop. The interface between the cold dry air mass of the pole and the warm moist air mass further south defines the location of the polar front. The polar front is centered, roughly at 60° latitude. A polar vortex strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer due to its dependence on the temperature difference between the equator and the poles.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;Halldór Björnsson. {{cite web |url=http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324184958/http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html |archive-date=March 24, 2010 |title=Global circulation |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 2, 2016 |df= }}.

As with other cyclones, their rotation is driven by the [[Coriolis effect]].

When the polar vortex is strong, there is a single vortex with a jet stream that is "well constrained" near the polar front. When the northern vortex weakens, it separates into two or more vortices, the strongest of which are near [[Baffin Island]], Canada and the other over northeast [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="glossvortex"&gt;{{cite web |website=Glossary of Meteorology |date=June 2000 |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Polar_vortex |title=Polar vortex |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |accessdate=15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antarctic]] vortex of the Southern Hemisphere is a single low pressure zone that is found near the edge of the [[Ross ice shelf]] near 160 west longitude. When the polar vortex is strong, the mid-latitude [[Westerlies]] (winds at the surface level between 30° and 60° latitude from the west) increase in strength and are persistent. When the polar vortex is weak, high pressure zones of the mid latitudes may push poleward, moving the polar vortex, [[jet stream]], and polar front equatorward. The jet stream is seen to "buckle" and deviate south. This rapidly brings cold dry air into contact with the warm, moist air of the mid latitudes, resulting in a rapid and dramatic change of weather known as a "[[cold snap]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Stratospheric Polar Vortex Influences Winter Cold, Researchers Say |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |date=December 3, 2001 |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-12/uoia-spv120301.php|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon was mentioned frequently in the news and weather media in the [[Early 2014 North American cold wave|cold North American winter of 2013–2014]], popularizing the term as an explanation of very cold temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.quarkexpeditions.com/polar-vortex-the-science-myth-media-hype-behind-north-american-weather-phenomenon{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{self-published inline|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polarvortexwinter.jpg|thumb|Polar vortex and weather impacts due to stratospheric warming]]
Polar vortices are weakest during summer and strongest during winter. [[Extratropical cyclone]]s that migrate into higher latitudes when the polar vortex is weak can disrupt the single vortex creating smaller vortices ([[cold-core low]]s) within the polar air mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tBa1DWYoDIC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=arctic+front+formation+weather+book#v=onepage&amp;q=arctic%20front%20formation%20weather%20book&amp;f=false|page=174|title=Polar lows: mesoscale weather systems in the polar regions|author=Erik A.

When the Arctic vortex is at its strongest, there is a single vortex, but normally, the Arctic vortex is elongated in shape, with two cyclone centers, one over Baffin Island in [[Canada]] and the other over northeast [[Siberian High|Siberia]]. When the Arctic pattern is at its weakest, subtropic air masses can intrude poleward causing the Arctic air masses to move equatorward, as during the [[Winter 1985 Arctic outbreak]].&lt;ref name="roanoke"&gt;Kevin Myatt (2005-01-17).

''[[Roanoke Times]]''. Retrieved on 2012-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antarctic]] polar vortex is more pronounced and persistent than the [[Arctic]] one. In the Arctic the distribution of land masses at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere gives rise to [[Rossby wave]]s which contribute to the breakdown of the polar vortex, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere the vortex is less disturbed. The breakdown of the polar vortex is an extreme event known as a [[sudden stratospheric warming]], here the vortex completely breaks down and an associated warming of 30–50&amp;nbsp;°C (54–90&amp;nbsp;°F) over a few days can occur.

The waxing and waning of the polar vortex is driven by the movement of mass and the transfer of heat in the polar region. In the autumn, the [[wikt:Special:Search/circumpolar|circumpolar]] winds increase in speed and the polar vortex rises into the [[stratosphere]]. The result is that the polar air forms a coherent rotating air mass: the polar vortex. As winter approaches, the vortex core cools, the winds decrease, and the vortex energy declines. Once late winter and early spring approach the vortex is at its weakest. As a result, during late winter, large fragments of the vortex air can be diverted into lower latitudes by stronger weather systems intruding from those latitudes. In the lowest level of the stratosphere, strong [[potential vorticity]] gradients remain, and the majority of that air remains confined within the polar air mass into December in the Southern Hemisphere and April in the Northern Hemisphere, well after the breakup of the vortex in the mid-stratosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nash |first1=E |last2=Newman |first2=P |last3=Rosenfield |first3=J |last4=Schoeberl |first4=M |year=2012 |title=An objective determination of the polar vortex using Ertel's potential vorticity |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=101 |issue=D5 |pages=9471–9478 |doi=10.1029/96JD00066 |accessdate= |bibcode = 1996JGR...101.9471N |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakup of the northern polar vortex occurs between mid March to mid May. This event signifies the transition from winter to spring, and has impacts on the [[hydrological cycle]], growing seasons of vegetation, and overall ecosystem productivity. The timing of the transition also influences changes in sea ice, ozone, air temperature, and cloudiness. Early and late polar breakup episodes have occurred, due to variations in the stratospheric flow structure and upward spreading of planetary waves from the troposphere.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} As a result of increased waves into the vortex, the vortex experiences more rapid warming than normal, resulting in an earlier breakup and spring. When the breakup comes early, it is characterized by {{Clarify|reason = by what?|date=November 2018}} with persistent of remnants of the vortex. When the breakup is late, the remnants dissipate rapidly. When the breakup is early, there is one warming period from late February to middle March. When the breakup is late, there are two warming periods, one January, and one in March. Zonal mean temperature, wind, and [[geopotential]] height exert varying deviations from their normal values before and after early breakups, while the deviations remain constant before and after late breakups. Scientists are connecting a delay in the Arctic vortex breakup with a reduction of planetary wave activities, few stratospheric sudden warming events, and depletion of ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=L |last2=Li |first2=C |last3=Pan |first3=Y |date=2012 |title=On the differences and climate impacts of early and late stratospheric polar vortex breakup |journal=Advances in Atmospheric Sciences |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=1119–1128 |doi=10.1007/s00376-012-1012-4|accessdate=|bibcode = 2012AdAtS..29.1119L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wei |first1=K |last2=Chen |first2=W |last3=Huang |first3=R |date=2007 |title=Dynamical diagnosis of the breakup of the stratospheric polar vortex in the northern hemisphere| journal=Science in China Series D (Earth Sciences) |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=1369–1379 |doi=10.1007/s11430-007-0100-2 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2016}}

Since all other oceans depend on the Atlantic Ocean's movement of heat energy, climates across the planet can be dramatically affected. The weakening or strengthening of the polar vortex can alter the sea circulation more than a mile beneath the waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reichler |first1=Tom |last2=Kim |first2=J |last3=Manzini |first3=E |last4=Kroger |first4=J |year=2012 |title=A stratospheric connection to Atlantic climate variability |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=783–787 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1586 |accessdate=|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..783R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strengthening storm systems within the troposphere that cool the poles, intensify the polar vortex.

The degree of the mixing of polar and mid-latitude air depends on the evolution and position of the [[polar night jet]]. In general, the mixing is less inside the vortex than outside. Mixing occurs with unstable planetary waves that are characteristic of the middle and upper stratosphere in winter. Prior to vortex breakdown, there is little transport of air out of the Arctic Polar Vortex due to strong barriers above 420&amp;nbsp;km (261 miles). The polar night jet which exists below this, is weak in the early winter. As a result, it does not deviate any descending polar air, which then mixes with air in the mid-latitudes. In the late winter, air parcels do not descend as much, reducing mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manney |first1=G |last2=Zurek |first2=R |last3=O'Neill |first3=A |last4=Swinbank |first4=R |year=1994 |title=On the motion of air through the stratospheric polar vortex |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1994)051&lt;2973:otmoat&gt;2.0.co;2 |volume =  51 |issue =20 | pages= 2973–2994 |bibcode = 1994JAtS...51.2973M }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the vortex is broken up, the ex-vortex air is dispersed into the middle latitudes within a month.&lt;ref name=JGR2012/&gt;

Sometimes, a mass of the polar vortex breaks off before the end of the final warming period. If large enough, the piece can move into Canada and the Midwestern, Central, Southern, and Northeastern United States. This diversion of the polar vortex can occur due to the displacement of the polar jet stream; for example, the significant northwestward direction of the polar jet stream in the western part of the United States during the winters of 2013–2014, and 2014–2015.

The general assumption is that reduced snow cover and sea ice reflect less sunlight and therefore evaporation and transpiration increases, which in turn alters the pressure and temperature gradient of the polar vortex, causing it to weaken or collapse. This becomes apparent when the jet stream amplitude increases ([[meanders]]) over the northern hemisphere, causing [[Rossby waves]] to propagate farther to the south or north, which in turn transports warmer air to the north pole and polar air into lower latitudes. The jet stream amplitude increases with a weaker polar vortex, hence increases the chance for weather systems to become blocked. A recent blocking event emerged when a high-pressure over Greenland steered [[Hurricane Sandy]] into the northern [[Mid-Atlantic states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Friedlander |first=Blaine |date=March 4, 2013 |title=Arctic ice loss amplified Superstorm Sandy violence |website=Cornell Chronicle |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/03/arctic-ice-loss-amplified-superstorm-sandy-violence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sea level equation''' (SLE) is the linear, integral equation that describes the sea-level variations associated with the [[Post-glacial rebound|Glacial Isostatic Adjustement]] (GIA).

The basic idea of the SLE dates back to 1888, when Woodward published his pioneering work on the form and position of mean [[sea level]],&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, R. S., 1888. On the form and position of mean sea level. United States Geol. Survey Bull., 48, 87170.&lt;/ref&gt; and only later has been refined by Platzman &lt;ref name="Platzman"&gt;Platzman , G. W., 1971. Ocean tides. In Lectures in Applied Mathematics, 14, part 2, pp. 239292, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI.&lt;/ref&gt; and Farrell &lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;Farrell, W. E., 1973. Earth tides, ocean tides and tidal loading. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A, 274, 253259.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of the study of the ocean tides. In the words of Wu and Peltier,&lt;ref name="Wu-Peltier"&gt;Wu, P., and W. R. Peltier. Glacial isostatic adjustment and the free–air gravity anomaly as a constraint on deep mantle viscosity. Geophys. J. R. Astron. Soc., 74, 377449, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; the solution of the SLE yields the space– and time–dependent change of ocean [[bathymetry]] which is required to keep the [[geoid|gravitational potential of the sea surface]] constant for a specific [[deglaciation]] chronology and [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] earth model. The SLE theory was then developed by other authors as Mitrovica &amp; Peltier,&lt;ref name="Mitrovica-Peltier"&gt;Mitrovica, J. X. &amp; Peltier, W. R., 1991. On postglacial geoid subsidence over the equatorial ocean. J. geophys. Res., 96, 20,05320,071.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitrovica et al.&lt;ref name="Mitrovica-etal"&gt;Mitrovica, J. X., Davis, J. L. &amp; Shapiro, I. I., 1994. A spectral formal- ism for computing three–dimensional deformations due to surface loads. J. geophys. Res., 99, 70577073.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spada &amp; Stocchi.&lt;ref name="Spada-Stocchi"&gt;Spada G. &amp; Stocchi, P., 2006. The Sea Level Equation, Theory and Numerical Examples. {{ISBN|88-548-0384-7}}, 96 pp., [[Aracne (publisher)|Aracne]], Roma.&lt;/ref&gt; In its simplest form, the SLE reads 

:&lt;math&gt; S=N-U, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  is the sea–level change, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the sea surface variation as seen from Earth's center of mass, and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is vertical displacement. 

In a more explicit form the SLE can be written as follow:

: &lt;math&gt;S (\theta, \lambda, t) = \frac{\rho_i}{\gamma}  G_s \otimes_i I + \frac{\rho_w}{\gamma} G_s \otimes_o S + S^E - \frac{\rho_i}{\gamma}\overline{G_s \otimes_i I } - \frac{\rho_w}{\gamma}\overline{G_o \otimes_o S }, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is [[colatitude]] and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is [[longitude]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_w&lt;/math&gt; are the densities of ice and water, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the reference surface gravity, &lt;math&gt;G_s=G_s(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; is the sea–level Green’s function (dependent upon the  &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; viscoelastic load–deformation coefficients - LDCs), &lt;math&gt; I= I(\theta, \lambda, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the ice thickness variation, &lt;math&gt;S^E=S^E(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[eustatic]] term (i.e. the ocean–averaged value of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;),   &lt;math&gt;\otimes_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\otimes_o&lt;/math&gt; denote spatio-temporal convolutions over the ice- and ocean-covered regions, and the overbar indicates an average over the surface of the oceans that ensures mass conservation.

The '''Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary''' is an area of 50 million square kilometres surrounding the continent of [[Antarctica]] where the [[International Whaling Commission|International Whaling Commission (IWC)]] has banned all types of commercial [[whaling]]. To date, the IWC has designated two such sanctuaries, the other being the [[Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary]].

==Area==
The northern boundary of the sanctuary follows the 40°S parallel of [[latitude]] except in the Indian Ocean sector where it joins the southern boundary of the Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary at 55°S, and around South America and into the South Pacific where the boundary is at 60°S.

==History==
The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was established by the IWC in 1994 with 23 countries supporting the agreement and [[Japan]] opposing it.&lt;ref name=establishment&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=226911 |title=Lee condemns latest Japanese whaling venture |date=6 November 2001 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of the Southern Ocean Sanctuary is reviewed and open to change by the IWC every 10 years.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/conservation/sanctuaries.htm#sanctuaries |accessdate=7 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518044428/http://www.iwcoffice.org/conservation/sanctuaries.htm |archivedate=18 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2004 meeting a proposal was made by Japan to remove the sanctuary, but it failed to reach the 75% majority required (it received 25 votes in favour and 30 votes against with two abstentions).

==Controversy and enforcement==
While commercial whaling is prohibited in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, Japan's [[Institute of Cetacean Research]] (ICR) has continued to hunt whales inside the Sanctuary in accordance with a provision in the IWC charter permitting whaling for the purposes of [[scientific research]].&lt;ref name=IRCclaims&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrwhale.org/QandAjapanresearch.htm |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602142349/http://www.icrwhale.org/QandAjapanresearch.htm |archivedate=2 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan clarified its position on whaling in a number of forums, noting that while some whale species are threatened, many such as minke whale are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydney.au.emb-japan.go.jp/english/top/important_info/japanese_governments_position.htm |title=Japanese Government’s position |publisher=Sydney.au.emb-japan.go.jp |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservation groups such as the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] claim Japan's whaling operations are conducted in violation of the IWC charter, arguing that Japan's self-imposed annual quota of 1000 whale kills for research is not really scientific activity, but rather a veil to cover commercial fishing operations as [[whale meat]] ends up being sold in Japanese markets.&lt;ref name=SeaShepherdclaims&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv/whale-wars/japanese-whalers/japan-sell-whaling-meat.html |title=Whale Wars : Why does Japan sell meat from research whaling?: Animal Planet |publisher=Animal.discovery.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter to the Japanese government, published in 2002 in the [[New York Times]] and sponsored by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund (WWF)]], 21 scientists declared that they "believe Japan's whale 'research' program fails to meet minimum standards for credible [[science]]". They were "concerned that Japan's whaling program is not designed to answer scientific questions relevant to the management of whales; that Japan refuses to make the information it collects available for independent review; and that its research program lacks  testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] or other performance indicators consistent with accepted scientific standards". They accused Japan of "using the [[pretext|pretense]] of scientific research to evade its commitments to the world community".&lt;ref name=nytletter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baleinesendirect.net/pdf/whaling-letter_to_NY_Times.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819151058/http://www.baleinesendirect.net/pdf/whaling-letter_to_NY_Times.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian delegation to the IWC has argued to repeal the provision that allows nations to harvest whales for scientific research, to no effect.

Japan, meanwhile, lodged a formal objection to the sanctuary with regard to [[minke whales]], meaning that the terms of the sanctuary do not apply to its harvest of that species within the boundaries of the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=Japaneseobjection&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/commission/schedule.htm |accessdate=7 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703211318/http://www.iwcoffice.org/commission/schedule.htm |archivedate=3 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Claiming the Japanese whaling fleet's actions to be illegal, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society acts against Japanese whaling ships engaged in yearly hunts, attempting to interrupt or cut short the whaling activities.&lt;ref name=SeaShepherdintervention&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-100103-1.html |title=Sea Shepherd Turns the Tables on the Whalers - Sea Shepherd Conservation Society |publisher=Seashepherd.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICR considers the activists' methods as constituting piracy, terrorism, and illegal harassment of the ICR fleet.&lt;ref name=ICRreaction&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrwhale.org/gpandsea.htm |title=ICR : Harassment &amp; terrorism |publisher=Icrwhale.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017160228/http://www.icrwhale.org/gpandsea.htm |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Critics of the ICR point out that recent scientific advances allow for the use of non-lethal techniques in cetacean research, such as biopsies or determination of cetatean dietary intake through analysis of DNA samples from whale feces.&lt;ref name=nonlethal&gt;[https://archive.is/20130218033127/http://www.goodplanet.info/eng/Contenu/Points-de-vues/Why-Japan-s-whaling-activities-are-not-research/(theme)/265] &lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010/2011 whaling season, the ICR was forced to halt its whaling operations due to the actions of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, having harvested 172 whales (a fifth of their season quota).  The ICR dispatched its whaling fleet as usual to the Northwest Pacific survey (JARPN II), with a quota for 260 whales, including 100 Minkes.&lt;ref name=quotapacificwhaling&gt;[https://archive.is/20120326201534/http://www.onlyagaijin.com/2011/06/japan-launches-another-pacific-research.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MAFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfa.maff.go.jp/j/press/enyou/110609.html |title=水産庁/「2011年度 第二期北西太平洋鯨類捕獲調査（沖合調査）」の開始について |publisher=Jfa.maff.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute over legality==
Japan has argued that the establishment of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was in contravention of the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]] (ICRW) on which the IWC is based and is therefore illegal.

This view received strong support from Professor W. T. Burke of the [[University of Washington]] in his paper circulated as IWC Document Number IWC/48/33. He refers to Article V(2) of the ICRW, which states that the creation of any sanctuary must "be based on scientific findings" and "take into consideration the interests of the consumers of whale products and the whaling industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/commission/convention.htm#convention |title=Key Documents |publisher=Iwcoffice.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chairman's Report of the 47th Meeting. (IWC. 1995). pp.23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof Burke's interpretation is disputed by Prof Chris Wold of the Northwestern School of Law of Lewis &amp; Clark College, who argued that the IWC must maintain both the conservation and whaling industry objectives of the ICRW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wold|first=Chris|title=Legal Opinion on the Competence of the IWC to Include Humane Treatment and Human and Cetacean Health Concerns in the RMS|date=21 June 2000|url=https://www.lclark.edu/live/files/183|publisher=Lclark.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by Alexander Gillespie, Professor of Law at the University of Waikato, who reasoned in his 2006 book, Whaling Diplomacy, that phrases such as "best interests of the whaling industry" must now consider commercial non-consumptive use (such as whale watching).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gillespie|first=Alexander|title=Whaling Diplomacy: Defining Issues in International Environmental Law|place=Northampton MA|publisher=Edward Elgar Publications|year=2005|page=267|isbn=1-84542-107-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzJmAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=IWC+Document+Number+IWC/48/33&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eXaJ27Tv0M&amp;sig=iViGqk2AOOiydWLbjeKxFG58dG8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kvcKVM-9BIHbav-KgagD&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=IWC%20Document%20Number%20IWC%2F48%2F33&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there is no settlement procedure in the IWC for this type of dispute, Japan has asked the IWC to submit its case to a relevant legal body for analysis. This proposal was rejected by a majority of IWC members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highnorth.no/Library/Trade/CITES/ci-an-iw.htm |title=CITES and the IWC:The Fall of Conservation? |accessdate=2008-07-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812192739/http://www.highnorth.no/Library/Trade/CITES/ci-an-iw.htm |archivedate=12 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }} - Section 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Court of Justice (ICJ) proceedings===
On 31 May 2010, the Australian Government lodged formal proceedings against Japan in the [[International Court of Justice|International Court of Justice (ICJ)]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="ICJ-Complaint"&gt;{{cite web |title=Application Instituting Proceedings |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/15951.pdf |work=Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v Japan) |publisher=International Court of Justice |author=Commonwealth of Australia |location=[[The Hague]] |format=PDF |date=31 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024146/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/15951.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a joint ministerial statement, the government stated that it "has not taken this decision lightly."

On 5 January 2011, leaked US diplomatic cables revealed that the Australian legal challenge to Japanese whaling was heavily influenced by domestic political pressures and Australian government advisers were left deeply pessimistic about the prospects of success in the International Court. In its reports to Washington, the US Embassy reported that Australian government contacts were stating that the legal proceedings "... would be unlikely to stop the whale hunt entirely, but could well force modifications that would make it more difficult for the Japanese".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/doomed-whaling-fight-aimed-at-saving-labor-vote-20110104-19f52.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |first=Philip |last=Dorling |title='Doomed' whaling fight aimed at saving Labor vote |date=5 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian public overwhelmingly supports governmental efforts to stop Japanese whaling, even at risk of losing valuable trade relations.&lt;ref name="lowy.895"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lowyinstitute.org/Publication.asp?pid=895 |first=Fergus |last=Hanson |work=The Lowy Institute |title=Poll: An International Policy Publication |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2008-12-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208085017/http://www.lowyinstitute.org/Publication.asp?pid=895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand government lodged a "Declaration of Intervention" with the ICJ on 6 February 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Declaration of Intervention of New Zealand |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/17268.pdf |format=PDF |work=International Court of Justice |publisher=International Court of Justice |date=6 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611234615/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/17268.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it deemed Japan as ineligible for a Special Permit that would allow whaling on the basis of scientific research.&lt;ref name="Julia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Australia takes Japan to court on whaling – where to now? |url=http://theconversation.com/australia-takes-japan-to-court-on-whaling-where-to-now-13481 |work=The Conversation |publisher=The Conversation Media Group |first=Tony |last=Press |first2=Julia |last2=Jabour |date=17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the Australian government's 2010 application, a court case was heard at the ICJ. The hearing ran from 26 June 2013 until 6 July 2013. In its deposition to the ICJ, the Australian government has claimed that Japan "has breached and is continuing to breach" its obligations under the international convention, and further asserted that Japan has refused to accept International Whaling Commission (IWC) recommendations.  [[Solicitor-General of Australia]] [[Justin Gleeson]] appeared for Australia before the ICJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/whaling-disputes-final-phase-in-hague/story-fn3dxix6-1226670379718 |title=Barbs traded in Aust v Japan whaling case|work=The Australian|publisher=News Limited |first=Julian |last=Drape |date=26 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICJ's 16-judge bench received and then decided upon the case. Rothwell stated that the case "is a complex one which raises novel legal issues not previously considered by any international court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whales in court: Australia v Japan in The Hague |url=http://theconversation.com/whales-in-court-australia-v-japan-in-the-hague-15540  |newspaper=The Conversation Australia |date=27 June 2013 |first=Professor Donald R. |last=Rothwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Press, CEO of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre at the [[University of Tasmania]], Australia, provided weekly reports of the ICJ hearings for ''The Conversation Australia'' media publication. Following the second week, Press relayed that Japan articulated in certain terms its intentions in the Southern Ocean: "the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry",&lt;ref&gt;https://theconversation.com/whaling-in-the-antarctic-week-2-japan-responds-14490&lt;/ref&gt; further explaining that a whale must be killed to obtain certain types of information, such as the collection of ear plugs to estimate the age of a whale. During the second week, Professor Lars Walløe, of the [[University of Oslo]] and a former Norwegian Commissioner to the Whaling Commission was presented by Japan as its sole expert witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whaling in the Antarctic: Week 2 – Japan responds |url=http://theconversation.com/whaling-in-the-antarctic-week-2-japan-responds-14490 |newspaper=The Conversation Australia |date=5 July 2013 |first=Tony |last=Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the week beginning 8 July 2013, New Zealand delivered its intervention, in which it provided a history of the origin of the 1946 Whaling Convention and [[Attorney-General for Australia|Australian Attorney-General]] [[Mark Dreyfus]] affirmed that his nation had not "colluded" with New Zealand to launch the ICJ proceedings. Dreyfus concluded Australia's contribution by emphasising the friendship shared by Australia and Japan, and stated: "Australia respectfully requests the Court to bring Japan’s whaling program to an end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whaling in the Antarctic: New Zealand intervenes, Australia concludes |url=http://theconversation.com/whaling-in-the-antarctic-new-zealand-intervenes-australia-concludes-14491 |newspaper=The Conversation Australia |date=13 July 2013 |first=Tony |last=Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICJ hearing concluded on 16 July 2013. In Japan's final presentation Professor Payam Akhavan of Harvard University stated: "it would not be an exaggeration to say that Australia’s case now hangs by a thread".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whaling in the Antarctic: the case concludes |url=http://theconversation.com/whaling-in-the-antarctic-the-case-concludes-14493 |newspaper=The Conversation Australia |date=17 July 2013 |first=Tony |last=Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outcome====
On 31 March 2014 the ICJ ruled that Japan's JARPA II whaling program "can broadly be characterized as “scientific research”" but failed to comply with three provisions of the Schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. The Court ordered that "Japan revoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to kill, take or treat whales in relation to JARPA II, and refrain from granting any further permits under Article VIII, paragraph 1, of the Convention, in pursuance of that programme".&lt;ref name="outcome 2014"&gt;{{citation |contribution=The Court finds that Japan’s whaling programme in the Antarctic (JARPA II) is not in accordance with three provisions of the Schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling |title=Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v.

'''Space exploration''' is the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and [[exploration]] of [[Sky|celestial]] structures in [[outer space]] by means of evolving and growing [[space technology]]. While the study of space is carried out mainly by [[astronomer]]s with [[telescope]]s, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by [[unmanned robotic space probes]] and [[human spaceflight]].

While the observation of objects in space, known as [[astronomy]], predates reliable [[recorded history]], it was the development of large and relatively efficient [[rocket]]s during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150828"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roston |first=Michael |title=NASA’s Next Horizon in Space |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/25/science/space/nasa-next-mission.html |date=28 August 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the [[Cold War]]. The early era of space exploration was driven by a "[[Space Race]]" between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit [[Earth]], the Soviet Union's [[Sputnik 1]], on 4 October 1957, and the first [[Moon landing]] by the American [[Apollo 11]] mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet Space Program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first [[human spaceflight]] ([[Yuri Gagarin]] aboard ''[[Vostok 1]]'') in 1961, the first [[spacewalk]] (by [[Aleksei Leonov]]) on 18 March 1965, the [[Luna 9|first automatic landing]] on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first [[space station]] (''[[Salyut 1]]'') in 1971.
After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the [[Space Shuttle program]], and from competition to cooperation as with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).

With the substantial completion of the ISS&lt;ref name="space-11078"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/11078-space-station-complete.html |title=After 13 Years, International Space Station Has All Its NASA Rooms |first=Denise |last=Chow |publisher=SPACE.com |date=9 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[STS-133]] in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux.

The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the [[International Space Station|ISS]] beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from [[NASA]] to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as [[Lagrangian point|Earth–Moon L1]], the Moon, [[Lagrangian point|Earth–Sun L2]], near-Earth asteroids, and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] or Mars orbit.&lt;ref name="obama"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/about/obamaspeechfeature_prt.htm |work=Address at KSC |date=15 April 2010 |title=President Outlines Exploration Goals, Promise }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the People's Republic of China initiated a [[Chinese space program|successful manned spaceflight program]], while the [[European Union]], Japan, and [[India]] have also planned future crewed space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and India have advocated crewed missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated [[Aurora programme|manned missions to both the Moon and Mars]] during the 20th and 21st century.

From the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting [[space tourism]] and then public space exploration of the Moon (see [[Google Lunar X Prize]]).

The highest known projectiles prior to the rockets of the 1940s were the shells of the [[Paris Gun]], a type of German long-range [[siege gun]], which reached at least 40 kilometers altitude during [[World War One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/parisgun.htm|title=Paris Gun|work=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111000000/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/parisgun.htm|archivedate=11 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps towards putting a human-made object into space were taken by German scientists during [[World War II]] while testing the [[V-2]] rocket, which became the first human-made object in space on 3 October 1942 with the launching of the [[Aggregate series#A4 (V-2 rocket)|A-4]]. After the war, the U.S. [[Operation Paperclip|used German scientists]] and their captured rockets in programs for both military and civilian research. The first scientific exploration from space was the cosmic radiation experiment launched by the U.S. on a V-2 rocket on 10 May 1946.&lt;ref name="pv2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postwarv2.com/usa/ws/uars/uars03.html |title=Upper Air Rocket Summary V-2 NO. 3 |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first images of Earth taken from space followed the same year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.airspacemag.com/images/1stPhotoFromSpace.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221145846/http://media.airspacemag.com/images/1stPhotoFromSpace.jpg |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="army"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/WSHist/Pages/ChronologyCowboystoV2stotheSpaceShuttletolasers.aspx |title=Chronology: Cowboys to V-2s to the Space Shuttle to lasers |publisher=wsmr.army.mil |accessdate=27 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[animals in space|first animal experiment]] saw fruit flies lifted into space in 1947, both also on modified V-2s launched by Americans. Starting in 1947, the Soviets, also with the help of German teams, launched sub-orbital V-2 rockets and their own variant, the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]], including radiation and animal experiments on some flights. These [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] experiments only allowed a very short time in space which limited their usefulness.

=== First orbital flights ===

[[File:Sputnik asm.jpg|thumb|''[[Sputnik 1]]'', the first artificial [[satellite]] orbited Earth at {{convert|939|to|215|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1957, and was soon followed by ''[[Sputnik 2]]''. See [[Satellite#First satellites of countries|First satellite by country]] (Replica Pictured) ]]

The first successful orbital launch was of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] uncrewed ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' ("Satellite 1") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about {{convert|83|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40&amp;nbsp;MHz), which emitted "beeps" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a [[meteoroid]]. ''Sputnik 1'' was launched by an [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958.

The second one was ''[[Sputnik 2]]''. Launched by the USSR on November 3, 1957, it carried the dog [[Laika]], who became the first animal in orbit.

This success led to an escalation of the American [[space program]], which unsuccessfully attempted to launch [[Vanguard TV3|a Vanguard satellite]] into orbit two months later. On 31 January 1958, the U.S. successfully orbited ''[[Explorer 1]]'' on a Juno rocket.

=== First human flights ===
The first successful human spaceflight was ''[[Vostok 1]]'' ("East 1"), carrying 27-year-old Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced [[Soviet space program]] and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: [[human spaceflight]].

The U.S. first launched a person into space within a month of ''[[Vostok 1]]'' with [[Alan Shepard]]'s suborbital flight on [[Mercury-Redstone 3|Freedom 7]]. Orbital flight was achieved by the United States when [[John Glenn]]'s [[Mercury-Atlas 6|Friendship 7]] orbited Earth on 20 February 1962.

[[Valentina Tereshkova]], the first woman in space, orbited Earth 48 times aboard ''[[Vostok 6]]'' on 16 June 1963.

China first launched a person into space 42 years after the launch of ''Vostok 1'', on 15 October 2003, with the flight of [[Yang Liwei]] aboard the ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' (Divine Vessel 5) spacecraft.

=== First planetary explorations ===
The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was [[Luna 2]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="jpl-luna2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=Luna_02 |title=NASA on Luna 2 mission |publisher=Sse.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331155310/http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=Luna_02 |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first automatic landing on another celestial body was performed by [[Luna 9]]&lt;ref name="jpl.luna9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=Luna_09 |title=NASA on Luna 9 mission |publisher=Sse.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331155324/http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=Luna_09 |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966. [[Luna 10]] became the first artificial satellite of the Moon.&lt;ref name="jpl-luna10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=Luna_10 |title=NASA on Luna 10 mission |publisher=Sse.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218232128/http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=Luna_10 |archivedate=18 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by [[Apollo 11]] on 20 July 1969.

The first successful interplanetary flyby was the 1962 [[Mariner 2]] flyby of [[Venus]] (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for [[Mars]] by [[Mariner 4]], 1973 for [[Jupiter]] by ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', 1974 for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] by [[Mariner 10]], 1979 for [[Saturn]] by ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', 1986 for [[Uranus]] by ''[[Voyager 2]]'', 1989 for [[Neptune]] by ''[[Voyager 2]]''. In 2015, the [[dwarf planet]]s [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] and [[Pluto]] were orbited by ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' and passed by ''[[New Horizons]]'', respectively.

The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of [[Venera 7]] on Venus which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes. In 1975 the [[Venera 9]] was the first to return images from the surface of another planet. In 1971 the [[Mars 3]] mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by [[Viking 1]] from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by [[Venera 13]] in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission.

=== Key people in early space exploration ===
The dream of stepping into the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere was driven by the fiction of Peter Francis Geraci&lt;ref name="russsw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/tsiolkovsky_bio.html |title=Tsiolkovsky biography |publisher=Russianspaceweb.com |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510054840/http://russianspaceweb.com/tsiolkovsky_bio.html |archivedate=10 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oberth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/SPACEFLIGHT/oberth/SP2.htm |title=Herman Oberth |publisher=centennialofflight.net |date=29 December 1989 |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa-vbbio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/bio.html |title=Von Braun |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[H. G. Wells]],&lt;ref name="genesis-goddard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/people/biographies/goddard.pdf |title=Goddard Biography |format=PDF |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and rocket technology was developed to try to realize this vision. The German [[V-2]] was the first rocket to travel into space, overcoming the problems of thrust and material failure. During the final days of World War II this technology was obtained by both the Americans and Soviets as were its designers. The initial driving force for further development of the technology was a weapons race for intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBM]]s) to be used as long-range carriers for fast [[nuclear weapon]] delivery, but in 1961 when the [[Soviet Union]] launched the first man into space, the United States declared itself to be in a "[[Space Race]]" with the Soviets.

'''[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], [[Robert Goddard]], [[Hermann Oberth]]''', and '''[[Reinhold Tiling]]''' laid the groundwork of rocketry in the early years of the 20th century.

'''[[Wernher von Braun]]''' was the lead rocket engineer for [[Nazi]] Germany's World War II [[V-2]] rocket project. In the last days of the war he led a caravan of workers in the German rocket program to the American lines, where they surrendered and were brought to the United States to work on their rocket development ("[[Operation Paperclip]]"). He acquired American citizenship and led the team that developed and launched ''[[Explorer 1]]'', the first American satellite. Von Braun later led the team at [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] which developed the [[Saturn V]] moon rocket.

Initially the race for space was often led by '''[[Sergei Korolev]]''', whose legacy includes both the [[R-7 Semyorka|R7]] and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]]—which remain in service to this day. Korolev was the mastermind behind the first satellite, first man (and first woman) in orbit and first spacewalk. Until his death his identity was a closely guarded state secret; not even his mother knew that he was responsible for creating the Soviet space program.

'''[[Kerim Kerimov]]''' was one of the founders of the [[Soviet space program]] and was one of the lead architects behind the first [[human spaceflight]] (''[[Vostok 1]]'') alongside Sergey Korolyov. After Korolyov's death in 1966, Kerimov became the lead scientist of the Soviet space program and was responsible for the launch of the first [[space station]]s from 1971 to 1991, including the [[Salyut]] and [[Mir]] series, and their precursors in 1967, the [[Cosmos 186]] and [[Cosmos 188]].&lt;ref name="find"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bond |first=Peter |publication-date=7 April 2003 |title=Obituary: Lt-Gen Kerim Kerimov |periodical=The Independent |publication-place=London |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030407/ai_n12692130 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108073958/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030407/ai_n12692130 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="az-1995"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Blair |last=Betty |year=1995 |title=Behind Soviet Aeronauts |url= |journal=[[Azerbaijan International]] |volume=3 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other key people ====

*'''[[Valentin Glushko]]''' was Chief Engine Designer for the Soviet Union. Glushko designed many of the engines used on the early Soviet rockets, but was constantly at odds with Korolyov.
*'''[[Vasily Mishin]]''' was Chief Designer working under Sergey Korolyov and one of the first Soviets to inspect the captured German V-2 design. Following the death of Sergei Korolev, Mishin was held responsible for the Soviet failure to be first country to place a man on the Moon.
*'''[[Robert Gilruth]]''' was the [[NASA]] head of the Space Task Force and director of 25 crewed space flights. Gilruth was the person who suggested to [[John F. Kennedy]] that the Americans take the bold step of reaching the Moon in an attempt to reclaim space superiority from the Soviets.
*'''[[Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.]]''' was NASA's first [[flight controller|flight director]], who oversaw development of [[Mission Control]] and associated technologies and procedures.
*'''[[Maxime Faget]]''' was the designer of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule; he played a key role in designing the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] spacecraft, and contributed to the design of the [[Space Shuttle]].

==Targets of exploration==
===The Sun===
Although the [[Sun]] will probably not be physically explored at all, the study of the Sun has nevertheless been a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates most [[space weather]], which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. [[Parker Solar Probe]], launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/8th the orbit of Mercury.

==Mercury==
[[File:Mercury as Never Seen Before.jpg|thumb|left|125px|''[[MESSENGER]]'' image of Mercury (2013)]][[File:MESSENGER EN0108828359M.png|thumb|130x130px|A ''MESSENGER'' image from 18,000&amp;nbsp;km showing a region about 500&amp;nbsp;km across (2008)]][[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] remains the least explored of the [[Terrestrial planets]]. As of May 2013, the [[Mariner 10]] and ''[[MESSENGER]]'' missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. ''MESSENGER'' entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b).
A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025, [[BepiColombo]] is to include two [[space probe|probes]]. BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the [[European Space Agency]]. ''MESSENGER'' and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10's [[Gravitational slingshot|flybys]].

Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or [[delta-v]]. Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable.

==Venus==
[[File:Venus-real color.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Mariner 10]] image of Venus (1974)]]

{{Main|Observations and explorations of Venus}}
[[Venus]] was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first successful Venus flyby was the American [[Mariner 2]] spacecraft, which flew past Venus in 1962. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a [[Gravity assist|gravitational assist]] en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967 [[Venera 4]] became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, [[Venera 7]] became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter [[Venera 9]] some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using [[radar]] to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.

==Earth==

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|left|125px|''[[The Blue Marble]]'' Earth picture taken during [[Apollo 17]] (1972)]]

{{Main|Earth observation satellite}}
Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object in its own right. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference.

For example, the existence of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, ''[[Explorer 1]]''. These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000&amp;nbsp;km impractical.
Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the [[Ozone depletion|hole in the ozone layer]] was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify.

===The Moon===
[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|thumb|The [[Moon]] (2010)|left|130x130px]]{{Main|Exploration of the Moon}}
[[File:Apollo 16 LM Orion.jpg|thumbnail|[[Apollo 16]] LEM Orion, the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] and astronaut [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] (1972)]]
The [[Moon]] was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans.

In 1959 the Soviets obtained the first images of the [[far side of the Moon]], never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the [[Ranger 4]] impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966 the Soviets successfully deployed a number of [[Lander (spacecraft)|landers]] to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, ''[[Surveyor 1]]'' marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod program]] in the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully [[Sample return mission|brought lunar soil samples to Earth]] for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters, and in 2008 the Indian [[Moon Impact Probe]].

Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the [[Apollo 8]] mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the [[Apollo 11]] mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long, however. The [[Apollo 17]] mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit there, and the next, [[Exploration Mission 2]], is due to orbit the Moon in 2023. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously.

==Mars==
[[File:Mars 23 aug 2003 hubble.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Mars, as seen by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (2003)]]

[[File:Spirit rover tracks.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Surface of Mars by the [[Mars Exploration Rover|''Spirit'' rover]] (2004)]]
{{Main|Exploration of Mars}}
The exploration of [[Mars]] has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of [[robotic spacecraft]], including [[orbiter]]s, [[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]]s, and [[rover (space exploration)|rover]]s, have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth.

The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of ''The Great Galactic Ghoul''&lt;ref name="space-232"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dinerman |first=Taylor |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/232/1 |title=Is the Great Galactic Ghoul losing his appetite? |work=The space review |date=27 September 2004 |accessdate=27 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which subsists on a diet of Mars probes.

==Jupiter==
[[File:Jupiter and its shrunken Great Red Spot.jpg|thumb|Jupiter, as seen by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (2014).|left|125x125px]]{{Main|Exploration of Jupiter}}The exploration of [[Jupiter]] has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been "flybys", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] programs. The ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' and ''[[Juno spacecraft|Juno]]'' spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded.

Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref name="delta-v"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wong |first=Al |date=28 May 1998 |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/faqnav.html |title=Galileo FAQ: Navigation |publisher=NASA |accessdate=28 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is comparable to the 9.7&amp;nbsp;km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.&lt;ref name="pma-delta"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirata |first=Chris |url=http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |title=Delta-V in the Solar System |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=28 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715015836/http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |archivedate=15 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, [[Gravitational slingshot|gravity assists]] through [[planetary flyby]]s can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.&lt;ref name="delta-v" /&gt;

Jupiter has 79 [[Moons of Jupiter|known moons]], many of which have relatively little known information about them.

==Saturn==
[[File:Ringworld Waiting.jpg|thumb|A picture of Saturn taken by ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] (2004)''|left|180x180px]]
{{Main|Exploration of Saturn}}
[[File:Titan Saturn Moon.jpg|thumb|164x164px|A view beneath the clouds of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], as seen in false colour, created from a mosaic of images taken by ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' (2013)]]
[[Saturn]] has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission (''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'') planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', in 1980 by ''[[Voyager 1]]'', in 1982 by ''[[Voyager 2]]'' and an orbital mission by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017.

Saturn has at least 62 [[Moons of Saturn|known moons]], although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth.  Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the ''Huygens'' probe deployed by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft.

==[[Uranus]]==
[[File:Uranus.jpg|thumb|[[Uranus]] as imaged by ''[[Voyager 2]] (1986)''|left|125x125px]]
{{Main|Exploration of Uranus}}
The exploration of [[Uranus]] has been entirely through the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its [[axial tilt]] of 97.77°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. ''Voyager 2'' studied the planet's unique atmosphere and [[magnetosphere]]. ''Voyager 2'' also examined its [[Rings of Uranus|ring system]] and the [[moons of Uranus]] including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons.

Images of Uranus proved to have a very uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]] had been unusually geologically active.

==Neptune==
[[File:Neptune Full.jpg|thumb|left|125px|A picture of [[Neptune]] taken by ''[[Voyager 2]] (1989)'']]{{main|Exploration of Neptune}}[[File:Triton moon mosaic Voyager 2 (large).jpg|thumb|125px|[[Triton (moon)|Triton]] as imaged by ''[[Voyager 2]] (1989)'']]

The exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flyby, the sole visit to the system as of 2014. The possibility of a [[Neptune Orbiter]] has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought.

Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroras]], and even a conspicuous [[Great Dark Spot|anticyclone storm system]] rivaled in size only by Jupiter's small Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name="Suomi1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suomi |first=V.E. |last2=Limaye |first2=S.S. |last3=Johnson |first3=D.R. |title=High winds of Neptune: A possible mechanism |journal=Science |year=1991 |volume=251 |pages=929–932 |bibcode=1991Sci...251..929S  |doi=10.1126/science.251.4996.929 |pmid=17847386 |issue=4996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Voyager 2'' also examined Neptune's ring and moon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring "arcs" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, ''Voyager 2'' also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]], proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from ''Voyager 2'' supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], is a captured [[Kuiper belt]] object.&lt;ref name="Agnor06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Agnor |first=C.B. |last2=Hamilton |first2=D.P. |title=Neptune's capture of its moon Triton in a binary-planet gravitational encounter |journal=Nature |year=2006 |volume=441 |pages = 192–4 |doi=10.1038/nature04792 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7090/abs/nature04792.html |accessdate=10 May 2006 |pmid=16688170 |issue=7090 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..192A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other objects in the Solar System===
[[File:Nh-pluto-in-true-color 2x JPEG-edit-frame.jpg|left|thumb|125x125px|''[[New Horizons]]'' image of [[Pluto]] (2015)]]{{main|Pluto#Exploration}}[[File:Charon in Color (HQ).jpg|thumb|125px|''[[New Horizons]]'' image of [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] (2015)]]
The [[dwarf planet]] Pluto  presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit very difficult at present). ''[[Voyager 1]]'' could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. ''[[Voyager 2]]'' never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.&lt;ref name="jpl-faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/faq.html |title=Voyager Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=8 September 2006 |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=14 January 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050617/http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/faq.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluto continues to be of great interest, despite its reclassification as the lead and nearest member of a new and growing class of distant icy bodies of intermediate size (and also the first member of the important subclass, defined by orbit and known as "[[plutino]]s"). After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed ''[[New Horizons]]'' was granted funding from the United States government in 2003.&lt;ref name="s4p"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pluto mission gets green light at last |first=Robert |last=Roy Britt |work=space.com |url=http://www.space4peace.org/articles/plutomissiongetsok.htm |date=26 February 2003 |publisher=Space4Peace.org |accessdate=26 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Horizons'' was launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of a [[gravity assist]] from [[Jupiter]]. Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter.

====Asteroids and comets====
{{Main|Exploration of the asteroids|List of missions to comets}}
[[File:495296main epoxi-1-full full.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Comet [[103P/Hartley]] (2010)]]
[[File:Dawn-image-070911.jpg|thumb|125px|Asteroid [[4 Vesta]], imaged by the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]] (2011)]]
Until the advent of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the [[asteroid belt]] were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery.
Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', which flew past two: [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed by [[243 Ida]] in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to ''Galileo'''s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'' probe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object. The dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] and the asteroid [[4 Vesta]], two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]], launched in 2007.

Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the ''[[International Cometary Explorer]]'' conducted the first comet fly-by ([[21P/Giacobini-Zinner]]) before joining the [[Halley Armada]] studying the famous comet. The [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|''Deep Impact'' probe]] smashed into [[9P/Tempel]] to learn more about its structure and composition and the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|''Stardust'' mission]] returned samples of another comet's tail. The [[Philae (spacecraft)|''Philae'' lander]] successfully landed on [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko|Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] in 2014 as part of the broader [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' mission]].

''[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]]'' was an [[Robotic spacecraft|unmanned spacecraft]] developed by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] to [[Sample return mission|return a sample of material]] from the small near-Earth asteroid [[25143 Itokawa]] to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, ''Hayabusa'' studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010.

===Deep space exploration===
{{main|Deep space exploration}}
[[Image:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|This high-resolution image of the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] includes galaxies of various ages, sizes, shapes, and colors. The smallest, reddest galaxies, are some of the most distant galaxies to have been imaged by an optical telescope.]]

Deep space exploration is the branch of [[astronomy]], [[astronautics]] and [[space technology]] that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/education/space_ex/exploration.html |title=Space and its Exploration: How Space is Explored |work=NASA.gov |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702153058/http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/education/space_ex/exploration.html |archivedate=2 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical exploration of space is conducted both by [[human spaceflight]]s (deep-space astronautics) and by [[robotic spacecraft]].

Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include [[anti-matter]], [[nuclear power]] and [[beam-powered propulsion|beamed propulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/exploration/futurespaceflight/index.shtml |title=Future Spaceflight |work=BBC |accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes.&lt;ref name="Forward1996"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ad Astra! |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |first=Robert L |last=Forward |volume=49 |pages=23–32 |date=January 1996 |bibcode = 1996JBIS...49...23F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Globalize|section|date=September 2013}}
{{main|Future of space exploration}}
In the 2000s, several plans for space exploration were announced; both government entities and the private sector have space exploration objectives. China has announced plans to have a 60-ton multi-module space station in orbit by 2020.

The [[NASA Authorization Act of 2010]] provided a re-prioritized list of objectives for the American space program, as well as funding for the first priorities. NASA proposes to move forward with the development of the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), which will be designed to carry the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]], as well as important cargo, equipment, and science experiments to Earth's orbit and destinations beyond. Additionally, the SLS will serve as a back up for commercial and international partner transportation services to the International Space Station. The SLS rocket will incorporate technological investments from the Space Shuttle program and the Constellation program in order to take advantage of proven hardware and reduce development and operations costs. The first developmental flight is targeted for the end of 2017.&lt;ref name="nasa-sls1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/sls1.html/ |title=NASA Announces Design for New Deep Space Exploration System |work= |publisher=NASA |date=14 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921160159/http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/sls1.html |archivedate=21 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High level automated systems===
The idea of using high level automated systems for space missions has become a desirable goal to space agencies all around the world. Such systems are believed to yield benefits such as lower cost, less human oversight, and ability to explore deeper in space which is usually restricted by long communications with human controllers.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=98ac372f-074d-4ce4-9c53-5dcd6a91b385%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=asf&amp;AN=501525230 |title=Autonomy in Space: Current Capabilities and Future Challenges |work= |publisher= |date=Winter 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Autonomous system ====
Autonomy is defined by three requirements:&lt;ref name="ebscohost" /&gt;
# Being able to sense the world and their state, make decisions, and carry them out on their own
# Can interpret the given goal as a list of actions to take
# Fail flexibly

==== Benefits ====
Autonomous technologies would be able to perform beyond predetermined actions. They would analyze all possible states and events happening around them and come up with a safe response. In addition, such technologies can reduce launch cost and ground involvement. Performance would increase as well. Autonomy would be able to quickly respond upon encountering an unforeseen event, especially in deep space exploration where communication back to Earth would take too long.&lt;ref name="ebscohost" /&gt;

==== NASA's Autonomous Science Experiment ====
NASA began its autonomous science experiment (ASE) on Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) which is NASA's first satellite in the new millennium program Earth-observing series launched on 21 November 2000. The autonomy of ASE is capable of on-board science analysis, replanning, robust execution, and later the addition of model-based diagnostic. Images obtained by the EO-1 are analyzed on-board and downlinked when a change or an interesting event occur. The ASE software has successfully provided over 10,000 science images.&lt;ref name="ebscohost" /&gt;

===== Asteroids in space exploration =====
{{main|Exploration of the asteroids}}An article in science magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Binzel|first=Richard P.|date=2014-10-30|title=Human spaceflight: Find asteroids to get to Mars|url=http://www.nature.com/news/human-spaceflight-find-asteroids-to-get-to-mars-1.16216|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=514|issue=7524|pages=559–561|doi=10.1038/514559a|bibcode=2014Natur.514..559B}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, "a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit"; second,  "extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars"; and finally,  "developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them in times of greater risk to radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/110210-mars-trip-asteroids-taxi-cosmic-rays-hitchhikers-space-science/|title=Astronauts Could Ride Asteroids to Mars, Study Says|date=2011-02-10|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as [[NASA]] and [[Roscosmos]], is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as [[NASA spin-off]]s), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program.&lt;ref name="doi-1023"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1020207506064| year = 2002| last1 = Hertzfeld | first1 = H. R. | journal = The Journal of Technology Transfer| volume = 27| issue = 4| pages = 311|title=Measuring the Economic Returns from Successful NASA Life Sciences Technology Transfers}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate a lot of revenue.&lt;ref name="nature-2012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Elvis |first=Martin |title=Let's mine asteroids — for science and profit |year=2012 |work=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/news/let-s-mine-asteroids-for-science-and-profit-1.10733 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering.&lt;ref name="freakonomics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freakonomics.com/2008/01/11/is-space-exploration-worth-the-cost-a-freakonomics-quorum/ |title=Is Space Exploration Worth the Cost? A Freakonomics Quorum |work=Freakonomics |publisher=freakonomics.com |accessdate=27 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to mankind and that staying on Earth will lead to [[Human extinction|extinction]]. Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. [[Stephen Hawking]], renowned British theoretical physicist, said that "I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars."&lt;ref name="tele-20011016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/10/16/nhawk16.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Colonies in space may be only hope, says Hawking |date=15 October 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2007 |location=London |first=Roger |last=Highfield }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration.&lt;ref name="yt-EewrC22ysus"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EewrC22ysus |title=NASA "Reach" Public Service Announcement for Space Exploration |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to an [[Associated Press]] Poll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is "a good investment", compared to 21% who did not.&lt;ref name="poll-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pollingreport.com/space2.htm |publisher=Pollingreport.com |title=Origin of Human Life – USA Today/Gallup Poll |date=3 July 2007 |accessdate=25 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph ''Interplanetary Flight''.&lt;ref name="intro-ast"&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur C. |last=Clarke |title=Interplanetary Flight – An Introduction to Astronautics |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |location=New York |year=1950 |chapter=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death.

===Spaceflight===
{{Main|Spaceflight}}
''Spaceflight'' is the use of [[space technology]] to achieve the flight of [[spacecraft]] into and through outer space.

Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like [[space tourism]] and [[telecommunications satellite|satellite telecommunications]]. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include [[Space observatory|space observatories]], [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and other [[Earth observation satellite]]s.

A spaceflight typically begins with a [[rocket launch]], which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of [[gravity]] and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called [[astrodynamics]]. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during [[atmospheric reentry]], and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.

===Satellites===
{{Main|Satellite}}

Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. [[Space station]]s and human [[spacecraft]] in orbit are also satellites.

===Commercialization of space===
{{Main|Commercialization of space}}
Current examples of the commercial use of space include [[satellite navigation system]]s, satellite television and [[satellite radio]]. [[Space tourism]] is the recent phenomenon of [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] by individuals for the purpose of personal pleasure.

[[Private spaceflight|Private spaceflight companies]] such as [[SpaceX]] and [[Blue Origin]], and [[Orbital Technologies Commercial Space Station|commercial space station]]s such as the Axiom Space and the [[Bigelow Commercial Space Station]] have dramatically changed the landscape of space exploration, and will continue to do so in the near future.

===Alien life===

Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human [[Space habitat|habitation]] of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the [[Colonization of the Moon|Moon]] or [[Colonization of Mars|Mars]], using significant amounts of [[in-situ resource utilization]].

To date, the longest human occupation of space is the [[International Space Station]] which has been in continuous use for {{age in years and days|2000|11|02}}. [[Valeri Polyakov]]'s record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the [[Mir]] space station has not been surpassed. Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, and radiation exposure.

Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a "stepping stone" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006 NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024.&lt;ref name="nasa-164021"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Global Exploration Strategy and Lunar Architecture |publisher=NASA |date=4 December 2006 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/164021main_lunar_architecture.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=5 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614040311/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/164021main_lunar_architecture.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of [[private property]], the inability or difficulty in establishing [[property rights]] in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of [[space technology]] in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of [[Sovereign state|national]] [[Land claim|territorial claims]] in [[outer space]] and on [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] has been specifically proscribed by the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which had been, {{asof|2012|lc=y}}, ratified by all [[Spacefaring|spacefaring nations]].&lt;ref name="tna2012fall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simberg |first=Rand |title=Property Rights in Space |journal=The New Atlantis |date=Fall 2012 |issue=37 |pages=20–31 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/property-rights-in-space |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215001750/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/property-rights-in-space |archivedate=15 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Hutchins''' ([[Monmouth County, NJ]] 1730 – April 18, 1789, [[Pittsburgh]]) was an American military engineer, [[cartographer]], [[geographer]] and [[surveying|surveyor]]. In 1781, Hutchins was named Geographer of the United States. He is the only person to hold that post.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

==Biography==

Hutchins was born in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9588/ |title = A New Map of the Western Parts of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and North Carolina, 1778 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1778 |accessdate = 2013-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"When only sixteen years of age he went to the western country, and obtained an appointment as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the British Army."&lt;ref name="autogenerated267"&gt;The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography. NY: White &amp; Co. 1899. Volume IX, page 267.&lt;/ref&gt; "He joined the [[militia]] during the [[French and Indian War]]&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; and later took a regular commission with British forces. "...he fought in the French and Indian War (1754-1763). By late 1757, was commissioned a lieutenant in the colony of Pennsylvania, and a year later he was promoted to quartermaster in Colonel [[Hugh Mercer]]’s battalion and was stationed at [[Fort Duquesne]] near Pittsburgh."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid308hutchins.pdf "Thomas Hutchins Papers. Historical Society of Pennsylvania].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:A New Map of the Western Parts of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and North Carolina, 1778.png|thumb|"A New Map of the Western Parts of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and North Carolina, 1778" by Thomas Hutchins, engraved by T. Cheevers, published in 1778 in London.]]
"In 1763 General [[Henry Bouquet]], a British officer then in command at Philadelphia, was ordered to the relief of [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], now [[Pittsburgh]], and setting out with 500 men, mostly [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]], found the frontier settlements greatly alarmed on account of savage invasions. He has some fighting with the Indians along the way, but succeeded in reaching Fort Pitt with supplies, losing, however, eight officers and one hundred and fifteen men. Hutchins was present at this point, and distinguished himself as a soldier, while he laid out the plan of new fortifications, and afterwards executed it under the directions of General Bouquet."&lt;ref name="autogenerated267"/&gt;

In 1766, he started working for the British army as an [[engineer]].&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; That year, Hutchins joined [[George Croghan]], deputy Indian agent, and Captain [[Henry Gordon (engineer)|Henry Gordon]], chief engineer in the Western Department of North America, on an expedition down the [[Ohio River]] to survey territory acquired by the [[1763 Treaty of Paris]]. Hutchins worked in the Midwestern territories on land and river surveys for several years until he was transferred to the Southern Department of North America in 1772. He spent about five years working on survey projects in the western part of [[Florida]]. During this time he also occasionally traveled north, often to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His advancements in the fields of [[topography]] and geography led him to be elected a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in the spring of 1772.

In 1774, he participated in a survey of the [[Mississippi river]] from [[Manchac]] to the [[Yazoo River]]. This was a mapping expedition led by [[George Gauld (surveyor)|George Gauld]], with Dr. [[John Lorimer (doctor)|John Lorimer]] and Captain [[Thomas Davey (sailor)|Thomas Davey]], Captain of HMS Sloop Diligence. Also along on part of the expedition was Major Alexander Dickson, commander of the 16th Regiment in West Florida. Much of the data used by Hutchins in preparing his 1784 book, "Historical, Narrative and Topographical Description of Louisiana and West Florida" came from his experiences on this expedition.

Despite his years of service with the British Army, he sympathized with the American cause during the [[American Revolution]]. One Journal of these events, written in his handwriting in three different versions, was likely meant for the planned biography that was never finished. It indicates that Hutchins accompanied his old 60th Royal American Regiment for a brief time during the invasion of Georgia in December 1778.  Similar to other anonymous journals attributed to Hutchins, he describes the countryside while serving beside a fellow New Jersey acquaintance Lieut. Col. Mark Prevost, brother of the Gen. Augustine Prevost.  Captain Hutchins apparently accompanied his regiment just days before the Battle of Brier Creek which was fought on March 3, 1779 in Georgia. He may have served in one of his previous capacities with the Prevost's during the French and Indians War as a recorder and observer of the battle. Hutchins, although not directly in the fighting himself, witnessed and recorded cruelties that may have cemented his anti-war stance toward hostilities against the Americans.  Hutchins' veteran observations recorded some of the most vivid descriptions of the battle as the light infantry regiment, led by the infamous Capt. James "Bloody" Baird of the 71st Fraser Highlanders, started bayoneting Georgia Continentals after their surrender.  Hutchins descriptions of the 71st Highlanders seem to give hint of what may have been commonly held prejudices held by British Regular officers serving alongside Scottish Regiments.  Some days after the event, Hutchins likely sailed for Great Britain from Savannah, Georgia to print cartography materials of frontier America. Sometime during the preceding weeks, a secret investigation of the activities of Hutchins was apparently set in motion. An agent had discovered that Hutchins had been using a secret mailing address and sending coded dispatches.  Some mention of Hutchins' activities and letters were made by Thomas Digges in letters exchanged with Benjamin Franklin.   It is not clear if this was espionage or his continued attention to land speculation activities he was involved in back in America.  Since Capt. Hutchins was considered one of Britain's leading authorities on the western frontier lands, this left him in the unusual position of being an important consultant about lucrative future Native American land acquisitions.  Some American and British leaders were involved in these activities so when news of his investigation surfaced, many recognized this as a potentially scandalous affair. Some such individuals were the Prevost family members who all but represented the heart of the command for the 60th Regiment.  One such connection was in the messy affair of the George Croghan lands of Western Pennsylvania.  The potential may have been viewed as serious enough to have the American 60th Regiment moved from the states to Jamaica by the end of 1779.  Likely suspecting his investigation, Hutchins tried to sell his captaincy in the Regiment.  Hutchins resigned from his position in 1780.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;&lt;ref name =longlyyork/&gt; He was arrested, charged with treason, and imprisoned in a mostly secretive set of events.  In 1780, he escaped to France and contacted [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the United States with a request to join the American army. In December 1780, Hutchins sailed to [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Very little is known of his service with the Americans during the remainder of the war.  Hutchins is believed to be the only British Regular Officer to have switched to the American side during the war.

"By resolution on May 4, 1781, Congress appointed him geographer of the southern army. On July 11, the title was changed to 'Geographer of the United States.'"&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Hutchins." Dictionary of American Biography. NY: Scribner's Sons. 1932. Volume IX, page 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchins was the first and only Geographer of the United States &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=70281 Fort Steuben History]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Department of the Geographer to the Army, 1777-1783]]) from 1781. He became an early advocate of [[Manifest Destiny]], proposing that the United States should annex [[West Florida]] and [[Spanish Louisiana|Louisiana]], which were then controlled by Spain.&lt;ref name =longlyyork&gt;{{cite book |title=Turning the World Upside Down: the War of American Independence and the Problem of Empire|last1=Longly York|first1=Neil|year=2003|publisher=[www.praeger.com Praeger Publishers]|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_lhtog-ckcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=longley+york&amp;ei=SvpLS4TLL5bwyASGvqzsCw&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|isbn=0-275-97693-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1781, Hutchins was appointed geographer of the southern army, and shared duties with [[Simeon DeWitt]], the geographer of the main army. Just a few months later, a new title was granted to both men, geographer of the United States. When DeWitt became the surveyor-general of New York in 1784, Hutchins held the prestigious title alone.

"Although Congress balked at the idea of a postwar establishment with an engineering department, it did see the need for a geographer and surveyors. Thus, in 1785, Thomas Hutchins became geographer general and immediately began his biggest assignment- surveying "Seven Ranges" townships in the [[Northwest Territory]] as provided by the Land Ordnance Act of 1785. For two years [[Josiah Harmar]]'s troops offered Hutchins and his surveyors much needed protection from Indians."&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Paul K.

[Washington, D.C.]: Historical Division, Office of Administrative Services, Office of the Chief of Engineers, 1981. Page 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchins died on assignment while surveying the [[Seven Ranges]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/chronology/chronology_driver.pl?q=geographer&amp;year=&amp;month=&amp;day=&amp;start_line=0&amp;searchtype=single&amp;page=sim], University of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt; "The Gazette of the United States concluded a commendary memorial notice by the remark, 'he has measured the earth, but a small space now contains him.'"&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Hutchins."

Like South Korea, North Korea does not currently observe [[daylight saving time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/g.html |title=When is Daylight Saving Time Worldwide? |website=[[WebExhibits]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time keeping in North Korea is under the State Commission for Science and Technology.

== History ==
Before modern clocks were introduced into Korea, Koreans kept time with the help of a [[sundial]] during the daylight time and a [[water clock]] at night. In 1434, [[Jang Yeong-sil]], a [[Joseon]] scientist and astronomer with other scientists, developed Korea's first sundial, Angbu Ilgu ({{lang|ko|앙부일구}}/{{lang|ko|仰釜日晷}}) and was put into service as standard time-keeper of the kingdom and began the standard time at Hanyang ([[Seoul]]) which was calculated to be UTC+08:28.&lt;ref&gt;A Bridge between Conceptual Frameworks: Sciences, Society and Technology Studies edited by Raffaele Pisano&lt;/ref&gt; In 1442, [[Chiljeongsan]], an astronomical calendar system that was created during the reign of [[Sejong the Great|King Sejong]] used Hanyang (Seoul) local time as its standard as it overcame the limitations of previous-made calendars.&lt;ref&gt;http://jkas.kas.org/journals/2012v45n4/v45n4p085_kwlee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Korean Empire]] adopted a standard time of {{frac|8|1|2}} hours ahead of UTC (UTC+08:30), which is similar to Pyongyang Standard Time, around the beginning of the 20th century. Some sources claim 1908,&lt;ref name="MunroeKim2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Turning back the clock: North Korea creates Pyongyang Standard Time |editor-first=Paul |editor-last=Tait |work=Reuters |date=6 August 2015 |access-date=7 August 2015 |first1=Tony |last1=Munroe |first2=Jack |last2=Kim |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/07/us-northkorea-time-idUSKCN0QC04P20150807 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809212635/http://reuters.com/article/2015/08/07/us-northkorea-time-idUSKCN0QC04P20150807 |archive-date=9 August 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; others claim 1912&lt;ref name="Ts'ai2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ts'ai |first=Hui-yu Caroline |title=Taiwan in Japan's Empire-Building: An Institutional Approach to Colonial Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0yruIa2hVwC&amp;pg=PA97 |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-203-88875-8 |page=97 |lccn=2008018374 |oclc=227205710 |quote=After Japan took over Taiwan in 1895, the new empire was divided into two standard time zones: central and western; ....

'''Volcanology of New Zealand''' is the scientific study of [[volcano]]es and volcanic phenomena in New Zealand. [[Volcanism]] has been responsible for many of the country's geographical features, especially in the [[North Island]] and [[New Zealand outlying islands|the country's outlying islands]].

While the land's volcanic history dates back to before the [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] microcontinent [[rift]]ed away from [[Gondwana]] 60–130 million years ago, activity continues today with minor eruptions occurring every few years. This recent activity is primarily due to the country's position on the boundary between the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]] and [[Pacific Plate]]s, a part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and particularly the [[subduction]] of the Pacific Plate under the Indo-Australian Plate.

New Zealand's rocks record examples of almost every kind of volcanism observed on Earth, including some of [[List of largest volcanic eruptions|the world's largest eruptions]] in geologically recent times.

None of the [[South Island]]'s volcanoes are active.

==Major eruptions==
[[File:Lake taupo landsat.jpg|thumb|right|The scalloped bays indenting [[Lake Taupo]]'s northern and western coasts are typical of large volcanic [[caldera]] margins. The caldera they surround was formed during the huge [[Oruanui eruption]].]]
New Zealand has been the site of many large explosive eruptions during the last two million years, including several of [[supervolcano]] size.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Catchpole. [http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/3165/full Islands of fire], ''Cosmos Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; These include eruptions from [[Macauley Island]] and the Taupo, Whakamaru, Mangakino, [[Reporoa caldera|Reporoa]], [[Rotorua Caldera|Rotorua]], and Haroharo [[caldera]]s.

Two relatively recent eruptions from the Taupo volcano are perhaps the best known. Its [[Oruanui eruption]] was the world's largest known eruption in the past 70,000 years, with a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] (VEI) of 8. It occurred around 26,500 years ago and deposited approximately 1,200&amp;nbsp;km³ of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Later erosion and sedimentation had long-lasting effects on the landscape, causing the [[Waikato River]] to shift from the [[Hauraki Plains]] to its current course through the Waikato to the [[Tasman Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand's largest lake, [[Lake Taupo]], fills the [[caldera]] formed in this eruption.

Taupo's most recent major [[eruption]], the Taupo or [[Hatepe eruption]], took place around 180 CE, and is New Zealand's largest eruption since Oruanui. It ejected some 120&amp;nbsp;km³ of material (rating 7 on the VEI scale),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Taupo – Eruptive History |url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0401-07=&amp;volpage=erupt | work = Global Volcanism Program | publisher = [[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with around 30&amp;nbsp;km³ ejected in just a few minutes. It is believed that the eruption column was {{convert|50|km|mi}} high, twice as high as the eruption column from [[Mount St. Helens]] in 1980. This makes it one of the most violent eruptions in the last 5000 years (alongside the [[Tianchi eruption]] of [[Baekdu Mountain|Baekdu]] at around 1000 and the 1815 eruption of [[Mount Tambora|Tambora]]). The resulting [[ash (volcanic)|ash]] turned the sky red over Rome and China.&lt;ref name="Wilson1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=C. J. N. |authorlink=Colin J. N. Wilson |author2=Ambraseys, N. N. |author3=Bradley, J. |author4= Walker, G. P. L.  |year=1980 |title=A new date for the Taupo eruption, New Zealand |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=288 |issue= 5788|pages=252–253 |doi=10.1038/288252a0 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 1980Natur.288..252W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mount Tarawera]]'s eruption around 1310 CE, while not nearly as large, was still substantial, producing 2.5&amp;nbsp;km³ of [[lava]] and 5&amp;nbsp;km³ of tephra (VEI&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref name="Okataina gvp history"&gt;{{cite gvp | vnum=0401-05=&amp;volpage=erupt | title=Okataina: Eruptive History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because its deposits, stretching from [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] to the [[Bay of Islands]], were emplaced around the time that [[Māori people|Māori]] permanently settled New Zealand, they have provided a useful archaeological marker. Tarawera erupted again on 10 June 1886, spewing ash and debris over {{convert|16000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, destroying the [[Pink and White Terraces]] and three villages, including [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]], and claiming the lives of perhaps 120&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;Dench, p 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km³ of tephra was erupted (VEI&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref name="Okataina gvp history"/&gt;

{{Wide image|Tarawera rift, halfway out.jpg|800px|Part of the {{convert|17|km|mi|adj=on}} long rift created in [[Mount Tarawera]]'s 1886 eruption}}

==Hazards==
As well as the direct effects of explosions, [[lava]], and [[pyroclastic flow]]s, volcanoes pose various hazards to the New Zealand populace. These include [[tsunami]]s, break-out floods and [[lahar]]s from volcanically dammed lakes, [[ashfall]], and other far field effects.

[[File:Ruapehu Crater Lake n.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Ruapehu|Ruapehu]]'s [[crater lake]], source of the deadly 1953 [[lahar]]]]
For instance, the [[Tangiwai disaster]] occurred on 24 December 1953 when the Tangiwai railway bridge across the Whangaehu River collapsed from a [[lahar]] in full flood, just before an express train was about to cross it. The train could not stop in time, and 151 lives were lost. This was ultimately caused by Ruapehu's 1945 eruption, which had emptied the [[crater lake]] and dammed the outlet with tephra.

Effects can be widespread even for eruptions of only moderate size. Ash plumes from Ruapehu's 1996 eruption forced the closure of eleven airports, including [[Auckland International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gns.cri.nz/news/release/20100419ash.html Mass aircraft grounding possible in NZ too scientists say], media release, GNS Science, 19 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance against volcanic damage (along with other natural disasters) is provided by the country's [[Earthquake Commission]].

==Cultural references==

The [[Māori people|Māori]] had many myths and legends regarding the land's volcanic mountains. Perhaps the most well known regards the location of [[Mount Taranaki/Egmont|Taranaki]], [[Tongariro]] and [[Pihanga]] as they stand today. It is said that the other two volcanoes competed for the love of the beautiful Pihanga, and Taranaki lost. Defeated, Taranaki moved to its present location near [[New Plymouth]].

[[File:MountNgauruhoe.jpg|thumb|left|The young [[stratovolcano]] [[Mount Ngauruhoe|Ngauruhoe]], named after the slave who legend says died on its summit]]
Another legend recounts the exploits of [[Ngātoro-i-rangi]], a tohunga (priest) who arrived from the ancestral Māori homeland, Hawaiki, on the [[Arawa (canoe)|Arawa]] waka (canoe). Travelling inland and looking southward from [[Lake Taupo|Lake Taupō]], he decided to climb the mountains he saw there. He reached and began to climb the first mountain along with his slave Ngāuruhoe, who had been travelling with him, and named the mountain Tongariro (the name literally means 'looking south'), whereupon the two were overcome by a blizzard carried by the cold south wind. 
Near death, Ngātoro-i-rangi called back to his two sisters, Kuiwai and Haungaroa, who had also come from Hawaiki but remained upon [[Whakaari/White Island]], to send him sacred fire which they had brought from Hawaiki. This they did, sending the fire in the form of two [[taniwha]] (powerful spirits) named Te Pupu and Te Haeata by a subterranean passage to the top of Tongariro. The tracks of these two taniwha formed the line of geothermal fire which extends from the Pacific Ocean and beneath the Taupo Volcanic Zone, and is seen in the many volcanoes and [[hot spring]]s extending from Whakaari to Tokaanu and up to the Tongariro massif. The fire arrived just in time to save Ngātoro-i-rangi from freezing to death, but Ngāuruhoe was already dead by the time Ngātoro-i-rangi turned to give him the fire. For this reason the hole through which the fire ascended, the active cone of Tongariro, is now called Ngauruhoe.
Volcanic eruptions in the North Island such as the Kahoroa eruption of Mt Tarawera in 1314, have been used to help determine the approximate date of arrival of the early Polynesian colonists to about 1280. Fossilized footprints of perhaps second- or third-generation Polynesian colonists have been found in volcanic ash on islands in the Hauraki Gulf.

==Volcanic areas==

There are remnants of volcanic activity throughout most of New Zealand, but there are several areas where this is more obvious, and some where activity is very much continuing. Eruptions have been confined to the Taupo Volcanic Zone and the Kermadec Arc since Taranaki's last activity in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/region.cfm?rnum=04&amp;rpage=list Volcanoes of New Zealand to Fiji], Global Volcanism Program, Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kermadec Arc===
The [[Kermadec Islands]] are an active volcanic [[island arc]] stretching north-northeast from New Zealand's North Island towards Tonga. While only a few volcanoes in the arc are tall enough to form islands, it also includes about 30 sizeable [[submarine volcano]]es. The largest island, [[Raoul Island]], produced a large eruption around 2200 years ago. Its activity has continued intermittently since, with its latest eruption occurring in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=0402-03=|name=Raoul Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northland===
The [[Northland Region|Northland]] region contains two recently active [[volcanic field]]s, one around [[Whangarei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=0401-011|name=Whangarei Volcanic Field}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kaikohe-Bay of Islands volcanic field]].&lt;ref name="BOI"&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=0401-01=|name=Kaikohe-Bay of Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their latest activity, around 1300–1800 years ago, created four scoria cones at [[Te Puke (volcano)|Te Puke]] (near [[Paihia]]).&lt;ref name="BOI"/&gt;

=== Auckland volcanic field ===
The [[basalt]]ic [[Auckland volcanic field]] is a [[monogenetic volcanic field]] underlying much of the [[Auckland]] metropolitan area. The field's many vents have produced a diverse array of explosion craters, [[scoria]] cones, and [[lava]] flows. The largest and most recent is [[Rangitoto Island|Rangitoto]], which erupted in the Hauraki Gulf 600–700&amp;nbsp;years ago. Currently [[Dormant volcano|dormant]], the field is likely to erupt again within the next "hundreds to thousands of years" (based on past events), a very short timeframe in geologic terms.&lt;ref name="CONT"&gt;Beca Carter Hollings &amp; Ferner (2002).

The extinct Coromandel Volcanic Zone (CVZ) was a volcanic arc stretching from [[Great Barrier Island]] in the north, through the [[Coromandel Peninsula]], to [[Tauranga]] and the southern [[Kaimai Ranges]] in the south. Activity began in the north around 18 million years ago, and was primarily andesitic until around 9–10 million years ago, when it changed to a bimodal basaltic/rhyolitic pattern.

===Mayor Island===
[[File:Lady Knox Geyser.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lady Knox Geyser]], in the [[Waiotapu]] geothermal area]]
[[Mayor Island]] is a [[peralkaline]] shield volcano with a caldera partly formed in a large eruption some 7000 years ago. It has exhibited many eruptive styles, and its last eruption may have occurred only 500–1000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=0401-021|name=Mayor Island}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's Maori name, ''Tuhua'', refers to the obsidian they found on the island and prized for its sharp cutting edge.

[[File:Mt Taranaki.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mount Taranaki/Egmont]], with Fanthams Peak on the left]]

===Taranaki===
Volcanism in the [[Taranaki]] region has migrated southeastward during the last two million years. Beginning in the [[Sugar Loaf Islands]], near [[New Plymouth]], activity then shifted to [[Kaitake]] (580,000 years ago) and [[Mount Taranaki|Pouakai]] (230,000 years ago) before creating the large stratovolcano called Taranaki or [[Mount Egmont]], which last erupted in 1854, and its satellite vent Fanthams Peak.&lt;ref name="locke97"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Locke|first=Corinne A.|author2=John Cassidy |year=1997|title=Egmont Volcano, New Zealand: three-dimensional structure and its implications for evolution |journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=76|issue=1–2|pages=149–161|doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(96)00074-1|bibcode = 1997JVGR...76..149L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banks Peninsula ===
[[File:BanksPeninsulaModel.jpg|thumb|right|The mountainous terrain of [[Banks Peninsula]] contrasts with the nearby plains]]
[[Banks Peninsula]] comprises the eroded remnants of two large stratovolcanoes (Lyttelton formed first, then Akaroa). These formed through intraplate volcanism through [[continental crust]] between approximately eleven and eight million years ago ([[Miocene]]). The peninsula formed as offshore islands, with the volcanoes reaching to about 1,500&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. Two dominant craters were eroded, then flooded, to form the [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] and [[Akaroa]] Harbours. The portion of crater rim lying between Lyttelton Harbour and Christchurch city forms the [[Port Hills]].

=== Solander Islands ===
The [[Solander Islands]], a small chain of uninhabited islets close to the western end of the [[Foveaux Strait]], are the emergent portions of a large extinct andesitic volcano that last erupted around 150,000 to 400,000 years ago. Caused by the subduction of the Australian Plate beneath the Pacific Plate, it is the only volcano associated with this subduction zone that protrudes above the sea.&lt;ref&gt;

===Subantarctic islands===
The majority of [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands|New Zealand's widely separated subantarctic islands]] are primarily volcanic in origin, including [[Auckland Island]], [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]], and [[Antipodes Island]].&lt;ref name="Panter et al"/&gt; These are mainly [[Miocene]] intraplate volcanoes with ages decreasing towards the northeast, although Antipodes Island may have been active during the last 20,000 years.

==Older volcanism==
[[File:Mount Tapuaenuku 2.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Tapuaenuku|Tapuae-o-Uenuku]]'s summit comprises the uplifted and eroded foundations of an old volcano]]
Older remnants of volcanism are also found in several places around New Zealand. These were generally formed either when New Zealand still formed part of the [[Gondwana]] [[supercontinent]], or while [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] was rifting away from the rest of Gondwana, although some have been emplaced in their current setting more recently. (New Zealand is the main part of the submerged [[microcontinent]] of Zealandia that currently emerges above the sea.)

A band of granitic intrusions covering over 10,000&amp;nbsp;km², the Median Batholith, stretches from [[Stewart Island]] through [[Fiordland]], and again through the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] after interruption by the [[Alpine Fault]]. This was produced between 375 and 105 million years ago in the course of subduction-related volcanism in a long mountain range along the Gondwanan coast somewhat like today's [[Andes]]. Two more [[batholith]]s, the Karamea-Paparoa and Hohonu Batholiths, are also found on the West Coast.

[[File:Zealandia-Continent map en.svg|thumb|upright|left|Map of southern part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]]]]
Basaltic lava flows, [[dike (geology)|dike]]s, and tuff from fissure eruptions between 100 million and 66 million years ago, during Zealandia's separation from Gondwana, are found in [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]], the West Coast and offshore further west. Ultramafic intrusions are found in Marlborough and north [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], including at the summit of [[Mount Tapuaenuku|Tapuae-o-Uenuku]], the country's highest mountain outside the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. A., J. A. Gamble, and I. J. Graham (1994). The age, geology, and geochemistry of the Tapuaenuku Igneous Complex, Marlborough, New Zealand.

Rhyolitic ignimbrite from 85 million years ago is found in [[Otago]] at Shag Point and in the [[Kakanui Mountains]].

The [[Hikurangi Plateau]] is an [[oceanic plateau]] on the Pacific Plate that attached to the Chatham Ridge after partially subducted under it, and is now subducting under the [[North Island]]. It likely formed in one of the world's largest volcanic outpourings, the [[Ontong Java Plateau|greater Ontong Java event]].

[[Ophiolite]]s, volcanic deposits from the ocean floor, have been incorporated into the continental basement of New Zealand in the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt, found at both ends of the [[South Island]], and in Northland.

The traits of a wolf most commonly given to lakes include “something to be feared”, “quick and relentless”,” an enemy of man”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Netherlands, meaning “low countries” is a nation where 18% of the countries’ land is below [[sea level]], and half of the land under one meter above sea level, and is prone to flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2014/02/the-battle-of-the-floods.html|title=The Battle of the Floods - European studies blog|website=blogs.bl.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before modern flood control, severe [[Storm|storms]] could cause flooding that could wipe out whole villages in the area of the waterwolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1982/1209/120971.html|title=How Dutch shooed the 'waterwolf' from door|date=1982-12-09|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2018-05-09|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the land in the Netherlands is considered peat [[Bog|bogs]]. Peat is known to be an [[organic matter]] substance consisting of 10% carbon and 90% water and is usually found in colder [[Climate|climates]] where the [[plant growth]] and plant decay are slow. Peat is considered a [[carbon sequestration]], and when dried can be burned as a fuel. Historically peat was the primary source of fuel in the Netherlands, and farmers would mine the peat to burn or sell, thus contributing to the erosion of the [[landscape]].

The first great step to reclaiming land taken by the waterwolf was made with the creation of [[Windmills in the Netherlands|windmills]] that could pump water out of the surrounding area, allowing for the creation of [[polder]]s, or areas inhabited below sea level with an artificially managed [[water table]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allianz.com/en/about_us/open-knowledge/topics/environment/articles/100311-dutch-flood-protection-taming-the-water-wolf.html/|title=Dutch flood protection: Taming the water wolf - About us {{!}} Allianz|website=www.allianz.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern flood control in the Netherlands consists of maintaining polders, [[Levee|levees]], and is highlighted by the world’s largest [[dam]] project: The [[Delta Works]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While modern flood control has conquered the waterwolf, new events such as rising sea levels from climate change could once again bring the waterwolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18080442|title=California Turns to Holland for Flood Expertise|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Flood control in the Netherlands|Flood Control in the Netherlands]] with the most notable "waterwolves" conquered being the [[Haarlem Lake]] and the [[Braakman]].[[File:Kaart Haarlemmermeer wapen 1641.gif|thumb|Detail of a map by Jacob Bartelz Veris drawn in 1641 of the Haarlem Lake, with a poem by [[Joost van den Vondel]] topped by a Dutch Lion fighting the Waterwolf as an allegory of the Dutch struggle against floods]]
