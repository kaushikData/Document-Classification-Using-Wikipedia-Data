{{Campaignbox Boko Haram insurgency}}
The '''2009 Boko Haram uprising''' was a conflict between [[Boko Haram]], a militant [[Islamist]] group, and [[Nigeria]]n security forces. Violence across several states in northeastern Nigeria resulted in more than  1,000 dead, with around 700 killed in the city of [[Maiduguri]] alone, according to one military official.&lt;ref name="The Discourses of Salafi Radicalism and Salafi Counter-radicalism in Nigeria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pulizer Center" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeria accused of ignoring sect warnings before wave of killings"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/nigeria-boko-haram-islamist-sect |title=Nigeria accused of ignoring sect warnings before wave of killings|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A government inquiry later found that, while long-standing tensions existed between Boko Haram and the Nigerian Security forces, the immediate cause of the violence stemmed from a confrontation between a group of sect members and police in the city of Maiduguri. The Boko Haram members were en route to bury a comrade at the cemetery. The officers, part of a special operation to suppress violence and rampant crime in Borno State, demanded that the young men comply with a law requiring motorcycle passengers to wear helmets. They refused and, in the confrontation that followed, police shot and wounded several of the men.&lt;ref name="The Discourses of Salafi Radicalism and Salafi Counter-radicalism in Nigeria"/&gt;

According to initial media reports, the violence began on 26 July when [[Boko Haram]] launched an attack on a police station in Bauchi State. Clashes between militants and the [[Nigeria Police Force]] erupted in Kano, Yobe and Borno soon after. But President [[Umaru Yar’Adua]] disputed this version of events, claiming that government security forces had struck first. 

“I want to emphasize that this is not an inter-religious crisis and it is not the Taliban group that attacked the security agents first, no. It was as a result of a security information gathered on their intention ... to launch a major attack," he said.&lt;ref name="Hundreds flee battle in north Nigeria"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2009-07-30/news/29265580_1_nigerian-leader-police-station-maiduguri|title=Nigeria accused of ignoring sect warnings before wave of killings|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=6 August 2009|website=[[Boston.com]]|agency=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725105934/http://articles.boston.com/2009-07-30/news/29265580_1_nigerian-leader-police-station-maiduguri|archive-date=25 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerian troops surrounded the home of [[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf]], the founder and spiritual leader of Boko Haram since 2002, in Maiduguri on 28 July after his followers had barricaded themselves inside. On July 30, the military captured Yusuf and transferred him to the custody of the police. They summarily executed him in public outside police headquarters.&lt;ref name=HRW2012 /&gt; 

''Islam Online'' suggests that politics, not religion, was the cause of the violence.&lt;ref name="Politics Vs Religion in Nigeria Attacks"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1248187502404&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout |last=Oriyomi |first=Rafiu |title=Politics Vs Religion in Nigeria Attacks |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=29 July 2009 |publisher=[[IslamOnline]] |archivedate=31 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731032731/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1248187502404&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News%2FNWELayout |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; People such as Christian pastor George Orjih were murdered specifically because they refused to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=6 August 2009 |last=Ola |first=Timothy |url=http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/news/national/2009/aug/06/national-06-08-2009-01.htm |title=Boko Haram: How 3 pastors were beheaded eyewitness |work=Sun News Online |archivedate=12 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812212917/http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/news/national/2009/aug/06/national-06-08-2009-01.htm |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HRW2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Human Rights Watch|title=Spiraling Violence: Boko Haram Attacks and Security Force Abuses in Nigeria|date=11 October 2012|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2012/10/11/spiraling-violence-0|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the clashes, many local Muslim leaders and at least one military official had warned the Nigerian authorities about the Boko Haram sect. Those warnings were reportedly ignored.&lt;ref name="Nigeria accused of ignoring sect warnings before wave of killings"/&gt;

==Bauchi, Bauchi State==
On 26 July, more than 50 people were killed and several dozen were injured in [[Bauchi]] when a gun-battle erupted as a police station was attacked by 70 Nigerian Boko Haram sect members who possessed grenades and guns. One government soldier and 32 Boko Haram militants were killed in the aftermath of the initial attack.&lt;ref name="Nigeria forces kill 32 after attack on police station"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE56P0MA20090726|title=Nigeria forces kill 32 after attack on police station|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=27 July 2009|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Security forces kill 50 in Nigeria"/&gt; The government claimed that 39 militants had been killed, and confirmed the death of a soldier. The attack was initiated by Boko Haram after their leaders were detained by the police.&lt;ref name="Nigeria forces kill 32 after attack on police station"/&gt; Security forces retaliated by raiding the neighbourhoods where the group was entrenched.&lt;ref name="Nigeria forces kill 32 after attack on police station"/&gt;

[[Isa Yuguda]], State [[Governor of Bauchi]], commented: "We have pre-empted the militants. Otherwise the situation would have been bad. I'm calling on all the people of Bauchi to be calm and be rest assured the situation has been brought under control."{{cn|date=September 2016}}

Yuguda declared a night-time curfew, and the police maintained a visible profile.&lt;ref name="Security forces kill 50 in Nigeria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigerian Islamist attacks spread"/&gt; Businesses remained open in the area.&lt;ref name="Security forces kill 50 in Nigeria"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/security-forces-kill-50-in-nigeria-1.843875|title=Security forces kill 50 in Nigeria|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=27 July 2009|work=[[The Irish Times]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, Army soldiers reportedly launched an offensive on the compound of sect leader Mohammed Yusuf and a nearby mosque used by his followers in the [[Borno state]] capital of Maiduguri.

On 30 July, Nigerian security forces killed 100 Boko Haram militants in fighting in Maiduguri. Security forces fought their way into a mosque occupied by militants, raking the interior with machine gun fire. Elsewhere, Military and Police forces engaged militants in house-to-house fighting. It was initially reported that Boko Haram vice-chairman [[Abubakar Shekau]] had been killed, but he was later reported alive.&lt;ref name=WRN&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamist leader Shekau 'hiding in the desert'|url=http://wwrn.org/articles/33883/|accessdate=13 July 2015|agency=Worldwide Religious News|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigerian policemen were also killed. After the government declared Maidguri to be secured, Nigerian forces began setting up mortar positions to shell the remaining enemy compound.

On 30 July, Yusuf was captured by the military and handed over to the police at the police headquarters in Maiduguri. Police officers summarily executed Yusuf inside the compound in full view of public onlookers.&lt;ref name=HRW2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera Video"&gt;{{cite news|title=Video shows Nigeria 'executions'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2010/02/2010298114949112.html|accessdate=27 June 2015|agency=Al Jazeera|date=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police officials initially claimed that either Yusuf was shot while trying to escape or died of wounds sustained during a gun battle with the military.&lt;ref name=HRW2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera Video" /&gt; The police also executed other Boko Haram suspects, including Yusuf's father-in-law, outside the police headquarters.&lt;ref name=HRW2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera Video" /&gt;

On March 1, 2010, a group of Japanese [[2channel|2chan]] and Korean website [[Naver|NAVER]]'s 'Terror Action Association' which was made up [[DC Inside]], [[Todayhumor]] [[netizens]] engaged in a civil cyberwar. The day was [[South Korea]]'s [[March 1st Movement]] Anniversary, and the 100th anniversary of the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910]].

==Description==
~ 2010. 2. 23.
About a Korean international student was killed in [[Russia]] in the winter of 2009, ([[2channel|2chan]]) made online comments such as "Dog died, Why did the news show it up?" or "Kill more!". After [[Yuna Kim]] won the gold medal in figure skating, the group [[2channel|2chan]] asserted that a referee must have been bribed, and posts on the website of [[DC Inside]] insinuated a plot.

2010. 2. 24.
About 12,000 people organized community, Terror Action Association(TAA) in Korea. Sensing the organization of the community, 2chan launched a small attack at DC Inside, but this attack failed in seconds.

2010. 2. 25.
2chan's spy loosed TAA's plot of attack at March 1st, TAA launched visitor inspection program.

2010. 2. 26. ~ 2. 28.
TAA has recruited Japanese speakers to translate 2chan's internal instructions of attack. TAA has found out all the programs and attacks used by 2chan. 2chan had known about this fact, but most of 2chan's attackers did not know that March 1 was a Korean holiday.

2010. 3. 1. ~ 3. 5.

The text of this history has been considerably altered, but it has always been in high favor with the Armenians.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agathangelus|volume=1|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred von Gutschmid|Von Gutschmid]] maintains that the unknown author made use of a genuine life of St. Gregory, also of a history of his [[martyr]]dom and of that of Saint [[Rhipsime]] and her companions. Historical facts are intermingled in this life with [[legend]]ary or uncertain additions, and the whole is woven into a certain unity by the narrator, who may have assumed his significant name from his quality of narrator of "the good news" of Armenia's conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |inline=1 |wstitle=Agathangelus}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been translated into several languages, and [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] translations are found in the ''Acta Sanctorum Bollandistarum'', tome viii.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

According to Agathangelos, he was tasked by Tiridates III to write about his father [[Khosrov II of Armenia]] and his reign period. Until the 19th century, based on this fact, scholars believe that Agatangelos lived in the 4th century. However further detailed research of his writing has demonstrated that Agathangelos lived and worked in the 5th century and was not able to be Tiridates III's secretary.

'''Arminius''' ({{lang-de|Hermann}}; 18/17 BC – AD 21) was a chieftain of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Cherusci]] tribe who commanded an alliance of Germanic tribes at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD, in which three [[Roman legion]]s were destroyed.
His victory at Teutoburg Forest would precipitate the [[Roman Empire]]'s permanent strategic withdrawal from [[Magna Germania]], and made a major contribution to the eventual [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Aaron Ralby|title=Atlas of Military History|year=2013|publisher=Parragon|isbn=978-1-4723-0963-1|page=241|chapter=The Roman Legion: Refining Military Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians have regarded Arminius' victory as Rome's greatest defeat.&lt;ref name="Murdoch"&gt;{{harvnb|Murdoch|2012|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it prevented the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of the Germanic peoples, Arminius' victory has also been considered one of the most decisive battles in history,&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wHpVn68GCogC&amp;pg=PA75 75]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cawthorne"&gt;{{harvnb|Cawthorne|2012|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=nv73QlQs9ocC&amp;pg=PA68 68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Creasy"&gt;{{harvnb|Creasy|2007|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a turning point in [[History of the world|world history]].&lt;ref name="Spectator"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/20823/how-the-eagles-were-tamed/ |title=

Born a prince of the Cherusci tribe, Arminius was made a hostage of the Roman Empire as a child. Raised in Rome, he was drafted into the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]] at an early age, during which he was granted [[Roman citizenship]] and became a [[Equites|Roman knight]]. After serving with distinction in the [[Bellum Batonianum|Great Illyrian Revolt]], he was sent to [[Germania]] to aid the local governor [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] in completing the Roman conquest of the Germanic tribes. While in this capacity, Arminius secretly prepared a Germanic revolt against Roman rule, which culminated in the ambush and destruction of three Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest.

In the aftermath of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest Arminius fought off retaliatory invasions by the Roman general [[Germanicus]] in the battles of [[Battle at Pontes Longi|Pontes Longi]], [[Battle of Idistaviso|Idistaviso]] and the [[Battle of the Angrivarian Wall|Angrivarian Wall]], and deposed a rival, the [[Marcomanni]] king [[Maroboduus]]. Germanic nobles, afraid of Arminius' growing power, assassinated him in 21 AD. He was remembered in [[Saga|Germanic legends]] for generations afterwards.&lt;ref name="Annals.02.88"/&gt; Roman historian [[Tacitus]] designated Arminius as the liberator of the Germanic tribes and commended him for having fought the Roman Empire to a standstill at the peak of its power.&lt;ref name="Annals.02.88"&gt;[[Tacitus]]. [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#63|The Annals.2.88]]. "Assuredly he was the deliverer of Germany, one too who had defied Rome, not in her early rise, as other kings and generals, but in the height of her empire's glory, had fought, indeed, indecisive battles, yet in war remained unconquered. He completed thirty-seven years of life, twelve years of power, and he is still a theme of song among barbarous nations, though to Greek historians, who admire only their own achievements, he is unknown, and to Romans not as famous as he should be, while we extol the past and are indifferent to our own times."&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the [[unification of Germany]] in the 19th century, Arminius was hailed by [[German nationalism|German nationalists]] as a symbol of German unity and freedom.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/battle-of-the-teutoburg-forest-germany-recalls-myth-that-created-the-nation-a-644913.html |title= Battle of the Teutoburg Forest: Germany Recalls Myth That Created the Nation |last1=Crossland |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=August 28, 2009 |website=[[Spiegel Online|Spiegel Online International]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[World War II]], however, Arminius was [[Memory hole|omitted]] from German textbooks due to his association with militaristic nationalism, and many modern Germans are unaware of his story. The 2000th anniversary of his victory was lightly commemorated in Germany, which has replaced traditional nationalism with "an easy-going patriotism that mainly manifests itself at sporting events."&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt;

==Name==
[[File:ArminiusbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|200px|No known portrait image of Arminius exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]
The [[etymology]] of the Latin name ''Arminius'' is unknown. [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]], in his ''Historiae'', mentions him as "Arminius, the son of Sigimer, a prince of [the German] nation" and states he "attained the dignity of [[Equites|equestrian rank]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html|title=The Roman History|author=C. Velleius Paterculus|publisher=Loeb Classical Library|date=1924|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Roman naming conventions#Foreign names|Roman naming conventions]] of the time, it is likely ''Arminius'' is an adopted name granted to him upon citizenship, or otherwise not his Cheruscan name.

The origin of the use of the name ''Hermann'' dates from the 16th century, possibly first by [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Arminius into Hermann: History into Legend|author=Herbert W. Benario|journal=Greece and Rome|volume=51|issue=1|date=April 2004|pages=83–94|doi= 10.1093/gr/51.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In German, Arminius is traditionally known as ''Hermann der Cherusker'' ("Hermann the Cheruscan") or ''Hermann der Cheruskerfürst'' ("Hermann the Cheruscan Prince"). Hermann etymologically means "Man of War", coming from the [[Old High German]] ''heri'' "war" and ''man'' "man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Förstemann|first1=Ernst Wilhelm|title=Altdeutsches Namenbuch|date=1900|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=9781270714996|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vorname.com/name,Hermann.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Stammbaum ADBSegest.jpg|right|400px|thumb|Relatives of Arminius]]
Arminius, born in 18 or 17 BC in [[Germania]], was son of the Cheruscan chief [[Segimerus]] (German: ''Segimer''; Proto-Germanic: ''Sigimariz''; Old English: ''Sigemaer'') and trained as a Roman military commander alongside his younger brother [[Flavus (son of Segimerus)|Flavus]]. He had lived in Rome as a hostage in his youth, where he had served in the Roman army between 1 and 6 AD, and had received a military education and obtained [[Roman citizenship]] as well as the status of [[equite]] before returning to Germania and driving the Romans out.&lt;ref name="Durschmied"&gt;{{harvnb|Durschmied|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESY980GKv3cC&amp;pg=PA1759 p. 1759]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Arminius|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]]|year=2014|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica]]|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Teutoburg Forest===
[[File:Magna Germania before the battle of the Teutoburg Forest.png|right|thumb|Magna Germania in 9 AD. The yellow legend represents the areas controlled by the Roman Republic in 31 BC, the shades of green represent gradually conquered territories under the reign of Augustus, and pink areas on the map represent tributary tribes.]]
{{Main article|Battle of the Teutoburg Forest}}
Around the year AD 4, Arminius assumed command of a Cheruscan detachment of Roman auxiliary forces, probably while fighting in the [[Pannonian]] wars on the [[Balkan peninsula]]. He returned to northern Germania in AD 7 or 8, where the Roman Empire had established secure control of the territories just east of the [[Rhine]], along the [[Lippe]] and [[Main (river)|Main]] rivers, and was now seeking to extend its hegemony eastward to the [[Weser]] and [[Elbe]] rivers, under [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]], a high-ranking administrative official appointed by [[Augustus]] as governor. Arminius began plotting to unite various Germanic tribes to thwart Roman efforts to incorporate their lands into the empire. Between 6 and 9 AD, the Romans were forced to move eight of eleven legions present in Germania east of the Rhine river to crush a [[Great Illyrian Revolt|rebellion]] in the [[Balkans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/v_alaudae.html | date = September 2010 | title = Legio V Alaudae | publisher = www.livius.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Varus with only three legions to face the Germans. Additional two legions, under the command of [[Lucius Nonius Asprenas (suffect consul AD 6)|Lucius Nonius Asprenas]] were stationed in [[Moguntiacum]].&lt;ref&gt;Syme, pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt; This represented the perfect opportunity for Arminius to defeat Varus.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Compendium of Roman History'' 2, 109, 5; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' 55, 28, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Otto Albert Koch Varusschlacht 1909.jpg|left|thumb|''Varusschlacht''. Otto Albert Koch (1909)]]

In the autumn of AD 9, the 25-year-old Arminius brought to Varus a fake report of rebellion in northern Germany. He persuaded Varus to divert the three legions under his command (composed of the [[Legio XVII|17th]], [[Legio XVIII|18th]] and [[Legio XIX|19th]] [[Roman legion|legions]], plus three [[cavalry]] detachments and six [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] of auxiliaries) from the march to winter quarters to suppress the rebellion. Varus and his legions marched right into the trap that Arminius had set for them near [[Kalkriese]], the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Arminius's tribe, the [[Cherusci]], and their allies the [[Marsi (Germanic)|Marsi]], [[Chatti]], [[Bructeri]], [[Chauci]], and [[Sicambri]] (five out of at least fifty Germanic tribes at the time)&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt; ambushed and annihilated Varus's entire army, totaling over 20,000 men. Recent archaeological finds show the long-debated location of the three-day battle was almost certainly near Kalkriese Hill, about 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Osnabrück]]. When defeat was certain, Varus committed suicide by falling on his sword. Arminius's success in destroying three entire legions and driving the Romans out of Germany was one of the most devastating defeats Rome suffered in its history, and a high point of Germanic power for centuries. Roman attempts to reconquer Germania failed although they managed to break Arminius's alliance.

===Roman retaliation, inter-tribal conflicts, and death===
[[File:Blick-über-den-Teutoburger-Wald1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View over the [[Teutoburg Forest]]]]
After the battle, the Germans quickly annihilated every trace of Roman presence east of the Rhine. Roman settlements such as the [[Waldgirmes Forum]] were abandoned. The vastly outnumbered Roman garrison of Aliso (modern day [[Haltern am See]]), under the command of the prefect Lucius Cedicius, inflicted heavy losses on the Germans before retreating into [[Gaul]], resisting long enough for Lucius Nonius Asprenas to organize the Roman defense on the Rhine and [[Tiberius]] to arrive with a new army. This prevented Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History II, 120, 4; Cassius Dio, Roman History LVI, 22, 2a-2b&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 14 and 16 AD, [[Germanicus]] launched punitive operations into Germany, fighting Arminius to a draw in the [[Battle at Pontes Longi]] and twice defeating him (according to Tacitus): first in the [[Battle of Idistaviso]] and later at the [[Battle of the Angrivarian Wall]]. Arminius also faced opposition from his father-in-law and other pro-Roman Germanic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann''. 1.54–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 15, Roman troops managed to recapture one of the three [[aquila (Roman)|legionary eagles]] lost in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In AD 16, a second eagle was retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann''. 1.60.4, 2.25.2&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius denied the request of Germanicus to launch an additional campaign for AD 17, however, having decided the frontier with Germania would stand at the Rhine river. Instead, he offered Germanicus the honor of a triumph for his two victories. The third Roman eagle was recovered in AD 41 by Publius Gabinius, under the emperor [[Claudius]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio 60.8.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the Roman threat, a war broke out between Arminius and [[Maroboduus|Marbod]], king of the [[Marcomanni]]. It ended with Marbod fleeing to [[Ravenna]] and Roman protection, but Arminius failed to break into the "natural fortification" of [[Bohemia]], and the war ended in stalemate.

In AD 19, Germanicus died in [[Antioch]] under circumstances which led many to believe he had been poisoned by his opponents. Arminius suffered death two years later, in AD 21, murdered by opponents within his own tribe who felt that he was becoming too powerful.&lt;ref name="tacit"&gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#88|2.88]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' 2.22 ff.; [[Suetonius]], ''Caligula'' 1.4; Dio 57.18.1; on Arminius' assassination, Tac. ''Ann''. 2.88;&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius allegedly had refused an earlier offer from a Chatti nobleman to poison Arminius: "It was not by secret treachery but openly and by arms that the people of Rome avenged themselves on their enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann''. 2.87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman attempts to reconquer Germany failed although the Romans inflicted several defeats on the Germans.

[[File:Herbst im Teutoburgerwald.jpg|thumb|left|Autumn in Teutoburg Forest]]

Arminius's victory against the Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest had a far-reaching effect on the subsequent history of both the ancient [[Germanic peoples]] and on the [[Roman Empire]]. The Romans were to make no more concerted attempts to conquer and permanently hold Germania beyond the river [[Rhine]] and the [[Agri Decumates]]. Modern historians have regarded Arminius's victory as "Rome's greatest defeat"&lt;ref name="Murdoch"/&gt; and one of the most decisive battles in history.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cawthorne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creasy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durschmied"/&gt; During the [[Unification of Germany]] in the 19th century, Arminius became hailed as a symbol of German unity and freedom.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt;

Arminius had married a princess named [[Thusnelda]], whose name is preserved only by [[Strabo]]. She was captured by the Romans while pregnant, so her son [[Thumelicus]] grew up in Roman captivity. [[Tacitus]] informs he had an unusual story, which the historian promises to tell, but it has been lost to us.

===Rome===
[[File:Arminius pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|This Roman sculpture of a young man is sometimes identified as Arminius.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Arminius|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Thusnelda Loggia dei Lanzi 2005 09 13.jpg|thumb|Thusnelda statue in [[Loggia dei Lanzi]], Florence.]]
In the accounts of his Roman enemies, Arminius is highly regarded for his military leadership skills and as a defender of the liberty of his people. Based on these records, the story of Arminius was revived in the 16th century with the recovery of the histories of [[Tacitus]], who wrote in his ''Annales II, 88'':

{{quote|text=Arminius, without doubt Germania's liberator, who challenged the Roman people not in its beginnings like other kings and leaders, but in the peak of its empire; in battles with changing success, undefeated in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arminius the Liberator: Myth and Ideology|first=Martin M.|last=Winkler|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2016|isbn=9780190252915|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Arminius was not the only reason for Rome's change of policy towards Germania. Politics also played a factor; emperors could rarely trust a large army to a potential rival, though Augustus had enough family members to wage his wars. Also, Augustus, in his 30-year reign, had annexed many territories still at the beginning of the process of Romanization.

Tiberius, successor of Augustus, decided that Germania was a far less developed land, possessing few villages, with only a small food surplus, and therefore was not currently important to Rome. It would require a commitment too burdensome for the imperial finances and for excessive expenditure of military force for a new achievement.

Modern scholars have pointed out that the [[Rhine]] was a more practical boundary for the Roman Empire than any other river in Germania. Armies on the Rhine could be supplied from the [[Mediterranean sea]] via the [[Rhône]], [[Saône]] and [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]], with a brief area of portage. Armies on the [[Elbe]], however, would have to have been supplied by extensive overland routes or by ships travelling the hazardous Atlantic. Economically, the Rhine already had towns and sizable villages at the time of the Gallic conquest. The Rhine was significantly more accessible from Rome and better equipped to supply sizeable garrisons than the regions beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heather, (2006), ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome would control Germania by appointing [[client king]]s, which was cheaper than military campaigns. Rome chose no longer to rule directly in Germania east of the [[Rhine]] and north of the [[Danube]]; Rome preferred to exert indirect influence through client kings, so [[Italicus]], nephew of Arminius, was appointed king of the Cherusci; [[Vangio and Sido]] became [[vassal]] princes of the powerful [[Suebi]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annals (Tacitus)|Tacitus]], Book 12 [verse 27 to 31]&lt;/ref&gt;

If indirect methods proved insufficient to control the Germanic tribes beyond the Rhine, Roman Emperors would lead devastating punitive campaigns deep into Germania. One of them, led by the Roman emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]], resulted in a Roman victory in AD 235 at the [[Battle at the Harzhorn]] Hill,&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Two Maximini'' 12:1–4; Herodian, ''Roman History'', Book 7:2:3&lt;/ref&gt; which is located in the modern German state of [[Lower Saxony]], east of the [[Weser]] river, between the towns of [[Kalefeld]] and [[Bad Gandersheim]].

===Old Germanic sagas===
In the early 19th century, attempts were made to show that the story of Arminius and his victory may have lived on in the [[Old Norse]] [[sagas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ueber den Ursprung der Siegfriedsage|author=A. Giesebrecht|journal=Germania|issue=2|year=1837|url=https://archive.org/details/UeberDenUrsprungDerSiegfriedsage/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of the dragon slayer [[Sigurd]] of the [[Völsunga saga]] and the [[Nibelungenlied]]. An Icelandic account&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Nikulas Bergsson, Arnamagnæan Collection manuscript 194, 8yo |author=unknown | year=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Altnordische Kosmographie: Studien und Quellen zu Weltbild und Weltbeschreibung in Norwegen und in Island vom 12. bis zum 14. Jahrhundert |author= Simek, R. |journal= Berlin/New York | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
states that Sigurd "slew the dragon" in the Gnitaheidr—today the suburb Knetterheide of the city of [[Bad Salzuflen]], located at a strategic site on the [[Werre]] river which could very well have been the point of departure of Varus's legions on their way to their doom in the Teutoburg Forest. Also one of the foremost Scandinavian scholars of the 19th century, [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Grimm centenary; Sigfred-Arminivs, and other papers
|author= G. Vigfusson, F. York Powell|journal=Oxford Clarendon Press|year=1886|url=https://archive.org/details/grimmcentenarysi00gudb}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies Sigurd as Arminius. This educated guess was also picked up by [[Otto Höfler]], who was a prominent [[National Socialist]] academic in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;O. Höfler, "Siegfried Arminius und die Symbolik,"  ''Heidelberg'' (1961), 60–64, and also in ''Siegfried, Arminius und der Nibelungenhort'' (Vienna 1978); F.G. Gentry, W. McConnell, W. Wunderlich (eds.), ''The Nibelungen Tradition. An Encyclopedia'' (New York–London 2002), article "Sigurd".&lt;/ref&gt;

===German nationalism===
In Germany, the name ''Arminius'' was interpreted as reflecting the name ''Hermann''
by [[Martin Luther]], who saw Arminius as a symbol of the German people and their fight against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=German Pagan Antiquity in Lutheran Historical Thought|author=W. Bradford Smith|journal=The Journal of the Historical Society|volume=4|issue=3|year=2004|pages=351–74 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-921X.2004.00104.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hermann der Cheruskerfürst''  became an emblem of the revival of [[German nationalism]] fueled by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Klein/Käppel"&gt;Dorothea Klein (ed.), Lutz Käppel (ed.): ''Das diskursive Erbe Europas: Antike und Antikerezeption''. Peter Lang, 2008, {{ISBN|9783631560136}},  [https://books.google.com/books?id=yvfqcAjU9wsC&amp;pg=PA329 p. 329]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gehrts Armin verabschiedet sich von Thusnelda 1884.jpg|thumb|Arminius says goodbye to [[Thusnelda]]. [[Johannes Gehrts]] (1884)]] In 1808, [[Heinrich von Kleist]] wrote the play ''[[Die Hermannsschlacht (Kleist)|Die Hermannsschlacht]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich von Kleist: Die Herrmannsschlacht. Ein Drama [1808] (Frankfurt am Main and Basel: Stroemfeld-Roter Stern, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; but with Napoleon's [[Battle of Wagram|victory at Wagram]] it remained in manuscript, being published in 1821 and not staged until 1860. The play has been revived repeatedly at moments propitious for raw expressions of [[National Romanticism]] and was especially popular during the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Literary Encyclopedia | title=Die Hermannsschlacht | first=William C | last=Reeve | year=2004 | url= http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=13117 | publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company | accessdate=2006-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, construction was started on a massive statue of Arminius, known as the ''[[Hermannsdenkmal]]'', on a hill near [[Detmold]] in the Teutoburg Forest; it was finally completed and dedicated during the early years of the Second [[German Empire]] in the wake of the German victory over France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871. The monument has been a major tourist attraction ever since, as has The [[Hermann Heights Monument]], a similar statue erected in [[New Ulm, Minnesota]] in the United States in 1897.

The Hermann Heights monument was erected by the [[Sons of Hermann]], a fraternal organization formed by [[German American]]s in New York City in 1840 and named for Hermann the Cheruscan that during the 19th century flourished in American cities with large populations of German origin. [[Hermann, Missouri]], a town on the Missouri River founded in the 1830s and incorporated in 1845, was also named for Arminius.

Following [[World War II]] Arminius became a less known figure among West Germans and many schools shunned away from teaching the subject in any detail due to its previous association with nationalism.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt; There was, however, a somewhat different perception in [[East Germany]] than [[West Germany]]. In East Germany, Arminius, based on a marxist reading of history, came to be seen as a revolutionary figure of sorts, leading German tribes in a fight against the Roman slaveholder society (''Sklavenhaltergesellschaft''). In the context of the cold war Arminius became a symbol for socialism, with Rome being a symbol for the capitalist United States as an oppressive empire.&lt;ref name=zeit&gt; Tillmann Bendikowski: [http://www.zeit.de/2008/45/DOS-varus-schlacht ''Deutsche Geschichte – Mythos einer Schlacht'']. Zeit Online, 2008-11-04 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2,000 year anniversary of the battle was celebrated with restraint, avoiding "flag-waving festivals" and other gestures that might be interpreted as nationalism.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt; According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'': "The old nationalism has been replaced by an easy-going [[patriotism]] that mainly manifests itself at sporting events like the soccer [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]."&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt; The German Bundesliga football-club [[DSC Arminia Bielefeld]] is named after Arminius.

[[File:Bernhard Smith, 1948.JPG|thumb|upright|Bernard Smith, 1948]]
'''Bernard William Smith''' (3 October 1916{{spaced ndash}}2 September 2011) was an Australian [[art historian]], [[art critic]] and academic, considered one of the most eminent art historians of the 20th century. His book ''Place, Taste and Tradition: a study of Australian art since 1788'' is a key text in Australian art history, and an influence on [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]. Smith was associated with the [[Communist Party of Australia]], and after leaving the party remained a prominent left-wing intellectual. Smith sold much of his art collection to fund one of the first art prizes for artists of Aboriginal background. 

==Biography==
Smith was born in [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]], Sydney, to Charles Smith and Rose Anne Tierney on 3 October 1916. In 1941, he married his first wife, Kate Challis, who died in 1989. Smith married his second wife, Margaret Forster, in 1995.

Smith was educated at the [[University of Sydney]]. Between 1935 and 1944 he taught in the [[New South Wales Department of Education and Training|NSW Department of Education]]. After that he served as an education officer for the [[Art Gallery of NSW]] country art exhibitions programme from 1944. In 1948, he won a scholarship to study at the [[Warburg Institute|Warburg]] and [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld]] Institutes, [[University of London]]. On his return to Australia in 1951, Smith returned to his position at the art gallery. In 1952, Smith was awarded a research scholarship at the newly established [[Australian National University]], where he completed a PhD.

He was a lecturer and then a senior lecturer in the [[University of Melbourne]]'s Fine Arts Department (1955–1967). In 1959, he convened a group of seven emerging figurative painters known as the [[Antipodeans]], which organised its only exhibition in August 1959. Between 1963 and 1966, he worked as an art critic for ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper, Melbourne.

In 1967, the Smiths moved to Sydney, where Smith became the founding Professor of Contemporary Art and director of the [[Power Institute of Fine Arts]], University of Sydney, a position he held until his retirement in 1977.

In 1977, the Smiths returned to Melbourne, and Smith became the president of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]], until 1980. Later, he was a professorial fellow in the department of Art History at the University of Melbourne.

Smith was a recipient, Chevalier, of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]].

}}'''Charlotte Reeve Conover''' (1855 - 1940) was an author, lecturer, political activist, educator, and  "[[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton's]] historian".&lt;ref name="rogersJH06jan65" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schweikart"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schweikart |first1=MLA |title=Charlotte Reeve Conover |url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&amp;article=1015&amp;context=humanities&amp;type=additional |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Conover was born to physician Dr. John Charles and Emma Barlow Reeve on June 14, 1855.&lt;ref name="rogersJH06jan65" /&gt; She attended [[Central High School (Dayton, Ohio)|Dayton Central High School]], Cooper Seminary, and the [[University of Geneva]].&lt;ref name="rogersJH06jan65" /&gt;

==Writing career==
Conover wrote books about Dayton history and articles for [[Ladies' Home Journal]], [[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] and [[The Atlantic]]. She wrote a regular column called ''Mrs. Conover's Corner'' for the [[Dayton Daily News]]&lt;ref name="rogersJH06jan65" /&gt; and served as editor of the [[Society reporting|Women's Page]] for four years.&lt;ref name="walkoffame" /&gt; Her four-volume history ''Dayton and Montgomery County'' was in 1965 considered "the most authentic public record of Dayton and its pioneer citizens."&lt;ref name="rogersJH06jan65" /&gt; She was noted for her "pioneering studies" of area history.&lt;ref name="walkoffame"&gt;{{cite web |title=Charlotte Reeve Conover |url=http://www.daytonwalkoffame.citymax.com/conover.html |publisher=Dayton Walk of Fame |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later years she lost her vision but continued to write columns for the Dayton Daily news; friends would stop by to help her read, and the paper's owner and editor "[[James M. Cox|Governor Cox]] never knew she was blind."&lt;ref name="rogersJH06jan65" /&gt;

==Impact==
In 1901 Conover martialled the Young Women's League of Dayton to take over the publication of the Dayton Daily News -- known as "The Day The Women Got Out The News" -- on March 30, 1901, as a fundraiser for the organization.&lt;ref name="burbaDDN30oct1932"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Burba |first1=Howard |title=When the Women Got Out The News |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/400751348/?terms=charlotte%2Breeve%2Bconover |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Conover was a leader of the Woman's Suffrage Party of Montgomery County. In ''The Importance for Women to have Suffrage: An Address before the Woman Suffrage Association'' she spoke of the importance of suffrage and equality of the sexes to the country's future.&lt;ref name="schweikart" /&gt; 
Conover was a founder of the Dayton Woman's Literary Club and served as its fourth president, from 1895 - 1897.&lt;ref name="rogersJH06jan65"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Mrs. William |title=Charlotte Reeve Conover enriched a city's memories |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/394487825/?terms=charlotte%2Breeve%2Bconover |publisher=The Journal Herald |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She encouraged other writers, among them fellow Daytonian [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]].&lt;ref name="walkoffame" /&gt;

In 1932, one of her lectures, ''Ramblings of an Ancient Daytonian,'' was reprinted in its entirety in the Dayton Daily News.&lt;ref name="walkoffame" /&gt;

The Dayton Daily News in 1940 called her "Dayton's foremost historian."&lt;ref name="DDN24sept40"&gt;{{cite web |title=Charlotte Reeve Conover |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/391824511/?terms=charlotte%2Breeve%2Bconover |publisher=Dayton Daily News |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Conover married lawyer Frank K.

{{Citation style|date=September 2009}}

'''Chinese law''' is one of the oldest [[legal]] traditions in the world. In the 20th and 21st centuries, law in China inherits a large number of traditions. The core of modern Chinese law is based on Germanic-style [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], and [[Traditional Chinese law|traditional Chinese approaches]].

For most of the [[history of China]], its legal system has been based on the [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] of social control through moral education, as well as the [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalist]] emphasis on [[legal code|codified law]] and [[punishment|criminal sanction]]. Following the [[Revolution of 1911]], the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] adopted a largely Western-style legal code{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition (specifically [[German law|German-influenced]]). The establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought with it a more [[USSR|Soviet-influenced]] system of [[socialist law#Chinese Socialist law|socialist law]]. However, earlier traditions from Chinese history have retained their influence.

Law in the People's Republic of China is currently undergoing gradual reform, as many elements inside and outside the country emphasize the need to strengthen the [[rule of law]] in China, and international trade and globalization spur transformations in various areas of Chinese domestic law.

== Chinese legal tradition ==
{{Main|Traditional Chinese law}}

The word for law in [[classical Chinese]] was ''fǎ'' (法). The [[Chinese character]] for ''fǎ'' denotes a meaning of "fair", "straight" and "just", derived from its water [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] (氵).{{citation needed|reason=patent nonsense|date=September 2014}} It also carries the sense of "standard, measurement, and model".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lang Chippings]], "Explicating 'Law': A Comparative Perspective of Chinese and Western Legal Culture" (1989) 3(1) ''Journal of Chinese Law'' 55-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Derk Bodde and Clarence Morris held that the concept of ''fǎ'' had an association with ''yì'' (義: "social rightness").&lt;ref&gt;Derk Bodde and Clarence Morris, ''Law in Imperial China: Exemplified by 190 Ching Dynasty Cases with Historical, Social, and Judicial Commentaries'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1973) at 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yan Fu]], in his Chinese translation of [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' published in 1913, warned his readers about the difference between the Chinese ''fǎ'' and Western law: "The word 'law' in Western languages has four different interpretations in Chinese as in ''lǐ'' (理: "order"), ''lǐ'' (禮: "rites", "decorum"), ''fǎ'' (法: "human laws") and ''zhì'' (制: "control").&lt;ref&gt;Yan Fu, ''Fayi'' [法意: "The Spirit of the Laws"] (Beijing: The Commercial Press, 1981) at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A term which preceded ''fǎ'' was ''xíng'' (刑), which originally probably referred to [[decapitation]]. ''Xíng'' later evolved to be a general term for laws that related to criminal punishment. The early history ''[[Shang Shu]]'' recorded the earliest forms of the "five penalties": [[tattoo]]ing, [[disfigurement]], [[castration]], [[mutilation]], and [[capital punishment|death]]. Once written law came into existence, the meaning of ''xíng'' was extended to include not only punishments but also any state prohibitions whose violation would result in punishments. In modern times, ''xíng'[[penal law]] or [[criminal law]]. An example of the classical use of ''xíng'' is ''Xíng Bù'' (刑部, lit. "Department of Punishment") for the legal or justice department in imperial China.

The two major Chinese philosophical schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced the idea of law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a sense of shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.

Unlike many other major [[civilization]]s where written law was held in honor and often attributed to divine origin, law in early China was viewed in purely [[secular]] terms, and its initial appearance was greeted with hostility by Confucian thinkers as indicative of a serious moral decline, a violation of human morality, and even a disturbance of the total cosmic order.&lt;ref&gt;Note 4 at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the people's awareness and acceptance of ethical norms was shaped far more by the pervasive influence of custom and usage of property and by inculcating moral precepts than by any formally enacted system of law. Early emperors however embraced the Legalist ideal as a way of exerting control over their large and growing territory and population. This process was integrated with traditional Chinese beliefs in the cosmic order, holding that correct behavior was behavior consonant with the appropriate responses set by ''fǎ''. ''Xíng'' states the potential costs to the individual of exceeding them and imposes penalties for these actions.&lt;ref&gt;Brian E. McKnight, ''Law and Order in Sung China'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 1992) at 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imperial period was characterized mainly by the concept of law as serving the state, a means of exerting control over the citizenry. In the late Qing dynasty there were efforts to reform the law codes mainly by importing German codes with slight modifications. This effort continued and was amplified in the republican period resulting in the Provisional Constitution of 1912 which included the idea of equality under the law, rights for women, and broader rights for citizens vis-à-vis the government. The onset of the communist period at first rolled back the development of individual rights with the primary concept of law returning to that of a tool of the state. After the Cultural Revolution devastated the ranks of intellectuals and legal professionals, it took until 1982 for the idea of individual rights to reemerge as a significant influence on Chinese law.

The current constitution, created in 1982, states in Article V that no organization or individual is above the law and in Article III makes the People’s Congresses and state administration responsible to the people, paving the way for later efforts to allow enforcement of individual rights. Passage of the Administrative Litigation Law of 1987 created legal recourse for individuals from arbitrary government action, an avenue previously unavailable. Despite the deep-seated norm against legal proceedings, litigation in the Chinese courts has increased dramatically, especially in recent years. The continuing weakness of courts resulting from their dependence on the local government for financial support and enforcement undermines the effectiveness of these remedies but this has also begun to change with China’s initiatives to increase legal training and the professionalism of the judiciary.

One avenue of individual appeal from government action which continues to be important is the custom of ''xìnfǎng'' or petitions by citizens to the individuals officials for change. The continuing wide use of ''xìnfǎng'' reflects the fact that many officials are still able to avoid legal sanctions and the underlying avoidance of the legal system, as well as the personal ability of officials to personally intervene to change unjust results. Recently ''xìnfǎng'' has been institutionalized to some extent with the central government mandating that every level of administration establish a ''xìnfǎng'' office to handle petitions and report them up to high levels. This solution by exertion of personal power clearly goes against the idea of rule of law, and worse, some scholars have noted that ''xìnfǎng'' today functions more as an informational collection system for the government than an effective review mechanism.

=== Confucianism and Legalism ===
[[Confucianism]] and [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] are two major Classical legal theories or philosophies developed during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, a time that saw the most impressive proliferation of new ideas and philosophies in Chinese history. While both theories call for governmental hierarchy, they differ drastically in their views of human potential and the preferred means to achieve political order. Nevertheless, both theories have influenced and continue to influence the development of cultural, social, and legal norms in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=The Influence of Confucianism on the Construction of the Chinese Political and Juridical System|date=2008|ssrn=1288392|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Confucianism ====
The basic premise of Confucianism is the idea that human beings are fundamentally good. With this optimistic view on human potential, Confucius advocates for ruling through ''li'' – traditional customs, mores, and norms – which allow people to have a sense of shame and become humane people with good character, rather than through government regulations and penal law. The idea is that people will internalize the acceptable norms and only take proper actions. This will not only lead to a harmonious social order, but it will also provide the additional benefit of improving an individual’s inner character and the overall quality of the society. In contrast, codified laws require external compliance, and people may abide by the laws without fully understanding the reason for compliance. As such, a social order achieved through formal laws does not come with the additional benefit of better citizenry. It is worth noting, however, that even Confucius did not advocate for the elimination of formal laws. Rather, according to Confucius, laws should be used minimally and reserved only for those that insist on pursuing one’s self-interests without taking into account the well being of the society.

As Confucius rejects the general use of formal laws to achieve social order, what lies vital to Confucius’ theory is the willing participation by citizens of the society to search for commonly accepted, cooperative solutions. In addition to willing participation of citizens, there must also be grounds or bases upon which commonly acceptable solutions can be arrived at – the concept known as ''li''. ''Li'' is commonly understood as a set of culturally and socially valued norms that provide guidance to proper behaviors that will ultimately lead to a harmonious society. These norms are not fixed or unchangeable over time but rather a reflection of what is accepted at a particular time in a particular context. When conflicts arise, the ''li'' have to be applied and interpreted to produce a just result and restore the harmony of the society. However, in the absence of any procedural safeguard afforded by codified laws, interpretation of ''li'' is subject to abuse.

Recognizing that people in a society hold diverse interests, Confucius charges the ruler with the responsibility to unify these interests and maintain social order. This is not done by dictatorship but by setting an example. Therefore, a ruler needs not to force his people to behave properly. Instead, the ruler needs only to make himself respectful, and the people will be induced and enlightened by his superior virtues to follow his example – an ideal known as ''wúwéi''. Nevertheless, the ruler must know and understand the ''li'' to be able to create solutions to conflict and problems the society faces. As the people are to follow the moral standards and example set by the ruler, to a large extent, the quality of the ruler determines the quality of the political order.

==== Legalism ====
In contrast to Confucius’ ''li''-based theory, the Legalism advocates the utilization of codified laws and harsh punishment to achieve social order. This is due to the legalists’ belief that all human beings are born evil and self-interested. Therefore, if left unrestrained, people would engage in selfish behavior which will undoubtedly lead to social unrest. To cure this defect and force people to behave morally, the only way, believed the legalists, is to publicly promulgate clearly written laws and impose harsh punishments.

Realizing that the abilities of rulers are often limited and that reliance on the ruler’s ability and judgment often leads to adverse results, the legalists designed a system in which the law is run by the state, not the ruler. This ensures that the laws will be applied impartially without the interference of personal bias of the ruler or ones who are responsible for applying the laws. It also makes it irrelevant whether the ruler has superior abilities. This non-action promoted by the legalists is their understanding of the concept of ''wuwei'', which is different from the Confucians’ understanding of the same concept.

==== Comparison ====
Notwithstanding such an understanding, the ruler, like in Confucianism, has the ultimate authority to decide what the law should be. Therefore, like Confucianism, Legalism is subject to abuse as well. In fact, the Qin emperor implemented strict laws and extremely harsh punishments without taking into account mitigating circumstances even for insignificant crimes. For example, books were burned and people holding different ideals were buried alive. While the Qin emperor successfully instilled fear and respect for law into the minds of his people, the harshness of the law led to his quick demise after only 14 years of reigning over China.

In summary, although both Confucianism and Legalism were developed in a period of turmoil and both were aimed at the re-unification of the country, the two theories went opposite directions with one advocating for and one against the use of formal laws to achieve social order. What the two theories have in common is their concession of the ultimate authority to the ruler, who remained above and beyond the li or law. It is true that neither theory is ideal in achieving a social order. Nevertheless, both theories have had a significant impact on the cultural and legal development in China, and their influence remains visible today.

The significant influence of the Legalist tradition in Chinese law has historically been overlooked. Although the Confucian ideology provided the fundamentals for the substance of traditional law, the Legalist school constructed the important framework of the traditional legal system. The [[Han dynasty]] retained the basic legal system established under the Qin but modified some of the harsher aspects in line with the Confucian philosophy of social control.

The Han dynasty formally recognized four sources of law: ''lü'' (律: "codified laws"), ''ling'' (令: "the emperor's order"), ''ke'' (科: "statutes inherited from previous dynasties") and ''bi'' (比: "precedents"), among which ''ling'' has the highest binding power over the other three. Most legal professionals were not lawyers but generalists trained in philosophy and literature. The local, classically trained, Confucian gentry played a crucial role as arbiters and handled all but the most serious local disputes.

Eventually, the incorporation of the essentials of Confucianist ''li'' into legal codes occurred with this Confucian conception dominating ancient Chinese law. Ch'ü concludes that the gradual process of Confucianisation of law was the most significant development in the legal system of China prior to 20th century modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'ü T'ung-tsu, ''Law and Society in Traditional China'' (Paris: Mouton &amp; Co., 1965) at 280.&lt;/ref&gt; The line between ruling by moral influence and ruling by punishment was not always clearly delineated. For example, ''li'' could be enforced by moral influence and legal means. The metamorphosis of ''li'' into law depended on its widespread and unvaried acceptance by society.

Although the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of law was largely completed by the ''[[Tang Code]]'' of CE 624, throughout the centuries the Confucian foundations of the Tang Code were retained, and indeed with some aspects of it strengthened by the later dynasties. ''The Great Ming Code'', which was a model for the Qing code, covered every part of social and political life, especially family and ritual, but also foreign relations and even relations of earthly life with the cosmos. {{sfnp|Jiang|2005|p=Introduction}}

The Confucian notion that morality and self-discipline was more important than legal codes caused many historians, such as [[Max Weber]], until the mid-20th century to conclude that law was not an important part of Imperial Chinese society. This notion, however, has come under extreme criticism and is no longer the conventional wisdom among Sinologists, who have concluded that Imperial China had an elaborate system of both criminal and civil law which was comparable to anything found in Europe.

During the Qing dynasty, criminal justice was based on extremely detailed ''[[Great Qing Legal Code]]''. One element of the traditional Chinese criminal justice system is the notion that criminal law has a moral purpose, one of which is to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of [[torture]], in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All [[capital punishment|capital offenses]] were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the [[List of Emperors of the Qing Dynasty|emperor]].

There was no [[civil code]] separate from the [[criminal code]], which led to the now discredited belief that traditional Chinese law had no civil law. More recent studies have demonstrated that most of the magistrates' legal work was in civil disputes, and that there was an elaborate system of [[Private law|civil law]] which used the criminal code to establish [[torts]].

== Modernization ==
The introduction and translation of Western legal texts into Chinese is believed to have been started under the auspices of [[Lin Zexu]] in 1839. More systematic introduction of Western law together with other Western sciences started with the establishment of [[Tongwen Guan]] in 1862. The major efforts in translation of Western law that continued until the 1920s prepared the building blocks for modern Chinese legal language and Chinese law.&lt;ref&gt;Yu Jiang, "Jindai Zhongguo faxue yuci de xingcheng yu fazhan" [近代中国法学语词的形成与发展: "Formation and development of modern Chinese legal language and terms"] in ''Zhongxi falü chuantong'' [中西法律传统: "Chinese and Western Legal Tradition"], vol. 1 (Beijing: Zhongguo zhengfa daxue chubanshe, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Legal translation was very important from 1896 to 1936 during which period the Chinese absorbed and codified their version of Western laws. These efforts were assisted by the medium of the Japanese legal language and law developed in Japan during the [[Meiji period]] which involved in large part Japanese translation of [[civil law (legal system)|European Continental laws]].

In the late [[Qing dynasty]] there was a concerted effort to establish legal codes based on European models. Because of the German victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and because Japan was used as the model for political and legal reform, the law codes which were adopted were modeled closely after that of Germany.

Attitudes toward the traditional Chinese legal system changed markedly in the late-20th century. Most Chinese and Westerners of the early 20th century regarded the traditional Chinese legal system as backward and barbaric. However, extensive research into China's traditional legal system has caused attitudes to become more favorable in the late-20th and early 21st centuries. Researchers of the early and mid-20th century tended to compare the traditional Chinese legal system to then contemporary systems, finding the former to be backward. However, more recent research compared the 18th-century Chinese legal system to European systems of the 18th century, resulting in a far more positive view of traditional Chinese law. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The Department of Punishment was changed to ''fa bu'' (法部: "Department of Law") in the early 1900s legal reforms.

=== Republic of China ===
{{Main|Law of the Republic of China}}
Law in the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) is mainly a civil law system. The legal structure is codified into the [[Six Codes]]: the Constitution, the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedures, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedures and in Administrative Laws.

=== People's Republic of China ===
{{Main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}

After the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist victory]] in 1949, the newly established People's Republic of China (PRC) quickly abolished the ROC's legal codes and attempted to create a system of [[socialist law]] copied from the [[Soviet law|Soviet Union]]. With the [[Sino-Soviet split]] (1960-1989) and the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976), all legal work came under suspicion of being counter-revolutionary, and the legal system completely collapsed.

Over the past century [[Constitution of China (disambiguation)|China has had several constitutions]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-Yee Chen (1992), pp. 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempts towards implementing a constitution in China occurred during the final decade (1902-1912) of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Various controlling groups subsequently promulgated different constitutions between that time and the establishment of the PRC in 1949. The PRC had a provisional constitution from its inception until the enactment of its first constitution in 1954. This initial constitution was based on the constitution of the Soviet Union. It was shortly ignored, however, and became without legal force. Although it provided for the election of the [[National People’s Congress]] (NPC) every four years as the highest state power, these guidelines were not adhered to. The second constitution of the PRC, modeled on the ideology of the Cultural Revolution, came into force in 1975. This constitution subjected the NPC to the [[Communist Party of China]] and removed previous constitutional protections such as equality under the law and private-property succession rights. It was also immediately disregarded through breaches of its provisions and non-adherence to guidelines regarding the NPC. The third constitution of the PRC was adopted in 1978. Although this version moved away from the ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, it did retain some remnants of it. It also retained Communist Party control over the state structure. However, reformists subsequently gained power, which led to the breakdown of this constitution as focus shifted to economic construction and modernization.

With the start of the [[Deng Xiaoping]] reforms (ca 1979), the need for reconstructing a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses was seen.{{by whom|date=May 2016}} In 1982 the National People's Congress adopted a new [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|state constitution]] that emphasized the rule of law under which even party leaders are theoretically held accountable. Legal reconstruction occurred in piece-meal fashion. Typically, temporary or local regulations would be established; after a few years of experimentation, conflicting regulations and laws would be standardized.

The {{as of | 2016 | alt = current}} Constitution of the PRC, enacted in 1982, reflects the model of the first PRC constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-Yee Chen (1992), pp. 45-54.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution provides for [[leadership]] through the working class, led in turn by the Communist Party. This Constitution also contains more extensive rights than any of the previous constitutions. The rights include equality before the law, political rights, religious freedom, personal freedom, social and economic rights, cultural and educational rights, and familial rights. These rights, however, are connected to social duties. The duties include safeguarding the unity, security, honor, and interests of the country, observing law and social ethics, paying taxes, and serving in the military. Neither the rights nor duties provided for in the Constitution are exhaustive.

The Constitution provides that the NPC is the supreme organ of state power over a structure of other people's congresses at various levels.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-Yee Chen (1992), pp. 48-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The NPC has power to:

* amend the Constitution by a two-thirds majority
* promulgate legislation
* elect and remove highest-level officials
* determine the budget
* control economic and social-development planning

The NPC also includes a [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] that functions much as the NPC does when the NPC is not in session. Although the Standing Committee has had some powers since 1955, its law-making powers were initially provided for in the 1982 Constitution. The NPC sits at the highest level in the hierarchy of governmental structure in the PRC. This national level is followed in descending order by the provincial level (including autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the national level), the [[Prefectures of the People's Republic of China|prefectural]] level, the [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|county]] level, and the townships and towns level. Government members at the lower two levels are directly elected, and those at the higher levels are elected by the lower levels. In addition to the NPC, the provincial people's congresses possesses legislative power and can pass laws so long as they do not contravene the Constitution or higher legislation or administrative regulations.

The Constitution states its own supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-Yee Chen (1992), pp. 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been theorized{{by whom|date=May 2016}} that the supremacy of the Communist Party means that the Constitution and law are not supreme, and that this perspective results from the [[Marxism|Marxist]] view of law as simply a [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] combined with a lack of recognition of rule of law in philosophical or historical tradition. Although the Constitution provides for legislative, executive, judicial, and [[Supreme People's Procuratorate|procuratorial]] powers, they all remain subject to Communist Party leadership. Often, important political decisions are made through actions which are not regulated by the Constitution. Additionally, [[Court system of the People's Republic of China|court]]s need not rely on the Constitution in deciding cases, and they may not review legislation for Constitutionality.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Nonetheless the Constitution does provide the linguistic framework for conducting government affairs and describing them in the media.

Since 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 300 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. The use of [[Law enforcement in China|mediation committee]]s, informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties, is one innovative device. More than 800,000 such committees operate - in both [[rural]] and urban areas.

In drafting the new laws, the PRC has not copied any other legal system wholesale, and the general pattern has involved issuing laws for a specific topic or location. Often laws are drafted on a trial basis, with the law being redrafted after several years. This process of creating a legal infrastructure piecemeal has led to many situations where the laws are missing, confusing, or contradictory, and has led to judicial decisions having more [[legal precedent|precedent]]al value than in most [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. In formulating laws, the PRC has been influenced by a number of sources, including traditional Chinese views toward the role of law, the PRC's socialist background, the German-based law of the [[Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]], and the [[England and Wales|English]]-based [[common law]] used in Hong Kong.

Legal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. The Chinese government has promoted a reform it often calls "[[legalisation]]" (法制化). Legalisation, among other things, has provided the régime with a gloss of legitimacy and has enhanced predictability.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} There have been major efforts in the rationalization and strengthening of the legal structure and institution building in terms of developing and improving the professionalism of the legislature, judiciary and legal profession. As [[Chinese economic reform|market reform]]s have deepened and social inequality has widened, legal forums – ranging from [[mediation]] and [[arbitration]] commissions to courts – have come to play an increasingly prominent role.

The 1994 Administrative Procedural Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or [[malfeasance]]. In addition, the [[criminal law]] and the criminal-procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal-law amendments abolished the crime of "[[counter-revolutionary]]" activity. However [[political dissident]]s are sometimes charged on the grounds of subverting state security or of publishing state secrets. Criminal-procedures reforms also encouraged establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. Minor crimes such as prostitution and drug use are sometimes dealt with under [[re-education through labor]] laws. The PRC constitution and laws provide for [[fundamental human rights]], including [[due process]], but some have argued that they are often ignored in practice. (See [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China]].)

The basic principles of Chinese legislative drafting include generality and flexibility. Sometimes excessive generality and omissions in Chinese law, coupled with the wide discretionary powers conferred on local authorities to implement laws, undermines the predictability and certainty of law. Furthermore, as Chinese law is intended{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to be educative, the language of the law is that of the ordinary language comprehensible to the average [[citizen]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} although many laws are drafted in broad and indeterminate language.

As a result of a pending trade war with the [[United States|United States of America]] over violations of [[intellectual property]] rights of American corporations in the early 1990s,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} the [[People's Republic of China's trademark law]] has been modified and {{as of | 1995 | lc = on}} offers significant protections to foreign trademark-owners.&lt;ref name="Alford"&gt;{{cite book | last= Alford | first= William P. | title= To Steal a Book is an Elegant Offense: Intellectual Property Law in Chinese Civilization | publisher= [[Stanford University Press]] | year= 1995 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NahUmDXLYLwC&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn = 0-8047-2270-6 | location = Stanford, California | authorlink = William P. Alford}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

After their respective transfers of sovereignty, Hong Kong and [[Macau]] continue to practice English [[Common Law]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] legal systems respectively, with their own [[Court of Final Appeal (disambiguation)|courts of final appeal]]. In other words, Hong Kong and Macau lie outside of the legal jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, except on constitutional issues.

Due to the growing sophistication of Chinese laws, the expansion of the [[rule of law]], as well as an influx of foreign [[law firm]]s, China has also begun to develop a [[legal services|legal-services]] market. Foreign lawyers have accompanied foreign capital and their clients to China, which has had an immense influence on the promulgation of new Chinese laws based on international norms, especially in regards to intellectual property and [[Corporate law|corporate]] and [[Securities law|securities]] law.&lt;ref name="Alford" /&gt;{{qn|date=May 2016}}

On July 1, 1992, in order to meet growing demand, the Chinese government opened the legal-services market to foreign law-firms, allowing them to establish offices in China when the [[Ministry of Justice]] and the [[State Administration of Industry and Commerce]] (SAOIC) issued the Provisional Regulation of Establishment of Offices by Foreign Law Firms regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130415140013/http://www.oycf.org/Perspectives2/6_063000/internationalization_of_china.htm The Internationalization of China's Legal Services Market&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, many foreign law firms, including the United States' [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]] and [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison]], along with several British firms, incorporated consulting firms in their home countries or in Hong Kong and then set up subsidiaries in Beijing or Shanghai to provide legal services.

However, many regulatory barriers to entry remain to protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the local firms they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China's restrictive legal market can be directly tied{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights in the face of rampant corruption. Information received{{by whom|date=May 2016}} from the State Council Legislative Office suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

While China's legal market continues to open up, China's laws and regulations have helped the development of a number of domestic Chinese firms specializing in working with foreigners to meet the demand of a booming economy. According to ''[[Asia Law and Business]]'' magazine China Awards, the top China firms were{{when|date=May 2016}} [[King &amp; Wood PRC Lawyers]], [[Commerce &amp; Finance Law Offices]], [[Fangda Partners]], [[Haiwen &amp; Partners]], [[Jun He Law Offices]] and [[Lehman, Lee &amp; Xu]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Legal rights ==
Classical Chinese does not have a semantic equivalent to the concept of "rights".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The idea of rights was introduced to China from the West. Its translation as ''quánlì'' (权利) was coined by [[William Alexander Parsons Martin]] in 1864, in his translation of [[Henry Wheaton]]'s ''Elements of International Law''....

== Rule of law ==
One of the most commonly used phrases in contemporary China, by legal scholars and politicians alike, is fǎzhì (法治). Fǎzhì can be translated into English as “[[rule of law]]”, but questions have often been asked whether Chinese leaders meant "rule by law", which means the instrumental use of laws by rulers to facilitate social control and to impose punishment as understood in the Legalist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Chelan Li, The “Rule of Law” Policy in Guangdong: Continuity or Departure? Meaning, Significance and Processes. (2000), 199-220.
 Reply Forward&lt;/ref&gt; The related concepts of yǐ fǎzhì guó (以法治国: "governing the nation with law") and jiànshè shèhuì zhǔyì fǎzhì guójiā (建设社会主义法制国家: "building a socialist rule of law state") have been part of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s official policy since the mid-1990s. In 1999, the NPC adopted an amendment to the Chinese Constitution, incorporating both concepts in Article 5.

The existence of the rule of law in China has been widely debated.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Peerenboom &amp; He Xin, ''Dispute Resolution in China: Patterns, Causes, and Prognosis'', 4 [[East Asia Law Review]] (2009), found at [http://www.pennealr.com/pages/issues/volume_4/issue_1.php Penne. ALR website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325094835/http://www.pennealr.com/pages/issues/volume_4/issue_1.php |date=2011-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing Chinese law, it is worth noting that various expressions have been used, including “strengthening the law,” “tightening up the legal system,” “abiding by the law in administration,” “rule by law,” and the “rule of law”. Different shades of meanings have been attached to each of these terms, but Chinese officials and scholars have employed the expressions rather loosely and sometimes interchangeably.&lt;ref name="The 2000"&gt;Linda Chelan Li, The “Rule of Law” Policy in Guangdong: Continuity or Departure? Meaning, Significance and Processes. (2000), 199-220.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the central government had originally preferred the expression, “strengthening the law/legal system” to “the rule of law”. It was thought that the latter might give a controversial connotation of the instrumentality, while the former conveyed a straightforward meaning of strengthening the law and institutions. “Strengthening the law” meant reform of legislation and [[Law enforcement in the People's Republic of China|enforcement of laws]].&lt;ref name="The 2000" /&gt;
There are differing theories of the rule of law. One theory is the "thin", or formal, theory of rule of law, and the other is the "thick" theory.

The "thin" theory of rule of law is described by Randall Peerenboom as at the basest level incorporating a legal system that imposes meaningful restraints on the state and individuals in ruling power, that the law is supreme, and that all citizens are equal before the law (Peerenboom, 2). According to Lon Fuller’s account of thin theory, rule of law exists in a society when the laws of that society are “general, public, prospective, clear, consistent, capable of being followed, stable, and enforced” (Peerenboom, 3). The thin theory has also been explained by Joseph Raz as emphasizing the formal or instrumental aspects of a legal system regardless of whether it is part of a particular political structure, i.e. a democratic or non-democratic society.[14] Thick theory rule of law espouses all the elements of thin theory in addition imposes a political, social, and economic concept into the rule of law. The [[rule of law]] is regarded by some as presupposing political or economic structures of [[liberal democracy]], [[human rights]] and other ideal socio-legal order.[11] Some scholars believe that given China's socialist and non-democratic political system and practice, it is at best regarded as a country of rule by law with law used by the state as an instrument for social control.[12] However, others rely on the formal or thin theory of rule of law to interpret fazhi as a legal reality in China.[13] Additionally, some believe that China may still fall short of the thin theory of rule of law.

Of particular relevance to the second principle set out above, was the enactment of the Administrative Permission Law of the PRC (APL) on 27 August 2003, effective from July 2004. The APL for the first time requires all laws and regulations that subject any civil act to approval requirements to be published.&lt;ref name="China Briefing Business Guide: North East China"&gt;{{cite web|title=China Briefing Business Reports|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/download.php?download_file=ChinaBriefing_200506.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225181134/http://www.china-briefing.com/user/login?goto=download.php?download_file=ChinaBriefing_200506.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-25|publisher=Asia Briefing|year=2008|accessdate=2009-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APL also provides that only those laws adopted by the National People’s Congress or its Standing Committee, administrative regulations promulgated by the State Council, and local regulations adopted by the local people’s congresses may impose administrative approval requirements. Individual ministries or agencies (central or local) do not have such powers except in specified circumstances. This is consistent with the hierarchy of laws and regulations provided under the Legislative Law of the PRC. The enactment of the APL represents an encouraging step forward.&lt;ref name="China Briefing Business Guide: North East China" /&gt;

Despite the newly elevated role of courts in Chinese society, there still remains some consensus about defects in China’s legal system in regards to progressing towards the rule of law. Scholars point to the following defects as slowing movement toward rule of law. These include:
* First, the [[National People’s Congress]] is ineffective at executing its constitutional duty to legislate and supervise the government.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-yee Chen, An Introduction to the Legal Systems of the People’s Republic of China, Butterworths Asia (1992), 80-82.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Constitution]] is not treated as the supreme law, nor is it enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 107; Randal Peerenboom, China’s Long March Toward Rule of Law, Cambridge University Press (2002), 61&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third, the judiciary is not independent from political pressure. On the other hand, direct intervention in particular cases by the CCP has lessened in recent years, as has the direct influence of the CCP on the legislative process.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 106, 117-121&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fourth, there is a high level of corruption among public officials. Personal favors, bribery, and taking of public monies are all too common at all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, 295-297&lt;/ref&gt;
* Finally, the legal profession is inadequate for lack of qualified attorneys and judges.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 121-123&lt;/ref&gt; This failure is being remedied by legislation aimed at instituting higher educational standards for judges, opening more courts and law schools throughout China.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, 290-293&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the [[Weiquan movement]] began in the PRC, seeking to advance citizens' rights partly by petitioning for enforcement of existing laws, and partly through activism. Lawyers in the movement have seen some court victories, but in other cases they are unsuccessful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41661">In [[armed conflict]]s, the '''civilian casualty ratio''' (also '''civilian death ratio''', '''civilian-combatant ratio''', etc.) is the [[ratio]] of [[civilian casualties]] to [[combatant]] [[casualties]], or total casualties. The measurement can apply either to casualties inflicted by or to a particular [[belligerent]], casualties inflicted in one aspect or arena of a conflict or to casualties in the conflict as a whole. Casualties usually refer to both dead and injured. In some calculations, deaths resulting from [[famine]] and [[epidemics]] are included.

Starting in the 1980s, it was often claimed that 90 percent of the victims of modern wars were [[civilians]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahnert, M., D. Pitt, et al., Eds. (1983). ''Children and War: Proceedings of Symposium at Siuntio Baths, Finland, 1983.'' Geneva and Helsinki, [[Geneva International Peace Research Institute]], IPB and Peace Union of Finland, p. 5, which states: "Of the human victims in the First World War only 5% were civilians, in the Second World War already 50%, in Vietnam War between 50 - 90 % and according to some information in Lebanon 97%. It has been appraised that in a conventional war in Europe up to 99% of the victims would be civilians."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Graça Machel]], [http://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf "The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children,''  Report of the expert of the Secretary-General, 26 Aug 1996, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Kaldor]], [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=XVgVstFi0XUC&amp;dq=mary+kaldor&amp;q=90+per+cent#v=snippet&amp;q=90%20per%20cent&amp;f=false ''New and Old Wars: Organized Violence in a Global Era'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1999, p. 107.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Zinn]], Moises Samam, Gino Strada.

Uppsala, Department of Peace and Conflict Research, [[Uppsala University]].&lt;/ref&gt; which includes [[refugees]] and [[internally displaced persons]] as casualties. Other authors cite [[Ruth Leger Sivard]]'s 1991 monograph in which the author states "In the decade of the 1980s, the proportion of civilian deaths jumped to 74 percent of the total and in 1990 it appears to have been close to 90 percent."&lt;ref&gt;Sivard, R. L. (1991). ''World Military and Social Expenditures 1991.'' Washington DC, World Priorities, Inc. Vol. 14, pp 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most comprehensive examination of civilian war deaths throughout history is by [[William Eckhardt (law)|William Eckhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/20/1/89.full.pdf Eckhardt, W. "Civilian deaths in wartime." ''Security Dialogue'' 20(1): 89-98.] Also at [http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/20/1/89.extract]&lt;/ref&gt; in which Eckhardt states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the average, half of the deaths caused by war happened to civilians, only some of whom were killed by famine associated with war...The civilian percentage share of war-related deaths remained at about 50% from century to century. (p. 97)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mexican Revolution (1910–20)==
Although it is estimated that over 1 million people died in the [[Mexican Revolution]], most died from disease and hunger as an indirect result of the war. Combat deaths are generally agreed to have totaled about 250,000. According to Eckhardt, these included 125,000 civilian deaths and 125,000 combatant deaths, creating a civilian-combatant death ratio of 1:1 among combat deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat2.htm Twentieth Century Atlas&amp;nbsp;– Death Tolls].

Retrieved 2010-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
{{see also|World War I casualties}}
Some 7 million combatants on both sides are estimated to have died during [[World War I]], along with an estimated 10 million non-combatants, including 6.6 million civilians.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 59%. Boris Urlanis notes a lack of data on civilian losses in the Ottoman Empire, but estimates 8.6 million military killed and dead and 6 million civilians killed and dead in the other warring countries.&lt;ref&gt;Urlanis, Boris, ''War and Population'', pp. 209 and 268, rounded off.&lt;/ref&gt; The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 42%. Most of the civilian fatalities were due to famine, [[typhus]], or [[Spanish flu]] rather than combat action. The relatively low ratio of civilian casualties in this war is due to the fact that the front lines on the main battlefront, the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]], were static for most of the war, so that civilians were able to avoid the combat zones.

[[Chemical weapons in World War I|Chemical weapons were widely used by all sides during the conflict]] and wind frequently carried poison gas into nearby towns where civilians did not have access to [[gas masks]] or warning systems. An estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties were affected by the use of chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more died from the effects of such weapons in the years after the conflict ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D. Hank Ellison |date=August 24, 2007 |pages=567–570 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-8493-1434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War Made New: Weapons, Warriors, and the Making of the Modern World |author=Max Boot |date=August 16, 2007 |pages=245–250 |publisher=Gotham |isbn=978-1-5924-0315-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany suffered 750,000 civilian dead during and after the war due to famine caused by the [[blockade of Germany|Allied blockade]]. [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] suffered civilian casualties in the millions in the [[Russian Civil War]] and invasion of [[Anatolia]] respectively.&lt;ref name=neiberg_pp68-70/&gt; [[Armenia]] suffered up to 1.5 million civilians dead in the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Urlanis, Boris, ''War and Population'', p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
{{see also|World War II casualties}}
According to most sources, [[World War II]] was the most lethal war in world history, with some 70 million killed in six years. The civilian to combatant fatality ratio in World War II lies somewhere between 3:2 and 2:1, or from 60% to 67%.&lt;ref name=sadowski_p134&gt;Sadowski, p. 134. See the [[World War II casualties]] article for a detailed breakdown of casualties.&lt;/ref&gt; The high ratio of civilian casualties in this war was due in part to the increasing effectiveness and lethality of strategic weapons which were used to target enemy industrial or population centers, and [[famines]] caused by economic disruption. A substantial number of civilians in this war were also deliberately killed by [[Axis Powers]] as a result of racial policies (for example, the [[Holocaust]]) or [[ethnic cleansing]] campaigns.&lt;ref name=neiberg_pp68-70&gt;Neiberg, Michael S. (2002): ''Warfare in World History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=PLQ9N1f7HnAC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22civilian+casualties%22+%22world+war+i%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c50ATabrFs2HcbmYxasH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=28&amp;ved=0CLMBEOgBMBs#v=onepage&amp;q=%22civilian%20casualties%22%20%22world%20war%20i%22&amp;f=false pp. 68-70], Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-22954-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean War==
The median total estimated Korean civilian deaths in the [[Korean War]] is 2,730,000. The total estimated North Korean combatant deaths is 213,000 and the estimated Chinese combatant deaths is over 400,000. In addition to this the Republic of Korea combatant deaths is around 134,000 dead and the combatant deaths for the [[United Nations]] side is around 49,000 dead and missing (40,000 dead, 9,000 missing). The estimated total Korean war military dead is around 793,000 deaths. The civilian-combatant death ratio in the war is approximately 2:1 or 67%. One source estimates that 20% of the total population of North Korea perished in the war.&lt;ref name=deane_p149&gt;Deane, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam War==
The Vietnamese government has estimated the number of Vietnamese civilians killed in the [[Vietnam War]] at two million, and the number of [[North Vietnamese Army|NVA]] and [[Viet Cong]] killed at 1.1 million—estimates which approximate those of a number of other sources.&lt;ref name=shenon&gt;[http://www.virtual.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/232/2322414020.pdf "20 Years After Victory"], Philip Shenon, clipping from the Vietnam Center and Archive website.&lt;/ref&gt; This would give a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of approximately 2:1, or 67%. These figures do not include civilians killed in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]. However, the lowest estimate of 411,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB6.1A.GIF |title=Table 6.1A - Vietnam Democide Estimates Sources and Calculations |publisher=University of Hawaii |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; civilians killed during the war (including civilians killed in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]) would give a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of approximately 1:3, or 37%. Using the lowest estimate of Vietnamese military deaths, 400,000, the ratio is about 1:1.

==Chechen wars==
During the [[First Chechen War]], 4,000 separatist fighters and 40,000 civilians are estimated to have died, giving a civilian-combatant ratio of 10:1. The numbers for the [[Second Chechen War]] are 3,000 fighters and 13,000 civilians, for a ratio of 43:10. The combined ratio for both wars is 76:10. Casualty numbers for the conflict are notoriously unreliable. The estimates of the civilian casualties during the First Chechen war range from 20,000 to 100,000, with remaining numbers being similarly unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Christoph | last = Zürcher |author-link=Christoph Zuercher| title = The post-Soviet wars: rebellion, ethnic conflict, and nationhood in the Caucasus | page = 100 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C0DTtKEktdEC| isbn = 9780814797099 | date = November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactics employed by Russian forces in both wars were heavily criticized by human rights groups, which accused them of indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilian areas and other crimes.&lt;ref name=hrw1996&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1996/WR96/Helsinki-16.htm "Russian Federation - Human Rights Developments"], [[Human Rights Watch]] report, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/web/ar2001.nsf/webeurcountries/RUSSIAN+Federation?OpenDocument Russian Federation 2001 Report]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114184928/http://www.web.amnesty.org/web/ar2001.nsf/webeurcountries/RUSSIAN%2BFEDERATION?OpenDocument |date=November 14, 2007 }} [[Amnesty International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==NATO in Yugoslavia==
{{see also|Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force}}

In 1999, [[NATO]] intervened in the [[Kosovo War]] with a bombing campaign against Yugoslav forces, who were alleged to be conducting a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]]. The bombing lasted about 2½ months, until forcing the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Kosovo.

Estimates for the number of casualties caused by the bombing vary widely depending on the source. NATO unofficially claimed a toll of 5,000 enemy combatants killed by the bombardment; the Yugoslav government, on the other hand, gave a figure of 638 of its security forces killed in Kosovo.&lt;ref name=larson_p71&gt;Larson, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates for the civilian toll are similarly disparate. [[Human Rights Watch]] counted approximately 500 civilians killed by the bombing; the Yugoslav government estimated between 1,200 and 5,000.&lt;ref name=larson_p65&gt;Larson, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the NATO figures are to be believed, the bombings achieved a civilian to combatant kill ratio of about 1:10, on the Yugoslav government's figures, conversely, the ratio would be between 4:1 and 10:1. If the most conservative estimates from the sources cited above are used, the ratio was around 1:1.

According to military historian and Israeli Ambassador to the United States [[Michael Oren]], for every [[Serbia]]n soldier killed by [[NATO]] in 1999 (the period in which [[Operation Allied Force]] took place), four civilians died, a civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 4:1. Oren cites this figure as evidence that "even the most moral army can make mistakes, especially in dense urban warfare".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Oren, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/09/24/un_report_a_victory_for_terror/ UN report a victory for terror], Boston Globe 24-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afghanistan War==
{{see also|Civilian casualties in the war in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}
According to the Watson Institute for International &amp; Public Affairs, as of January 2015 roughly 92,000 people had been killed in the Afghanistan war, of which over 26,000 were civilians, for a civilian to combatant ratio of 0.4:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://costsofwar.org/article/afghan-civilians "Afghan Civilians | Costs of War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616010655/http://costsofwar.org/article/afghan-civilians |date=2013-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq War==
{{see also|Casualties of the Iraq War}}
According to a 2010 assessment by John Sloboda of [[Iraq Body Count]], a United Kingdom-based organization, American and Coalition forces had killed at least 28,736 combatants as well as 13,807 civilians in the [[Iraq War]], indicating a civilian to combatant casualty ratio inflicted by coalition forces of 1:2.&lt;ref name=katz&gt;{{cite news |first=Yaakov |last=Katz |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?ID=193196&amp;R=R1 |title=Analysis: Lies, leaks, death tolls &amp; statistics |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, overall, figures by the [[Iraq Body Count]] from 20 March 2003 to 14 March 2013 indicate that of 174,000 casualties only 39,900 were combatants, resulting in a civilian casualty rate of 77%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The War in Iraq: 10 years and counting|url=https://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/ten-years/|website=Iraq Body Count|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US drone strikes in Pakistan==
{{main|Drone attacks in Pakistan#Civilian casualties}}
The civilian casualty ratio for [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan]] is notoriously difficult to quantify. The U.S. itself puts the number of civilians killed from drone strikes in the last two years at no more than 20 to 30, a total that is far too low according to a spokesman for the [[NGO]] [[Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict|CIVIC]].&lt;ref name=mcclatchy_10dec2010&gt;[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/12/10/105104/pakistanis-protest-civilian-deaths.html "Pakistanis protest civilian deaths in U.S. drone attacks"], Saeed Shah, mcclatchy.com, 2010-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, Daniel L. Byman of the [[Brookings Institution]] suggests that drone strikes may kill "10 or so civilians" for every militant killed, which would represent a civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 10:1. Byman argues that civilian killings constitute a humanitarian tragedy and create dangerous political problems, including damage to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government and alienation of the Pakistani populace from America.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Byman, [http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2009/07/14-targeted-killings-byman Do Targeted Killings Work?], Brookings 14-07-2009&lt;/ref&gt; An ongoing study by the [[New America Foundation]] finds non-militant casualty rates started high but have declined steeply over time, from about 60% (3 out of 5) in 2004–2007 to less than 2% (1 out of 50) in 2012. The study puts the overall non-militant casualty rate since 2004 at 15–16%, or a 1:5 ratio, out of a total of between 1,908 and 3,225 people killed in Pakistan by drone strikes since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones "The Year of the Drone: An Analysis of U.S. Drone Strikes in Pakistan, 2004-2012"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830000000/http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones |date=August 30, 2011 }}, New America Foundation. Retrieved 2012-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli–Palestinian conflict==
Estimates of civilian casualties from the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] differ. A 2007 report by the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)]] found that, from the beginning of the second intifada in September 2000 until the end of July 2007, at least 5,848 people were killed in the conflict, over half of whom were civilians. Amongst those killed in that period, 69% of Israelis were civilians, while the report estimated 59% of Palestinian casualties were civilians, although the status of a large number of Palestinian victims was unknown.&lt;ref name="Ocha report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli-Palestinian Fatalities Since 2000 - Key Trends|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/BE07C80CDA4579468525734800500272|publisher=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]]|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,010 Israelis were killed between September 29, 2000 and January 1, 2005. Of these, 773 were civilians killed in Palestinian attacks, resulting in a ratio of approximately 5:1.&lt;ref name=statspage&gt;[http://212.150.54.123/casualties_project/stats_page.cfm "ICT Middleastern Conflict Statistics Project"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703000000/http://212.150.54.123/casualties_project/stats_page.cfm |date=July 3, 2007 }}.

There are reports that Israel also used Palestinian civilians as human shields during the First and Second Intifadas, and on at least 14 UN-documented occasions between January 2010 and March 2013 alone, with pictures showing Palestinian minors tied up to the hoods of Israeli military vehicles or in other dangerous situations to prevent any attacks against them.&lt;ref Haaretz June 20, 2013&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.530993 | title=UN: Palestinian Children Tortured, Used as Human Shields by Israel| journal=Haaretz| date=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in May 2012 B'Tselem decided to stop addressing the question of participation in combat, with respect to Palestinians killed in the West Bank, stating that, "while in the past there were complicated incidents in the West Bank that might have met the definition of "combat incidents," in recent years the incidents meeting that definition have been almost nil."&lt;ref name=BTselem_explanation /&gt; B'Tselem has also established a separate category for recording Palestinian police officers killed by Israel; according to B'Tselem, Israel counts the Gaza police force as a non-civilian when calculating the civilian casualty ratio, and states that such a definition is not compatible with the ICRC interpretation of international law.&lt;ref name=BTselem_explanation&gt;B'Tselem, [http://www.btselem.org/statistics/casualties_clarifications ''Explanation of statistics on fatalities''].

Heather Sharp, BBC, 5 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] regards persons as civilians if they do not fulfill a "continuous combat function" (for example, many police officers) and do not participate directly in hostilities.&lt;ref name=BTselem_explanation /&gt; Analysts state that in addition to their civilian roles such as policing traffic, police in Gaza are active in counter-intelligence and fighting dissent.&lt;ref name=BBC_Sharp /&gt;

===Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip===
The head of the [[Shin Bet]] reported to the Israeli Cabinet that of the 810 Palestinians killed in Gaza in 2006 and 2007, 200 were civilians (a ratio of approximately 1:3). ''[[Haaretz]]'' assessed this to be an underestimation of civilian casualties. Using figures from Israeli human rights organisation [[B'Tselem]] they calculated that 816 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza during the two-year period, 360 of whom were civilians.&lt;ref name=HzBR&gt;{{cite news|title=Haaretz probe: Shin Bet count of Gaza civilian deaths is too low
|author=Barak Ravid|work=Haaretz|date=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military journalist Amos Harel wrote in ''[[Haaretz]]'' that the ratio between military targets and civilians was 1:1 in 2002–2003, when half the casualties in air assaults on the Gaza Strip were civilians. He attributed this to an [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) practice of attacking militants even when they had deliberately located themselves in densely populated areas. The ratio improved to 1:28 ratio in late 2005, meaning one civilian killed for every 28 combatants. It lowered, however, to 1:10 in 2006. In 2007, the ratio was at its lowest ever, more than 1:30.&lt;ref name=Harel_pinpoint&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/pinpoint-attacks-on-gaza-more-precise-1.236163 "Pinpoint attacks on Gaza more precise"]. Amos Harel, ''Haaretz'', 30 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Figures showing an improvement from 1:1 in 2002 to 1:30 in 2008 were also cited by ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' journalist Yaakov Katz.&lt;ref name=katz/&gt; However, in operations in Gaza since 2008, the ratio again dropped, as low as 5:2 during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]].&lt;ref name="OCHA2015" /&gt;

On its web blog, the IDF stated that the IDF's civilian-to-terrorist death ratio is the lowest in the world.&lt;ref name="idfblog.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idfblog.com/2012/03/11/bombing-gaza-or-pinpoint-strikes/ |title=Israeli Air Force: Bombing Gaza or Pinpoint Strikes? |publisher=Israel Defense Forces |date=2012-03-11 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It says that civilian deaths are caused by the use of human shields by Gazan militant groups, such as [[Hamas#Children and women as human shields|Hamas]]. The IDF blog lists various counter-terrorism methods used by the IDF to minimize civilian casualties and lower the civilian casualty ratio,&lt;ref name="idfblog.com"/&gt; including [[Targeted killings by Israel Defense Forces|pinpoint targeting]], aborting strikes due to risk of civilian casualties, and smartbombs with the ability to cancel a strike whilst in midair.

====Israel in the 2008–09 Gaza War====
{{see also|Casualties of the Gaza War (2008–09)}}
Several analysts have attempted to calculate the [[Israel Defense Forces]]'s civilian casualty ratio in the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|2008–09 Gaza War]]. All have noted that the ratio differs significantly depending on which figures are used regarding the total number of casualties and their identity. The main sets of figures are those published by the IDF, essentially corroborated by [[Hamas]], the opposing belligerent in the conflict, on the one hand; and those published by [[B'Tselem]] on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/hamas-admits-600-700-of-its-men-were-killed-in-cast-lead-1.323776 |title=Hamas admits 600-700 of its men were killed in Cast Lead Israel News |journal=Haaretz |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101101/wl_mideast_afp/israelpalestiniansconflictgazahamastoll |title=Hamas says 300 fighters killed in Gaza war |date=2010-11-02 |publisher=Yahoo News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106061603/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101101/wl_mideast_afp/israelpalestiniansconflictgazahamastoll |archivedate=2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final IDF report identified 709 militants out of a total of 1,161 Gaza fatalities, with another 162 whose status could not be confirmed (300 were ID'd as civilians).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/03/2602.htm Majority of Palestinians Killed in Operation Cast Lead: Terror Operatives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520054835/http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/03/2602.htm |date=2011-05-20 }}," IDF Research Department&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Dror Yemini's article translated from ''Maariv'', "[http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archive/2009/07/ben-dror-yemini-how-many-civilians-were/index.shtml How Many Civilians Were Killed in Gaza?]"&lt;/ref&gt; B'Tselem say 1,391 Palestinians were killed, of whom 759 of them did not take part in the hostilities while 350 did take part in the hostilities, 248 were police officers who were killed inside police stations, and it is not known if 32 who were killed did take part in the hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/castlead_operation Operation Cast Lead, 27 Dec.

The [[Goldstone Report]] into the conflict concluded that while there were many individual Gaza policemen who were members of militant groups, the Gaza police forces were a civilian police force and "cannot be said to have been taking a direct part in hostilities and thus did not lose their civilian immunity from direct attack as civilians".&lt;ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf&gt;{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf|title=Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council|accessdate=September 15, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Yaakov Katz states in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' that the ratio is 1:3 according to the Israeli figures and 60% civilians (3:2) according to B'Tselem's figures. Katz describes the IDF's civilian casaulty ratio in the Gaza War and in the year preceding it as low.&lt;ref name=katz/&gt;

Katz says that over 81 percent of the 5,000 missiles the IDF dropped in the Gaza Strip during the operation were [[smart bombs]], a percentage which he states is unprecedented in modern warfare.&lt;ref name=katz/&gt; Journalist and commentator Evelyn Gordon writes in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' that the civilian casualty ratio in the 2008–09 Gaza War was 39 percent (2:3), using however only the preliminary Israeli estimates, but that 56 or 74 percent were civilians according to B'Tselem's figures, depending on whether 248 Hamas policemen are considered combatants or civilians; and 65 or 83 percent according to the figures of the [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights]]. Gordon says that all of these ratios, even if the worse were correct, are lower than the normal civilian-to-combatant wartime fatality ratio in wars elsewhere, as given by the Red Cross, and states that the comparison shows that the IDF was unusually successful at minimizing civilian casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Evelyn |last=Gordon |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/evelyn-gordon/377631 |title=WikiLeaks and the Gaza War |work=Commentary |date=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

13 Israelis were killed during the conflict, including 10 IDF soldiers (4 killed by [[friendly fire]]),&lt;ref name=btselem /&gt; giving a civilian casualty ratio for Palestinian forces of 24% or 3:10.

Reports of casualties in the [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]] have been made available by a variety of sources.

In March 2015, OCHA reported that 2,220 Palestinians had been killed in the conflict, of whom 1,492 were civilians (551 children and 299 women), 605 militants and 123 of unknown status, giving Israeli forces a ratio of 5:2.&lt;ref name="OCHA2015"&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/annual_humanitarian_overview_2014_english_final.pdf ''Fragmented Lives: Humanitarian Overview, 2014''] [[OCHA]] March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1982 Lebanon War==
In 1982, [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]] with the stated aim of driving the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] away from its northern borders.&lt;ref name=" Sorenson"&gt;{{cite book|last= Sorenson|first=David S. |title=Global Security Watch--Lebanon: A Reference Handbook|year=2010|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-313-36578-2|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The war culminated in a seven-week-long Israeli naval, air and artillery bombardment of Lebanon's capital, [[Beirut]], where the PLO had retreated. The bombardment eventually came to an end with an internationally brokered settlement in which the PLO forces were given safe passage to evacuate the country.&lt;ref name=hartley_pp91-92&gt;Hartley ''et all'', pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Red Cross]], by the end of the first week of the war alone, some 10,000 people, including 2,000 combatants, had been killed, and 16,000 wounded—a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of 5:1.&lt;ref name=layoun_p134&gt;Layoun ''et al'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese government sources later estimated that by the end of the siege of Beirut, a total of about 18,000 had been killed, an estimated 85% of whom were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, November 16, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon: the casualties |doi=10.1177/030639688302400404 |date=1983-04-01 |volume=24 |issue=4 |journal=Race &amp; Class |pages=340–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a civilian to military casualty ratio of about 6:1.

According to Richard A. Gabriel between 1,000 and 3,000 civilians were killed in the southern campaign.&lt;ref name=Gabriel&gt;Gabriel, Richard , A, ''Operation Peace for Galilee, The Israeli-PLO War in Lebanon'', New York: Hill &amp; Wang. 1984, p. 164, 165, {{ISBN|0-8090-7454-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that an additional 4,000 to 5,000 civilians died from all actions of all sides during the siege of Beirut,&lt;ref name=Gabriel/&gt; and that some 2,000 Syrian soldiers were killed during the Lebanon campaign and a further 2,400 PLO guerillas were also killed.&lt;ref name=Gabriel/&gt; Of these, 1,000 PLO guerrillas were killed during the siege.&lt;ref name=Gabriel/&gt; According to Gabriel the ratio of civilian deaths to combatants during the siege was about 6 to 1 but this ratio includes civilian deaths from all actions of all sides.&lt;ref name=Gabriel/&gt;

The '''Day of the Sun''' ({{Korean|hangul=태양절|mr=T'aeyang-jŏl|context=north}}) is an annual [[Public holidays in North Korea|public holiday]] in [[North Korea]] on 15 April, the birth anniversary of [[Kim Il-sung]], founder and [[Eternal leaders of Juche Korea|Eternal President of North Korea]].&lt;ref name="ency_Birt"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Birthday of Kim Il-sung| publisher = Omnigraphics| via = TheFreeDictionary.com| work = Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary| edition = Fourth| date = 2010| accessdate = 3 May 2015| url = http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Birthday+of+Kim+Il-Sung}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most important national holiday in the country,&lt;ref name="usat_Kore"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Korean defectors recall 'Day of the Sun'| author = Calum MacLeod| others = Contributing: Jueyoung Song, Duck Hwa Hong| work = USA Today| date = 26 April 2013| accessdate = 6 April 2015| url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/15/north-korea-defectors/2085161/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to be the North Korean equivalent of [[Christmas]].&lt;ref name="Lee2001"/&gt;  Kim's birthday, which had been an official holiday since 1968, was renamed Day of the Sun in 1997, three years after [[death of Kim Il-sung|his death]]. The name takes its significance from his name; [[Il-sung]] is [[Korean language|Korean]] for "become the sun".

North Koreans commemorate the holiday by visiting locations that have a connection with the leader's life, such as thousands of statues scattered across the country, or [[Mangyongdae]], his birthplace in the capital [[Pyongyang]]. The most important observances take place in the capital, including visits to [[Kumsusan Palace of the Sun]], where Kim Il-sung's body lies in rest, and [[Mansu Hill Grand Monument]], which features a very tall statue of the leader.

The state seeks to provide its citizens with more food and electricity than is normally available, but success is not always guaranteed.&lt;ref name="dail_Spec"/&gt; Children, in particular, receive candy and other gifts attributed to love shown by the leaders.&lt;ref name="dail_KimI"/&gt;

Festivities are not confined to the date. Commemorations occur from 16 February, which is the birthday of [[Kim Jong-il]], during what is known as the Loyalty Festival. Celebrations in April around the Day of the Sun are called the Sun Festival. The day itself is followed by two days of rest, making it a three-day holiday.

==Background==
[[File:Kim Il-sung's birthplace.jpg|thumb|Birthplace of [[Kim Il-sung]] in [[Mangyongdae]]]]
[[Kim Il-sung]] was born on 15 April 1912 in the village of [[Mangyongdae]], which is now a suburb of [[North Korea]]'s capital [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name="Corfield2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corfield|first=Justin|title=Historical Dictionary of Pyongyang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zKWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79|year=2014|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-78308-341-1|page=79|chapter=Kim Il Sung}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been long identified with the [[Sun]]&lt;ref name="Lee2001"/&gt; and is frequently called "Sun of the nation".&lt;ref name="worl_KBSW"/&gt; He adopted his name [[Il-sung]] ({{korean|hangul=일성|hanja=日成|context=north}}), meaning "become the Sun"&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bradley K.|last=Martin|title=Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoZx6hOCNukC&amp;pg=PT48|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=1 April 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4299-0699-9|page=48|via = Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the early 1930s as one of his ''[[noms de guerre]]''.&lt;ref name="Lim201588"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jae-Cheon Lim|title=Leader Symbols and Personality Cult in North Korea: The Leader State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcwqBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT136|accessdate=3 May 2015|date=24 March 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-56740-0|via = Google Books|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kim Il-sung's birthday had been designated as a provisional holiday in 1962. It became official 1968, the year that saw great expansion of his cult of personality in the aftermath of a domestic political crisis known as the [[Kapsan Faction Incident]].&lt;ref name="Lim2015p48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jae-Cheon Lim|title=Leader Symbols and Personality Cult in North Korea: The Leader State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcwqBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT48|accessdate=3 May 2015|date=24 March 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-56740-0|via = Google Books|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the day was promoted the most important holiday of the country.&lt;ref name="worl_KBSW"&gt;{{Cite web | title = N.

The purpose of the Day of the Sun was to celebrate "the greatest festival for the Korean nation," and to initiate a holiday which would be of equal importance to North Koreans as [[Christmas]] is in many other places.&lt;ref name="Lee2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hy-Sang Lee|title=North Korea: A Strange Socialist Fortress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Rx8Q_cxqvkC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=3 May 2015|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96917-2|page=220|via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every fifth and tenth anniversary is marked with more pronounced celebrations than usual.&lt;ref name="worl_KBSW"/&gt; 2012 marked the centenary of the birth of Kim Il-sung.

The '''diocese of Dionysiana''' (in [[Latin]]: Dioecesis Dionysianensis) is a suppressed and [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2d47.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diocese of Dionysos''', was centered on a [[Civitas|Roman town]] of the [[Roman province]] of [[Byzacena]] ( in today's [[Tunisia]]) during [[late antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0641.htm La diocesi] nel sito di www.gcatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
There are three known bishops of this diocese during [[Late antiquity|antiquity]], which is one of the oldest in [[Roman North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], (Leipzig, 1931), p.&amp;nbsp;465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Antonio Morcelli, [https://books.google.it/books?id=dO4-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA151 ''Africa christiana''], Volume I, (Brescia, 1816), pp.&amp;nbsp;151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Ferron, v. ''Dionysiana'' in [http://booksnow.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca2/4/dictionnairedhis13bauduoft/dictionnairedhis13bauduoft.pdf ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques''], vol. IX, 1937, col. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*Pomponio is first known for a letter he wrote in 249 to Bishop [[Cyprian]] of [[Carthage]]. He also participated in two Carthaginian synods ([[Council of Carthage (251)|251]] and [[Council of Carthage (256)|256]]) on the issue of the [[Lapsi (Christianity)|lapsii]]. 
*In 393, the diocese was occupied by a [[Donatist]] bishop of the [[Maximianist]] sect, called Fortunato, who took part in [[Council of Cabarsussi]] against [[Primiano of Carthage]]. 
*Another Donatist, Vittore, was sitting in Dionysia at the [[Council of Carthage (411)]]. 
* Finally, the acts of the council convened by the [[Arianism|Arian]] King [[Huneric]] of the [[Vandal Kingdom]] in 484 show that the diocese was vacant at that time.
The diocese ceased to effectively function with the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] in 698.

Since 1925 Dionysius now survives as a [[titular bishop]]ric and the current bishop is Martín Fassi, auxiliary bishop of San Isidro.
* [[Antonio Malecki]] (1926–1935)&lt;ref&gt;Catholic-Hierarchy menziona un vescovo del XVI secolo, Francisco Puerto, che secondo Konrad Eubel fu invece vescovo titolare di [[Diocesi di Dionisiade|Dionisiade]] (''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002718&amp;mediaType=application/pdf vol. 3], p.&amp;nbsp;186). Inoltre, sia Catholic-Hierarchy sia GCatholic inseriscono, prima di Malecki, Giuseppe Maria Aldanesi, che però fu in realtà anch'egli titolare di [[Diocesi di Dionisiade|Dionisiade]]: [http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-01-1909-ocr.pdf AAS 01] (1909), p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity''''' (1997)&lt;ref name=dnw&gt;{{cite book |title=Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity|author1=Charles Spinosa|author2=Fernando Flores|author3=Hubert L. Dreyfus|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press USA|isbn=0-262-19381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosophical proposal intended to restore or energize [[democracy]] by [[social constructionism]] via an [[argument]] style of [[world disclosure]] but which philosophy is distinct from:
*[[Relativism]] - a concept in which points of view have no absolute truth or validity.
*[[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]] - an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy
*[[Essentialism]] - the view that, for any specific entity (such as an animal, a group of people, a physical object, a concept), there is a set of attributes which are necessary to its identity and function.

Nevertheless, the authors build on these ideas and seek to reformulate the relationship between democratic rights and economic progress when persistent  technological advance obscures an uncertain future for humanity threatened by multiple issues such as  [[peak oil]],  [[global warming]] and [[environmental degradation]]. The book is co-authored by [[Fernando Flores]],  [[Hubert Dreyfus]]  and Charles Spinosa (a consultant philosopher specializing in commercial innovation). They concentrate on three practical activities:

* [[social entrepreneurship]],
* [[active citizenship]] and
* [[solidarity|social solidarity]]

The authors reason that human beings are at their best when engaged in imaginative and practical innovation rather than in abstract reflection, and thus  challenging accepted wisdom and conventional practices within their particular environment, or as the authors claim, when they are making history. History-making, in this account, refers not to political power changes, wars or violent revolution, but to changes in the way people  understand their  personal qualities and deal with their particular situations.

==Structure of the work==
'''[[World disclosure]]''' (German: Erschlossenheit, literally development or comprehension) is a phenomenon first described by the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] in his landmark book [[Being and Time]]. As well as the authors of this work, the idea of disclosing has also been discussed by philosophers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. It refers to how things become intelligible and meaningfully relevant to ordinary people.

==Conclusion==
The authors reiterate the importance of history making and identify thee types of actors:
* The entrepreneur
* The virtuous citizen 
* The culture figure

Each has to overcome [[resistance to change]], but do so in different ways. Solving puzzles request of each a clear [[strategy|strategic]] objective, but use different [[tactic (method)|tactic]]s to overcome obstructions. By understanding and disclosing our objectives, and discovering the sort of role we may have to play according to particular situations to reach those goals, all of us can be "history makers" and make changes to our society by changing the shared narrative that binds our particular culture. The authors quote already changed collective attitudes which have recently become much less tolerant  of road accidents, various forms of discrimination and repressive public education of young people.

They promote a change to the overarching [[consumerism]] as the western world's social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts, in favor of [[sustainable development]]  within individual communities as a precursor to disclosing a new world order that supports [[human equality]]

'''Epode''',&lt;ref&gt;From {{lang-el|ἐπῳδός}}, ''epodos'', "singing to/over, an enchanter."&lt;/ref&gt; in [[poetry|verse]], is the third part of an [[ode]], which followed the [[strophe]] and the [[antistrophe]], and completed the movement.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Epode |volume=9 |page=707 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain point in time the choirs, which had previously chanted to right of the altar or stage, and then to left of it, combined and sang in unison, or permitted the ''[[coryphaeus]]'' to sing for them all, while standing in the centre. With the appearance of [[Stesichorus]] and the evolution of [[choral poetry|choral lyric]], a learned and artificial kind of poetry began to be cultivated in [[Greece]], and a new form, the epode-song, came into existence. It consisted of a verse of iambic trimeter, followed by a verse of iambic dimeter, and it is reported that, although the epode was carried to its highest perfection by Stesichorus, an earlier poet, [[Archilochus]], was really the inventor of this form.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The epode soon took a firm place in choral poetry, which it lost when that branch of literature declined. But it extended beyond the ode, and in the early dramatists we find numerous examples of monologues and dialogues framed on the epodical system. In [[Latin]] poetry the epode was cultivated, in conscious [[archaism]], both as a part of the ode and as an independent branch of poetry. Of the former class, the epithalamia of [[Catullus]], founded on an imitation of [[Pindar]], present us with examples of strophe, antistrophe and epode; and it has been observed that the celebrated ode of [[Horace]], beginning ''Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri'', possesses this triple character.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==''Epodes'' of Horace==

The word is now mainly familiar from an experiment of [[Horace]] in the second class, for he entitled his fifth book of odes ''Epodon liber'' or the ''Book of Epodes''. He says in the course of these poems, that in composing them he was introducing a new form, at least in [[Latin literature]], and that he was imitating the effect of the iambic distichs invented by Archilochus. Accordingly, we find the first ten of these epodes composed in alternate verses of [[iambic trimeter]] and [[iambic dimeter]], as at, for example, ''Epode'' 5.1–2:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{| style="border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space: nowrap;"
! scope="col" width="400px" |

At o Deorum quicquid in coelo regit&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Terras et humanum genus&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
|
But, o any of the gods in the heavens ruling&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the lands and the human race.
|}

In the seven remaining epodes Horace diversified the measures, while retaining the general character of the distich. This group of poems belongs mostly to the early youth of the poet, and displays a truculence and a controversial heat which are absent from his more mature writings. As he was imitating Archilochus in form, he believed himself justified, no doubt, in repeating the sarcastic violence of his fierce model. The curious thing is that these particular poems of Horace, which are really short lyrical satires, have appropriated almost exclusively the name of epodes, although they bear little enough resemblance to the epode of early [[Greek literature]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:WLANL - MicheleLovesArt - Joods Historisch Museum - Levensboom glas in lood - Eli Content (Midden).jpg|thumb|''Tree of Life'' by [[Eli Content]] at the [[Joods Historisch Museum]]. The [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], or {{transl|he|Etz haChayim}} ({{lang|he|עץ החיים}}) in Hebrew, is a mystical symbol used in the Kabbalah of esoteric Judaism to describe the path to [[HaShem]] and the manner in which He created the world {{lang|la|ex nihilo}} (out of nothing).]]
{{wiktionary}}

'''{{lang|la|Ex nihilo}}''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "out of [[nothing]]". It often appears in conjunction with the concept of [[Creationism|creation]], as in {{lang|la|creatio ex nihilo}}, meaning "creation out of nothing", chiefly in philosophical or [[theological]] contexts, but it also occurs in other fields.

In theology, the common phrase {{lang|la|creatio ex nihilo}} ({{Literal translation|"creation out of nothing"|lk=on}}), contrasts with {{lang|la|creatio ex materia}} (creation out of some pre-existent, eternal matter) and {{lang|la|creatio ex deo}} (creation out of the [[being]] of [[God]]). {{lang|la|Creatio continua}} is the ongoing divine creation.

The phrase {{lang|la|ex nihilo}} also appears in the classical philosophical formulation {{lang|la|[[ex nihilo nihil fit]]}}, which means "out of nothing comes nothing".

When used outside of [[religious]] or [[metaphysical]] contexts, {{lang|la|ex nihilo}} also refers to something coming from nothing. For example, in a conversation, one might call a topic "{{lang|la|ex nihilo}}" if it bears no relation to the previous topic of discussion.

==History==
[[Ancient Near Eastern mythologies]] and classical creation myths in [[Greek mythology]] envisioned the creation of the world as resulting from the actions of a god or gods upon already-existing primeval matter, known as ''[[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Rubio, "Time Before Time: Primeval Narratives in Early Mesopotamian Literature"; in ''Time and History in the Ancient Near East: Proceedings of the 56th Recontre Assyriologique Internationale at Barcelona, 26–30 July 2010'', ed. L. Feliu et al.; Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns, 2013; {{ISBN|978-1-57506-255-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early conflation of Greek philosophy with the [[Genesis creation narrative|narratives]] in the Hebrew Bible came from [[Philo of Alexandria]] (d.{{nbsp}}AD{{nbsp}}50), writing in the context of [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Philo equated the Hebrew [[creator deity]], [[Yahweh]], with [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[primum movens]]'' (First Cause)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yonge, Charles Duke (1854) |title=Appendices A Treatise Concerning the World (1): But what can be worse than this, or more calculated to display the want of true nobility existing in the soul, than the notion of causes in general being secondary and created causes, combined with an ignorance of the one first cause, the uncreated God, the Creator of the universe, who for these and innumerable other reasons is most excellent, reasons which because of their magnitude human intellect is unable to apprehend?"

Bohn |url=http://cornerstonepublications.org/Philo |publisher=Cornerstonepublications.org |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928224539/http://cornerstonepublications.org/Philo/ |archivedate=2015-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato Laws Book X, Public Domain-Project Gutenberg. "ATHENIAN: Then I suppose that I must repeat the singular argument of those who manufacture the soul according to their own impious notions; they affirm that which is the first cause of the generation and destruction of all things, to be not first, but last, and that which is last to be first, and hence they have fallen into error about the true nature of the Gods… Then we must say that self-motion being the origin of all motions, and the first which arises among things at rest as well as among things in motion, is the eldest and mightiest principle of change, and that which is changed by another and yet moves other is second."&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to prove that the Jews had held [[monotheistic]] views even before the Greeks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} However, this was still within the context of creation from pre-existing materials (i.e., "moving" or "changing" a material substratum.)

The classical tradition of creation from chaos first came under question in [[Hellenistic philosophy]] (on ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' grounds), which developed the idea that the primum movens must have created the world out of nothing.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Theologians debate whether the Bible itself teaches creation ''ex nihilo''. Traditional interpreters&lt;ref&gt;
Collins, C. John, ''Genesis 1-4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary'' (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&amp;R Publishing, 2006), 50ff.
&lt;/ref&gt; argue on grammatical and syntactical grounds that this is the meaning of {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:1}}, which is commonly rendered: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." They find further support for this view in New Testament passages such as [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 11:3—"By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible" and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 4:11, "For you [God] created all things, and by your will they existed and were created." However, other interpreters&lt;ref&gt;

|quote= If we look into the early Christian sources, it becomes apparent that the thesis of ''creatio ex nihilo'' in its full and proper sense, as an ontological statement, only appeared when it was intended, in opposition to the idea of world-formation from unoriginate matter, to give expression to the omnipotence, freedom and uniqueness of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; understand creation ''ex nihilo'' as a second-century theological development. According to this view, church fathers opposed notions appearing in pre-Christian [[creation myth]]s and in [[Gnosticism]]—notions of creation by a [[demiurge]] out of a primordial state of matter (known in religious studies as ''[[chaos (mythology)|chaos]]'' after the Greek term used by [[Hesiod]] in his ''[[Theogony]]'').&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = Probably the idea of creation never entered the human mind apart from Revelation. Though some of the pagan philosophers attained to a relatively high conception of God as the supreme ruler of the world, they seem never to have drawn the next logical inference of His being the absolute cause of all finite existence. [...] The descendants of Sem and Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob, preserved the idea of creation clear and pure; and from the opening verse of Genesis to the closing book of the Old Testament the doctrine of creation runs unmistakably outlined and absolutely undefiled by any extraneous element. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." In this, the first, sentence of the Bible we see the fountain-head of the stream which is carried over to the new order by the declaration of the mother of the Machabees: "Son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: and consider that God made them out of nothing" (2 Maccabees 7:28). One has only to compare the Mosaic account of the creative work with that recently discovered on the clay tablets unearthed from the ruins of Babylon to discern the immense difference between the unadulterated revealed tradition and the puerile story of the cosmogony corrupted by polytheistic myths. Between the Hebrew and the Chaldean account there is just sufficient similarity to warrant the supposition that both are versions of some antecedent record or tradition; but no one can avoid the conviction that the Biblical account represents the pure, even if incomplete, truth, while the Babylonian story is both legendary and fragmentary (Smith, "Chaldean Account of Genesis", New York, 1875).}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became important to Judaism, to ongoing strands in the Christian tradition, and—as a corollary—to Islam.

The first sentence of the Greek version of Genesis in the [[Septuagint]] starts with the words: ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν, translatable as "in the beginning he made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Gary Alan|title=The Greek of the Septuagint|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=NA-mTy4X_WAC&amp;pg=PR11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A verse of [[2 Maccabees]] (a book written in [[Koine Greek]] in the same sphere of Hellenized Judaism of [[Alexandria]], but predating Philo by about a century) expresses the following: "I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise." (2{{nbsp}}Maccabees 7:28, [[KJV]]).  While those who believe in ''ex nihilo'' point to God creating "things that were not", those who reject creation out of nothing point out that the context mentions the creation of man, who was "made from the dust" and not from absolutely "nothing". Many ancient texts tend to have similar issues, and those on each side tend to interpret the text according to their understanding.

Max Weber summarizes a [[sociology|sociological]] view of the overall development and corollaries of the theological idea:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] As otherworldly expectations become increasingly important, the problem of the basic relationship of god to the world and the problem of the world's imperfections press into the foreground of thought; this happens the more life here on earth comes to be regarded as a merely provisional form of existence when compared to that beyond, the more the world comes to be viewed as something created by god ''ex nihilo'', and therefore subject to decline, the more god himself is conceived as a subject to transcendental goals and values, and the more a person's behavior in this world becomes oriented to his fate in the next. [...]&lt;ref&gt;

==Supporting arguments==

===Logical===
A major argument for ''creatio ex nihilo'', the [[first cause argument]], states in summary:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
# everything that begins to exist has a cause
# the universe began to exist
# therefore, the universe must have a cause

An expansion of the first cause argument is the [[Kalam cosmological argument]], which also requires ''creatio ex nihilo'':{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} 
# Everything that begins to exist has a cause
# The universe began to exist
# Therefore, the universe has a cause.
# If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal creator of the universe exists, who without the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless, and infinitely powerful.
# Therefore, an uncaused, personal creator of the universe exists, who without the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless, and infinitely powerful.

Another argument for ''ex nihilo'' creation comes from [[Claude Nowell]]'s [[Summum]] philosophy that states before anything existed, nothing existed, and if nothing existed, then it must have been possible for nothing to be. If it is possible for nothing to be (the argument goes), then it must be possible for everything to be.&lt;ref&gt;

For Voegelin this is a creatio ex nihilo, which points the finger of questioning towards the yet undifferentiated beyond. If he is right, the Greek philosophers who followed were unanimous in retreating from this seeming violation of the principle of sufficient reason to the principle that ex nihilio nihil fit.[sic]

In ''The Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma'' (''Kitāb al-Amānāt wa l-Iʿtiqādāt'', ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'', completed 933) written by [[Saadia Gaon]] (c. 882−942) the metaphysical problems of the creation of the world and the unity of the Creator are discussed. In this book, Saadia Gaon gives four proofs for the doctrine of the [[Creation myth|creation]] of the world ''ex nihilo'' (''[[Ayin and Yesh|yesh me-ayin]]'').

To harmonize the biblical statement of the creation ''ex nihilo'' with the doctrine of the primordial elements, the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' assumes a double creation, one ideal and the other real.&lt;ref name=JewishEncyclopedia&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=YEẒIRAH, SEFER|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13386-sefer-yezirah|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;br&gt;

In introducing ''Sefer Yetzirah's'' theory of creation Saadia Gaon makes a distinction between the Biblical account of creation ''ex nihilo'', in which no process of creation is described, and ''matter formed by speech'' as described in ''Sefer Yetzirah''. The [[cosmogony]] of ''Sefer Yetzirah'' is even omitted from the discussion of creation in his magnum opus ''Emunoth ve-Deoth''.

===Islamic===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[Early Islamic philosophy]], as well as key Muslim schools of thought, have argued a wide array of views, the basis always being that the creator was an eternal being who was outside of the creation (i.e., any materially based entities within all of creation), and was not a part of creation. Several schools of thought stemming from the first cause argument, and a great deal of philosophical works from Muslim scholars such as [[Al-Ghazali]], came from the following verses in the Qur'an. The following quotations come from [[Muhammad Asad]]'s translation, ''[[The Message of The Qur'an]]'':
* 52:35: "Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators?" 
* 2:117: "The Originator is He of the heavens and the earth: and when He wills a thing to be, He but says unto it, 'Be'—and it is."
* 19:67: "But does man not bear in mind that We have created him aforetime while at one point they were nothing?"
* 21:30: "ARE, THEN, they who are bent on denying the truth not aware that the heavens and the earth were [once] one single entity, which We (formal singular) then parted asunder? – and [that] We made out of water every living thing? Will they not, then, [begin to] believe?"
* 21:56: "He answered: 'Nay, but your [true] Sustainer is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth—He who has brought them into being: and I am one of those who bear witness to this [truth]!'"
* 35:1: "ALL PRAISE is due to God, Originator of the heavens and the earth, who causes the angels to be (His) message-bearers, endowed with wings, two, or three, or four. He adds to His creation whatever He Wills: for, verily, God, is most competent over all things."
* 51:47: "It is We (formal singular) who have built the heaven with (Our creative) power; and, verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it."

To expound the term 'beginning,' of Christ, is altogether frivolous. For Moses simply intends to assert that the world was not perfected at its very commencement, in the manner in which it is now seen, but that it was created an empty chaos of heaven and earth. His language therefore may be thus explained. When God in the beginning created the heaven and the earth, the earth was empty and waste. He moreover teaches by the word 'created,' that what before did not exist was now made; for he has not used the term יצר, (yatsar,) which signifies to frame or forms but ברא, (bara,) which signifies to create. Therefore his meaning is, that the world was made out of nothing. Hence the folly of those is refuted who imagine that unformed matter existed from eternity; and who gather nothing else from the narration of Moses than that the world was furnished with new ornaments, and received a form of which it was before destitute."

==Opposing arguments==
{{See also|Parmenides|Nothing comes from nothing}}

===Logical===
The "first cause" argument was rooted in ancient Greek philosophy and based on observation in physics. Originally, it was understood{{by whom|date=April 2017}} in the context of creation from chaos. The observed phenomenon seen in reality is that nothing moves by itself. In other words, motion is not self-caused; thus, the Classic Greek thinkers argued that the cosmos must have had a "prime mover" ''[[primum movens]]''. However, this scientific observation of ''motion'' does not logically extend to the idea of ''existence'', and therefore does not necessarily indicate creation from absolutely nothing.

In theology, ''ex nihilo'' creation states that there was a beginning to one's existence, and anything that exists has a beginning. This idea of a ''required beginning'' appears to contradict the proposed creator who existed ''without a beginning''. In other words, people are considered to be contingent beings, and their existence depends upon a non-contingent being. However, if non-contingency is possible, then there is no basis for arguing that contingency is required for existence, nor can it be logically concluded that the number of non-contingent beings or non-contingent things is limited to one single substance or one single Being.

David Ray Griffin expressed his thoughts on this as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"No special philosophical problems are raised by this view: If it is intelligible to hold that the existence of God requires no explanation, since something must exist necessarily and "of itself," then it is not unintelligible to hold that that which exists necessarily is God ''and'' a realm of non-divine actualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.anthonyflood.com/griffincreationoutofchaos.htm |title= David Ray Griffin "Creation Out of Chaos and the Problem of Evil" |publisher= Anthonyflood.com |accessdate= 2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oord offers nine objections to ''creatio ex nihilo'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thomasjayoord.com/index.php/blog/archives/creatio_ex_nihilo_the_problem/#.UQDtUOgRkeM |title= Creatio Ex Nihilo: The Problem · For The Love of Wisdom and The Wisdom of Love · Thomas Jay Oord |publisher= Thomasjayoord.com |accessdate= 2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Theoretical problem: One cannot conceive absolute nothingness.
# Biblical problem: Scripture – in Genesis, 2 Peter, and elsewhere – suggests creation from something (water, deep, chaos, etc.), not creation from absolutely nothing.
# Historical problem: The [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]]s [[Basilides]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] first proposed ''creatio ex nihilo'' on the basis of assuming the inherently evil nature of creation, and in the belief that God does not act in history.  Early Christian theologians adopted the idea to affirm the kind of absolute divine power that many Christians now reject.
# Empirical problem: We have no evidence that our universe originally came into being from absolutely nothing.
# Creation-at-an-instant problem:  We have no evidence in the history of the Universe after the [[big bang]] that entities can emerge instantaneously from absolute nothingness.  As the earliest philosophers noted, out of nothing comes nothing (''[[Nothing comes from nothing|ex nihilo, nihil fit]]'').
# Solitary power problem: ''Creatio ex nihilo'' assumes that a powerful God once acted alone.  But power, as a social concept, only becomes meaningful in relation to others.
# Errant revelation problem: The God with the capacity to create something from absolutely nothing would apparently have the power to guarantee an unambiguous and inerrant message of salvation (for example: [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant Bible]]).  An unambiguously clear and inerrant divine revelation does not exist.
# [[Problem of Evil]]: If God once had the power to create from absolutely nothing, God essentially retains that power.  But a God of love with this capacity appears [[culpability|culpable]] for failing to prevent evil.
# Empire Problem: The kind of divine power implied in ''creatio ex nihilo'' supports a [[theology of empire]], based upon unilateral force and control of others.

[[Process theology|Process theologians]] argue that humans have always related a God to some "world" or another. They&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Creation Out of Chaos and the Problem of Evil by David Ray Griffin|url= http://www.anthonyflood.com/griffincreationoutofchaos.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; also claim that rejecting ''creatio ex nihilo'' provides the opportunity to affirm that God has everlastingly created and related with some realm of non-divine actualities or another (compare [[continuous creation]]). According to this alternative God-world theory, no non-divine thing exists without the creative activity of God, and nothing can terminate God's necessary existence.

Some [[non-trinitarian]] Christian churches do not teach the ''ex nihilo'' doctrine:
* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) teaches that [[Jehovah]] (whom they identify as the heavenly form of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]), under the direction of [[God the Father]], organized this world and others like it out of eternal, pre-existing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jesus Christ|url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/jesus-christ?lang=eng|work= The Guide to the Scriptures|publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate= 2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bruce R.

God had materials to organize the world out of chaos... The pure principles of element are principles which can never be destroyed; they may be organized and reorganized, but not destroyed. They had no beginning and can have no end"&lt;ref&gt;(History of the Church 6:308-309).&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate continues on the issue of creation Ex Nihilo versus creation Ex Materia between evangelical authors Paul Copan and William Lane Craig&lt;ref&gt;The New Mormon Challenge: Responding to the Latest Defenses of a Fast-Growing Movement&lt;/ref&gt; and LDS/Mormon apologist Blake Ostler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fairlds.org/authors/ostler-blake/reviews-of-the-new-mormon-challenge |title= Reviews of The New Mormon Challenge " FAIR |publisher= Fairlds.org |accessdate= 2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] teach that God used the energy he possesses to create the Universe based on their interpretation of Isaiah{{nbsp}}40:26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= The Watchtower|date= October 1, 2009|pages= 4&amp;ndash;6|title= What Is the Holy Spirit?|url= http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2009721|publisher= Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe this harmonizes with the scientific idea of the relationship between matter and energy. They distinguish Jehovah from Jesus Christ, teaching that before he created the physical universe, Jehovah created Jesus and that Michael is the heavenly form of Jesus.

GK III.23 notes for instance that the ''sruti'' equally upholds the view that creation occurs from a pre-existent being (''sat'') and that it proceeds from non-existence. creation is most frequently understood to be a transformation (''parinama'') or an emanation from a pre-existent reality. Creation from non-being (''asat''), however, is put forward as a possibility in ''Chandogya Upanisad'' III.19 and ''Taittiriya Upanisad'' II.7. This is not necessarily a ''creatio ex nihilo'', but in all likelihood denotes an emergence of being from the pregnant and undifferentiated chaos known as non-being (''asat''). Nevertheless, the equating of non-being with nothingness may have been intended and it is certainly criticized on those grounds in ''Chandogya Upanisad'' VI.2. The predominant Brahmanical creation theme, however, describes an emanation from or transformation of "''sat''," whether envisaged as an abstract impersonal reality as in ''Taittiriya Upanisad'' II.i, or from a personal creator, as in ''Prasna Upanisad'' I.4.

Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/20 |title= Bhagavad Gita 13.20 |publisher= Vedabase.com |accessdate= 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening words of Krishna in BG{{nbsp}}2.12-13 also imply this, as do the doctrines referred to in BG{{nbsp}}16.8 as explained by the commentator Vadiraja Tirtha.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://dvaita.info/pipermail/dvaita-list_dvaita.info/2007-April/002780.html Sri Vadiraja's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most philosophical schools in Hinduism maintain that material creation started with some minute particle (or seed) which had to be co-eternal or a part of ultimate reality (Brahman). This minute starting point is also the point into which all creation contracts at the end of each cycle. This concept varies between various traditions, such as the Vishishtadvaita tradition (which asserts that the Universe forms a part of God, created from some aspect of His divinity) and Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta traditions (which state that the minute initial particle (shuddha Maya) has always existed and was never created).

=== Linguistic and textual ===
Scholars have suggested alternative translations from the [[Biblical Hebrew]] for the concept often rendered as "created" in [[English-language]] versions of Genesis 1. Van Volde, for example, suggests that the Genesis account tells of the "separation" of existing material rather than of creation ''ex nihilo''.&lt;ref&gt;

Note that ordinary language may lack a concise definitive native expression for "creation ''ex nihilo''" - hence the need for the technical Latinate phrase itself. The English-language word "create" itself comes from the Latin ''creare'' (to make, bring forth, produce, beget), with a root cognate with ''crescere'' (to arise, to grow) and allied to the English word ''crescent'' (originally meaning "growing").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD| create | accessdate=2017-04-16}}

'''Friedrich Lütge''' (21 October 1901 - 25 August 1968) was a [[Germany|German]] economist, [[Social history |social historian]] and [[Economic history |economic historian]].&lt;ref name=FLlautRM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agso.uni-graz.at/marienthal/biografien/luetge_friedrich.htm|title=Friedrich Lütge|date=June 2008|author=Reinhard Müller (compiler)|publisher= Archiv für die Geschichte der Soziologie in Österreich, Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz| accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FLselonHK&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.persee.fr/doc/ahess_0395-2649_1969_num_24_2_422076| title=Friedrich Lütge  [note biographique] |pages=568-570| work=Annales,  Année 1969 |publisher= Persées (UMS3602), École Normale Supérieure de Lyon|author=[[:de:Hermann Kellenbenz |Hermann Kellenbenz]]| accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at the [[HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management  |Leipzig Graduate School of Management (HHL)]] and at the [[University of Leipzig]] between 1940 and 1947, then moving on to the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] where he taught till a few months before he died.   Through his research work between 1949 and 1968 he exercised a great influence on the understanding of economic history in West Germany.   Together with [[Wilhelm Abel]] and [[:de:Günther Franz |Günther Franz]] he contributed decisively to research into [[:de:Agrargeschichte |agrarian history]] in [[Germany]].   He was instrumental in ensuring that social and economic history emerged as an alternative strand to the prism of [[historical materialism]] that was mainstream in many German universities during this period.   From this followed an insistence in his economic research that the subject needs to be studied not simply from a theoretical quasi-mathematical standpoint, but also empirically and in the context of broader historical considerations.&lt;ref name=GSWlautJR&gt;Jörg Rode: Die Gesellschaft für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte (1961–1998). Stuttgart 1998, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and works ==
=== Provenance and early years ===
Friedrich Karl Lütge was born into a [[Protestant]] family&lt;ref name=FLlautNDB/&gt; at the start of the twentieth century at [[Wernigerode]], a midsized town located in the [[Harz |Harz Mountains]] between [[Hanover]] and [[Halle (Saale)| Halle]].   He was the older of twin brothers.   There were also two younger siblings.   His father was a captain in the German merchant navy who was much involved with [[Kamerun]] trade, but died in 1905.   As a child Friedrich Lütge suffered from a spinal disease which confined him to bed for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Abel, Knut Borchardt, Hermann Kellenbenz, Wolfgang Zorn (Hrsg.): Wirtschaft, Geschichte und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. Festschrift zum 65. Geburtstag von Friedrich Lütge. Fischer, Stuttgart 1966, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;   On 23 September 1918, while still at school he found himself recruited into an [[Regiment |infantry regiment]] as a [[Fahnenjunker |junior officer (''"Fahnenjunker"'')]], but by this time the [[First World War]] was nearly over and he was never sent into the fighting of it.   However, in February 1919 he found himself taken into the [[Freikorps |Freikorps (''"militia" unit'')]] of [[:de:Adolf von Oven |Adolf von Oven]] in [[Berlin]], and he was involved in the putting down of the [[Spartacist uprising |Spartacus uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dornheim: Die deutsche Agrargeschichte in der NS-Zeit und die Lehrstuhl-Berufungen nach 1945 in Westdeutschland. In: Zeitschrift für Agrargeschichte und Agrarsoziologie 53 (2005), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;   It was only in 1921 that he passed his [[Abitur |Abitur (school leaving exams)]] which opened the way to university-level education.

In 1921 Lütge enrolled at the [[University of Freiburg]] where he studied [[:de:Volkswirtschaftslehre |Applied economics (Volkswirtschaft)]] and [[History]] on a course directed by [[:de:Georg von Below |Georg von Below]].   That was followed by a term at the [[University of Marburg]] where he was taught by [[Albert Brackmann]] and [[:de:Wilhelm Busch (Historiker) |Wilhelm Busch]].  He concluded his student studies at the [[University of Jena]] where he was supervised for his doctorate by [[:de:Franz Gutmann (Ökonom)|Franz Gutmann]].  Importantly for Lütge 's subsequent academic career, it was Gutmann who awakened his interest in [[:de:Agrargeschichte |agrarian history]].   His doctoral dissertation concerned "The liberation of the peasantry in the County of Wernigerode".&lt;ref name=FLselonHK/&gt;   He was obliged to [[:de:Werkstudent |work his way through his university years]] in order to support himself and his widowed mother.&lt;ref name=FLNachruflautigghhl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igghhl.de/luetge.pdf|title=Prof. Dr. rer. pol. Dr. Phil. Friedrich Lütge|work=Rektor vom 1. Mai 1945 bis zum 4. Februar 1946|publisher=Interessengemeinschaft Geschichte der Handelshochschule Leipzig|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefly, between 15 October and 16 November 1923, he belonged to the so-called [[Black Reichswehr]].

Unusually, on 1 December 1928 Friedrich Lütge was awarded a second doctorate.   This time his dissertation concerned the history of the book trade in Jena, including the impact of the invention of printing.   The work was supervised by Georg Menz.   While working on this doctorate he was also employed in [[Jena]] as a private researcher by the economist-statistician [[:de:Ludwig Elster |Ludwig Elster]].&lt;ref name=FLlautRM/&gt;   Projects on which he worked with Elster included the fourth edition of the "Wörterbuchs der Volkswirtschaftslehre" (''loosely, "Lexicon of Applied Economics"'') and the [[:de:Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik |"Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik" (''loosely "Year books of National Economy and Statistics"'')]].&lt;ref&gt;Erich Maschke: Friedrich Lütge [Nachruf]. In: Historische Zeitschrift. vol. 208 (1969), section 3, pp. 772–774&lt;/ref&gt;   He also authored a celebratory booklet in respect of the fiftieth anniversary of the [[:de:Gustav Fischer Verlag |Gustav Fischer Verlag (publishing house)]]:  research for this commission supported and influenced the doctorate on which he was working at the same time.   In 1929 he obtained a permanent position with [[:de:Gustav Fischer Verlag |Fischer]] as a literary editor and academic researcher.   At Fischer he was entrusted with producing a number of works, mostly concerned with [[:de:Volkswirtschaftslehre |Applied economics (Volkswirtschaft)]] and [[Economic History]]&lt;ref name=FLlautNDB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd122795784.html#ndbcontent|title=Lütge, Friedrich:   Wirtschaftshistoriker, * 21.10.1901 Wernigerode, † 25.8.1968 München.

It was also in 1929 that Friedrich Lütge married Eva Buchfink, a daughter of General Ernst Buchfinck.   The marriage produced one recorded son and two daughters.&lt;ref name=FLlautNDB/&gt;

=== Jena in the 1930s ===
During the early 1930s he pursued his career with the publisher in parallel with his academic researches, publishing several essays on social policy and agricultural history.   In 1934 he published a significant piece of work in which he pointed out that in central Germany as early as the [[early modern period]] a form of [[Manorialism |landlordship and tenancy]] existed which was based not on [[Socage |service obligation]], but simply the handing over of produce.   That contrasted with he versions of [[manorialism]] that was normal in the northern and southern parts of [[Holy Roman empire|Germany]].&lt;ref name=FLlautNDB/&gt;   He followed this up in 1937 with a broadened study of the German agrarian economy, taking his research back to the middle ages and, in particular, to the [[Carolingian dynasty |Carolingian era]].   This meant that there had been fundamental regional variations in land tenure arrangements in Germany far earlier than had hitherto been believed.&lt;ref name=GrundherrschaftlaitMP&gt;{{cite web|pages=406-407|author1=Magdalena Pernold (author), Universität Innsbruck| author2=Prof. Dr. Alois Niederstätter (supervisor)|url=https://webapp.uibk.ac.at/ojs/index.php/historiascribere/article/viewFile/182/106 |title=Leibeigenschaft und Grundherrschaft im mittelalterlichen Mitteleuropa |date=2010| publisher=Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year he saw to the posthumous publication of the "Outline history of the German rural economy in the middle ages" (''"Geschichte der deutschen Landwirtschaft des Mittelalters in ihren Grundzügen"'') by his former tutor, [[:de:Georg von Below |Georg von Below]], using manuscripts that von Below had left behind when he died ten years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Georg von Below: "Geschichte der deutschen Landwirtschaft des Mittelalters in ihren Grundzügen". Aus den hinterlassenen Manuskripten herausgegeben von Friedrich Lütge [produced posthumously from von Below's manuscripts by Friedrich Lütge]. Fischer, Jena 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

1933 was the year of the [[Machtergreifung|National Socialist take-over]].   It was also the year in which Lütge joined the [[German National People's Party| German National People's Party (''"Deutschnationale Volkspartei, "'' / DNVP)]], though this party had dissolved itself by the end of that year.&lt;ref name="HossfeldStutz2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jörg Opitz (author)  |author2=Uwe Hossfeld (editor-compiler)|author3=Rudiger Stutz (editor-compiler)|title=Kämpferische Wissenschaft: Studien zur Universität Jena im Nationalsozialismus| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJCxIkTe1gYC&amp;pg=PA476|year=2003|publisher=Böhlau Verlag Köln Weimar| isbn=978-3-412-04102-1 |pages=471–518}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He also had close connections with the anti-[[Nazi party|government]] [[Confessing Church]].   He would later insist that his various longstanding memberships of associations connected with the army, notably the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten |Stahlhelm]], afforded him a measure of independence in his interactions with the [[Nazi Germany |National Socialist state]].  When the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten |Stahlhelm]] was forcibly merged into the party's own [[Sturmabteilung |Sturmabteilung (SA)]] paramilitary organisation, Lütge was one of many who responded by resigning from the Stahlhelm.   Unlike many of the scholars who preserved their university careers through the Hitler years, Lütge never found it necessary to join [[Nazi Party |The Party]] itself.&lt;ref name="Kissener2005"&gt;{{cite book| author=Michael Kissener|title=Ut omnes unum sint: Gründungspersönlichkeiten der Johannes-Gutenberg-Universität|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPxxy-mWHdYC&amp;pg=PA110|year=2005|publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag| isbn=978-3-515-08650-9|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Nevertheless, he did join the party's [[National Socialist People's Welfare |"People's Welfare" (''"Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt"'' /NSV)]] organisation in 1934.   In 1937 he joined the party's [[National Socialist German Lecturers League |"Teachers' League" (''"Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund, "'' / NSDDB)]].   And in 1944 he added the [[:de:Nationalsozialistischer Altherrenbund |"Altherrenbund"]], a party organisation for university academics, to his portfolio of memberships.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dornheim: Die deutsche Agrargeschichte in der NS-Zeit und die Lehrstuhl-Berufungen nach 1945 in Westdeutschland. In: Zeitschrift für Agrargeschichte und Agrarsoziologie 53 (2005), pp. 39–55&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1936 he received his [[habilitation]] degree from the [[University of Jena]], which opened the way to a university teaching career in respect of [[:de:Volkswirtschaftslehre |Applied economics (Volkswirtschaft)]] and [[Economic history]].&lt;ref name=FLlautRM/&gt;   Because of the amount of relevant research work that he had already undertaken he was awarded the habilitation without any requirement to write a habilitation-dissertation.   The faculty deemed the two dissertations he had already completed in respect of his doctorates sufficient.   Receipt of his [[:de:Lehrberechtigung |teaching permit (''"venia legendi "'')]] was delayed till the next year due to differences with government authorities.   There is speculation that he only received it at all because of his longstanding personal friendship with the nationally respected economist [[:de:Jens Jessen |Jens Jessen]] who at this stage was still a committed [[Nazi Party |party member]] (though he would later be executed by hanging).   In 1937 Lütge began working as a teacher in his disciplines at the [[University of Jena|Jena University]] Law and Economics faculties.&lt;ref name=FLNachruflautigghhl/&gt;

=== Leipzig in the 1940s ===
In 1940 Lütge was offered and accepted a junior professorship in [[:de:Volkswirtschaftslehre |Applied economics (Volkswirtschaft)]], with a particular focus on [[:de:Wohnungswirtschaft |settlement and housing]] at the [[HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management |"Handelshochschule Leipzig" (HHL / ''loosely, "Commercial academy"'')]] - as it was  known at that time, in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name=FLNachruflautigghhl/&gt;   He had already been taking a quasi-scientific approach to the housing issues which was at the time innovative.   His specialities included housing-market pricing and statistics.   In 1940, the year of his appointment, he was in a position to publish a systematic introduction to [[:de:Wohnungswirtschaft |settlement and housing]],&lt;ref name=FLNachruflautigghhl/&gt; which was republished in 1949.&lt;ref name="Lütge1949"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Lütge |title=Wohnungswirtschaft: eine systematische Darstellung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der deutschen Wohnungswirtschaft| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmRuAAAAIAAJ|year=1949|publisher=G. Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt;   it can be seen as the first comprehensive [[Monograph |academic monograph]] on the subject.&lt;ref&gt; Karl Bosl: Friedrich Lütge 21.10.1901–25.8.1968. In: Jahrbuch der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. 1964, pp. 202–205,&lt;/ref&gt;   He was conscripted into the [[Wehrmacht |army]] in August 1941, but was released on health grounds in May 1943 after being assessed as unsuitable for service on account of a spinal condition.   He returned to the [[HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management |Leipzig]] and was promoted to a full professorship.&lt;ref name=FLNachruflautigghhl/&gt;   Jointly with [[:de:Erich Preiser |Erich Preiser]]  he took on responsibility for the annual production of the [[:de:Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik |"Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik" (''loosely "Year books of National Economy and Statistics"'')]].&lt;ref name=FLlautNDB/&gt;   The compendium was banned in 1944 but returned, still produced by Lütge and Preise, in 1949.&lt;ref name=JahrbuecherlautZAW&gt;{{cite web|title=1943-1967/68: Friedrich Lütge und Erich Preiser|work=Historie der Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik |publisher=Zentrum fuer Europaeische Wirtschaftsforschung GmbH|url=ftp://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/div/historie_jb.pdf| accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[End of World War II in Europe|War ended]] in May 1945 and the western two thirds of what had been Germany was divided into four [[Allied-occupied Germany|military occupation zones]].   [[Leipzig]] had been liberated from National Socialism in April 1945 by the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|US]] [[69th Infantry Division (United States)|army]], but a different division of Germany had already [[Yalta Conference|been agreed]] between the [[Allied leaders of World War II|leaders]] of the victorious powers whereby Leipzig should [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|be administered]] as part of the [[Soviet occupation zone]].   The American military commanders agreed that Friedrich Lütge, as a "non-party comrade" and a member of the [[Confessing Church|anti-Nazi Confessing church]] should be appointed post-war [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management |"Hochschule für Wirtschaftswissenschaften "("Commercial academy"'')]] as it was by now known.   There were additional curatorial responsibilities.   When the American troops withdrew from Leipzig in July 1945 the Soviet commanders who moved in were content to confirm his appointment.&lt;ref name=FLlautNDB/&gt;   In 1946 the academy was merged into the [[University of Leipzig |University]] Faculty for Economics and Social Sciences and Lütge, now on the Leipzig university payroll, was appointed dean.&lt;ref name=FLlautKMUL&gt;{{cite web |url=https://research.uni-leipzig.de/catalogus-professorum-lipsiensium/leipzig/Luetge_1066.pdf |work=Professorenkatalog der Universität Leipzig / Catalogus Professorum Lipsiensium, Herausgegeben vom Lehrstuhl für Neuere und Neueste Geschichte |publisher=Historisches Seminar der Universität Leipzig |title=Prof. Dr. rer. pol. et phil. Friedrich Lütge |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lütge was no fan of [[Communism]].   He characterised the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist Party]] as "warring brothers from the same root" (''"feindliche Brüder des gleichen Stammes"'')&lt;ref name=MarWus&gt;Markus Wustmann: Die Gesellschaftswissenschaftliche Fakultät in Leipzig 1947–1951.

[[University of Leipzig |The university]] nominated him to take over as dean of their new social sciences faculty but the [[:de:Deutsche Verwaltung für Volksbildung  |Soviet Zone administration for popular education (''"Deutsche Verwaltung für Volksbildung"'')]] then rejected the appointment because of his political stance.&lt;ref name=MarWus/&gt;   Before his position could become any more difficult, in September 1946 Lütge accepted a chair in political economics at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and relocated to the US occupation zone (after May 1949 part of [[West Germany]]) to take up his new position.&lt;ref name=FLselonHK/&gt;   The Munich job also came with directorship of the Economic History Seminar that had been created at the university by [[:de:Jakob Strieder |Jakob Strieder]] back in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=FLselonHK/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLlautNDB/&gt; 

=== Postwar Munich ===
Friedrich Lütge took up his teaching chair at Munich in 1946 or 1947.&lt;ref name=FLselonHK/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLNachruflautigghhl/&gt;.   The next year his colleague [[:de:Hans Proesler |Hans Proesler]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich's]] Professor of Economic History, left to take up a new position [[:de:Hochschule für Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften Nürnberg |in Nuremberg]] and Lütge took on his former colleague's discipline, now in charge of both the [[:de:Volkswirtschaftslehre |Applied economics (Volkswirtschaft)]] Institute and that of the university Institute for Economic History.&lt;ref name=WirtschaftsgeschichtebeiLMUlautKB&gt;{{cite web|title=Stichworte zur Institutionalisierung der Wirtschaftsgeschichte in der Staatswirtschaftlichen/Volkswirtschaftlichen Fakultät der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München |author=[[Knut Borchardt]]| url=https://www.econhist.econ.uni-muenchen.de/geschichte/wigeschmu_nchen.pdf|publisher=Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] (relaunched in October 1949 as the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany |Soviet sponsored]] [[German Democratic Republic |German Democratic Republic / East Germany)]])  Lütge's 1940 book, "Kriegsprobleme der Wohnungswirtschaft" was consigned to the official [[:de:Liste der auszusondernden Literatur |list of books to be weeded out (''"Liste der auszusondernden Literatur"'')]]&lt;!---tho I can't find it on the online version.   maybe it got "rehabilitated" later?---&gt;.&lt;!---Friedrich Lütge joined the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany |Christian Democratic Union (CDU party)]] according to wiki-de and it makes sense that he would have done, but a more convincing source would be good.---&gt;

Alongside his duties at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|the university]] he also taught at the [[Technical University of Munich]] and at the city's then separate [[Bavarian School of Public Policy |"University for Politics" (''"Hochschule für Politik München"'')]].   That was the context in which his 1948 book "Einführung in die Lehre vom Gelde" (''loosely, "Introduction to the Doctrine of Money"'') appeared.   He had already, while still at Leipzig, highlighted the unique nature of  historical [[Manorialism|landlord and tenant relationships]] in [[Bavaria]], and in 1949 he published the resulting study under the title "Die bayerische Grundherrschaft – Untersuchungen über die Agrarverfassung Altbayerns im 16.–18. Jahrhundert." (''loosely "Bavarian Manorialism - Investigations into the agrarian constitutional structures in old Bavaria during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries"'').&lt;ref name="Schröder-Lembke2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Blickle (author)|author2=Gertrud Schröder-Lembke (editor-compiler)|title=Deutsche Agrargeschichte in der zweiten Haelfte des 20.

He also re-evaluated conventional [[Periodization |definitions of western historical periods]] through the prisms of economic and agrarian history, both in writing and in lectures, which gave rise to lively discussions between experts.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Borchardt: Friedrich Lütge. In: Wilhelm Abel, Knut Borchardt, Hermann Kellenbenz, Wolfgang Zorn (editor-compilers): Wirtschaft, Geschichte und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. Festschrift zum 65. Geburtstag von Friedrich Lütge. Fischer, Stuttgart 1966, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1949 [[Deutscher Historikertag |German Historians' Day]] took place at [[Munich]] and Lütge took the opportunity to set out his thesis that the [[Black Death]] which reached Europe between 1346 and 1350, and the ensuing changes in economic and political power balances that ensued as a result of depopulation, made 1350 a much more plausible starting point for "[[Early modern period |Modern history]]" than 1500 which then (as now) was widely - often unquestioningly - identified as the starting point for the modern era in European history.  The next year he set out the contention in greater detail in the newly redesigned and relaunched [[:de:Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik |"Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik" (''loosely "Year books of National Economy and Statistics"'')]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Lütge: Das 14./15. Jahrhundert in der Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. In: Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Geschichte. vol. 162, 1950, pp. 161–213.&lt;/ref&gt;   He challenged another historians' shibboleth in 1958 when he argued that the decades directly preceding the [[Thirty Years' War]] had not been a period of slow decline, marked by a succession of poor harvests in Europe, as widely believed, but that it was only the outbreak of hostilities in 1618 that put an end to several decades of dynamic economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Lütge: Die wirtschaftliche Lage Deutschlands vor Ausbruch des Dreißigjährigen Krieges. In: Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik. vol 170, 1958, pp. 43–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:de:Wohnungswirtschaft |Settlement and housing (''"Wohnungswirtschaft"'')]] was a topic that continued to interest him during his Munich years.   Lütge was a member of an "Expert Advisory Committee" to the [[:de:Bundesbauministerium |West German Ministry for Housing Development]], and in 1949 published a new edition of his introduction to [[:de:Wohnungswirtschaft |settlement and housing]].&lt;ref name="Lütge1949"/&gt;   Then in 1957 he authored a further contribution under the title "Die Wohnungs- und Siedlungswirtschaft in der Konjunktur" (''loosely, "Housing and urban development and the economic cycle"'').&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Lütge: Die Wohnungs- und Siedlungswirtschaft in der Konjunktur. R. Müller, Köln-Braunsfeld 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 he received an invitation, which in the end he turned down, to take a professorship in Economic History at the [[University of Cologne]].&lt;ref name=WirtschaftsgeschichtebeiLMUlautKB/&gt;   This triggered a negotiation with [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|his own university]] in [[Munich]] which led to a re-assignment of teaching responsibilities that corresponded more closely with the reality of what was already happening.   At the same time his "Seminar for Economic History" was extended in scope and elevated in status, becoming the university "Institute for Social and Economic History".&lt;ref name=WirtschaftsgeschichtebeiLMUlautKB/&gt;   

In 1967 he published in a single volume a synthesis from his various regional studies concerning German [[:de:Agrarverfassung |agrarian societal structures]] from the [[early middle ages]] till the [[:de:Bauernbefreiung |so-called liberation of the peasantry]] in the eighteenth/nineteenth centuries.   This appeared as Volume 3 of the "Deutschen Agrargeschichte" (''"On German Agrarian History"'') series produced by [[:de:Günther Franz |Günther Franz]] (which would eventually extend to 40 volumes).&lt;ref name="Schmidt1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich Richard Schmidt| title=Geleitwort| work=Dorf und Religion: reformierte Sittenzucht in Berner Landgemeinden der frühen Neuzeit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nt84MvAODeoC&amp;pg=PR8|year=1995|publisher=Lucius &amp; Lucius DE|isbn=978-3-437-50391-7|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Back in 1952 he had already published "Deutschen Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte" (''"German Social and Economic History"'') which provides a multi-faceted overview of his entire research scope, and a widely used textbook which in some ways represents his most important contribution to historiography.

In 1967/68 Friedrich Lütge succeeded in obtaining funding for a second teaching chair in Economic and Social History at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]].  [[:de:Wolfgang Zorn |Wolfgang Zorn]] was invited to fill it.&lt;ref name=WZlautRK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0006/bsb00064108/images/index.html?fip=193.174.98.30&amp;seite=162&amp;pdfseitex=|title=Nachruf:  Wolfgang Zorn|work=Zeitschrift für bayerische Landesgeschichte|pages= 441-444|author=Rolf Kiessling|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Friedrich Lütge himself was by this point seriously ill.&lt;ref name=FLselonHK/&gt;   He died on 25 August 1968.   He was succeeded at Munich by [[Knut Borchardt]].&lt;ref name=WirtschaftsgeschichtebeiLMUlautKB/&gt; 

== Memberships and celebration ==
From 1955 Friedrich Lütge was a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] in [[Munich]].   In addition, in 1966 he became a corresponding member of the [[Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium]].   At the Munich academy he initiated the establishment of a commission for social and economic history, the committee of which he then chaired.   On 18 February 1961 the "Gesellschaft für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte" (GSWG - ''"Society for Social and Economic History"'') was founded.   Lütge was key to its creation.   Till his death he served as its first chairman.&lt;ref name=GSWGVorstand&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gswg.eu/Ueber-uns/ |title=Der Zweck der Gesellschaft   ....

V., c/o Universität Regensburg|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lütge also headed up the Economic History committee of the [[Verein für Socialpolitik |"German Economic Association (''"Verein für Socialpolitik"'')]]" between 1958 and 1962.&lt;ref name=AusschusslautCB&gt;{{cite web |title=Über den Ausschuss |url=https://www.vfs.uni-bayreuth.de/de/ausschuss/index.html |author=Christoph Buchheim (1954-2009) |date=2006 |work=Verein für Socialpolitik – Wirtschaftshistorischer Ausschuss |publisher=Universität Bayreuth |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Producer-editor / Publisher ==
In 1943 Lütge teamed up with [[:de:Günther Franz |Günther Franz]] to launch the "Quellen und Forschungen zur Agrargeschichte" (''"Sources and Research in Agrarian History"'') series at [[:de:Gustav Fischer Verlag |Gustav Fischer Verlag]].   The times were not propitious, but after the war, joined by [[Wilhelm Abel]], they made a success of the initiative.&lt;ref name=FLlautRM/&gt;   At the same publishing house Lütge launched another series, "Forschungen zur Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte" (''"Researches into Social and Economic Hostory"'') in 1959.

Additionally, from the last part of 1943, together with [[:de:Erich Preiser |Erich Preiser]] he became co-producer of the annual [[:de:Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik |"Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik" (''loosely "Year books of National Economy and Statistics"'')]], on which he had previously worked under the direction of [[:de:Ludwig Elster |Ludwig Elster]], securing the publication's future through a difficult period.&lt;ref name=FLlautNDB/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLlautRM/&gt;   After Preiser died in August 1967, Lütge became sole producer of it, but his illness forced him out in May 1968.&lt;ref name=JahrbuecherlautZAW/&gt;   He seriously considered renaming the Jahrbücher as "Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Wirtschaftsgeschichte" (''loosely "Year books of National Economy and Economic History"'') in order more accurately to reflect the interdisciplinary approach taken under his stewardship, but that name change never happened.&lt;ref name=GSWlautJR/&gt;   In 1953 he also became one of the co-producers of the [[:de:Zeitschrift für Agrargeschichte und Agrarsoziologie |"Zeitschrift für Agrargeschichte und Agrarsoziologie" (''"Journal for Agrarian History and Sociology"'')]].&lt;ref name="FahlbuschHaar2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Fahlbusch|author2=Ingo Haar|author3=Alexander Pinwinkler|title=Handbuch der völkischen Wissenschaften: Akteure, Netzwerke, Forschungsprogramme|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3QE2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182|date=11 September 2017| publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-042989-3|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von 1952 bis 1968 erschien unter seiner Mitherausgabe das Handwörterbuch der Sozialwissenschaften in zwölf Bänden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8684">'''Guibert de Nogent''' (c. 1055–1124) was a [[Benedictine]] [[historian]], [[theology|theologian]] and author of [[autobiography|autobiographical]] memoirs. Guibert was relatively unknown in his own time, going virtually unmentioned by his contemporaries. He has only recently caught the attention of scholars who have been more interested in his extensive autobiographical memoirs and personality which provide insight into [[medieval]] life.

==Life==
Guibert was born of parents from the minor nobility at [[Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]]. Guibert claims that it took his parents over seven years to conceive, as he writes in his ''Monodiae''.  According to his memoirs, the labour nearly cost him and his mother their lives, as Guibert [[breech birth|turned around in the womb]].  Guibert's family made an offering to a shrine of the [[Virgin Mary]], and promised that if Guibert survived, he would be dedicated to a clerical life.  Since he survived, he followed this path.  His father was violent, unfaithful and prone to excess, and was captured at the [[Battle of Mortemer]], dying eight months later.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Barlow, ''William Rufus'', (University of California, 1983), 90.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his memoirs, Guibert views his death as a type of blessing, stating that if his father had survived, he likely would have forced Guibert to become a knight, thus breaking the oath to the Virgin Mary to dedicate Guibert to the church.  His mother was domineering, of great beauty and intelligence, and exceedingly zealous. Guibert writes so much about his mother, and in such detail, that some scholars, such as Archambault, have suggested that he may have had an [[Oedipus complex]].  She assumed control of his education, isolated him from his peers and hired him a private tutor, from the ages of six to twelve. Guibert remembers the tutor as brutally exacting, and incompetent; nevertheless Guibert and his tutor developed a strong bond. When Guibert was around the age of twelve, his mother retired to an abbey near [[Saint-Germer-de-Fly]] (or Flay), and he soon followed.  Entering the Order at [[Saint-Germer-de-Fly Abbey|St. Germer]], he studied with great zeal, devoting himself at first to the secular poets [[Ovid]] and [[Virgil]]&amp;mdash;an experience which left its imprint on his works.  He later changed his focus to theology, through the influence of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm of Bec]], who later became the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

In 1104, he was chosen abbot of the poor and tiny abbey of Nogent-sous-Coucy (founded 1059) and henceforth took a more prominent part in [[ecclesiastical]] affairs, where he came into contact with bishops and court society. More importantly, it gave him time to engage in his passion for writing. His first major work of this period is his history of the [[First Crusade]] called ''[[Dei gesta per Francos]]'' ("God's deeds through the Franks"), finished in 1108 and touched up in 1121. The history is largely a [[paraphrase]], in ornate style, of the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' of an anonymous [[Normans|Norman]] author; Crusade historians have traditionally not given it favourable reviews; the fact that he stays so close to ''Gesta Francorum'', and the difficulty of his [[Latin]], make it seem superfluous. Recent editors and translators, however, have called attention to his excellent writing and original material. More importantly, the ''Dei gesta'' supplies us with invaluable information about the reception of the crusade in France. Guibert personally knew crusaders, had grown up with crusaders, and talked with them about their memories and experiences.

For the modern reader, his autobiography (''De vita sua sive monodiarum suarum libri tres''), or ''[[Monody|Monodiae]]'' (''Solitary Songs'', commonly referred to as his ''Memoirs''), written in 1115, is considered the most interesting of his works. Written towards the close of his life, and based on the model of the [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|''Confessions'']] of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], he traces his life from his childhood to adulthood.  Throughout, he gives picturesque glimpses of his time and the customs of his country. The text is divided into three "Books."  The first covers his own life, from birth to adulthood; the second is a brief history of his monastery; the third is a description of an [[rebellion|uprising]] in nearby [[Laon]]. He provides invaluable information on daily life in [[castle]]s and [[monastery|monasteries]], on the educational methods then in vogue, and gives insights into some of the major and minor personalities of his time. His work is coloured by his passions and prejudices, which add a personal touch to the work.

For example, he was quite sceptical about the propriety of Catholic [[relics]] of [[Jesus Christ]], the [[Virgin Mary]] and numerous Catholic [[saints]], and entertained doubts about their authenticity, noting that some shrines and pilgrimage sites made conflicting claims about which bodily remnants, clothing or other sacred objects were held at which site.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Freeman "Brooding on God" ''History Today'':  62: 3: March 2012: 47-52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Freeman: ''Holy bones, Holy dust: how relics shaped the history of Medieval Europe:'' Yale University Press: 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years and wartime ==
Järv was born in a farmer's family in Western Finnish municipality of [[Korsholm]]. After graduating from high school in [[Vaasa]] Järv went to sea at the age of 18.&lt;ref name=kap&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.anarkismi.net/kapis/22harry.htm |title= Suomenruotsalainen sotasankari – ja anarkisti |publisher= Kapinatyöläinen |year=1997 | language = Finnish|accessdate= 4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Winter War]] broke out on November 1939 he enlisted in the [[Finnish Army]] as a volunteer. Later at World War II Järv was a platoon leader in the [[61st Infantry Regiment (Finland)|61st Infantry Regiment]] that consisted almost exclusively of [[Swedish-speaking Finns]]. He was a member of [[Patrolling|patrol unit]], leading [[Reconnaissance|recon]] and combat patrols behind the enemy lines. On September 1943 Järv was seriously wounded by a [[landmine]] and he spent rest of the war at [[Saint Göran Hospital]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=wwII&gt;[http://www.ww2incolor.com/finnish_forces/Lieutenant_Harry_Jarv_1941-1943.html WWII in Color – Lieutenant Harry Järv] (in English). Retrieved 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Järv carried a camera through the war and took a plenty of pictures that were later published in his books. The 2004 Finnish war film ''[[Beyond the Front Line]]'' is based on Järv's diaries.&lt;ref name=wwII/&gt; In 1945 Järv helped his former superior [[Alpo Marttinen]] flee Finland to Sweden, although Järv said he didn't like Marttinen as a person. Colonel Marttinen, who later joined the [[United States Army]], was involved with the [[Weapons Cache Case]].&lt;ref name=kap/&gt;

== Later years ==
After the war was over, Järv received a [[scholarship]] from [[Uppsala University]] and moved to Sweden where he spent the rest of his life. Järv had a great interest in reading and collecting books since his childhood.&lt;ref name=kap/&gt; Järv's personal library had more than 14,000 copies.&lt;ref name=hs/&gt; He worked as a librarian and later as a deputy director at the [[National Library of Sweden]].

In 1973 Järv was awarded an [[Honorary degree]] by Uppsala University. He was also a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kunskapstorstig-jarv-laste-laxan-i-falt/ |title= Kunskapstörstig Järv läste läxan i fält |publisher= Dagens Nyheter |date= 4 March 2004 | language = Swedish|accessdate= 4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Järv wrote and translated more than 50 books as well as dozens of articles in various publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/hitlist.jsp?q=f%C3%B6rf%3A%28J%C3%A4rv%2C+Harry%2C+1921-2009%29 Libris] (in Swedish). Retrieved 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His own books were mostly an [[essay]] collections of [[Ancient history]], [[politics]] and [[philosophy]]. Järv was the [[Editor-in-chief]] in Swedish culture magazines ''Horisont'', ''Radix'' and ''Fenix'' and was known as an eminent expert on [[Franz Kafka]].

== Political ideas ==
Järv was first introduced to anarchist ideas as a teenager by the books of [[Peter Kropotkin]]. On his time at the sea Järv was influenced by Finnish [[syndicalist]] [[Niilo Wälläri]] who was the leader of [[Finnish Seamen’s Union]]. During the war Järv suited anarchist ideas on his role as a platoon leader. Järv treated his men equally to himself and the decisions were made democratically. This often led to conflicts with his superior officers and Järv was considered as "unmilitary". In 1952 Järv joined the Swedish anarcho-syndicalist union [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden|SAC]] and started writing articles in its newspaper ''[[Arbetaren]]''.&lt;ref name=kap/&gt;

Other areas of his interest are languages, culture and statehood.

==Bibliography==

In 1970 Frendo completed his Bachelors in Maltese, English and History at the [[University of Malta]]. During the 1960s Frendo was involved in a number of Youth and Student groups. From 1968 to 1969 Frendo was Chairman of a student-led campaign called ‘Djar ghall-Maltin’ (Houses for the Maltese), which aimed to secure low-cost housing and land planning in the wake of newly achieved independence from the British. From 1970-1971 Frendo was made Editor-in-Chief of daily Maltese newspaper called Il-Hajja (The Life).

In 1973 Frendo graduated with a Masters in History from the University of Malta, with a thesis on the language-culture clash in the 19th – 20th century between traditional italianita’ – latinita’ adherents and utilitarian assimilationist pro-English supporters and the emergence of Maltese language. In the same year, Frendo became resident at University College at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Frendo received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Modern History from the University of Oxford in 1976. In his doctoral thesis, Frendo wrote on the formation of political parties in Malta under British rule, which was later published in his 1979 book ''Party Politics in a Fortress Colony''. Frendo later returned to Malta, between 1976-1978, to be promoted from Assistant Lecturer to Lecturer in History at the University of Malta.

In 1978 Frendo accepted a position with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) at their Headquarters in Geneva, after he encountered fierce resistance to his academic work by the [[Malta Labour Party|Labour]] government. In 1979 Frendo was promoted to the position of Programme Officer in the Middle East and North Africa section, whilst still in Geneva.

From 1985 to 1988 Frendo was a [[Senior Lecturer]] in European political development, Commonwealth history and Ethnic Studies at La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia. At this same time, Frendo also worked as a consultant with the [[Australian National University]] in Canberra on the Australian bicentennial social encyclopaedia, and as a consultant to the Victor Ethnic Affairs Commission where he set up Victoria’s Legal Interpreting Services.

In 1988 Frendo returned to Malta where he was appointed as Associate Professor of Modern History with the University. In 1989 Frendo accepted a Fellowship with the [[University of Salzburg]], Austria. Since 1988 Frendo has been involved in extensive television, radio and journalist work. Frendo started off 1992 by being appointed a full-ranked Professor in Modern History at the University of Malta. In this same year, Frendo also appeared as a Guest Professor with the [[University of Augsburg]] in Germany lecturing in their Faculty of Philosophy and Sociology. In 1993 Frendo was appointed [[Chairman]] of the European Cultural Foundation’s Malta branch, a post which he held until 1997. From 1994-2001 Frendo served as Mayor of Attard (Malta) and as the President of the College of Mayors. In 1996 Frendo was elected a [[Life Member]] of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] whilst there as a visiting fellow. From 1996 to 1998, Frendo was Chairman of the [[Euro-Med Group]] and was Head of Delegation to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe (CLRAE) for two terms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040714/local/henry-frendo-short-listed-for-top-euromed-post&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2000 Frendo received a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to lecture at [[Loyal University in New Orleans]] (USA). In 2001 Frendo became the [[Vice-President]] of the CLRAE. In this same year, Frendo was appointed as the Maltese Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs’ Chairman of the Refugee Appeals Board in Valletta (Malta).

An '''interview''' is a [[conversation]] where [[question]]s are asked and answers are given.&lt;ref name=twsMerriam&gt;Merriam Webster Dictionary, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interview Interview], Dictionary definition, Retrieved February 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In common parlance, the word "interview" refers to a one-on-one conversation between an ''interviewer'' and an ''interviewee''. The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually so information may be transferred from  interviewee to interviewer (and any other audience of the interview). Sometimes, information can be transferred in both directions. [[communication]], unlike a speech, which produces a one-way flow of information.

Interviews usually take place [[Face-to-face interaction|face to face]] and in person, although modern communications technologies such as the [[Internet]] have enabled conversations to happen in which parties are separated geographically, such as with [[videoconferencing]] software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.brandeis.edu/hiatt/howto/interview/index.html |title= Introduction to Interviewing |publisher= [[Brandeis University]] |accessdate= 2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[telephone interview]]s can happen without visual contact. Interviews almost always involve [[speech|spoken conversation]] between two or more parties, although in some instances a "conversation" can happen between two persons who type questions and answers back and forth. Interviews can range from [[Unstructured interview|unstructured]] or free-wheeling and open-ended conversations in which there is no predetermined plan with prearranged questions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Rogers|first1= Carl R.|title= Frontier Thinking in Guidance|date= 1945|publisher= Science research associates|location= University of California|pages= 105–112|url= https://books.google.com/?id=3OdBAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=frontiers+of+guidance+Non-directive+counselling+as+an+effective+technique&amp;q=Non-directive+counselling+as+an+effective+technique|accessdate= March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to highly [[structured interview|structured]] conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagepub.com/booksProdDesc.nav?prodId=Book226668 Kvale &amp; Brinkman. 2008. InterViews, 2nd Edition. Thousand Oaks: SAGE.] {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2542-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can follow diverse formats; for example, in a [[ladder interview]], a respondent's answers typically guide subsequent interviews, with the object being to explore a respondent's [[subconscious]] [[Motivation|motives]].&lt;ref&gt;2009, Uxmatters, [http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/07/laddering-a-research-interview-technique-for-uncovering-core-values.php Laddering: A research interview technique for uncovering core values]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=15 Tips on How to Nail a Face-to-Face Interview |url=https://blog.pluralsight.com/15-tips-on-how-to-nail-a-face-to-face-interview |website=blog.pluralsight.com |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the interviewer has some way of recording the information that is gleaned from the interviewee, often by writing with a pencil and paper, sometimes transcribing with a [[Digital video recorder|video]] or [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] recorder, depending on the context and extent of information and the length of the interview. Interviews have a duration in time, in the sense that the interview has a beginning and an ending.

The traditional two-person interview format, sometimes called a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and followups, which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy of responses. It is a flexible arrangement in the sense that subsequent questions can be tailored to clarify earlier answers. Further, it eliminates any possible distortion by having third parties present.

Face to face interviewing makes it easier for people to interact and form a connection, and it helps both the potential employer and potential hire who they might be interacting with.&lt;ref name=SS1&gt; Snap Surveys, [https://www.snapsurveys.com/blog/advantages-disadvantages-facetoface-data-collection/ Advantages and disadvantages of face to face data collection], Retrieved April 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Further, face to face interview sessions can be more enjoyable.&lt;ref name=SS1/&gt;

== Contexts ==
Interviews can happen in a wide variety of contexts:

'''Employment'''. Interviews in an employment context are typically called [[job interview]]s which describe a formal consultation for the purpose of evaluating the qualifications of the interviewee for a specific position.&lt;ref name = "Dipboye et al"&gt;Dipboye, R. L., Macan, T., &amp; Shahani-Denning, C. (2012). The selection interview from the interviewer and applicant perspectives: Can't have one without the other. In N. Schmitt (Ed.), The Oxford handbook of personnel assessment and selection (pp. 323-352). New York City: Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews are seen as a useful tool in assessing qualifications.&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/value-importance-job-interview-1660.html |title=The Value or Importance of a Job Interview |publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific type of job interview is a [[case interview]] in which the applicant is presented with a question or task or challenge, and asked to resolve the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Lu, ''The Harvard Business School Guide to Careers in Management Consulting'', 2002, page 21, {{ISBN|978-1-57851-581-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes to prepare for job interviews, candidates are treated to a [[mock interview]] as a training exercise to prepare the respondent to handle questions in the subsequent 'real' interview. Sometimes the interviews happen in several waves, with the first interview sometimes being called a ''screening interview'' which is a shorter length interview, followed by more in-depth interviews later on, usually by company personnel who can ultimately hire the applicant. Technology has enabled new possibilities for interviewing; for example, video phoning technology has enabled applicants to interview for jobs despite being in different cities or countries than the interviewer. 

'''Psychology'''. Psychologists use a variety of interviewing methods and techniques to try to understand and help their patients. In a [[psychiatric interview]], a psychiatrist or psychologist or nurse asks a battery of questions to complete what is called a [[psychiatric assessment]]. Sometimes two people are interviewed by an interviewer, with one format being called [[couple interview]]s.&lt;ref name="P-G-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polak |first1=L |last2= Green |first2= J |year= 2015|title=Using Joint Interviews to Add Analytic Value |journal=[[Qualitative Health Research]] |volume=26|issue= 12|pages=1638|publisher= |doi= 10.1177/1049732315580103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminologists and detectives sometimes use [[cognitive interview]]s on eyewitnesses and victims to try to ascertain what can be recalled specifically from a crime scene, hopefully before the specific memories begin to fade in the mind.&lt;ref name = "Memon,Cronin,Eaves,Bull"&gt;Memon, A., Cronin, O., Eaves, R., Bull, R. (1995). An empirical test of mnemonic components of the cognitive interview. In G. Davies, S. Lloyd-Bostock, M. McMurran, C. Wilson (Eds.), Psychology, Law, and Criminal Justice (pp. 135-145). Berlin: Walter de Gruyer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rand Corporation. (1975) The criminal investigation process (Vol. 1-3). Rand Corporation Technical Report R-1776-DOJ, R-1777-DOJ, Santa Monica, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Research'''. In [[marketing research]] and [[academic research]], interviews are used in a wide variety of ways. [[Interview (research)|Interviews]] are often used in [[qualitative research]] in which firms try to understand how consumers think. Consumer research firms sometimes use [[computer-assisted telephone interviewing]] to randomly dial phone numbers to conduct highly structured telephone interviews, with scripted questions and responses entered directly into the computer.&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Journalism and other media'''. Typically, reporters covering a story in [[journalism]] conduct [[Interview (journalism)|interviews]] over the phone and in person to gain information for subsequent publication. Reporters can interview political candidates on television shows. In a [[talk show]], a radio or television "host" interviews one or more people, with the choice of topic usually being chosen by the host, sometimes for the purposes of [[entertainment]], sometimes for informational purposes.  Such interviews are often recorded and some of them can be released on an [[interview disc]].  

'''Other situations'''. Sometimes college representatives or alumni conduct [[college interview]]s with prospective students as a way of assessing a student's suitability while offering the student a chance to learn more about a college.&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe4"/&gt; Some services specialize in coaching people for interviews.&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe4"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3578">'''Johan Nicolay Tønnessen''' (30 November 1901 – 27 December 1987) was a Norwegian historian and schoolteacher.

He was born in [[Kristiansand]] as a son of port magistrate Joh. E. Tønnessen and Ida, née Stray. He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1920 and took the [[cand.philol.]] degree at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in 1928, majoring in history and minoring in French and Latin. He also took [[pedagogy]] in 1926 and was a substitute at Trondhjem Cathedral School from 1927 to 1928. In 1928 he married Lulla Evensen; they had two daughters and one son.&lt;ref name=filo&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tønnessen, Johan Nicolay|encyclopedia=Norges filologer og realister|edition=2nd|year=1950|language=Norwegian|page=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a teacher at [[Gjøvik Upper Secondary School]] from 1928 to 1935 and [[Grefsen Upper Secondary School]] from 1935 to 1959.&lt;ref name=filo/&gt;&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; In Gjøvik he was elected to the city council in the [[Norwegian local elections, 1934]]. He represented the Fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], which with 10.9% of the vote had its third most successful city election in Gjøvik. Moving to Oslo, he did not finish the term.&lt;ref name=g150&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruud|first1=Marit Ekne|last2=Nygård|first2=Trond|title=Vilje til vekst|series=Gjøvik 150 år|volume=1st|year=2010|publisher=Alfa|location=Gjøvik|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-92253-35-9|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the school board and deputy member of the [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] of [[Aker, Norway|Aker]].&lt;ref name=filo/&gt;

During the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], when Nasjonal Samling was actually propelled to power as a collaborationist party, Tønnessen was arrested by the authorities in August 1943 for resistance work. He was imprisoned in [[Bredtveit concentration camp]] until November, then in [[Møllergata 19]], then from April to October 1944 at [[Akershus Fortress]], and ultimately in [[Grini concentration camp]] until the war's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Kristian Ottosen|Ottosen, Kristian]]|title=Nordmenn i fangenskap 1940–1945|edition=1st|year=1995|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-15-00288-9|page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tønnessen later took the [[dr.philos.]] degree in history, and issued the books ''Ole Nielsen (Aalgaard) og hans slekt'' (1953), ''Kaperfart og skipsfart 1807–1814'' (1955), ''Porsgrunns historie'' (two volumes in 1956 and 1957). He contributed to ''Den norske sjøfarts historie'' (1951), ''Den moderne hvalfangst historie'' (1968–1970) and the third volume of ''Kristiansands historie'' (1974).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2192">'''John Hobson Mathews''' (1858-1914) was a Roman Catholic Historian, Archivist and Solicitor.

He was born in Croydon to Emma Hobson from Great Grimsby and his father from St. Ives. He attended schools in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and [[Cambridge]] and worked in Malta for a short period with a shipping firm. Mathews joined the Roman Catholic church in 1877 and became a solicitor in 1889, subsequently working in Cardiff. As a keen linguist, he edited ''Emynau Catholig'' (English: 'Catholic Hymns'), translated ''Ffordd y Groes'' ('The way of the cross') and joined the Welsh Bardic Gorsedd. Mathews also edited the ''Cardiff Records, being materials for a history of the County Borough from the earliest times'' (1898-1911) and wrote a report on the Monmouthshire County Council records in 1905. He was involved in the transactions of the Cardiff Naturalists Society and, more significantly, the [[Catholic Record Society]], being among the original members of this society.

Mathews understood [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. He married Alice Mary Gwyn-Hughes in 1892, who bore him four sons and two daughters.

He died on 30 January 1914 in Ealing.

'''John Richard Green''' (12 December 1837 – 7 March 1883) was an English historian.

== Early life ==
Green was born on 12 December 1837,{{sfn|Stephen|1901|p=1}} the son of a tradesman in [[Oxford]], where he was educated, first at [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]], and then at [[Jesus College, Oxford]],{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}} where he is commemorated by the J. R. Green Society, which meets several times a term and is run by students from the undergraduate body.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He grew up in a [[high church|high-church]] [[Tory]] family from which he rebelled as early as 1850, being "temporarily banished from his uncle's house for ridiculing the uproar over 'Papal Aggression.'"{{sfn|Jann|1985|p=142}}

== Career ==

=== Ecclesiastical career ===
He entered the church, being ordained to the diaconate in 1860,{{sfn|Creighton|1890|p=47}} and served various cures in [[London]], under a constant strain caused by delicate health.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}} Always an enthusiastic student of history, the little leisure time he had was devoted to research.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}}

=== Turn to historical writings ===
In 1869 he finally gave up his work as a clergyman, and was appointed librarian at Lambeth.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}} He had been laying plans for various historical works, including a History of the English Church as exhibited in a series of Lives of the [[Archbishops of Canterbury]], and, what he proposed as his ''[[magnum opus]]'', a history of England under the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin]] kings.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}} After suffering from failing health he abandoned these projects and instead concentrated his energies on the preparation of his ''[[A Short History of the English People]]'', which appeared in 1874, and at once gave him an assured place in the first rank of historical writers.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}}

Abandoning his proposed history of the Angevins, he confined himself to expanding his ''Short History'' into ''A History of the English People'' in four volumes (1878–1880) and writing ''The Making of England'', of which one volume only, coming down to 828, had appeared when he died at Mentone in March 1883.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}} After his death appeared ''The Conquest of England''.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}} The ''Short History'', which in 1915 was republished as part of the [[Everyman Library]],{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} may be said to have begun a new epoch in the writing of history, making the social, industrial, and moral progress of the people its main theme.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|pp=167–168}} It sold 235,000 copies in England alone.{{sfn|Jann|1985|p=141}}

More recently [[J.&amp;nbsp;W. Burrow]] proposed that Green, like [[William Stubbs]] and [[Edward Augustus Freeman]], was a historical scholar with little or no experience of public affairs, with views of the present that were Romantically historicised, and who was drawn to history by what was in a broad sense an antiquarian passion for the past, as well as a patriotic and populist impulse to identify the nation and its institutions as the collective subject of English history, making 
{{quote|... the new historiography of early medieval times an extension, filling out and democratising, of older Whig notions of continuity. It was Stubbs who presented this most substantially; Green who made it popular and dramatic&amp;nbsp;... It is in Freeman&amp;nbsp;... of the three the most purely a narrative historian, that the strains are most apparent.{{sfn|Burrow|1981|p=227}}}}

== Personal life ==
In 1877 he married [[Alice Stopford Green|Alice Stopford]].{{sfnm |1a1=Cousin |1y=1910 |1p=167 |2a1=Creighton |2y=1890 |2p=48}}

During the 1870s Green suffered from [[lung]] problems.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} His wife assisted him in carrying out and completing his work as his broken health took its toll during his few remaining years.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=167}} He died on 7 March 1883.{{sfn|Creighton|1890|p=48}}

'''Julia Hillner''' is Professor of Medieval History at the [[University of Sheffield]]. She is known in particular for her work on [[late antiquity]] and her application of digital methods of [[social network analysis]] to large data sets drawn from a wide variety of late antique and early medieval sources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/history/staff/julia-hillner#tab00|title=Hillner, Julia - Staff - History -  The University of Sheffield|last=Sheffield|first=University of|website=www.sheffield.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Hillner studied for her [[Staatsexamen]] and PhD at the [[University of Bonn]]. She completed her PhD in 2001, which included a one-year visiting doctoral fellowship at the University of Padova (1997-8).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/jedes-haus-ist-eine-stadt-privatimmobilien-im-spatantiken-rom/oclc/57066908|title=Jedes Haus ist eine Stadt: Privatimmobilien im spätantiken Rom|last=Hillner|first=Julia|date=2004|publisher=R.

From 1999 Hillner worked on the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] project ''Religion, Dynasty and Patronage in Rome, c. 440-840'' at the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=4630|title=Discover - Religion, Dynasty and Patronage in Rome, c.440-840|website=discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a teaching fellow in Early Christianity and was a [[British Academy]] Postdoctoral Fellow from 2003 to 2008 working on ''Imprisonment in Late Antiquity: Christian Memory and Social Reality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/sites/default/files/ba-review07.pdf|title=British Academy Review (Issue 7 2003)|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cooper|first=Kate|title=Introduction|date=September 2007|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/religion-dynasty-and-patronage-in-early-christian-rome-300900/introduction/FFE69A57C87973B60EE37FD9D44238F1|work=Religion, Dynasty, and Patronage in Early Christian Rome, 300–900|pages=1–18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511482731.001|isbn=9780511482731|access-date=2018-08-20|last2=Hillner|first2=Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Religion_Dynasty_and_Patronage_in_Early.html?id=p1RkQgAACAAJ&amp;source=kp_author_description&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Religion, Dynasty, and Patronage in Early Christian Rome, 300-900|last=Cooper|first=Kate|last2=Hillner|first2=Julia|date=2010-02-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521131278|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillner moved to the [[University of Sheffield]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hillner's work on imprisonment in late antiquity resulted in her publication ''Prison, Punishment and Penance in Late Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2015) which won an Honorable Mention at the 2016 PROSE Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://proseawards.com/winners/2016-award-winners/#body|title=2016 Award Winners - PROSE Awards|work=PROSE Awards|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.dept.shef.ac.uk/tag/julia-hillner/|title=Julia Hillner {{!}} The Department of History|website=history.dept.shef.ac.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014 to 2017 Hillner was the Principal Investigator of ''The Migration of Faith: Clerical Exile in Late Antiquity'', an [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] funded project in collaboration with the Digital Humanities Institute at the [[University of Sheffield]], the Faculty of Theology at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]], the Department of Culture and Society at [[Aarhus University]], the Abteilung Byzanzforschung at the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], and the [[German Historical Institute London|German Historical Institute]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL006812%2F1|title=The Migration of Faith: Clerical Exile in Late Antiquity (325-c.600AD)|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Research and Innovation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhi.ac.uk/sites/clericalexile/people/staff/|title=Staff|date=2014-09-23|work=The Migration of Faith|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhi.ac.uk/projects/clerical-exile-in-late-antiquity/|title=Clerical Exile in Late Antiquity|date=2014-10-07|work=DHI|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovative project examined the banishment of Christian clerics across the Mediterranean during the religious controversies of [[late antiquity]] and how this shaped the institution of the Christian church. It constructed an online [[Prosopography|prosopographical]] database of exiled clerics from a wide variety of source material including contemporary [[epigraphy]], histories, [[hagiography]], and letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhi.ac.uk/sites/clericalexile/resources/database/|title=Database|date=2014-10-03|work=The Migration of Faith|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also resulted in the publication of a number of books and articles on the subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhi.ac.uk/sites/clericalexile/resources/books-and-articles/|title=Books and articles|date=2014-10-03|work=The Migration of Faith|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an edited volume ''Clerical Exile in Late Antiquity,'' the publication of the ''XVII International Conference on Patristic Studies'' held at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/publications/clerical-exile-in-late-antiquity(f375034a-9174-4825-9302-f7e93ad25c4e).html|title=Clerical Exile in Late Antiquity - Research - Aarhus University|website=pure.au.dk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-15|editor-last=Hillner|editor-first=Julia|editor2-last=Ulrich|editor2-first=Jörg|editor3-last=Engberg|editor3-first=Jakob|title=Clerical Exile in Late Antiquity|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/title/18490|language=en|doi=10.3726/978-3-653-06051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordpatristics.com/|title=patristics|website=patristics|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Hillner started a new project funded by the [[Leverhulme Trust]] on ''Women, Conflict and Peace: Gendered Networks in Early Medieval Narratives (c. 330-735).''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/sites/default/files/RPG%20March%202018_v4.pdf|title=Leverhulme Trust Research Project Grants 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/faculty/arts-and-humanities/ahfnews/women-conflict-peace-gendered-networks-in-early-medieval-narratives-1.774851|title=Leverhulme Trust project grant for a project entitled 'Women, Conflict and Peace: Gendered Networks in Early Medieval Narratives' - News - Faculty of Arts and Humanities - Faculties -  The University of Sheffield|last=Sheffield|first=University of|website=www.sheffield.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project will run from 2018 to 2020 and focuses on how women and their networks fitted into the narrative of conflict and peace during the turbulent period of the 4th to 8th centuries. Hillner's work will again use digital methods of network analysis to focus on the social roles of women rather than studying individuals and will use material from a wide variety of late antique and early medieval sources.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hillner is also under contract with Oxford University Press to write a biography of [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], mother of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] for the Women in Antiquity series.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/w/women-in-antiquity-wia/?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Women in Antiquity - Oxford University Press|website=global.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is planned to examine Helena in the context of a network of female contacts and the social parameters of late antique women. Hillner writes a blog dedicated to the subject of Helena and her life called ''Writing Helena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://writinghelena.wordpress.com/|title=Writing Helena|website=Writing Helena|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kachhalā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: कछला) is the first month in the [[Nepal Era]] calendar, the national [[lunar calendar]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Sambat gets national status |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5 |accessdate=8 May 2014 |newspaper=The Rising Nepal |date=24 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104054/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5 |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The month corresponds to [[Kartika (month)|Kārtik]] in the [[Hindu lunar calendar]] and roughly matches [[November]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

Kachhalā begins with the [[new moon]] and the [[full moon]] falls on the 15th of the [[lunar month]]. The month is divided into the bright and dark fortnights which are known as Kachhalā Thwa (कछला थ्व) and Kachhalā Gā (कछला गा) respectively.

The most important festival that occurs during this month is [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] ([[Swanti (festival)|Swanti]]). The first day of the bright fortnight of Kachhalā is New Year's Day when [[Newar]]s observe [[Mha Puja]], an auspicious ceremony to invoke good fortune during the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mha Puja today, Nepal Sambat 1132 being observed|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2011/10/27/top-story/mha-puja-today-nepal-sambat-1132-being-observed/342845.html|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=Ekantipur|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full moon [[Kartik Poornima|Kārtik Purnimā]] is also a major religious holiday. In [[Nepal Mandala]], the day is celebrated as Saki Milā Punhi (सकि मिला पुन्हि) or Saki Manā Punhi (सकि मना पुन्हि). Sacred paintings known as Halimali, which are made of popcorn, wheat and black soybeans, are displayed in front of temples to mark the end of the month-long hymn singing season. The special food of the day is boiled arum and sweet potato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Robert Isaac |date=1990 |title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|chapter=A Catalogue of Annual Events and Their Distribution throughout the Lunar Year |publisher= University of California Press |page=643 |isbn=9780520069114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Farce de maître Pathelin''''' (in [[English language|English]] '''''The Farce of Master Pathelin'''''; sometimes '''''La Farce de maître Pierre Pathelin''''', '''''La Farce de Pathelin,''''' '''''Farce Maître Pierre Pathelin,''''' or '''''Farce de Maître Pathelin''''') is a fifteenth-century (1457) anonymous [[medieval theatre|medieval farce]] written originally in French.  It was extraordinarily popular in its day, and held an influence on popular theatre for over a century.  Its echoes can be seen in the works of [[Rabelais]]. A number of phrases from the play became proverbs in French, and the phrase "Let us return to our muttons" (''retournons à nos moutons'') even became a common English [[calque]].

In the play there are only five characters: the title character, his wife Guillemette, a [[Cloth merchant|clothier]] named Guillaume Joceaulme, a [[shepherd]] named Thibault l’Aignelet, and finally a judge.  Every character except the last is dishonest in some way, which is exploited to great effect.

The play focuses on issues including the complex emerging state structure and honesty. In total, it can be performed in approximately one hour.

==Plot summary==

Master Pierre Pathelin is a local village [[lawyer]] with no professional, formal training who has very little work, due to the emerging class of professionally trained clerks and lawyers.  In order to obtain cloth to replace his and his wife's holey clothing, he visits the clothier Guillaume Joceaulme.  By flattering him, Pathelin convinces the clothier — against his better judgment — to let him have six yards of fine cloth on [[Credit (finance)|credit]]. However, he promises Joceaulme that he can visit his house that day to be paid.

When Pathelin arrives home he tells his wife Guillemette that the clothier is due to arrive home and to pretend that Pathelin has been sick in bed for almost three months.  After some humorous arguments, Joceaulme barges in on Pathelin, who is in bed and raving like a [[insanity|madman]].  In time Pathelin's entertaining babble moves from one [[French language|French]] [[dialect]] to another, which Guillemette has to explain away.

After Joceaulme gives up on attempting to retrieve his payment, he turns his thoughts to his shepherd, Thibault l’Aignelet, who has been stealing Joceaulme's [[sheep]] and eating them for the past three years.  Joceaulme summons Aignelet to court, and the latter goes to Pathelin in order to be legally represented.  Pathelin directs Aignelet to say only "Baaa" (like a sheep) when anyone questions him in court in the hope that the judge will find Joceaulme's case groundless, as it will appear that he has taken a mentally-challenged person to court.

At the trial Joceaulme instantly recognizes Pathelin.  He tries to explain the details of both cases (the stolen cloth and the stolen sheep) to the judge, but he is unable to do so clearly, and the judge conflates the two cases.  Because of Joceaulme's incoherent case against the shepherd (and the latter's one word nonsense response of "Baaa"), the judge rules against him.  Pathelin attempts to collect his fee from Aignelet, but the latter only answers Pathelin's demands with "Baaa."  Pathelin realizes that his brilliant defense is now being used against him, and he goes home.

==Memorials==
===Ukraine===
[[File:Monument dedicated to Taras Shevchenko.jpg|thumb|244x244px]]
There are many monuments to Shevchenko throughout Ukraine, most notably at his memorial in [[Kaniv]] and in the center of [[Kyiv]], just across from the [[Kyiv University]] that bears his name. The [[Kyiv Metro]] station, [[Tarasa Shevchenka (Kyiv Metro)|Tarasa Shevchenka]], is also dedicated to Shevchenko. Among other notable monuments to the poet located throughout Ukraine are the ones in [[Kharkiv]] (in front of the Shevchenko Park. Kharkiv|Shevchenko Park), [[Lviv]], [[Luhansk]] and many others.
[[File:Памятник Т. Г. Шевченко.jpg|thumb|]]
After Ukraine gained its independence in the wake of the [[Soviet collapse|1991 Soviet Collapse]], some Ukrainian cities replaced their statues of [[Lenin]] with statues of Taras Shevchenko&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Wanner, ''Burden of Dreams: History and Identity in Post-Soviet Ukraine''. Penn State Press: 1998. [https://books.google.com/books?id=k44rN1V8W90C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Burden+of+Dreams:+History+and+Identity+in+Post-Soviet+Ukraine&amp;sig=MHhi4H5NhMKQPlGqFKggwd_EXks].&lt;/ref&gt; and in some locations that lacked streets named to him, local authorities renamed the streets or squares to Shevchenko.

In 2001, the Ukrainian society "[[Prosvita]]" raised the initiative of building a Church near the [[Chernecha Mount]] in [[Kaniv]], where Taras Shevchenko is buried.&lt;ref&gt;Donations list for Kobzareva Church, Prosvita Society, in Ukrainian&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative got a rather supportive response in the society. Since then many charity events have been held all over the country to gather donations for the above purpose. A marathon under the slogan "Let's Build a Church for the Kobzar" by the First National Radio Channel of Ukraine collected 39,000 [[hryvnia]]s (about US$7,500) in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Channel Collects Money for Church to Honor Shevchenko, RISU Portal News, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former USSR countries===
[[File:Official visit of the President to Turkmenistan 06.jpg|thumb|A monument to Shevchenko in [[Ashgabat]].]]
Outside of Ukraine, monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in several locations of the former USSR associated with his legacy, both in the Soviet and the post-Soviet times. The modern monument in [[Saint Petersburg]] was erected on December 22, 2000, but the first monument (pictured) was built in the city in 1918 on the order of [[Lenin]] shortly after the [[October Revolution|Great Russian Revolution]]. There is also a monument located next to the Shevchenko museum at the square that bears the poet's name in [[Orsk]], Russia (the location of the military garrison where the poet served) where there are also a street, a library and the Orsk Pedagogical Institute|Pedagogical Institute named to the poet.&lt;ref name=OrskHist&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://history.opck.org/history/ludi/shevchenko.php Historical page of Orsk].&lt;/ref&gt; There are Shevchenko monuments and museums in the cities of [[Kazakhstan]] where he was later transferred by the military: [[Aqtau]] (the city was named ''Shevchenko'' between 1964 and 1992) and nearby [[Fort Shevchenko]] (renamed from Fort Alexandrovsky in 1939), and a street after him in Vilnius, where he also lived. [[T.G. Shevchenko University]] in [[Tiraspol]], the capital of [[Transnistria]], is the main university of that region.
There is also a bilingual Taras Sevchenko high school in [[Sighetu Marmatiei]], Romania. A monument to Taras Shevchenko on a street that bears his name can also be found in the city centre of Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

===North America===
Outside of Ukraine and the former [[USSR]], monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in many countries, usually under the initiative of local [[Ukrainian diaspora]]s. There are several memorial societies and monuments to him throughout Canada and the United States. 
The most notable American monument is the large bronze and granite [[Taras Shevchenko Memorial (Washington, D.C.)|monument in Washington, D.C.]], near [[Dupont Circle]] designed by artist [[Leo Mol]]. The carving of the granite stonework was by [[Vincent Illuzzi]] of Barre, Vermont. There is also a monument in [[Soyuzivka]] in New York State, Tipperary Hill in [[Syracuse, New York]].

A park in [[Elmira Heights, New York|Elmira Heights, N.Y.]] and a street is named after Shevchenko in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. A section of [[Connecticut Route 9]] that goes through [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] is also named after Shevchenko.

The most notable Canadian monument is the bronze and granite statue of Taras Shevchenko in [[Ottawa]], created by Leo Mol, and unveiled on June 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukremb.ca/canada/ua/news/detail/61807.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326121833/http://ukremb.ca/canada/ua/news/detail/61807.htm |archivedate=March 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Taras Shevchenko Monument Ottawa]]).
The [[Leo Mol]] [[sculpture garden]] in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, contains many images of Taras Shevchenko.

A two-tonne bronze statue of Shevchenko, located in a memorial park outside of [[Oakville, Ontario]] was discovered stolen in December 2006. It was taken for scrap metal; the head was recovered in a damaged state, but the statue was not repairable. The head is on exhibit at the Taras Shevchenko Museum &amp; Memorial Park Foundation in Toronto.

A Taras Shevchenko Museum &amp; Memorial Park Foundation is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoukes.com/shevchenkomuseum Taras Shevchenko Museum].&lt;/ref&gt; A video tour of the museum was created in March 2010. Among other exhibits, the video tour includes footage of Shevchenko's death mask.

There is a Shevchenko Boulevard in the Lasalle borough of Montreal, Quebec. The town of [[Vita,Manitoba|Vita]] in [[Manitoba]], Canada was originally named Shevchenko in his honor.

==Elsewhere==

== Biography ==
[[File:Harsagr.jpg|250px|thumb|Michael Harsgor as a teacher in a highschool]]
Harsgor was born Michael Goldberg in [[Bucharest]] into a Jewish family who were refugees from the [[October Revolution]] in Russia who settled in [[Romania]]. Early on, Harsgor's parents had the desire to give him a Western education and therefore his family moved to [[France]]. The economic crisis of 1929 damaged his father's business and therefore in 1933 his family returned to Romania. Harsgor's family intended to immigrate to the Land of Israel but this proved impossible during [[World War II]]. His entire family perished in the [[Holocaust]]. Because he was a member of the Socialist–Zionist youth movement [[Hashomer Hatzair]] the Romanian fascist authorities sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment with hard labor. Harsgor ended up working in the printing press of the prison. In 1944 he was released from prison, and continued to be active in the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement.

In 1946, after being active in gathering Jewish teenagers in Romania and facilitating their immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he himself immigrated to Palestine. The British authorities in Palestine limited the Jewish immigration quota at that time and all the passengers on the ship taking him to Palestine were seized imprisoned in camps in [[Cyprus]]. They were released in early 1949 after the establishment of the State of Israel. In Cyprus Harsgor changed his name from Goldberg to Harsgor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4026653,00.html|title=Historian Michael Harsegor dies at 87|first=Tomer|last=Velmer|publisher=Ynet.news.com|date=10 February 2011|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harsgor was a member of Kibbutz [[Zikim]] and was the person who gave the kibbutz its name. Harsgor was a member of the Israeli Communist Party [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]] and worked as a reporter for the Moscow Hebrew newspaper [[Kol HaAm]]. At that time he met his wife Tamar, and his daughter Niva was born.

Harsgor began his academic studies at the Tel Aviv University. He excelled in his Bachelor's degree and therefore the Tel Aviv University sent him to France to continue his studies. Harsgor studied in France for six years. For his academic achievement Harsgor was awarded the degree of [[Docteur d'État]], a degree which is usually not awarded to foreigners. Between 1962 and 1966 Harsgor taught history in the Municipal High School Ironi D in Tel Aviv.

In 1974, Harsgor was in [[Lisbon]] during the [[Carnation Revolution]], and as a result, the history of Portugal became one of his major topics of interest.

For more than twenty years, Harsgor hosted the regularly weekly seven o'clock evening program "Sha'a Historit" (History Hour) on the [[Army Radio (Israel)|Galatz]] radio station, along with the Israeli radio broadcaster Alex Ansky.

His grandson is former deputy mayor of Kfar Saba, [[Ilai Harsgor Hendin]].

Harsgor died on 10 February 2011 at the age of 86 in the city of [[Kfar Saba]] due to [[kidney disease]].

'''Nikita Vasilyevich Petrov''' ({{lang-ru|Ники́та Васи́льевич Петро́в}}, born 31 January 1957, Kiev) is a [[Russia]]n [[historian]]. He works at ''[[Memorial (society)|Memorial]],'' a Russian organization dedicated to studying Soviet political repression. Petrov specializes in [[Soviet security service]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memo.ru/d/3409.html "Никита Васильевич Петров"] at the ''Memorial'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

The book about  [[Nikolai Ezhov]] written by Nikita Petrov and Marc Jansen is based on the archives made accessible after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. Petrov's part was tracking original archival documents, while Jansen worked with published sources.

On March 24, 2005 Nikita Petrov was awarded Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland]] for his efforts in uncovering truth about repressions against [[Polish people]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WMP20050430594 Rej. 60/2005: Postanowienie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z dnia 24 marca 2005 r. o nadaniu orderów]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Petrov earned Ph.D. from the [[University of Amsterdam]] (Instituut voor Cultuur en Geschiedenis, Faculty of Humanities) with the thesis "Сталин и органы НКВД-МГБ в советизации стран Центральной и Восточной Европы. 1945–1953 гг."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dare.uva.nl/record/1/392553 Сталин и органы НКВД-МГБ в советизации стран Центральной и Восточной Европы. 1945–1953 гг. : Stalinisme en Sovjetisering 1945-1953 : Een studie van archiefmateriaal over Stalin, de NKVD-MGB, Duitsland en andere landen in Centraal- en Oost-Europa], UvA-DARE (Digital Academic Repository)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the journal|Paleoceanography (journal)}}
{{Primary sources|date=November 2016}}
'''Paleoceanography''' is the study of the history of the [[ocean]]s in the [[geology|geologic]] past with regard to circulation, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], geology and patterns of [[sedimentation]] and biological productivity. Paleoceanographic studies using environment models and different proxies enable the scientific community to assess the role of the oceanic processes in the global [[climate]] by the re-construction of past climate at various intervals.  Paleoceanographic research is also intimately tied to [[paleoclimatology]].

== Source and methods of information ==
{{Life timeline}}
Paleoceanography makes use of so-called [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] methods as a way to infer information about the past state and evolution of the worlds oceans.  Several geochemical proxy tools include long-chain organic molecules (e.g. [[alkenone]]s), stable and radioactive [[isotope]]s, and trace metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henderson|first1=Gideon M.|title=New oceanic proxies for paleoclimate|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=October 2002|volume=203|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00809-9|bibcode=2002E&amp;PSL.203....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, sediment cores can also be useful; the field of paleoceanography is closely related to [[sedimentology]] and [[paleontology]].

=== Sea-surface temperature ===
Sea-surface temperature (SST) records can be extracted from deep-sea sediment cores using [[Δ18O|oxygen isotope ratios]] and the ratio of magnesium to calcium (Mg/Ca) in shell secretions from plankton, from long-chain organic molecules such as alkenone, from tropical corals near the sea surface, and from mollusk shells.&lt;ref name=Cronin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cronin|first1=Thomas M.|title=Paleoclimates : understanding climate change past and present|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231144940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Δ18O|Oxygen isotope ratios (δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O)]] are useful in reconstructing SST because of the influence temperature has on the isotope ratio. Plankton take up oxygen in building their shells and will be less enriched in their δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O when formed in warmer waters, provided they are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urey|first1=Harold C.|title=The thermodynamic properties of isotopic substances|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed)|date=1947|pages=562|doi=10.1039/JR9470000562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When these shells precipitate, they sink and form sediments on the ocean floor whose δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O can be used to infer past SSTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Emiliani |first=C.  |year=1955 |title=Pleistocene temperatures |journal=Journal of Geology |volume=63 |pages=538–578 |doi=10.1086/626295 |bibcode=1955JG.....63..538E |jstor=30080906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxygen isotope ratios are not perfect proxies, however. The volume of ice trapped in continental ice sheets can have an impact of the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.  Freshwater characterized by lower values of δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O becomes trapped in the continental ice sheets, so that during glacial periods seawater δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O is elevated and [[calcite]] shells formed during these times will have a larger δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olausson|first1=Eric|title=Evidence of climatic changes in North Atlantic deep-sea cores, with remarks on isotopic paleotemperature analysis|journal=Progress in Oceanography|date=January 1963|volume=3|pages=221–252|doi=10.1016/0079-6611(65)90020-0|bibcode=1963PrOce...3..221O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shackleton|first1=Nicholas|title=Oxygen Isotope Analyses and Pleistocene Temperatures Re-assessed|journal=Nature|date=1 July 1967|volume=215|issue=5096|pages=15–17|doi=10.1038/215015a0|bibcode=1967Natur.215...15S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The substitution of [[magnesium]] in place of calcium in [[Calcite|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shells]] can be used as a proxy for the SST in which the shells formed. Mg/Ca ratios have several other influencing factors other than temperature, such as vital effects, shell-cleaning, and postmortem and post-depositional dissolution effects, to name a few.&lt;ref name=Cronin/&gt;  Other influences aside, Mg/Ca ratios have successfully quantified the tropical cooling that occurred during the last glacial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lea|first1=D. W.|title=Synchroneity of Tropical and High-Latitude Atlantic Temperatures over the Last Glacial Termination|journal=Science|date=5 September 2003|volume=301|issue=5638|pages=1361–1364|doi=10.1126/science.1088470|pmid=12958356|bibcode=2003Sci...301.1361L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alkenones]] are long-chain, complex organic molecules produced by photosynthetic algae. They are temperature sensitive and can be extracted from marine sediments. Use of alkenones represents a more direct relationship between SST and algae and does not rely on knowing biotic and physical-chemical thermodynamic relationships needed in [[calcite|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert |first=T. D.  |year=2003 |chapter=Alkenone paleotemperature determinations |editor-last1=Holland|editor-first1=H.D.|editor-last2=Turekian|editor-first2=K.K.|title=Treatise on geochemistry|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Oxford|isbn=0-08-043751-6|edition=1st|pages=391–432 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/06115-6|bibcode=2003TrGeo...6..391H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of using alkenones is that it is a product of photosynthesis and necessitates formation in the sunlight of the upper surface layers. As such, it better records near-surface SST.&lt;ref name=Cronin/&gt;

=== Bottom-water temperature ===
The most commonly used proxy to infer [[Paleothermometer|deep-sea temperature history]] are the Mg/Ca ratios in benthic [[foraminifera]] and [[ostracod]]es.  The temperatures inferred from the Mg/Ca ratios have confirmed an up to 3&amp;nbsp;°C cooling of the deep ocean during the late Pleistocene glacial periods.&lt;ref name=Cronin/&gt;  One notable study is that by Lear et al. [2002] who worked to calibrate bottom water temperature to Mg/Ca ratios in 9 locations covering a variety of depths from up to six different benthic foraminifera (depending on location).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Billups|first1=K.|last2=Schrag|first2=D.P.|title=Application of benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios to questions of Cenozoic climate change|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=April 2003|volume=209|issue=1–2|pages=181–195|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(03)00067-0|bibcode=2003E&amp;PSL.209..181B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found an equation calibrating bottom water temperature of Mg/Ca ratios that takes on an exponential form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Mg/Ca} = 0.867 \pm 0.049*\exp(0.109 \pm 0.007*\mathrm{BWT})
:&lt;/math&gt;
where Mg/Ca is the Mg/Ca ratio found in the benthic foraminifera and BWT is the bottom water temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lear|first1=Caroline H|last2=Rosenthal|first2=Yair|last3=Slowey|first3=Niall|title=Benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca-paleothermometry: a revised core-top calibration|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=October 2002|volume=66|issue=19|pages=3375–3387|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(02)00941-9|bibcode=2002GeCoA..66.3375L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salinity ===
[[Salinity]] is a more challenging quantity to infer from paleorecords.  [[Deuterium]] excess in core records can provide a better inference of sea-surface salinity than oxygen isotopes, and certain species, such as diatoms, can provide a semiquantitative salinity record due to the relative abundances of diatoms that are limited to certain salinity regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauch|first1=Henning A.|last2=Polyakova|first2=Yelena I.|title=Diatom-inferred salinity records from the Arctic Siberian Margin: Implications for fluvial runoff patterns during the Holocene|journal=Paleoceanography|date=June 2003|volume=18|issue=2|doi=10.1029/2002PA000847|bibcode=2003PalOc..18.1027B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ocean circulation ===
Several proxy methods have been used to infer past ocean circulation and changes to it.  They include [[Carbon-13|carbon isotope ratios]], [[cadmium]]/[[calcium]] (Cd/Ca) ratios, [[protactinium]]/[[thorium]] isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th), [[radiocarbon]] activity (δ&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), [[neodymium]] isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Nd and &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Nd), and sortable [[silt]] (fraction of deep-sea sediment between 10 and 63 μm).&lt;ref name=Cronin/&gt;  Carbon isotope and cadmium/calcium ratio proxies are used because variability in their ratios is due partly to changes in bottom-water chemistry, which is in turn related the source of deep-water formation.&lt;ref name=Lehman1992&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lehman|first1=Scott J.|last2=Keigwin|first2=Lloyd D.|title=Sudden changes in North Atlantic circulation during the last deglaciation|journal=Nature|date=30 April 1992|volume=356|issue=6372|pages=757–762|doi=10.1038/356757a0|bibcode=1992Natur.356..757L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oppo|first1=D. W.|last2=Lehman|first2=S. J.|title=Mid-Depth Circulation of the Subpolar North Atlantic During the Last Glacial Maximum|journal=Science|date=19 February 1993|volume=259|issue=5098|pages=1148–1152|doi=10.1126/science.259.5098.1148|pmid=17794395|bibcode=1993Sci...259.1148O}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These ratios, however, are influenced by biological, ecological, and geochemical processes which complicate circulation inferences.

All proxies included are useful in inferring the behavior of the [[Thermohaline circulation|meridional overturning circulation]].&lt;ref name=Cronin/&gt;  For example, McManus et al. [2004] used [[protactinium]]/[[thorium]] isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th) to show that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation had been nearly (or completely) shut off during the last glacial period.&lt;ref name=McManus&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McManus|first1=J. F.|last2=Francois|first2=R.|last3=Gherardi|first3=J.-M.|last4=Keigwin|first4=L. D.|last5=Brown-Leger|first5=S.|title=Collapse and rapid resumption of Atlantic meridional circulation linked to deglacial climate changes|journal=Nature|date=22 April 2004|volume=428|issue=6985|pages=834–837|doi=10.1038/nature02494|pmid=15103371|bibcode=2004Natur.428..834M}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th are both formed from the radioactive decay of dissolved uranium in seawater, with &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa able to remain supported in the water column longer than &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th: &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa has a residence time ~100–200 years while &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th has one ~20–40 years.&lt;ref name=McManus/&gt;  In today's Atlantic Ocean and current overturning circulation, &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th transport to the Southern Ocean is minimal due to its short residence time, and &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa transport is high.  This results in relatively low &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa /  &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th ratios found by McManus et al. [2004] in a core at 33N 57W, and a depth of 4.5&amp;nbsp;km.  When the overturning circulation shuts down (as hypothesized) during glacial periods, the &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa /  &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th ratio becomes elevated due to the lack of removal of &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa to the Southern Ocean.  McManus et al. [2004] also note a small raise in the &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa /  &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th ratio during the [[Younger Dryas]] event, another period in climate history thought to have experienced a weakening overturning circulation.&lt;ref name=McManus/&gt;

=== Acidity, pH, and alkalinity ===
[[Boron]] isotope ratios (δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B) can be used to infer both recent as well as millennial time scale changes in the acidity, [[pH]], and alkalinity of the ocean, which is mainly forced by [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations and [[bicarbonate]] ion concentration in the ocean.  δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B has been identified in corals from the southwestern Pacific to vary with ocean pH, and shows that climate variabilities such as the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]] (PDO) can modulate the impact of [[ocean acidification]] due to rising atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pelejero|first1=C.|title=Preindustrial to Modern Interdecadal Variability in Coral Reef pH|journal=Science|date=30 September 2005|volume=309|issue=5744|pages=2204–2207|doi=10.1126/science.1113692|bibcode=2005Sci...309.2204P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application of δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B in plankton shells can be used as an indirect proxy for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations over the past several million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearson|first1=Paul N.|last2=Palmer|first2=Martin R.|title=Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 60 million years |journal=Nature|date=17 August 2000|volume=406|issue=6797|pages=695–699|doi=10.1038/35021000|ref=harv|pmid=10963587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patricia Ann Grimshaw''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|AO|FASSA|FAHA}} (born 16 December 1938) is a retired Australian [[academic]] who specialised in women's and indigenous people's history. One of her most influential works is ''Women's Suffrage in New Zealand'', first published in 1972, which is considered the definitive work on the story of how New Zealand became the first country in the world [[Women's suffrage|to give women the vote]].&lt;ref name=questia1987/&gt;

==Background, education and early career==
Grimshaw was born on 16 December 1938, to a working-class family in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grimshaw, Patricia Ann |url = http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0267b.htm|website =  The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia | publisher=Australian Women's Archives Project 2014 | accessdate =16 December 2015 |first1 = Susan | last1=Foley | first2=Charles | last2=Sowerwine}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied at the [[University of Auckland]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1960 and a [[Master of Arts]] (MA) in 1963.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt; Her MA thesis on women's suffrage was later published as ''Women's Suffrage in New Zealand'' in 1972, and republished in 1975 and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Library search |url = http://librarysearch.auckland.ac.nz/UOA2_A:Combined_Local:uoa_alma21190957740002091 |publisher = University of Auckland |accessdate =18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt; The book became a best-seller in New Zealand in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/docs/1973/NZJH_07_2_10.pdf |title = Review of Women's Suffrage in New Zealand |last = Dalziel |first = Raewyn |date = 1973 |journal = New Zealand Journal of History |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be regarded as the definitive work on the story of the [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|New Zealand women's suffrage campaign]].&lt;ref name=questia1987&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women's Suffrage in New Zealand by Patricia Grimshaw |url = https://www.questia.com/library/3040798/women-s-suffrage-in-new-zealand|website = Questia |accessdate = 15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Grimshaw and her husband moved to [[Melbourne]] and Grimshaw began her doctoral studies at the [[University of Melbourne]] with [[Greg Dening]] and [[Inga Clendinnen]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt; She completed her PhD in 1987, and two years later published her thesis as ''Paths of Duty: American Missionary Wives in Nineteenth-Century Hawaii.'' This work was the first to consider wives of missionaries as active participants in the colonisation process.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1977, Grimshaw joined the Department of History at the [[University of Melbourne]] as a lecturer in women's history.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt; Two years later she began teaching a course on women's history, which then developed into a centre for women's history.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt; During her career she supervised approximately one hundred thesis writers in women's history, and then engaged her students in collaborative research after they had graduated, thus substantially expanding the field of women's history.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt;

In 1992, Grimshaw became a Fellow of the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]] and, in 1997, a Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prof Patricia Grimshaw | url = http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person12634#tab-Awards|publisher = University of Melbourne |accessdate = 16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 to 2000, Grimshaw was president of the [[International Federation for Research in Women's History]], an organisation that she had co-founded.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women's rights and human rights: about the author |url = http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/women's-rights-and-human-rights-patricia-grimshaw/?sf1=barcode&amp;st1=9780230562752|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate = 16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Grimshaw was named [[Max Crawford]] Professor of History and held this position until her retirement in 2006.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt;

Since her retirement, she holds the title Emeritus Professor of History, and continues to work on historical projects such as ''The Australian Women's Register'', and to deliver lectures at community events such as [[International Women's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women at war in the archives – a seminar at PROV featuring Janet Butler and Patricia Grimshaw |url = http://www.womenaustralia.info/blog/2015/02/23/women-at-war-in-the-archives-a-seminar-at-prov-featuring-janet-butler-and-patricia-grimshaw/|website =  Australian Women's Register Blog | accessdate = 16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2010, she was a member of the Committee of the National Foundation for Australian Women.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1933">'''Hans Ludwig David Paul, ''Graf'' Yorck von Wartenburg''' (1 April 1835 – 12 September 1897) was a German lawyer, writer and philosopher.

[[Graf| Graf (Count)]] Yorck developed a [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] philosophy of history in exchange with his friend [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. Their correspondence influenced the early [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]] philosophy of history, especially central concepts of his early thought and ''Being and Time'' such as historicity, generation, and the difference between history as lived (''Geschichte'') and as an object of inquiry (''Historie'').

Yorck was a grandson of the Napoleonic-era field marshal [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3303">The '''Peterhouse School of History''' was named after the [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Cambridge college]] of the same name where the [[history]] taught concentrated on 'high politics'. That is, the study of 'fifty or sixty [[Politician|politicians]] in conscious tension with one another', in the words of the late [[Maurice Cowling]], the most prominent member of the Peterhouse school.

[[Historian]]s generally considered to be part of the Peterhouse school have been [[Michael Bentley (historian)|Michael Bentley]], [[Alistair Cooke, Baron Lexden|Alistair B. Cooke]], Maurice Cowling, John Adamson,  [[Edward Norman (historian)|Edward Norman]] and [[John Vincent (historian)|John Vincent]]. Although some are no longer at Peterhouse and Cowling himself was not comfortable with the label (preferring "Peterhouse Right") these historians, Cowling stated, also:

{{quote|...share common prejudices - against the higher liberalism and all sorts of liberal rhetoric...and in favour of irony, geniality and malice as solvents of enthusiasm, virtue and political elevation.|Maurice Cowling|''Mill and Liberalism: Second Edition'' (CUP, 1990), p. xxx}}

The Peterhouse school see politicians making policy decisions with self-interest their primary goal and ideological principles acting as a kind of smoke screen to cover their true intentions or held because they are politically convenient at the time. Peterhouse historians reject [[biography]] as, Cowling argues, it "abstracts a man whose public action should not be abstracted" because politicians' actions cannot be properly understood in isolation but only by their interaction with fellow politicians. Cowling also claimed that the Peterhouse school treated [[British Parliament|Parliament]] as an instrument of [[class conflict|class warfare]] and that it borrowed from ''[[The Spectator]]'s'' political columnist [[Henry Fairlie]] and [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]]'s central chapters of his ''The Unknown Prime Minister'' the realisation of parliamentary politics as "a spectacle of ambition and manoeuvre".&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice Cowling believed that the term had been coined by Joseph Lee, a professor at [[University College Cork]] but previously a Fellow of Peterhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1986/04/10/the-peterhouse-school/ |title='The Peterhouse School' by Maurice Cowling &amp;#124; The New York Review of Books |journal=The New York Review of Books |date= 1986-04-10|accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cowling's own words:

{{quote|What Professor Lee meant, however, was not a philosophical position but what he called, with a historian's rancour, the "high-political" works which had been written about the history of nineteenth- and twentieth-century English politics by Professor J.R. Vincent, Dr. A.B. Cooke, Dr. Andrew Jones, and myself in the years between 1965 and 1976.|New York Review of Books, March 13, 1986|}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13201">'''Ridgeways''' are a particular type of ancient road that exploits the hard surface of hilltop ridges for use as unpaved, zero-maintenance roads, though they often have the disadvantage of steeper gradients along their courses, and sometimes quite narrow widths. Before the advent of turnpikes or [[toll road]]s, ridgeway trails continued to provide the firmest and safest cart tracks. They are generally an opposite to level, valley-bottom, [[Pavement (material)|paved]] roads, which require engineering work to shore up and maintain. Unmaintained valley routes may require greater travelling distances than ridgeways.

Prehistoric roads in Europe often variously comprised stretches of ridgeway above the line of springs, sections of [[causeway]] through bog and marsh, and other trackways of neither sort which crossed flat country.

A revival of interest in ancient roads and recreational walking in the 19th century brought the concept back into common use. Some ancient routes, in particular [[The Ridgeway]] [[National Trail]] of southern England, have been reprised as [[long-distance trail|long-distance footpaths]].

==Origin==
[[File:Ridgeway.jpg|thumb|right|The Ridgeway passing through open downland]]
Along ridge lines of hills, soil is often exposed and dry because of wind and natural drainage, and vegetation tends to be thinner. Where a beaten track evolves into a busier "road," constant passage by beasts, sleds and wheeled vehicles suppresses regrowth of vegetation. With the help of rain (and [[soil creep]]), a shallow trail can be worn down into the topsoil and smoothed without any purposeful road-making work.  The thin soil and rocky subsoil, combined with the natural drainage provided by the slopes on each side, also tended to keep such roads dry.

In western Europe, where prehistoric roads have been extensively documented with the help of itineraries, traces on old maps and extant marks on the landscape, ridgeways are a typical feature of long-distance ancient routes through rugged, high-rainfall parts of Germany and across the island of Great Britain. These [[ancient trackways]] generally ran along the hilltops, only descending when necessary to cross valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Landau&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, they are an opposite to modern-style roads, which tend to run along the valleys and only ascend when necessary to cross the hilltops.&lt;ref&gt;Weimann, Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
[[File:RidgewayRingfort.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Ridgeway]] (Uffington Castle ringfort in distance on left)]]
In rugged parts of central Germany, ridgeways tend to strictly follow the watershed line proper, since traversing steep slopes was difficult for wheeled vehicles and uncomfortable for foot travellers unless someone had cut a track into the hillside and shored it up against washouts and slips. However, deviations around high peaks were common, usually taking the south side of the peak, presumably because the warmer side was usually drier.&lt;ref&gt;Nicke.&lt;/ref&gt; On flatter British hills, the line of the tracks often runs a little below the actual crest of the ridge, possibly to afford some shelter from the wind or to avoid travellers presenting themselves to marauders as a target on the skyline.&lt;ref&gt;West.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discomfort of following ridgeways arises from their exposure to harsh weather and the fact that they are rarely level. The ridge line rises and falls. Moreover, at some point the ridge ends, so that the route must descend to ford a stream before rising again to follow the next ridge. Loads on two-wheeled carts had to be constantly shifted to the back during descents and to the front during ascents so that the animals could draw efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Nicke.&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval and later times ridgeways in England were used as [[drovers road]]s.

Since ridgeways were informal routes, and the rounded tops of many British and German ridges might be hundreds of metres wide, the track might change seasonally, or spontaneously, if any land alongside the trail appeared drier and firmer. But where the tracks were seen as marking boundaries, the course could no longer change without causing a property dispute. English ridgeway routes became fixed in the course of [[enclosure]]s beginning about 1750.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/ridgeway/text.asp?PageId=22 The Ridgeway website]. Retrieved on 2008-11-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable prehistoric ridgeways include:
;in England
*[[The Ridgeway]] between [[Avebury]] and [[Streatley, Berkshire|Streatley]] in southern England
*The [[Icknield Way]] on the escarpment of the [[Chiltern Hills]] and extending towards Norfolk in southern England
*The Old Shaftesbury Drove and the Ox Drove leading from [[Shaftesbury]] and [[Blandford Forum|Blandford]] to [[Salisbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Victoria County History of Wiltshire Volume 11|work=Bishopstone|pages=3–19|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=115482}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;in Germany
*The [[Rennweg (Arnsberger Wald)]], an old trade route along the [[Arnsberg Forest]]
*The [[Brüderstrasse]] between Cologne and Siegen, Germany
*The [[Rennsteig]] from Gerstungen through the Thuringian mountains of Germany, restored from 1896 onwards as a 169-kilometre trail

Some modern authors have suggested several advantages a ridgeway might possess: 
* A ridgeway trail preserves itself without paving and constant maintenance, which were not available in medieval or early modern times in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Nicke.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A watershed route can cover long distances without crossing water: valley roads require fords or bridges over tributary streams.&lt;ref&gt;Nicke, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some landscapes, a line along a hill is more direct, taking a route as the crow flies, whereas valley routes tend to [[meander]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicke.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Routes well away from arable land in valleys can avoid tolls and customs charges imposed by land-owners or potentates.&lt;ref&gt;Mechelhoff&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Despite laws on rights of way, lowland farmers encroach on paths which they themselves do not use.&lt;ref&gt;Mechelhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; Travellers can bypass villages on higher ground,&lt;ref&gt;Quinlan.&lt;/ref&gt; which has little agricultural value.
* Treeless hilltops may be safer from attack by robbers or fierce animals than densely forested valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Quinlan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
Some ridgeway routes were adopted and paved by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],&lt;ref&gt;Jermy&lt;/ref&gt; even though the prevailing Roman road-construction practice was to build straight roads from point to point, rising and falling with the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs&lt;/ref&gt;

Some German ridgeways were deliberately closed to force traffic into towns.&lt;ref&gt;Landau.&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, the central purpose of the Rheingauer Gebück, a 38-kilometre fence erected in the 12th century, may have been to close down a German ridgeway and force traffic onto the Rhine river.&lt;ref&gt;Mechelhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many ridgeways have continued in use with [[macadam]] or [[Pavement (material)|paved]] surfaces in modern times. Others fell into disuse when more level paved routes, either along valley bottoms or cut transversely along hillsides, were built parallel to them.

Noting the existence of such parallel routes, antiquarians in Britain came to associate ridgeways culturally with ancient [[Britons (historical)|Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;Phelps.&lt;/ref&gt; However the evidence for the great antiquity of ridgeway routes is ambiguous. In the modern era, new cart tracks have generally avoided inhospitable high ground: the 1840s and 1850s [[Emigrant Trail|Wagon Trails]] from the [[Missouri River]] to [[Oregon]] and [[California]] &amp;mdash; rutted trails in bare earth &amp;mdash; generally followed low courses.

==Rediscovery==
In Britain, the term ''ridgeway'' has been in continuous use since Anglo-Saxon times 
as a generic term to distinguish any high travel route from a lower one. The earliest extant written form is spelled ''hrycweg'', dating from 938.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; In German, a variety of terms of similar date match the concept of a ridgeway: ''Rennweg'' (since circa 860: ''Rennewec''&lt;ref&gt;Landau.&lt;/ref&gt;), ''Rennstieg'' (1162: ''Rinnestich''&lt;ref&gt;Landau.&lt;/ref&gt;), ''Bergstrasse'' (C9: ''Birgistrotun''&lt;ref&gt;Landau.&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''hohe Strasse'' (circa 1000 ''Howestraze''&lt;ref&gt;Landau.&lt;/ref&gt;).

A revival of interest in ancient roads in the 19th century brought the concept back into common use. Although the Great [[The Ridgeway|Ridgeway]] northwest of London was the best known of such routes, 19th-century British antiquarians rediscovered numerous other local ridgeways &lt;ref&gt;Phelps.&lt;/ref&gt; and speculated that names such as [[Ryknild Street]] (a valley route) contained the word ridge in modified form.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Georg Landau (1807&amp;ndash;1865) began mapping and walking ancient ridgeway roads across Germany in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, introduction by Willi Görich.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording prehistoric ridgeways today can be difficult. Trails only lightly worn into soil along ridge lines are generally no longer visible, but their courses are sometimes marked by modern roads and footpaths that have perpetuated the ridgeway routes.

A ridgeway previously used by carts often remains physically evident in the form of a [[hollow way]]: a trench or fosse eroded deep into the soil by constant passage of wheels and hooves. These are most common at inclines. Sleds, axles scraping the soil between wheel ruts, locked wheels skidding downhill and heavy weights dragged over the ground to brake the carts' descents would all continue eroding the surface down to the bedrock, if any, which then forms a natural pavement.&lt;ref&gt;Nicke, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it rains, the mud and [[debris]] in an inclined hollow way tend to be washed down the channel, slowly flushing it out and leaving banks on either side where hedgerows may develop and collect more material. Hollow ways can of course occur in any firm-ground trackway, not just in ridgeway sections. On level sections of a ridgeway, banks are less common'&lt;ref&gt;Nicke, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps because travellers avoided large puddles and constantly changed the courses, or because any banks eroded.

==Recreational==
[[File:ASC 7 db.jpg|right|thumb|Part of the outer circle at [[Avebury]] on [[The Ridgeway]]]]
From the 19th century onwards, old ridgeways which had not been converted into highways were often revived by hiking clubs or tourism authorities, marked out as scenic trails for walking, horse-riding or mountain biking far from the disturbances of motor traffic. An 1890 [[Baedeker]] guide recommended walks on The Ridgeway,&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain: Handbook for Travellers, Leipzig, Karl Baedeker, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; and efforts to give that ridgeway legislative recognition began in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Quinlan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some completely new recreational ridgeways have been devised where there was no tradition of the route being used for trade in previous centuries. 
Examples include the ''[[Kammweg]]'' established in 1904 in eastern Germany and the 197-kilometre [[Wessex Ridgeway]] in England, devised in the 1980s by the [[Ramblers Association]], following ridges between the Atlantic coast and [[Avebury]], with a preference for firm paths, good scenery and free access.&lt;ref&gt;Quinlan.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4725">'''Rodulfus''' (or '''Ralph''') '''Glaber''' (which means "the Smooth" or "the Bald") (985–1047) was an [[11th century]] French [[monk]] and [[chronicler]].
 
==Life==
Glaber was born in 985 in [[Burgundy|Burgundy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Radulfus-Glaber&lt;/ref&gt; At the behest of his uncle, a monk at [[Saint-Léger-de-Champeaux]], Glaber was sent to a monastery at the age of twelve, but he was eventually expelled for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Rodulfus Glaber, ''History'' 5.3 (ed. France, p. 221).&lt;/ref&gt; Later he spent time in various other monastaries, such as [[Moutiers-Saint-Jean]], [[Saint-Bénigne à Dijon]], and [[Saint-Germain d'Auxerre]].

Around the year 1010 he joined the monastery of St. Benignus near [[Dijon]] where he met a reform-minded cleric from [[Piedmont]], [[William of Volpiano]], [[Abbot of Saint-Bénigne]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 1028 he traveled to Italy with Volpiano, who encouraged him write what would become his masterpiece, the ''Historiarum libri quinque ab anno incarnationis DCCCC usque ad annum MXLIV'' ("History in five books from 900 AD to 1044 AD"). The chronicle was dedicated to the [[Abbot of Cluny]], [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]]. Today a few manuscripts of the ''Historiarum'' survive, including the author's original copy. As a second work, Rodulfus wrote a biography of Volpiano, which probably arose shortly after his death in 1031. That year, he moved to the [[Abbey of Cluny]], which was headed by Abbot [[Odilon de Mercœur]]. In 1039 he joined the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre]], where he remained until his death.

Glaber is credited with coining the phrase "white mantle of churches", describing the ubiquity of religious architecture of the times.

==Works==
Glaber is best known for ''Historiarum'', which he is believed to have started writing during his time at the Abbey of Cluny around 1026 or so, and completed at [[Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre]] some time later. Initially intended to be an ecclesiastical history, Glaber's focus is on events in the center of France, but occasionally ranges as far as [[Scotland]] and [[Southern Italy]].

Glaber's writings often sympathized with proponents of church reform of that age, including [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], and [[Robert II of France]], while criticizing others like [[Conrad II]], and [[Pope Benedict IX]]. As a source of events, the work is of limited value due to its chronological and geographic inadequacy, but it is significant as a cultural history document for morality and customs of the 11th century.

He also wrote a [[hagiography]] of [[William of Volpiano]], the ''Vita Sancti Guillelmi Abbatis Divionensis.''

Large extracts from his works are cited and discussed in ''The Year 1000'', by French author [[Georges Duby]]. ''Historiarum'' was first published in 1596 from a manuscript owned by [[Pierre Pithou]], as part of a collection of eleven medieval chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Historiae-Francorum-Christi-MCCLXXXV-scriptores/dp/1130597431 (facsimile reprint of 1596 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Included in ''Rodulfi Glabri Historiarum Libri Quinque'' by Rodulfus Glaber (Oxford, 1989) {{ISBN|9780198222415}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seimeni''' (plural of ''Seimen'') designates the group of [[flintlock]]-armed infantry [[mercenaries]] charged with guarding the ''[[gospodar]]'' (ruler) and his court in 17th and 18th century [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]. They were mostly of [[Serbs|Serb]] and other [[Balkans|Balkan]] origin. The term is of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] origin: ''seğmen'' means "young armed man". In modern transcriptions of [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]], it may also appear as ''simén'' (plural: ''siméni'')  or ''siimén'' (''siiméni'').

Menaced by the growing privileges of [[boyars]] and threatened to lose land grants or be turned into [[serfs]], the Wallachian ''seimeni'' rebelled in 1655, being crushed after [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Constantin Şerban]] enlisted the help of [[George II Rákóczi]], [[List of rulers of Transylvania|Prince]] of [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvania]], as well as that of Moldavia's [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Voivode]] [[Gheorghe Ştefan]]. After exercising a rule of terror in [[Bucharest]], capturing and executing several [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyars]], they were decisively defeated by Rákóczi on June 26, 1655, in a battle on the [[Teleajen River]].

'''Slobodan Jovanović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Слободан Јовановић}}; 3 December 1869 – 12 December 1958) was a [[Serbia]]n historian, lawyer, [[philosopher]], literary critic and politician, and one of the most prominent [[intellectual]]s of his time. He was the professor at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] (1897—1940), Rector of the [[University of Belgrade]] (1913-14 and 1920-21), and the President of the [[Serbian Royal Academy]] (1928–1931). He took part at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] (1919) as an expert for the Yugoslav Government.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=tT2sDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA653&amp;dq=serbian+legal+philosophers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq9-evquPeAhVKnOAKHVT-BO4Q6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=serbian%20legal%20philosophers&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Jovanović was the Deputy Prime Minister (March 1941 - June 1942) and the Prime Minister of the Royal [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]] in [[London]] between January 1942 and June 1943. After the [[World War II]], new Communist authorities of [[Yugoslavia]] sentenced him [[in absentia]] to 20 years in prison. Jovanović remained at liberty for the rest of his life in London.

==Biography==
{{unsourced|section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:13 members of the Serbian poetic circle.jpg|thumb|left|Jovanović as part of a poetic circle in his youth.]]
Slobodan Jovanović was born in [[Novi Sad]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (present-day [[Serbia]]) on 3 December 1869 to [[Vladimir Jovanović]] and his wife Jelena. He was reportedly the first Serbian male to be named "[[Slobodan]]" (''sloboda'' means "freedom" in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]), while his sister was named Pravda ("Justice"). He received an excellent education in [[Belgrade]], [[Munich]], [[Zurich]], and [[Geneva]], where he graduated with a law degree. From 1890 to 1892, he took post-graduate studies in [[constitutional law]] and [[political science]] in [[Paris]] before entering the Serbian foreign service. In 1893 he was appointed political attaché with the Serbian mission to [[Constantinople]], where he remained for a couple years. It was at this time that he began to write and have his articles on literary criticism published in various publications throughout the land. 

He eventually left the diplomatic service in favour of academia and literary pursuits. In 1897 he was appointed professor at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law. For more than four decades, Jovanović taught at the law faculty gaining a reputation as an authority on [[constitutional law]] and Serbian language and [[Serbian literature|literature]]. He was [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University of Belgrade in two separate occasions. Jovanović joined the [[Serbian Royal Academy]] in 1908, and was its President from 1928 to 1931. He was also a correspondent member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in [[Zagreb]] from 1927.

Jovanović had some influence on political life in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] due to his well established authority in the field of law and history, but he entered directly political life only in 1939 when the [[Serbian Cultural Club]] was established, and he was appointed as Club's president.

He was a pro-Western politician and when a pro-Western military coup took place in Belgrade on 27 March 1941, a pro-Western, essentially pro-British government was installed headed by General [[Dušan Simović]]. Jovanović was deputy Prime Minister in that government. The [[Third Reich]] attacked the Kingdoms of Yugoslavia and Greece on 6 April, and soon defeated Yugoslav and Greek forces. Jovanović moved in mid April together with King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] and other cabinet ministers to [[Jerusalem]] and he reached [[London]] in July. He became [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|prime minister]] of the [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]] during [[World War II]] on 11 January 1942 and remained in that position until 26 June 1943. 

Tried in absence in [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s communist state together with general [[Draža Mihailović]], he was sentenced to 20 years in jail which he never served, as well as the loss of political and civil rights for a period of ten years, and confiscation of all property and loss of citizenship. He spent his later years in exile in London (1945–1958). A memorial plaque in honour of "Professor Slobodan Yovanovitch. Serbian historian, literary critic, legal scholar, Prime Minister of Yugoslavia" may be found in London at 39b Queen's Gate Gardens, [[Kensington]].

After unofficial rehabilitation in 1989, his collected works were published in 1991. In Serbia, he is regarded as one of the most influential political thinkers of the turn of the century. Leading Serbian journal Politika on the occasion of his 70th birthday concluded that "his name has been carved as the highest peak of our culture up to now".&lt;ref&gt;"Sedamdeset godina zivota gospodina Slobodana Jovanovica" [Seventy years of the life of Mr. Slobodan Jovanovic], ''[[Politika]]'', 4 December 1939, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

His collected works were published in 17 volumes in 1939–1940. It contains the results of his unremitting labour as a writer, professor and politician for sixty years, and throws considerable light on [[Balkan]] history of the first half of the 20th century, as well as on the author himself. Although his works were not officially banned, any new issue of his books was not permitted in communist Yugoslavia until the late 1980s. Finally, a new edition of his collected works was published in Belgrade in 12 volumes in 1991. 

Since 2003 his portrait has appeared on the 5000 [[Serbian dinar|dinar]] banknote, and his bust stands at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law in Belgrade]]. His official rehabilitation occurred on 26 October 2007 by a Belgrade court.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Since 10 December 2011, plateau in front of Faculty of Law in Belgrade bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slobodan Jovanović sahranjen u otadžbini|author=М.

The '''Stolpersteine in Prague-Vršovice and Modřany''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in the town quarters [[Vršovice]] (Praha 10) and [[Modřany]] (Praha 12). Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých''.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

The six-part ''Stones of the Raj'' documents the stories behind some of British India's colonial architecture starting with ''Lahore'' (16 August 1997), ''Calcutta'' (23 August 1997), ''The French Connection'' (30 August 1997), ''The Fatal Friendship'' (6 September 1997), ''Surrey in Tibet'' (13 September 1997), and concluded with ''The Magnificent Ruin'' (20 September 1997).

The trilogy of ''Indian Journeys'' consists of three one-hour episodes starting with ''Shiva’s Matted Locks'' which while tracing the source of the Ganga, takes Dalrymple on a journey to the Himalayas. The second part ''City of Djinns'', is based on his travel book of the same name, takes a look at Delhi's history, and last ''Doubting Thomas'', which takes Dalrymple to the Indian states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], where [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas, the Apostle]] of Jesus is closely associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He has done a six-part history series ''The Long Search'' for Radio 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As Dalrymple says "In the course of my travels I often came across the assumption that intense spirituality was somehow the preserve of what many call 'the mystic East'... it's a misconception that has always irritated me as I've always regarded our own indigenous British traditions of spirituality as especially rich."

The BBC broadcast an acclaimed documentary on 3 September 2015 entitled ''Love and Betrayal in India: The White Mughal'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/18SDBJqWwgc7VLDM7MhGK2S/a-love-story-that-broke-the-conventional-boundaries-of-empire A love story that broke the conventional boundaries of Empire] BBC September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; based on Dalrymple's book ''White Mughals''.
