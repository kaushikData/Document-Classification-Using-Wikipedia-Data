'''{{mp|2006 JY|26}}''', also written '''[[Astronomical naming conventions#Minor planets|2006 JY26]]''', is a [[Horseshoe orbit|horseshoe]] companion to the [[Earth]] like [[3753 Cruithne]].&lt;ref name=dynamics&gt;{{Cite journal | title=A resonant family of dynamically cold small bodies in the near-Earth asteroid belt |first1=C. | last1=de la Fuente Marcos|last2=de la Fuente Marcos|first2= R. | date=July 2013 |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters]]|volume=434|issue=1|pages=L1-L5|doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slt062|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1093/mnrasl/slt062|arxiv=1305.2825|bibcode= 2013MNRAS.434L...1D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery, orbit and physical properties==
{{mp|2006 JY|26}} was discovered by E. J. Christensen on May 6, 2006, observing for the [[Catalina Sky Survey]].&lt;ref name=discovery&gt;[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/mpec/K06/K06J38.html Discovery MPEC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mpc/&gt; 
Its orbit is characterized by low eccentricity (0.083), low inclination (1.44º) and a semi-major axis of 1.01 AU.&lt;ref name=mpc&gt;[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=2006+JY26 MPC data on 2006 JY26]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon discovery, it was classified as an [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] [[asteroid]] but also an [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth crosser]] by the [[Minor Planet Center]]. The orbit is based on 76 observations spanning a data-arc of 4 days.&lt;ref name=jpl&gt;[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2006JY26;cad=1 JPL's Solar System Dynamics data on 2006 JY26]&lt;/ref&gt; {{mp|2006 JY|26}} has an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude (H)]] of 28.4 which gives a characteristic diameter of about 9 meters.&lt;ref name=jpl/&gt;

===Impact risk===
It is listed on the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] with a 1 in 140 chance of [[Impact event|impacting]] Earth on May 3, 2074.&lt;ref name=summary/&gt;&lt;ref name=NEODyS-impact/&gt; The [[Curve fitting|nominal]] best-fit orbit shows that {{mp|2006 JY|26}} will be {{convert|0.006|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth on May 3, 2074.&lt;ref name=jpl/&gt; An impact from this object would be less severe than the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]].

==Horseshoe companion to the Earth and orbital evolution==
Recent calculations indicate that it follows a horseshoe orbit with respect to the Earth.&lt;ref name=dynamics/&gt; It had a close encounter with the [[Earth]] on May 10, 2006, at {{convert|0.0029|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.&lt;ref name=jpl/&gt; Its orbital evolution is very [[Chaos Theory|chaotic]] and its orbit is difficult to predict beyond a few hundred years.&lt;ref name=dynamics/&gt; Its orbit matches the expected properties of that of an object in the [[Arjuna asteroid|Arjuna]]-class.

==Origin==
It may have been originated within the [[Venus]]–Earth–[[Mars]] region or in the main asteroid belt like other [[near-Earth object]]s, then transition to [[Amor asteroids|Amor]]-class asteroid before entering Earth's co-orbital region.&lt;ref name=dynamics/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1513">The '''Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases''', created in 1985, was an advisory body for the review of studies into the [[greenhouse effect]].  The group was created by the [[International Council for Science|International Council of Scientific Unions]], the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] to follow up on the recommendations of the ''International conference of the Assessment of the role of carbon dioxide and of other greenhouse gases in climate variations and associated impacts'', held at [[Villach]], [[Austria]], in October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Alazani Floodplain Forests Natural Monument''' ({{lang-ka|ალაზნის ჭალა}}) is a [[floodplain]] forest located in [[Dedoplistsqaro Municipality]] on banks of [[Alazani River]]  in southeastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.protectedplanet.net/alazani-flood-plane-forests-natural-monument Alazani flood plane forests in Georgia] ''Protected Planet''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Location and access==
Alazani floodplain forests are located on right bank of [[Alazani River]] to the southwest from village [[:ka:ფიროსმანი (დედოფლისწყაროს მუნიციპალიტეტი)|Pirosmani]], at 165 m above sea level.  Protected area covers 204.4 ha of natural floodplain forest. Forest is covered by [[liana]]s and also has in abundance perennial [[walnut]], [[ash]], [[oak]] and [[elm]], as well as characteristic to floodplain forests bushes.  Due to density of the forest it takes one hour to make a distance of  1 km on a pedestrian route in [[Kakliskure]] or [[Walnut Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgiantravelguide.com/en/routes/kaklis-kure-alanazni-peninsula/ Kaklis Kure - Alanazni peninsula]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C/2016 R2 (PANSTARRS)''' is a [[comet]], discovered using the [[Pan-STARRS]] telescopes on September 7, 2016. The comet has recently attracted attention from many astronomers as it approaches its closest point to the sun in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180112.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed to have a very complex [[Comet tail|tail]], which has been suggested to be due to a fast rotation period of the nucleus.

The comet orbits the Sun on a 20,000 year orbit, which takes it out about 740 AU (Sun-Earth distances).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-05-comet-c2016-r2-pan-starrs-rich.html|title=Comet C/2016 R2 (Pan-STARRS) is rich in carbon monoxide and depleted in hydrogen cyanide, study finds|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found to differ from typical comets, and was found to be rich in [[Carbon monoxide|carbon monixide]] (CO) with a blue [[Coma (cometary)|coma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-05-comet-c2016-r2-pan-starrs-rich.html|title=Comet C/2016 R2 (Pan-STARRS) is rich in carbon monoxide and depleted in hydrogen cyanide, study finds|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blue color is though to come from the rich amounts of carbon monoxide being [[ionized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/39579-rare-blue-carbon-monoxide-comet-photos.html|title=Rare Carbon-Monoxide Comet Turns Blue in Stunning Deep-Space Photos|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comet was also noted to be rich in [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/blue-comet-c2016-r2-06506.html|title=Astronomers Spot Rare Blue Comet: C/2016 R2 {{!}} Astronomy {{!}} Sci-News.com|work=Breaking Science News {{!}} Sci-News.com|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comet was observed by a submillimeter wavelength telescope in the late 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-05-comet-c2016-r2-pan-starrs-rich.html|title=Comet C/2016 R2 (Pan-STARRS) is rich in carbon monoxide and depleted in hydrogen cyanide, study finds|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comet made its closest approach to the Sun in May 2018, and its blue, teal, and dust tail were noted as an astronomical target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/39579-rare-blue-carbon-monoxide-comet-photos.html|title=Rare Carbon-Monoxide Comet Turns Blue in Stunning Deep-Space Photos|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue comets are a less common type of comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/blue-comet-c2016-r2-06506.html|title=Astronomers Spot Rare Blue Comet: C/2016 R2 {{!}} Astronomy {{!}} Sci-News.com|work=Breaking Science News {{!}} Sci-News.com|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''carr''' is a type of waterlogged wooded terrain that, typically, represents a [[Ecological succession|succession]] stage between the original reedy [[swamp]] and the likely eventual formation of [[forest]] in a sub-[[maritime climate]].&lt;ref name="Whittow"&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, 1984. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the Old Norse ''kjarr'', meaning a swamp. The carr is one stage in a [[hydrosere]]: the progression of vegetation beginning from a terrain submerged by fresh water along a [[river]] or [[lake]] margin. In sub-maritime regions, it begins with [[Reed bed|reed]]-swamp. As the reeds decay, the soil surface eventually rises above the water, creating [[fen]]s that allow vegetation such as [[sedge]] to grow. As this progression continues, [[riparian zone|riparian]] trees and bushes appear and a carr landscape is created–in effect a wooded fen in a waterlogged terrain. At this stage, overall, unlike overwhelming acidity of decaying reeds, the [[pH]] is not too [[acidic]] and the soil is not too deficient in minerals, making habitat for endemic and other wildlife. Characteristic trees include [[alder]], [[willow]] and [[sallow]].&lt;ref name="Whittow"/&gt;

The '''Centre of Ecology &amp; Rural Development''' ('''CERD''') is an Indian organisation which is part of the [[Pondicherry Science Forum]]. It was exclusively formed for taking up meaningful interventions in Health, Sanitation, Natural Resource Management, Energy, Watershed management and ICT for development.

CERD was set up in the year 1994 jointly by the [[Pondicherry Science Forum]] and [[Tamil Nadu Science Forum]] to take up S&amp;T based development initiatives improving the rural livelihoods of weaker sections. The earlier works included interventions in sericulture, vegetable leather tanning, fish aggregation device etc.

CERD has a field station at Bahoor called the [[Kalanjiyam]] (meaning Granary in Tamil) which acts has a hub of [[agriculture]] and technology options for the surrounding area.

CERD has a full-time manpower structure with a committed team of scientists working on a variety of areas ranging from women’s technology, [[science communication]], Continuing Education, Participatory Irrigation management through local democratic people’s institutions, women’s micro credit networks etc.

The latest of the projects that CERD is now implementing includes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130206050236/http://dst.gov.in/whats_new/whats_new12/EOI-WTP.pdf Women’s Technology Park] (WTP), an AICP Project on BIOFARM, a watershed development project in [[Sedappatti]] Block of Madurai funded by [[NABARD]], the Tank Rehabilitation Project-Pondicherry etc.

==Soil Fertility Management==

R&amp;D Work on Alternate Soil [[Fertility Management]] Strategies
Systems for Irrigated and dry land crops.
Developed Decision System (DSS) for [[Soil]] Fertility Mgmt.

==Bio resource integrated Farming==

Reduction of external inputs.
Increasing internal resource flows in the [[farming system]].
Ensuring nutritional security of the whole farming system.

==Watershed Development==

Initiated programmes in Madurai district.
Participatory planning, implementation and management of the [[Drainage basin|Watershed]] through people’s organizations.

==Participatory Irrigation Mgmt==

Pilot work on irrigation tanks in Pondicherry.
Evolved guidelines for sustainable institutional structures.
All stakeholder participation ensured including women, dalits of landless communities.
Large scale encroachment eviction through participatory approach leading to Participatory Irrigation Mgmt.
Worked in low energy technologies for water system development (Oorani – drinking water pond) in [[Ramanathapuram]]

==Wasteland Reclamation==

Evolved successful models for participatory wasteland reclamation through coalition 
between landless SHG women and farmers’ groups.
Sustainable income for landless Self-help Group (SHG) women through collective farming.

==ICT for Rural Development==

Established the first successful model of Village Information Centre known as '''Samadhan Kendra''' through 
unique content creation in local language.
Software creation for local planning and for primary production in local language 
including Decision Support Systems.

==Fuel Efficient Stoves==

CERD will expand its activities in this area by constructing more stoves and also by expanding the works to other areas like Tamil Nadu etc. CERD construction of a fuel efficient Tawa for making dosa/parotta also more of this also will be done during the coming years. Subsidies from the [[Renewable Energy Agency]] will be sought for the Tawa stove also and that will be another recognition for the work being carried out.

==Biomass based Biogas Units==

With technical collaboration from [[IISc]]. [[Bangalore]], CERD will be constructing 
[[biogas]] units and this will be a new area that CERD will be treading to. 
The units are not gobar based but instead will be based on biomass
decomposition and tapping the biogas for cooking purposes.

==Organic Farming==

Already an Organic Farmers’ Association has been formed and CERD will be extending full 
support to expanding this network including getting organic certification processes 
for the farmers and for arranging marketing linkages for their organic produce. 
This will have full backward and forward linkages starting from seeds, 
plant protection, harvest and post harvest options.

==Nutrition based Kitchen Gardening systems==

This will be mainly women-focused especially for women under SHGs 
since the malnutrition levels of women in [[Pondicherry]] 
are very high and it is estimated that about 80% women face malnutrition. 
This programme also will have complete backward and forward linkages from seeds, 
biomanures, bio pesticides, processing and value addition etc.

==Micro enterprises for SHG women and for weaker sections==

CERD will be concentrating more on viable village level enterprises for improved livelihood options for women, dalits and other weaker sections with providing necessary S&amp;T inputs and EDP skills.

'''Cudlee Creek Conservation Park''' (formerly Cudlee Creek National Park Reserve) is a [[protected area]] located in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] in the locality of [[Cudlee Creek, South Australia| Cudlee Creek]] in the [[Adelaide Hills]] state government region about {{convert|12|km}} south-east of the state capital of [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]] and about {{convert|4|km}} south-west of the town centre in [[Gumeracha, South Australia| Gumeracha]].&lt;ref name=LMV/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRE"&gt;{{cite AHD|7500| Cudlee Creek Conservation Park – listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate |date=1980|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation park consists of land in section 57 in the cadastral unit of the [[Hundred of Talunga]]  which is bounded to the east by [[Gorge Road, South Australia|Gorge Road]] and in part by the [[Torrens River]] whose watercourse is located within the conservation park's  boundaries at times.&lt;ref name=LMV/&gt;  

It was proclaimed on 29 April 1971 as the ''Cudlee Creek National Parks Reserve'' under the National Parks Act 1966.  It was reconstituted on 27 April 1972 as the '' Cudlee Creek Conservation Park'' upon the proclamation of the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]''.&lt;ref name=NPWact&gt;{{cite journal |title= No. 56 of 1972 (National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1972) |journal= The South Australian Government Gazette |date= 27 April 1972 |pages= 660 &amp; 702 |url= http://www9.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/sa/num_act/npawa56o1972293/npawa56o1972293.html |accessdate= 27 February 2018|publisher= Government of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2016, it covered an area of {{convert|49|ha}}.&lt;ref name="ReserveList"/&gt;

In 1980, it was described as follows:&lt;ref name="NRE"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A small park with open forest representative of the Adelaide hills region and containing excellent bird habitat.  The River Torrens flows through a portion of the park, where native hydrophyllic species are preserved.  … consisting of a steep hillside clothed with ''[[Eucalyptus obliqua]]'' / ''[[Eucalyptus goniocalyx |E. goniocalyx]]'' / ''[[ Eucalyptus viminalis |E. viminalis]]'' open forest over an understorey of ''[[Pteridium esculentum]]''. On the lower slopes and along the river course ''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis |E. camaldulensis]]'' open forest over ''[[Acacia melanoxylon]]'' and ''[[Banksia marginata]]'' occur.  The steep slopes are in disturbed natural condition but the lower slopes and riverbank are dominated by an understorey of blackberry (''[[Rubus]]'' sp.) and some gorse (''[[Ulex europaeus]]'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2016SASum/&gt;  In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct [[Register of the National Estate]].&lt;ref name="NRE"/&gt;

'''''De Materia Medica''''' ([[Latin]] name for the [[Greek language|Greek]] work Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς, Peri hulēs iatrikēs, both meaning "On [[Materia medica|Medical Material]]") is a [[pharmacopoeia]] of [[herbs]] and the [[medicine]]s that can be obtained from them. The five-volume work describes many drugs known to be effective, including [[aconitum|aconite]], [[aloes]], [[colocynth]], [[colchicum]], [[henbane]], [[opium]] and [[squill]]. In all, about 600 plants are covered, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from them.

The work was written between 50 and 70 AD by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], a Greek physician in the Roman army. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted by revised [[herbal]]s in the [[Renaissance]], making it one of the longest-lasting of all [[natural history]] books.

''De Materia Medica'' was circulated as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the [[mediaeval]] period. From the sixteenth century on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It formed the basis for [[herbal]]s in these languages by men such as [[Leonhart Fuchs]], [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Matthias de Lobel|Lobelius]], [[Rembert Dodoens]], [[Carolus Clusius]], [[John Gerard]] and [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]]. Gradually these herbals included more and more direct observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text.

Several manuscripts and early printed versions of ''De Materia Medica'' survive, including the illustrated [[Vienna Dioscurides]] manuscript written in the original Greek in sixth-century [[Constantinople]]; it was used there by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] as a hospital text for just over a thousand years. [[Arthur William Hill|Sir Arthur Hill]] saw a monk on [[Mount Athos]] still using a copy of Dioscorides to identify plants in 1934.

Between 50 and 70 AD, a Greek physician in the Roman army, [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], wrote a five-volume book in his native Greek, {{lang|grc|Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς}} (''Peri hules iatrikēs'', "On Medical Material"), known more widely in Western Europe by its Latin title ''De Materia Medica''. He had studied pharmacology at [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] in [[Roman Anatolia]] (now Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton, 2012. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The book became the principal reference work on [[pharmacology]] across Europe and the Middle East for over 1500 years,&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_dioscorides.html | title=Greek Medicine | publisher=National Institutes of Health, USA | date=16 September 2002 | accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was thus the precursor of all modern [[pharmacopoeia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iORoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 | author=Hefferon, Kathleen | title=Let Thy Food Be Thy Medicine | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2012 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBMEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143 | author=Rooney, Anne | title=The Story of Medicine | publisher=Arcturus Publishing | date=2009 | page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to many classical authors, ''De Materia Medica'' was not "rediscovered" in the Renaissance, because it never left circulation; indeed, Dioscorides' text eclipsed the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic corpus]].&lt;ref name="Vos 2010" /&gt; In the medieval period, ''De Materia Medica'' was circulated in Latin, Greek, and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Some detail about medieval manuscripts of ''De Materia Medica'' at [http://www.ibidispress.scriptmania.com/custom.html Ibidis Press]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Renaissance]] from 1478 onwards, it was printed in Italian, German, Spanish, and French as well.&lt;ref name=Boas47&gt;Boas, 1962. p47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1655, John Goodyer made an English translation from a printed version, probably not corrected from the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.panaceavera.com/demateriaindex.html | title=De Materia Medica (by) Pedanius Dioscorides | publisher=Ibidis | work=Preface | date=2000 | accessdate=22 May 2014 | author=Osbaldeston, Tess Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While being reproduced in manuscript form through the centuries, the text was often supplemented with commentary and minor additions from Arabic and Indian sources. Several illustrated manuscripts of ''De Materia Medica'' survive. The most famous is the lavishly illustrated [[Vienna Dioscurides]] (the ''Juliana Anicia Codex''), written in the original Greek in [[Byzantine]] Constantinople in 512/513 AD; its illustrations are sufficiently accurate to permit identification, something not possible with later medieval drawings of plants; some of them may be copied from a lost volume owned by Juliana Anicia's great grandfather, [[Theodosius II]], in the early 5th century.&lt;ref name=Janick2012&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 1500th Anniversary (512-2012) of the Juliana Anicia Codex: An Illustrated Dioscoridean Recension |author=Janick, Jules; Hummer, Kim E. |journal=Chronica horticulturae |volume=52 |issue=3 |year=2012 |pages=9–15 |url=https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/pdfs/ch5203.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naples Dioscurides]] and [[Morgan Dioscurides]] are somewhat later Byzantine manuscripts in Greek, while other Greek manuscripts survive today in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. Densely illustrated Arabic copies survive from the 12th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt9DIY1g9HYC&amp;pg=PA1077 | title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | publisher=Springer | author=Selin, Helaine | year=2008 | page=1077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a complex set of relationships between [[manuscript]]s, involving translation, copying errors, additions of text and illustrations, deletions, reworkings, and a combination of copying from one manuscript and correction from another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Illustrated Books May Be Hazardous to Your Health: A New Reading of the Arabic Receptionand Rendition of the "Materia Medica" of Dioscorides |author1=Saliba, George |author2=Komaroff, Linda | journal=Ars Orientalis | volume=35 | date=2008 | pages=6–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Materia Medica'' is the prime historical source of information about the medicines used by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the [[List of Dacian plant names|Dacian names for some plants]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nutton, Vivian | title=Ancient Medicine | publisher=Routledge | year=2004 | page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources.&lt;ref name=Krebs&gt;{{cite book | last=Krebs | first=Robert E. | first2=Carolyn A. | last2=Krebs | title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Ancient World | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | year=2003 | pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. Introduction, page xx&lt;/ref&gt; Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, 2007. p35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==

Each entry gives a substantial amount of detail on the plant or substance in question, concentrating on medicinal uses but giving such mention of other uses (such as culinary) and help with recognition as considered necessary. For example, on the "Mekon Agrios and Mekon Emeros", the opium poppy and related species, Dioscorides states that the seed of one is made into bread: it has "a somewhat long little head and white seed",&lt;ref name=poppy&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. pp607–611&lt;/ref&gt; while another "has a head bending down"&lt;ref name=poppy/&gt; and a third is "more wild, more medicinal and longer than these, with a head somewhat long — and they are all cooling."&lt;ref name=poppy/&gt; After this brief description, he moves at once into pharmacology, saying that they cause sleep; other uses are to treat inflammation and [[erysipela]], and if boiled with honey to make a cough mixture. The account thus combines recognition, pharmacological effect, and guidance on drug preparation. Its effects are summarized, accompanied by a caution:&lt;ref name=poppy/&gt;

{{quote|A little of it (taken with as much as a grain of ervum) is a pain-easer, a sleep-causer, and a digester, helping coughs and abdominal cavity afflictions. Taken as a drink too often it hurts (making men lethargic) and it kills. It is helpful for aches, sprinkled on with rosaceum; and for pain in the ears dropped in them with oil of almonds, saffron, and myrrh. For inflammation of the eyes it is used with a roasted egg yolk and saffron, and for erysipela and
wounds with vinegar; but for gout with women's milk and saffron. Put up with the finger as a suppository it causes sleep.|Dioscorides—Mekon Agrios and Mekon Emeros&lt;ref name=poppy/&gt;}}

Dioscorides then describes how to tell a good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends with a description of how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: ''chamaesyce'', ''mecon'' ''rhoeas'', ''oxytonon''; ''papaver'' to the Romans, and ''wanti'' to the Egyptians.&lt;ref name=poppy/&gt;

As late as in the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period]]s in Britain, herbals often still classified plants in the same way as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Man and the Natural World | publisher=Allen Lane | author=Thomas, Keith | year=1983 | pages=52–53 | isbn=0-7139-1227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only when European botanists like [[Matthias de l'Obel]], [[Andrea Cesalpino]] and [[Augustus Quirinus Rivinus]] (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification systems]] based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Man and the Natural World | publisher=Allen Lane | author=Thomas, Keith | year=1983 | page=65 | isbn=0-7139-1227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The book is divided into five volumes. Dioscorides organized the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do not correspond to any modern classification. In David Sutton's view the grouping is by the type of effect on the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, 2007. p34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume I: Aromatics===

Volume I covers aromatic oils, the plants that provide them, and ointments made from them. They include what are probably [[cardamom]], [[Spikenard|nard]], [[valerian (herb)|valerian]], [[cassia bark|cassia]] or [[senna (plant)|senna]], [[cinnamon]], [[balm of Gilead]], [[hops]], [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], [[turpentine]],  [[pine]] resin, [[bitumen]], [[Erica|heather]], [[quince]], [[apple]], [[peach]], [[apricot]], [[lemon]], [[pear]], [[medlar]], [[plum]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume II: Animals to herbs===

Volume II covers an assortment of topics: animals including sea creatures such as [[sea urchin]], [[seahorse]], [[whelk]], [[mussel]], [[crab]], [[scorpion]], [[electric ray]], [[Viperidae|viper]], [[cuttlefish]] and many others; dairy produce; [[cereals]]; vegetables such as [[sea kale]], [[beetroot]], [[asparagus]]; and sharp herbs such as [[garlic]], [[leek]], [[onion]], [[caper]] and [[mustard plant|mustard]].&lt;ref&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume III: Roots, seeds and herbs===

Volume III covers roots, seeds and herbs. These include plants that may be [[rhubarb]], [[gentian]], [[liquorice]], [[caraway]], [[cumin]], [[parsley]], [[lovage]], [[fennel]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume IV: Roots and herbs, continued===

Volume IV describes further roots and herbs not covered in Volume III. These include herbs that may be [[betony]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], [[clematis]], [[horsetail]], [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodil]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume V: Vines, wines and minerals===

Volume V covers the grapevine, wine made from it, grapes and raisins; but also strong medicinal potions made by boiling many other plants including [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]], [[hellebore]], and various metal compounds, such as what may be [[zinc oxide]], [[verdigris]] and [[iron oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his fellow physicians of Ancient Rome, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]], [[Galen]], [[Hippocrates]] and [[Soranus of Ephesus]], Dioscorides had a major and long-lasting effect on [[Arabic medicine]] as well as medical practice across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Saad, Bashar |author2=Azaizeh, Hassan |author3=Said, Omar  | title=Tradition and Perspectives of Arab Herbal Medicine: A Review | journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | date=1 January 2005 | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=475–479 | doi=10.1093/ecam/neh133|pmid=16322804 | pmc=1297506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/science+society/lectures/lecture11.html | author=Tomczak, Matthias | title=Lecture 11: Science, technology and medicine in the Roman Empire | work=Science, Civilization and Society (Lecture series) | date=15 December 2008 | origyear=2004 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''De materia medica'' was one of the first scientific works to be translated from Greek into Arabic.

===In Europe===
Writing in ''The Great Naturalists'', the [[history of science|historian of science]] David Sutton describes ''De Materia Medica'' as "one of the most enduring works of natural history ever written"&lt;ref name=Sutton33&gt;Sutton, 2007. p33&lt;/ref&gt; and that "it formed the basis for Western knowledge of medicines for the next 1,500 years."&lt;ref name=Sutton33/&gt;

The historian of science [[Marie Boas]] writes that herbalists depended entirely on Dioscorides and [[Theophrastus]] until the sixteenth century, when they finally realized they could work on their own.&lt;ref name=Boas47/&gt; She notes also that [[herbal]]s by different authors, such as [[Leonhart Fuchs]], [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Matthias de Lobel|Lobelius]], [[Rembert Dodoens]], [[Carolus Clusius]], [[John Gerard]] and [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]], were dominated by Dioscorides, his influence only gradually weakening as the sixteenth century herbalists "learned to add and substitute their own observations".&lt;ref&gt;Boas, 1962. pp49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of early science and medicine Paula Findlen, writing in the ''Cambridge History of Science'', calls ''De Materia Medica'' "one of the most successful and enduring herbals of antiquity, [which] emphasized the importance of understanding the natural world in light of its medicinal efficiency", in contrast to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (which emphasized the wonders of nature) or the [[natural history]] studies of [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]] (which emphasized the causes of natural phenomena).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kvjAp92zcY | work=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Findlen, Paula; edited by Roy Porter, Katharine Park and Lorraine Daston | year=2006 | page=438 | title=Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of medicine [[Vivian Nutton]], in ''Ancient Medicine'', writes that Dioscorides's "five books in Greek On Materia medica attained canonical status in Late Antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;Nutton, p174&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of science Brian Ogilvie calls Dioscorides "the greatest ancient herbalist", and ''De Materia Medica'' "the ''summa'' of ancient descriptive botany", observing that its success was such that few other books in his domain have survived from classical times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8FmrXT1jdIC | title=The Science of Describing: Natural History in Renaissance Europe | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Ogilvie, Brian W | year=2008 | page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, his approach matched the Renaissance liking for detailed description, unlike the philosophical search for essential nature (as in Theophrastus's ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]''). A critical moment was the decision by [[Niccolò Leoniceno]] and others to use Dioscorides "as the model of the careful naturalist—and his book ''De Materia Medica'' as the model for natural history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8FmrXT1jdIC | title=The Science of Describing: Natural History in Renaissance Europe | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Ogilvie, Brian W | year=2008 | pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dioscorides De Materia Medica Byzantium 15th century.jpg| thumb | [[Byzantine]] ''De Materia Medica'', 15th century]]

The Dioscorides translator and editor Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that "For almost two millennia Dioscorides was regarded as the ultimate authority on plants and medicine",&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxi&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. Introduction, pages xxi–xxii&lt;/ref&gt; and that he "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully."&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxi/&gt; To illustrate this, she states that "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including [[aconitum|aconite]], [[aloes]], [[bitter apple]], [[colchicum]], [[henbane]], and [[squill]]".&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxv&gt;Osbaldeston, 2000. Introduction, pages xxv–xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to [[aspirin]], she writes), [[Colchicum autumnale|autumn crocus]] and [[opium]], which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and [[emollients]]&amp;nbsp;... [such as] [[ammoniacum]], [[anise]], [[cardamom]]s, [[catechu]], [[cinnamon]], [[colocynth]], [[coriander]], [[crocus]], [[dill]], [[fennel]], [[galbanum]], [[gentian]], [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]], [[hyoscyamus]], [[lavender]], [[linseed]], mastic, [[male fern]], [[marjoram]], [[marshmallow]], [[mezereon]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[myrrh]], [[orris root|orris]] (iris), [[oak gall]]s, [[olive oil]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[peppermint]], [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]], [[psyllium]], [[rhubarb]], [[rosemary]], [[rue]], [[saffron]], [[sesame]], squirting cucumber ([[elaterium]]), [[starch]], stavesacre ([[delphinium]]), [[storax]], [[stramonium]], [[sugar]], [[terebinth]], [[thyme]], [[Veratrum album|white hellebore]], [[white horehound]], and [[couch grass]] — the last still used as a [[demulcent]] [[diuretic]]."&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/&gt; She notes that medicines such as [[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]], [[juniper]], [[ginger]], and [[calamine]] also remain in use, while "[[Chinese medicine|Chinese]] and [[Ayurveda|Indian physicians]] continue to use [[liquorice]]".&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/&gt; She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the [[spleen]] may be explained by the frequency of [[malaria]] in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause [[abortion]] and to treat [[urinary tract infection]]; [[palliative]]s for [[toothache]], such as [[colocynth]], and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases.&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/&gt; As well as these useful substances, she observes that "A few [[Superstition|superstitious practices]] are recorded in ''De Materia Medica'',"&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/&gt; such as using ''[[Echium]]'' as an [[amulet]] to ward off snakes, or ''Polemonia'' ([[Jacob's ladder]]) for [[scorpion]] stings.&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/&gt;

In the view of the historian Paula De Vos, ''De Materia Medica'' formed the core of the European pharmacopoeia until the end of the 19th century, suggesting that "the timelessness of Dioscorides' work resulted from an [[empiricism|empirical tradition]] based on trial and error; that it worked for generation after generation despite social and cultural changes and changes in medical theory".&lt;ref name="Vos 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author=De Vos, Paula | year=2010 | title=European Materia Medica in Historical Texts: Longevity of a Tradition and Implications for Future Use | journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume=132 | issue=1 | pages=28–47 | doi=10.1016/j.jep.2010.05.035 | pmid=20561577 | pmc=2956839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Mount Athos]] in northern Greece Dioscorides's text was still in use in its original Greek into the 20th century, as observed in 1934 by [[Arthur William Hill|Sir Arthur Hill]], Director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]: {{quote|"At [[Karyes, Mount Athos|Karyes]] there is an official Botanist Monk ... he was a remarkable old Monk with an extensive knowledge of plants and their properties. Though fully gowned in a long black cassock he traveled very quickly, usually on foot, and sometimes on a mule, carrying his 'Flora' with him in a large, black, bulky bag. Such a bag was necessary since his 'Flora' was nothing less than four manuscript folio volumes of Dioscorides, which apparently he himself had copied out. This Flora he invariably used for determining any plant which he could not name at sight, and he could find his way in his books and identify his plants – to his own satisfaction – with remarkable rapidity."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Hill, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4107714 "Preface"] in Turrill, William Bertram. "A contribution to the botany of Athos Peninsula." Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew) 1937.4 (1937): 197.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Electricity==
{{Main|Electricity sector in Denmark}}
The electricity sector relies on fossil, nuclear and renewable energy: wind power, biogas, biomass and waste. No hydro power is produced domestically and other countries' hydro and thermal power is used for buffering Denmark's renewable generation. The average consumption of electricity per person was 0.8 GWh less than EU 15 average in 2008. Denmark invested in the wind power development in the 1970s and has been the top wind power&lt;!--by share--&gt; country of the world ever since. Danish consumption of wind electricity has been highest in the world per person: 1,218 kWh in 2009. Denmark produced more wind power per person in 2009 than Spain or the UK produced nuclear power.

Denmark has mediocre electricity [[cost]]s (including about DKK 5 billion in [[Public service obligation|costs for cleaner energy]])&lt;ref name=psofut/&gt; in EU for industries at 9 [[1 cent euro coin|eurocent]]/kWh,&lt;ref name=esIndu&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_price_statistics#Electricity_prices_for_industrial_consumers Electricity prices for industrial consumers] ''[[Eurostat]]'', October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/ad/Halfyearly_electricity_prices_%28EUR_kWh%29.png Electricity prices (table)] ''[[Eurostat]]'', October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ens.dk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.dk/|title=Energistyrelsen|publisher= ''[[Danish Energy Agency]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/notat_elprismetode_30062015_web.pdf Forbedring af den nationale elprisstatistik for erhverv] page 7.

To encourage investment in [[wind power]], families were offered a [[tax exemption]] for generating their own electricity within their own or an adjoining commune. While this could involve purchasing a turbine outright, more often families purchased shares in [[wind turbine]] cooperatives which in turn invested in community wind turbines. By 2004 over 150,000 Danes were either members of cooperatives or owned turbines, and about 5,500 turbines had been installed, although with greater private sector involvement the proportion owned by cooperatives had fallen to 75%.

{{lake stratification topics}}
The '''epilimnion''' or '''surface layer''' is the top-most layer in a thermally [[Lake stratification|stratified]] [[lake]], occurring above the deeper [[hypolimnion]]. It is warmer and typically has a higher [[pH]] and higher [[dissolved oxygen]] concentration than the hypolimnion.

Being exposed at the surface, it typically becomes turbulently mixed as a result of surface wind-mixing. It is also free to exchange dissolved gases such as [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] with the atmosphere. Because this layer receives the most sunlight it contains the most [[phytoplankton]]. As they grow and reproduce they absorb nutrients from the water, when they die they sink into the hypolimnion resulting in the epilimnion becoming depleted of nutrients.

The '''evolution of the horse''', a [[mammal]] of the family [[Equidae]], occurred over a [[geologic time scale]] of 50 million years, transforming the small, dog-sized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Legendre|first=Serge|title=Les communautés de mammifères du Paléogène (Eocène supérieur et Oligocène) d'Europe occidentale : structures, milieux et évolution|year=1989|publisher=F.

[[Paleozoology|Paleozoologists]] have been able to piece together a more complete [[phylogenetics|outline]] of the evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineage]] of the modern horse than of any other animal. Much of this evolution took place in North America, where horses originated but became extinct about 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Singer | first = Ben | title = A brief history of the horse in America | publisher = Canadian Geographic Magazine | date = May 2005 | url =http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/ma05/indepth/#cnd | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120107031152/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/ma05/indepth/|archive-date= 2012-01-07|dead-url = yes|accessdate =22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The horse belongs to the [[order (biology)|order]] Perissodactyla ([[odd-toed ungulate]]s), the members of which all share [[hoof|hooved]] feet and an odd number of toes on each foot, as well as mobile [[upper lip]]s and a similar [[tooth]] structure. This means that horses share a [[common ancestry]] with [[tapir]]s and [[rhinoceros]]es. The perissodactyls arose in the late [[Paleocene]], less than 10 million years after the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. This group of animals appears to have been originally specialized for life in [[tropical forest]]s, but whereas tapirs and, to some extent, rhinoceroses, retained their jungle specializations, modern horses are adapted to life on drier land, in the much harsher climatic conditions of the [[steppe]]s. Other species of [[Equus (genus)|''Equus'']] are adapted to a variety of intermediate conditions.

The early ancestors of the modern horse walked on several spread-out toes, an accommodation to life spent walking on the soft, moist grounds of primeval forests. As [[grass]] species began to appear and flourish,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} the [[equid]]s' diets shifted from foliage to grasses, leading to larger and more durable teeth. At the same time, as the steppes began to appear, the horse's predecessors needed to be capable of greater speeds to outrun predators. This was attained through the lengthening of limbs and the lifting of some toes from the ground in such a way that the weight of the body was gradually placed on one of the longest toes, the third.

[[File:Extinct horses.jpg|thumb|Extinct equids restored to scale. Left to right: ''[[Mesohippus]]'', ''[[Neohipparion]]'', ''[[Eohippus]]'', ''[[Equus scotti]]'' and ''[[Hypohippus]]''.]]

[[Wild horse]]s were known since prehistory from central Asia to Europe, with [[domestic horse]]s and other equids being distributed more widely in the Old World, but no horses or equids of any type were found in the [[New World]] when European explorers reached the Americas. When the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonists]] brought domestic horses from Europe, beginning in 1493, [[mustang|escaped horses]] quickly established large feral herds. In the 1760s, the early naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] suggested this was an indication of inferiority of the New World fauna, but later reconsidered this idea.&lt;ref name=Leidy&gt;{{cite web

The first Old World equid fossil was found in the [[gypsum]] quarries in [[Montmartre]], [[Paris]], in the 1820s. The tooth was sent to the [[Paris Conservatory]], where it was identified by [[Georges Cuvier]], who identified it as a browsing equine related to the [[tapir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Horse breeding and management |author=James Warren Evans |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sketch of the entire animal matched later skeletons found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knell |first=Simon J. |author2=Suzanne Macleod |author3=Sheila E.

During the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey expedition]], the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] had remarkable success with fossil hunting in [[Patagonia]]. On 10 October 1833, at [[Santa Fe, Argentina]], he was "filled with astonishment" when he found a horse's tooth in the same [[stratum]] as fossil giant [[armadillo]]s, and wondered if it might have been washed down from a later layer, but concluded this was "not very probable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.13.html 'Filled with astonishment': an introduction to the St. Fe Notebook],&lt;br&gt;Barlow, Nora (ed. 1945) ''Charles Darwin and the voyage of the Beagle''. London: Pilot Press, p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1571&amp;pageseq=230 210]&lt;/ref&gt; After the expedition returned in 1836, the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] confirmed the tooth was from an extinct species, which he subsequently named ''[[Equus curvidens]]'', and remarked, "This evidence of the former existence of a genus, which, as regards South America, had become extinct, and has a second time been introduced into that Continent, is not one of the least interesting fruits of Mr. Darwin's palæontological discoveries."&lt;ref name="Jeff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C.

[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F8.13&amp;pageseq=29 p. 108–109]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, a study ''On the fossil horses of America'' by [[Joseph Leidy]] systematically examined [[Pleistocene]] horse fossils from various collections, including that of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]], and concluded at least two ancient horse species had existed in North America: ''Equus curvidens'' and another, which he named ''Equus americanus''. A decade later, however, he found the latter name had already been taken and renamed it ''[[Equus complicatus]]''.&lt;ref name="Leidy"/&gt; In the same year, he visited Europe and was introduced by Owen to Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/other/darwin.php Academy of Natural Sciences - Joseph Leidy - Leidy and Darwin]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eurohippus parvulus.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration of ''[[Eurohippus parvulus]]'', a mid- to late Eocene equid of Europe ([[Museum für Naturkunde]], Berlin)]]
The original sequence of species believed to have evolved into the horse was based on fossils discovered in North America in the 1870s by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. The sequence, from ''Eohippus'' to the modern horse (''Equus''), was popularized by [[Thomas Huxley]] and became one of the most widely known examples of a clear evolutionary progression. The horse's evolutionary lineage became a common feature of biology textbooks, and the sequence of [[transitional fossil]]s was assembled by the [[American Museum of Natural History]] into an exhibit that emphasized the gradual, "straight-line" evolution of the horse.

Since then, as the number of equid fossils has increased, the actual evolutionary progression from ''Eohippus'' to ''Equus'' has been discovered to be much more complex and multibranched than was initially supposed. The straight, direct progression from the former to the latter has been replaced by a more elaborate model with numerous branches in different directions, of which the modern horse is only one of many. [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1951&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord (1951): ''Horses''. Oxford University Press; New Impression edition. {{ISBN|0-19-500104-4}} (1971 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; first recognized that the modern horse was not the "goal" of the entire lineage of equids,&lt;ref&gt;The notion of a goal would contradict [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]],&lt;/ref&gt; but is simply the only genus of the many horse lineages to survive.

Detailed fossil information on the distribution and rate of change of new equid species has also revealed that the progression between species was not as smooth and consistent as was once believed. Although some transitions, such as that of ''[[Dinohippus]]'' to ''Equus'', were indeed gradual progressions, a number of others, such as that of ''[[Epihippus]]'' to ''[[Mesohippus]]'', were relatively abrupt in [[geologic time scale|geologic time]], taking place over only a few million years. Both [[anagenesis]] (gradual change in an entire population's gene frequency) and [[cladogenesis]] (a population "splitting" into two distinct evolutionary branches) occurred, and many species coexisted with "ancestor" species at various times. The change in equids' traits was also not always a "straight line" from ''Eohippus'' to ''Equus'': some traits reversed themselves at various points in the evolution of new equid species, such as size and the presence of facial ''[[Fossa (anatomy)|fossa]]e'', and only in retrospect can certain evolutionary trends be recognized.&lt;ref name=Hunt1995&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1995 |author=Hunt, Kathleen |title=Horse Evolution |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/horses/horse_evol.html |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate= 2018-01-26}} See also [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726122833/http://www.godslasteraar.org/assets/ebooks/Hunt_Kathleen_Horse_Evolution.pdf downloadable pdf version]}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before odd-toed ungulates==

===Phenacodontidae===
[[File:Phenacodus.jpg|thumb|right|Restoration of ''[[Phenacodus]]'']]
[[Phenacodontidae]] is the [[Most recent common ancestor|most recent family]] in the order [[Condylarthra]] believed to be the ancestral to the [[odd-toed ungulates]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It contains the genera ''[[Almogaver]]'', ''[[Copecion]]'', ''[[Ectocion]]'', ''[[Eodesmatodon]]'', ''[[Meniscotherium]]'', ''[[Ordathspidotherium]]'', ''[[Phenacodus]]'' and ''[[Pleuraspidotherium]]''. The family lived from the [[Early Paleocene]] to the [[Middle Eocene]] in Europe and were about the size of a [[sheep]], with [[tail]]s making slightly less than half of the length of their bodies and unlike their ancestors, good running skills for eluding predators.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Eocene and Oligocene: early equids==

===''Eohippus''===
{{main|Eohippus}}
''Eohippus'' appeared in the [[Ypresian]] (early [[Eocene]]), about 52 [[mya (unit)|mya]] (million years ago). It was an animal approximately the size of a fox (250&amp;ndash;450&amp;nbsp;mm in height), with a relatively short head and neck and a springy, arched back. It had 44 low-crowned teeth, in the typical arrangement of an omnivorous, browsing mammal: three incisors, one canine, four [[premolar]]s, and three molars on each side of the jaw. Its molars were uneven, dull, and bumpy, and used primarily for grinding foliage. The cusps of the molars were slightly connected in low crests. ''Eohippus'' browsed on soft foliage and fruit, probably scampering between thickets in the mode of a modern [[muntjac]]. It had a small brain, and possessed especially small [[frontal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name=Hunt1995/&gt;

[[File:Hyracotherium.jpg|thumb|350px|''Eohippus'', with left forefoot (third [[metacarpus|metacarpal]] colored) and tooth (a [[tooth enamel|enamel]]; b [[dentin]]; c [[cementum|cement]]) detailed]]

Its limbs were long relative to its body, already showing the beginnings of adaptations for running. However, all of the major leg bones were unfused, leaving the legs flexible and rotatable. Its wrist and hock joints were low to the ground. The forelimbs had developed five toes, of which four were equipped with small proto-hooves; the large fifth "toe-thumb" was off the ground. The hind limbs had small hooves on three out of the five toes, while the [[vestigial structure|vestigial]] first and fifth toes did not touch the ground. Its feet were padded, much like a dog's, but with the small hooves in place of claws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = MacFadden | first1 = B. J. | title = Fossil Horses--Evidence for Evolution | doi = 10.1126/science.1105458 | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5716 | pages = 1728–1730 | date = March 18, 2005 | pmid = 15774746 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a span of about 20 million years, ''Eohippus'' thrived with few significant evolutionary changes.&lt;ref name=Hunt1995/&gt; The most significant change was in the teeth, which began to adapt to its changing diet, as these early [[Equidae]] shifted from a mixed diet of fruits and foliage to one focused increasingly on browsing foods. During the Eocene, an ''Eohippus'' species (most likely ''Eohippus angustidens'') branched out into various new types of Equidae. Thousands of complete, fossilized skeletons of these animals have been found in the Eocene layers of North American strata, mainly in the [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind River]] basin in [[Wyoming]]. Similar fossils have also been discovered in Europe, such as ''[[Propalaeotherium]]'' (which is not considered ancestral to the modern horse).&lt;ref name="macfadden"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2412774 | last1 = MacFadden | first1 = B. J. | year = 1976 | title = Cladistic analysis of primitive equids with notes on other perissodactyls| journal = Syst. Zool. | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 | jstor = 2412774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Orohippus''===
Approximately 50 million years ago, in the early-to-middle [[Eocene]], ''Eohippus'' smoothly transitioned into ''[[Orohippus]]'' through a gradual series of changes.&lt;ref name="macfadden"/&gt; Although its name means "mountain horse", ''Orohippus'' was not a true horse and did not live in the mountains. It resembled ''Eohippus'' in size, but had a slimmer body, an elongated head, slimmer forelimbs, and longer hind legs, all of which are characteristics of a good jumper. Although ''Orohippus'' was still pad-footed, the vestigial outer toes of ''Eohippus'' were not present in ''Orohippus''; there were four toes on each fore leg, and three on each hind leg.

The most dramatic change between ''Eohippus'' and ''Orohippus'' was in the teeth: the first of the premolar teeth were dwarfed, the last premolar shifted in shape and function into a molar, and the crests on the teeth became more pronounced. Both of these factors gave the teeth of ''Orohippus'' greater grinding ability, suggesting ''Orohippus'' ate tougher plant material.

===''Epihippus''===
In the mid-Eocene, about 47 million years ago, ''[[Epihippus]]'', a genus which continued the evolutionary trend of increasingly efficient grinding teeth, evolved from ''Orohippus''. ''Epihippus'' had five grinding, low-crowned cheek teeth with well-formed crests. A late species of ''Epihippus'', sometimes referred to as ''[[Duchesnehippus|Duchesnehippus intermedius]]'', had teeth similar to [[Oligocene]] equids, although slightly less developed. Whether ''Duchesnehippus'' was a subgenus of ''Epihippus'' or a distinct genus is disputed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} ''Epihippus'' was only 2 feet tall.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===''Mesohippus''===
In the late Eocene and the early stages of the [[Oligocene]] epoch (32&amp;ndash;24 mya), the climate of North America became drier, and the earliest [[grass]]es began to evolve. The forests were yielding to flatlands,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- mangled vegetation type and landform --&gt; home to grasses and various kinds of brush. In a few areas, these plains were covered in [[sand]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} creating the type of environment resembling the present-day [[prairie]]s.[[File:Mesohippus.jpg|thumb|right|Restoration of [[Mesohippus]]]]
In response to the changing environment, the then-living species of Equidae also began to change. In the late Eocene, they began developing tougher teeth and becoming slightly larger and leggier, allowing for faster running speeds in open areas, and thus for evading predators in nonwooded areas{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. About 40 mya, ''[[Mesohippus]]'' ("middle horse") suddenly developed in response to strong new [[Selection (biology)|selective]] pressures to adapt, beginning with the species ''Mesohippus celer'' and soon followed by ''Mesohippus westoni''.

In the early Oligocene, ''Mesohippus'' was one of the more widespread mammals in North America. It walked on three toes on each of its front and hind feet (the first and fifth toes remained, but were small and not used in walking). The third toe was stronger than the outer ones, and thus more weighted; the fourth front toe was diminished to a vestigial nub. Judging by its longer and slimmer limbs, ''Mesohippus'' was an agile animal.

''Mesohippus'' was slightly larger than ''Epihippus'', about 610&amp;nbsp;mm (24&amp;nbsp;in) at the shoulder. Its back was less arched, and its face, snout, and neck were somewhat longer. It had significantly larger [[cerebral hemisphere]]s, and had a small, shallow depression on its skull called a [[fossa (anatomy)|fossa]], which in modern horses is quite detailed. The fossa serves as a useful marker for identifying an equine fossil's species. ''Mesohippus'' had six grinding "cheek teeth", with a single premolar in front&amp;mdash;a trait all descendant Equidae would retain. ''Mesohippus'' also had the sharp tooth crests of ''Epihippus'', improving its ability to grind down tough vegetation.

===''Miohippus''===
Around 36 million years ago, soon after the development of ''Mesohippus'', ''[[Miohippus]]'' ("lesser horse") emerged, the earliest species being ''Miohippus assiniboiensis''. As with ''Mesohippus'', the appearance of ''Miohippus'' was relatively abrupt, though a few transitional fossils linking the two genera have been found. ''Mesohippus'' was once believed to have [[anagenesis|anagenetically]] evolved into ''Miohippus'' by a gradual series of progressions, but new evidence has shown its evolution was [[cladogenesis|cladogenetic]]: a ''Miohippus'' population split off from the main genus ''Mesohippus'', coexisted with ''Mesohippus'' for around four million years, and then over time came to replace ''Mesohippus''.&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, D. R. and Shubin, N. (1989). "The evolution of Oligocene horses". ''The Evolution of Perissodactyls'' (pp. 142&amp;ndash;175). New York: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Miohippus'' was significantly larger than its predecessors, and its ankle joints had subtly changed. Its facial fossa was larger and deeper, and it also began to show a variable extra crest in its upper cheek teeth, a trait that became a characteristic feature of equine teeth.

''Miohippus'' ushered in a major new period of diversification in Equidae.&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt;[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/ ''Fossil Horses In Cyberspace'']. [[Florida Museum of Natural History]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miocene and Pliocene: true equines==

===''Kalobatippus''===
[[File:Megahippus mckennai.jpg|thumb|Fossil ''[[Megahippus|Megahippus mckennai]]'']]
The forest-suited form was ''Kalobatippus'' (or ''Miohippus intermedius'', depending on whether it was a new genus or species), whose second and fourth front toes were long, well-suited travel on the soft forest floors. ''Kalobatippus'' probably gave rise to ''[[Anchitherium]]'', which travelled to Asia via the [[Bering Strait]] [[land bridge]], and from there to Europe.&lt;ref name=MacFadden01&gt;{{cite journal | author = MacFadden, B.

===''Parahippus''===
The ''Miohippus'' population that remained on the steppes is believed to be ancestral to ''[[Parahippus]]'', a North American animal about the size of a small [[pony]], with a prolonged skull and a facial structure resembling the horses of today. Its third toe was stronger and larger, and carried the main weight of the body. Its four premolars resembled the molar teeth; the first were small and almost nonexistent. The incisor teeth, like those of its predecessors, had a crown (like human incisors); however, the top incisors had a trace of a shallow crease marking the beginning of the core/cup.

===''Merychippus''===
[[File:Merychippus.png|thumb|left|300px|''[[Merychippus]]'', an effective grazer and runner]]

In the middle of the Miocene epoch, the grazer ''[[Merychippus]]'' flourished. It had wider molars than its predecessors, which are believed to have been used for crunching the hard grasses of the steppes. The hind legs, which were relatively short, had side toes equipped with small hooves, but they probably only touched the ground when running.&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt; ''Merychippus'' radiated into at least 19 additional grassland species.

===''Hipparion''===
[[File:Protohippus simus.jpg|thumb|''Protohippus simus'']]
Three lineages within Equidae are believed to be descended from the numerous varieties of ''Merychippus'': ''[[Hipparion]]'', ''[[Protohippus]]'' and ''[[Pliohippus]]''. The most different from ''Merychippus'' was ''Hipparion'', mainly in the structure of [[tooth enamel]]: in comparison with other Equidae, the inside, or [[tongue]] side, had a completely isolated [[parapet]]. A complete and well-preserved skeleton of the North American ''Hipparion'' shows an animal the size of a small pony. They were very slim, rather like [[antelope]]s, and were adapted to life on dry prairies. On its slim legs, ''Hipparion'' had three toes equipped with small hooves, but the side toes did not touch the ground.

In North America, ''Hipparion'' and its relatives (''[[Cormohipparion]]'', ''[[Nannippus]]'', ''[[Neohipparion]]'', and ''[[Pseudhipparion]]''), proliferated into many kinds of [[Equidae|equid]]s, at least one of which managed to migrate to Asia and Europe during the Miocene epoch.&lt;ref name=MacFadden84&gt;{{cite journal | author = MacFadden, B.

===''Pliohippus''===
[[File:Pliohippus Pernix.jpg|thumb|''Pliohippus pernix'']]
''[[Pliohippus]]'' arose from ''Callippus'' in the middle Miocene, around 12 mya. It was very similar in appearance to ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', though it had two long extra toes on both sides of the hoof, externally barely visible as callused stubs. The long and slim limbs of ''Pliohippus'' reveal a quick-footed steppe animal.

Until recently, ''Pliohippus'' was believed to be the ancestor of present-day horses because of its many anatomical similarities. However, though ''Pliohippus'' was clearly a close relative of ''Equus'', its skull had deep facial fossae, whereas ''Equus'' had no fossae at all. Additionally, its teeth were strongly curved, unlike the very straight teeth of modern horses. Consequently, it is unlikely to be the ancestor of the modern horse; instead, it is a likely candidate for the ancestor of ''[[Astrohippus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacFadden | first1 = B.

===''Dinohippus''===
''[[Dinohippus]]'' was the most common species of Equidae in North America during the late [[Pliocene]]. It was originally thought to be monodactyl, but a 1981 fossil find in Nebraska shows some were tridactyl.

===''Plesippus''===
[[File:Equus simplicidens mounted 02.jpg|thumb|right|Mounted skeleton of [[Hagerman horse]] (''Equus simplicidens'')]]
''[[Plesippus]]'' is often considered an intermediate stage between ''Dinohippus'' and the extant genus, ''Equus''.

The [[Hagerman horse|famous fossils]] found near Hagerman, Idaho were originally thought to be a part of the genus ''Plesippus''. [[Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument|Hagerman Fossil Beds]] (Idaho) is a Pliocene site, dating to about 3.5 mya. The fossilized remains were originally called ''Plesippus shoshonensis'', but further study by paleontologists determined the fossils represented the oldest remains of the genus ''Equus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/hafo/crittercorner/equus.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103193555/http://www.nps.gov/archive/hafo/crittercorner/equus.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2007 | title= Hagerman "Horse" - ''Equus simplicidens'' |last= McDonald |first= G. |work=The Fossil Record |date=March 1993|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their estimated average weight was 425&amp;nbsp;kg, roughly the size of an [[Arabian horse]].

At the end of the Pliocene, the climate in North America began to cool significantly and most of the animals were forced to move south. One population of ''Plesippus'' moved across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] into Eurasia around 2.5 mya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jens Lorenz Franzen |title=Die Urpferde der Morgenröte |publisher=Elsevier, Spektrum Akademischer Verlag |location=München |year=2007 |isbn=3-8274-1680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Equus''===
{{main|Equus (genus)}}
[[File:Equus eisenmannae.JPG|thumb|Skull of a giant extinct horse, ''Equus eisenmannae'']]
The genus ''Equus'', which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from ''[[Dinohippus]]'', via the intermediate form ''[[Plesippus]]''. One of the oldest species is ''[[Hagerman Horse|Equus simplicidens]]'', described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged ''[[Equus livenzovensis]]'' documented from western Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name = "Azzaroli1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azzaroli |first=A. |year=1992 |title=Ascent and decline of monodactyl equids: a case for prehistoric overkill |journal=Ann.

Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus ''Equus'') lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recalibrating ''Equus evolution'' using the genome sequence of an early Middle Pleistocene horse |last1=Orlando|first1= L.|last2=Ginolhac|first2= A.|last3=Zhang|first3= G.|last4=Froese|first4= D.|last5=Albrechtsen|first5= A.|last6=Stiller|first6= M.|last7=Schubert|first7= M.|last8=Cappellini|first8= E.|last9=Petersen|first9= B.|journal=Nature|date=4 July 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature12323 |pmid=23803765 |volume=499 |issue=7456 |pages=74–8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus ''E. ([[Asinus]])'', including the [[Turkmenian kulan|kulan]], [[onager]], and [[kiang]]), followed by the African zebras (subgenera ''E. ([[Dolichohippus]])'', and ''E. ([[Hippotigris]])''). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] forms) belong to the subgenus ''E.

Remains attributed to a variety of species and lumped as [[New World stilt-legged horse]]s (including [[Haringtonhippus|''H. francisci'']], ''E. tau'', ''E. quinni'' and potentially North American Pleistocene fossils previously attributed to ''E. cf. hemiones'', and ''E. (Asinus)'' cf. ''kiang'') probably all belong to a second species [[endemic]] to North America, which despite a superficial resemblance to species in the subgenus ''E. (Asinus)'' (and hence occasionally referred to as North American ass) is closely related to ''E. ferus''.&lt;ref name = "WeinstockMolecularPerspective"/&gt; Surprisingly, the third species, endemic to South America and traditionally referred to as ''[[Hippidion]]'', originally believed to be descended from [[Evolution of the horse#Pliohippus|''Pliohippus'']], was shown to be a third species in the genus ''Equus'', closely related to the New World stilt-legged horse.&lt;ref name = "WeinstockMolecularPerspective"/&gt; The temporal and regional variation in body size and morphological features within each lineage indicates extraordinary [[intraspecific]] plasticity. Such environment-driven adaptative changes would explain why the taxonomic diversity of Pleistocene equids has been overestimated on morphoanatomical grounds.&lt;ref name = "AncientDNA"/&gt;

According to these results, it appears the genus ''Equus'' evolved from a ''Dinohippus''-like ancestor ~4–7 mya. It rapidly spread into the Old World and there diversified into the various species of asses and zebras. A North American lineage of the subgenus ''E. (Equus)'' evolved into the New World stilt-legged horse (NWSLH). Subsequently, populations of this species entered South America as part of the [[Great American Interchange]] shortly after the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], and evolved into the form currently referred to as ''Hippidion'' ~2.5 million years ago. ''Hippidion'' is thus only distantly related to the morphologically similar ''[[Pliohippus]]'', which presumably became extinct during the [[Miocene]]. Both the NWSLH and ''Hippidium'' show adaptations to dry, barren ground, whereas the shortened legs of ''Hippidion'' may have been a response to sloped terrain.&lt;ref name = "AncientDNA"/&gt; In contrast, the geographic origin of the closely related modern ''E. ferus'' is not resolved. However, genetic results on [[extant taxon|extant]] and fossil material of Pleistocene age indicate two clades, potentially subspecies, one of which had a [[holarctic]] distribution spanning from Europe through Asia and across North America and would become the founding stock of the modern domesticated horse.&lt;ref name = "VilaWidespreadOrigins"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vila |first=C. |year=2001 |title=Widespread Origins of Domestic Horse Lineages|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=291 |issue= 5503|pages=474–7 |doi=10.1126/science.291.5503.474 |url=http://www.uky.edu/Ag/Horsemap/Maps/VILA.PDF |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-19 |quote= |pmid=11161199|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "JansenMtDNA"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jansen |first=T. |date=July 2002 |title=Mitochondrial DNA and the origins of the domestic horse|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=99 |issue=16 |pages=10905–10910 |doi=10.1073/pnas.152330099 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/16/10905.full |accessdate=2008-12-19 |quote= |pmid=12130666 |pmc=125071 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other population appears to have been restricted to North America. However, one or more North American populations of ''E. ferus'' entered South America ~1.0–1.5 million years ago, leading to the forms currently known as ''E.

===Genome sequencing===

In June 2013, a group of researchers announced that they had sequenced the [[DNA]] of a 560–780 thousand year old horse, using material extracted from a leg bone found buried in [[permafrost]] in Canada's [[Yukon]] territory.&lt;ref name = "Hayden_2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/first-horses-arose-4-million-years-ago-1.13261 |title=First horses arose 4 million years ago |author=Erika Check Hayden |publisher=Nature |date=26 June 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this publication, the oldest nuclear genome that had been successfully sequenced was dated at 110–130 thousand years ago. For comparison, the researchers also [[Whole genome sequencing|sequenced]] the genomes of a 43,000-year-old [[Pleistocene]] horse, a [[Przewalski's horse]], five modern horse breeds, and a donkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130626-ancient-dna-oldest-sequenced-horse-paleontology-science/ |title=World's Oldest Genome Sequenced From 700,000-Year-Old Horse DNA|author=Jane J Lee|publisher=National Geographic|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of differences between these [[genome]]s indicated that the [[last common ancestor]] of modern horses, donkeys, and zebras existed 4 to 4.5 million years ago.&lt;ref name = "Hayden_2013"/&gt; The results also indicated that Przewalski's horse diverged from other modern types of horse about 43,000 years ago, and had never in its evolutionary history been domesticated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, all Equidae in North America ultimately became extinct. The causes of this extinction (simultaneous with the extinctions of a variety of other American [[megafauna]]) have been a matter of debate. Given the suddenness of the event and because these mammals had been flourishing for millions of years previously, something quite unusual must have happened. The first main hypothesis attributes extinction to [[climate change]]. For example, in [[Alaska]], beginning approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a [[steppe]] ecosystem gave way to shrub [[tundra]], which was covered with unpalatable plants.&lt;ref name="LeQuire"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4849 |author=LeQuire, Elise| title=No Grass, No Horse |publisher = The Horse, online edition| date= 2004-01-04 |accessdate= 2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guthrie"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Return to the Americas===
Horses only returned to the Americas with [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493. These were [[Iberian horse]]s first brought to [[Hispaniola]] and later to [[Panama]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], [[Argentina]], and, in 1538, [[Florida]].&lt;ref name = IberianOrigins&gt;{{cite journal

Subsequent explorers, such as [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado|Coronado]] and [[Hernando de Soto|De Soto]], brought ever-larger numbers, some from Spain and others from breeding establishments set up by the Spanish in the Caribbean. Later, as Spanish missions were founded on the mainland, horses would eventually be lost or stolen, and proliferated into large herds of [[feral horse]]s that became known as [[mustang (horse)|mustang]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] did not have a specific word for horses, and came to refer to them in various languages as a type of dog or deer (in one case, "elk-dog", in other cases "big dog" or "seven dogs", referring to the weight each animal could pull). {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Details==

===Toes===
{{See also|Limbs of the horse}}
The ancestors of the horse came to walk only on the end of the third toe and both side toes. Skeletal remnants show obvious wear on the back of both sides of [[metacarpal]] and [[metatarsal]] bones, commonly called the "splint bones". They are the remnants of the second and the fourth toe. Modern horses retain the splint bones; they are often believed to be useless attachments, but they in fact play an important role in supporting the carpal joints (front knees) and even the tarsal joints (hocks).{{Citation needed|date = October 2012}}

===Teeth===
{{Further|Horse teeth}}
Throughout the phylogenetic development, the teeth of the horse underwent significant changes. The type of the original [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] teeth with short, "bumpy" molars, with which the prime members of the evolutionary line distinguished themselves, gradually changed into the teeth common to [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] mammals. They became long (as much as 100&amp;nbsp;mm), roughly cubical molars equipped with flat grinding surfaces. In conjunction with the teeth, during the horse's evolution, the elongation of the facial part of the skull is apparent, and can also be observed in the backward-set eyeholes. In addition, the relatively short neck of the equine ancestors became longer, with equal elongation of the legs. Finally, the size of the body grew as well.{{Citation needed|date = October 2012}}

'''Ferdinand Friedrich Georg Ludwig Freiherr&lt;ref&gt;{{German title Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Wrangel''' ({{lang-ru|Фердина́нд Петро́вич Вра́нгель}}, ''Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel''; {{OldStyleDateDY|9 January|1797|29 December 1796}} – {{OldStyleDate|6 June|1870|25 May}}) was a [[Baltic German]] explorer and seaman in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], Honorable Member of the [[Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences]], a founder of the [[Russian Geographic Society]]. He is best known as chief manager of the [[Russian-American Company]], in fact governor of the Russian settlements in present-day [[Alaska]].

In English texts, ''Wrangel'' is sometimes spelled ''Vrangel'', a [[Romanization of Russian|transliteration from Russian]], which more closely represents its pronunciation in [[German language|German]], or ''Wrangell''.

==Biography==
Wrangel was born in [[Pskov]],&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Wrangell, Ferdinand Petrovitch, Baron von|year=1889|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the noble [[Baltic nobility|Baltic German]] [[Wrangel (family)|Wrangel]] family. He graduated from the [[Sea Cadet Corps (Russia)|Naval Cadets College]] in 1815. He took part in [[Vasily Golovnin]]'s [[world cruise]] on the ship ''Kamchatka'' in 1817–1819.

=== Kolymskaya expedition===
He was appointed in 1820 to command the Kolymskaya expedition to explore the Russian polar seas. Sailing from [[St. Petersburg]], he arrived at [[Nizhnekolymsk]] on 2 November 1820, and early in 1821 journeyed to Cape Shelagskiy on sledges drawn by dogs. He sailed afterward up [[Kolyma River]], advancing about 125 miles into the interior, through territory inhabited by the [[Yakuts]]. On 10 March 1822, he resumed his journey northward, and traveled 46 days on the ice, reaching 72° 2' north latitude. He left Nizhnekolymsk on 1 November 1823, and returned to St. Petersburg on 15 August 1824.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

He established that north of the [[Kolyma River]] and Cape Shelagsky there was an open sea, not dry land, as people thought. Together with [[Fyodor Matyushkin]] and P. Kuzmin, Wrangel described the [[Siberia]]n coastline from the [[Indigirka River]] to the [[Kolyuchinskaya Bay]] in the [[Chukchi Sea]]. (See [[Northeast Passage]].) His expedition made a valuable research in [[glaciology]], [[geomagnetic]]s, and [[climatology]] and also collected data about natural resources and native population of that remote area.

===''Krotky'' world voyage===
Having been promoted to commander, Wrangel led the Russian world voyage on the ship ''Krotky'' in 1825–1827.

===Governor of Russian Alaska===
He was appointed chief manager of the [[Russian-American Company]] in 1829, effectively governor of its settlements in [[North America]] (present day [[Alaska]]).  Wrangel was the first of a series of bachelor appointees to the office of governor who had to find a wife before assuming the duties in America, the Russian American Company rules having been changed in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Alix O'Grady: ''From the Baltic to Russian America 1829–1836,'' p. 21–25. Alaska History no. 51, The Limestone Press, Kingston, Ontario &amp; Fairbanks, Alaska.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his departure for Russia's American colonies, he was married  to Elisabeth Teodora Natalia Karolina de Rossillon, daughter of Baron Wilhelm de Rossillon.

He traveled to his post early in 1829, by way of [[Siberia]] and [[Kamchatka]]. After thoroughly reforming the administration, he introduced the cultivation of the potato, opened and regulated the working of several mines, and urged upon the home government the organization of a fur company. He promoted investment, and sent out missionaries. He began a survey of the country, opened roads, built bridges and government buildings. He made geographical and ethnographical observations, which he embodied in a memoir to the navy department. Recalled in 1834, he returned by way of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and the United States, where he visited several cities.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

===Admiral===
Wrangel was promoted rear admiral in 1837, and made director of the ship-timber department in the navy office, which post he held for twelve years. He became vice-admiral in 1847, but resigned in 1849, and temporarily severed his connection with the navy to assume the presidency of the newly reorganized Russian-American Company.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; Wrangel had been a member of the board of directors of the Russian-American Company from 1840 to 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pierce (historian)|Richard A. Pierce]]: ''Russian America: A Biographical Dictionary'', Alaska History no. 33, Limestone Press, Kingston, Ont. and Fairbanks, Alaska, 1990, p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854 he re-entered active service and was made chief director of the hydrographical department of the navy.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; He was the [[Heads of military of Imperial Russia#Ministry of Sea Forces|Minister of the Navy]] 1855–1857.

===Retirement and death===
Wrangel retired in 1864. He opposed the [[Alaska Purchase|sale of Alaska]] to the United States in 1867. Wrangel wrote the book ''Journey along the northern coastline of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean'' and other books about the peoples of northwestern America.

He lived in his last years in [[Roela]] in the eastern part of [[Governorate of Estonia|Estonia]]. He had bought the manor in 1840. He died in [[Tartu]], [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]].&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

==Writings==
An account of the physical observations during his first journey was published in German (Berlin, 1827), and also in German extracts from Wrangel's journals, ''Reise laengs der Nordküste von Sibirien und auf dem Eismeere in den Jahren 1820-1824'' (2 vols., Berlin, 1839), which was translated into English as ''Wrangell's Expedition to the Polar Sea'' (2 vols., London, 1840). The complete report of the expedition appeared as "Otceschewie do Sjewernym beregam Sibiri, po Ledowitomm More" (2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1841), and was translated into French with notes by Prince Galitzin, under the title ''Voyage sur les côtes septentrionales de la Sibérie et de la mer glaciale'' (2 vols., 1841). From the French version of the complete report an English one was made under the title ''A Journey on the Northern Coast of Siberia and the Icy Sea'' (2 vols., London, 1841).&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; The book influenced [[Charles Darwin]]'s thinking on [[animal navigation]], leading him to propose that humans and animals possess an innate ability for [[dead reckoning]]. Darwin wrote:&lt;ref name="DarwinNature"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darwin |first=Charles |date=24 April 1873 |title=Origin of Certain Instincts |journal=Nature |volume=7 |pages=417–418 |doi=10.1038/007417a0 |issue=179| url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F1760&amp;pageseq=1|bibcode=1873Natur...7..417D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance, a striking account, in relation to man, will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North Siberia, by Von Wrangell.  He there describes the wonderful manner in which the natives kept a true course towards a particular spot, whilst passing for a long distance through hummocky ice, with incessant changes of direction, and with no guide in the heavens or on the frozen sea. He states (but I quote only from memory of many years standing) that he, an experienced surveyor, and using a compass, failed to do that which these savages easily effected. Yet no one will suppose that they possessed any special sense which is quite absent in us. We must bear in mind that neither a compass, nor the north star, nor any other such sign, suffices to guide a man to a particular spot through an intricate country, or through hummocky ice, when many deviations from a straight course are inevitable, unless the deviations are allowed for, or a sort of "dead reckoning" is kept.&lt;ref name="DarwinNature"/&gt;}}

Wrangel also published:&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;
* ''Otcherk puti iz Sitki v S. Peterburg'' (Report of Travel from Sitka to St. Petersburg) (1836)
** French translation: ''Journal de voyage de Sitka à Saint Pétersbourg'' (Paris, 1836)

In the [[Kalevala]] rune entitled "Haava" (The Wound, section 8),&lt;ref&gt;Bosley, K., translator (1999) ''The Kalevala.'' Oxford World's Classics. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Väinämöinen]] attempts a heroic feat that results in a gushing wound, the blood from which covers the entire earth. This deluge is not emphasized in the Kalevala version redacted by [[Elias Lönnrot]], but the global quality of the flood is evident in original variants of the rune. In one variant collected in [[Northern Ostrobothnia]] in 1803/04, the rune tells:

: ''The blood came forth like a flood&lt;br /&gt;''
: ''the gore ran like a river:&lt;br /&gt;''
: ''there was no hummock&lt;br /&gt;''
: ''and no high mountain&lt;br /&gt;''
: ''that was not flooded&lt;br /&gt;''
: ''all from Väinämöinen's toe
: ''from the holy hero's knee.''&lt;ref&gt;Kuusi, M., Bosley, K., and Branch, M., editors and translators (1977) ''Finnish folk poetry: epic: an anthology in Finnish and English.'' Helsinki: [[Finnish Literature Society]]. p 94&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matti Kuusi]] notes in his analysis that the rune's motifs of constructing a boat, a wound, and a flood have parallels with flood myths from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kuusi, M., Bosley, K., and Branch, M., editors and translators (1977) ''Finnish folk poetry: epic: an anthology in Finnish and English.'' Helsinki: [[Finnish Literature Society]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are sources that cite this flood mythology to the nature of Kalevala as a [[comparative mythology]], which borrowed elements from stories found in other ancient sources such as the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Phoenicians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art, Volume 42|last=Bidwell|first=W.H.|publisher=Leavitt, Trow, &amp; Company|year=1857|isbn=|location=New York|pages=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bible and the Greek mythology, then integrated it with the myth's personification of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=nUYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=flood+myth+kalevala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX1ebmg-HcAhXIxLwKHY-SAJAQ6AEIQjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=flood%20myth%20kalevala&amp;f=false|title=The Presbyterian Quarterly|last=Stickler|first=G.B|last2=Barnett|first2=E.H.|date=1889|publisher=Constitution Publishing Company|year=1889|isbn=|location=New York|pages=154|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account of the great flood was embedded in a narrative that also featured the Greek [[Solar deity|sun-myths]] and [[List of lunar deities|moon-myths]]. These influences are not found in the myths of Finland's [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] neighbors. However, a theory explained this aspect to Finnish myth as a relic of the earliest Asiatic life of one of the Finnish ancestors, the [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Ugrian tribes]].

According to [[Anna-Leena Siikala]], Väinämöinen's legs are of mythological and [[creation myth|cosmogonic]] significance throughout Finnish mythology. For example, it is originally on Väinämöinen's knee that the primordial water-fowl first lays the [[world egg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siikala|first=Anna-Leena|title=Itämerensuomalainen mytologia|year=2012|publisher=[[Finnish Literature Society]]|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-952-222-393-7|pages=536|url=https://kirjat.finlit.fi/index.php?showitem=2596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6208">{{about|the obsolete theory of global cooling|the conjecture positing an overall cooling of the Earth and perhaps the commencement of glaciation or even an ice age|Global cooling}}
Before the concept of [[plate tectonics]], '''global cooling''' was a [[Geophysics|geophysical]] theory by [[James Dwight Dana]], also referred to as the '''contracting earth''' theory.  It suggested that the [[Earth]] had been in a molten state, and features such as mountains formed as it cooled and shrank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbm.me.uk/portsdown/PH_061_History_a.htm The History of Continental Drift - Before Wegener&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123101326/http://www.bbm.me.uk/portsdown/PH_061_History_a.htm |date=2005-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the interior of the Earth cooled and shrank, the rigid crust would have to shrink and crumple.  The crumpling could produce features such as mountain ranges.

== Application ==

The Earth was compared to a cooling ball of iron, or a steam boiler with shifting boiler plates.  By the early 1900s, it was known that temperature increased with increasing depth.  With the thickness of the crust, the "boiler plates", being estimated at ten to fifty miles, the downward pressure would be hundreds of thousands of pounds per square inch.  Although groundwater was expected to turn to steam at a great depth, usually the downward pressure would contain any steam.  Steam's effect upon molten rock was suspected of being a cause of volcanoes and earthquakes, as it had been noticed that most volcanoes are near water.  It was not clear whether the molten rock from volcanoes had its origin in the molten rock under the crust, or if increased heat due to pressure under mountains caused the rock to melt.  One of the reasons for volcanoes was as a way in which "the contracting earth disposes of the matter it can no longer contain."  A relationship between earthquakes and volcanoes had been noted, although the causes were not known.  Fault lines and earthquakes tended to happen along the boundaries of the shifting "boiler plates", but the folding of mountains indicated that sometimes the plates buckled.&lt;ref name="Mowbray1909" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, Professor [[Eduard Suess]] used the theory to explain the [[1908 Messina earthquake]], being of the opinion that the Earth's crust was gradually shrinking everywhere.  He also predicted that eruptions would follow the earthquake and tsunami in Southern Italy. He attributed the earthquake to the sinking of the Earth's crust, in the zone of which the [[Lipari Islands|Aeolian Islands]] are the center. He declared that as the process of sinking went on, the Calabrian and Sicilian highlands on either side of the Straits of Messina would be submerged, only the highest peaks remaining above the sea. The strait, he said, would thereby be greatly widened.&lt;ref name="Mowbray1909"&gt;{{cite book| last = Mowbray| first = Jay Henry| title =Italy's Great Horror or Earthquake and Tidal Wave| year = 1909| pages=127–144, 200–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Professor [[Robert T. Hill]] explained at that time that "the rocks are being folded, fractured and otherwise broken or deformed by the great shrinking and settling of the earth's crust as a whole. The contraction of the earth's sphere is the physical shrinkage of age that is measured in aeons instead of years. The prehistoric convulsions of the earth before man inhabited this planet were terrific, almost inconceivable."  There "was no doubt that earthquakes are diminishing."  The displacement of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] was only a few feet, while prehistoric earthquakes made fissures and slides of 20,000 feet.&lt;ref name="Mowbray1909" /&gt;

[[File:EarthquakeRegions1911.jpg|thumb|alt=1906 map of earthquake regions|1906 map of earthquake regions]]
The [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] had been noticed, as well as a second earthquake belt which went through:{{clarify|date=March 2018}}
* the [[Philippines]]
* [[Panama]]
* the [[Caribbean]]
* [[Spain]]
* the [[Alps]]
* the [[Himalayas]]
* Asia to [[Japan]]&lt;ref name="Mowbray1909" /&gt;

A contracting Earth served as framework for [[Leopold Kober]] and [[Hans Stille]] who worked on [[geosyncline]] theory in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Sen23&gt;[[#Sengor1982|Şengör (1982)]], p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==

Some of the objections include:
* Some large-scale features of the Earth are the result of extension rather than shortening.
* After [[radioactive decay]] was discovered, it was realized it would release heat inside the planet.  This undermines the cooling effect upon which the shrinking planet theory is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Identical fossils have been found thousands of kilometres apart, showing the planet was once a single continent which broke apart because of [[plate tectonics]].

== Current status ==

This theory is now disproven and considered obsolete.  In contrast to Earth, however, global cooling remains the dominant explanation for scarp (cliff) features on the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].  After resumption of Lunar exploration in the 1990s, it was discovered there are scarps across the Moon's surface which are caused by contraction due to cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA's LRO Reveals 'Incredible Shrinking Moon'|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/shrinking-moon.html|work=Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter|publisher=NQASA|accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''giant's kettle''', also known as either a '''giant's cauldron''', '''moulin pothole''', or '''glacial pothole''', is a typically large and cylindrical [[Pothole (landform)|pothole]] [[drilling|drilled]] in solid [[rock (geology)|rock]] underlying a glacier either by water descending down a deep [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulin]] or by [[gravel]] rotating in the bed of [[Subglacial stream|subglacial meltwater stream]].&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, eds. (2005) ''Glossary of Geology'' (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. {{ISBN|0-922152-76-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interiors of potholes tend to be smooth and regular, unlike a [[plunge pool]]. An example is the large pothole found in [[Archbald, Pennsylvania]], in [[Archbald Pothole State Park]].

==Formation==
[[File:Giant's kettle illustration.png|thumb|Giant's kettle illustration]]
[[File:Galets_marmites-01782.JPG|thumb|Collection of pebbles shaped in giant's kettles]]
Giant's kettles are formed while a [[bedrock]] surface is covered by a glacier. Water, produced by the thawing of the [[ice]] and [[snow]], forms [[stream]]s on the surface of the glacier, which, having gathered into their courses a certain amount of [[Moraine|morainic]] debris, finally flow down a [[crevasse]] as a swirling [[waterfall|cascade]] or [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulin]]. The sides of the crevasse are abraded, and a vertical shaft is formed in the ice.&lt;ref name="MAS-112"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Bulletin of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society|date=July 1953|volume=XIV|issue=4|pages=112|url=http://library.bridgew.edu/exhibits/BMAS/pdf/MAS-v14n04.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[erosion]] may be continued into the bed of the glacier; and, the ice having left the district, the giant's kettle so formed is seen as an empty shaft, or as a [[Plumbing|pipe]] filled with gravel, [[sand]], or [[boulder]]s. Such cavities and pipes afford valuable evidence as to the former extent of glaciers.

Similar potholes are encountered in [[stream bed|riverbed]]s and the [[Channeled Scablands]]s scoured by glacial [[outburst flood]]s.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Victor|editor1-last=Migon|editor1-first=Piotr|title=Channeled Scablands: A Megaflood Landscape, in Geomorphological Landscapes of the World|date=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789048130542|pages=21-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable giant's kettle==
[[File:Hiidenkirnut.jpg|thumb|Giant's kettle in [[Rovaniemi]], [[Finland]]]]
The GletscherGarten of [[Lucerne]] ([[Switzerland]]) is famous for its giant's kettles, having 32 in number, the largest being {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} deep. They are also common in [[Germany]], [[Norway]] (''jettegryte''), [[Sweden]] (''jättegryta''), [[Finland]] (''hiidenkirnu''; [[hiisi]]'s [[Butter churn|churn]]), and [[Moss Island]] in the [[United States]].

{{italic title}}
'''''History of Animals''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Τῶν περὶ τὰ ζῷα ἱστοριῶν}}, ''Ton peri ta zoia historion'', "Inquiries on Animals"; {{lang-la|Historia Animālium}} "History of Animals") is one of the major [[Aristotle's biology|texts on biology]] by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], who had studied at [[Plato's Academy]] in [[Athens]]. It was written in the fourth century BC; Aristotle died in 322 BC.

Generally seen as a pioneering work of [[zoology]], Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he is investigating the ''what'' (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the ''why'' (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to part of the [[nature|natural world]]. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all [[birds]] have [[feather]]s, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]].

The ''History of Animals'' contains many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular of the [[marine biology]] around the island of [[Lesbos]], such as that the [[octopus]] had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of [[Mustelus canis|a dogfish]] grow inside their mother's body, or that the male of [[Silurus aristotelis|a river catfish]] guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle has been accused of making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.

The ''History of Animals'' had a powerful influence on zoology for some two thousand years. It continued to be a primary source of knowledge until in the sixteenth century zoologists including [[Conrad Gessner]], all influenced by Aristotle, wrote their own studies of the subject.

==Context==
[[Image:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|Aristotle spent many years at [[Plato's academy]] in Athens. [[Mosaic]], 1st century, [[Pompeii]]|alt=Image of mosaic from a villa in Roman Pompeii, showing Plato's Academy in ancient Athens, with men in robes, some seated on a bench under a tree]]

[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) studied at [[Plato's Academy]] in Athens, remaining there for some 17 years. Like [[Plato]], he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably of the [[natural history]] of the island of [[Lesbos]] and the [[marine biology|marine life]] in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on [[zoology]] was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work.&lt;ref name=Lennox&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lennox |first1=James |title=Aristotle's Biology |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-biology/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=28 November 2014 |date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's pupil [[Theophrastus]] later wrote a similar book on botany, [[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|''Enquiry into Plants'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ancient Natural History: Histories of Nature | publisher=Routledge | author=French, Roger | year=1994 | pages=92–99 | isbn=0-415-11545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==

===Approach===
{{The Works of Aristotle}}

In the ''History of Animals'', Aristotle sets out to investigate the existing facts (Greek "hoti", what), prior to establishing their causes (Greek "dioti", why).&lt;ref name=Lennox/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of Animals'', I, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is thus a defence of his method of investigating [[zoology]]. Aristotle investigates four types of differences between animals: differences in particular body parts (Books I to IV); differences in ways of life and types of activity (Books V, VI, VII and IX); and differences in specific characters (Book VIII).&lt;ref name=Lennox/&gt;

To illustrate the philosophical method, consider one grouping of many kinds of animal,  '[[birds]]': all members of this group possess the same distinguishing features—feathers, wings, beaks, and two bony legs. This is an instance of a [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]: if something is a bird, it will have [[feather]]s and [[wing]]s; if something has feathers and wings, that also implies it is a bird, so the reasoning here is bidirectional. On the other hand, some animals that have red [[blood]] have [[lung]]s; other red-blooded animals (such as fish) have [[gills]]. This implies, in Aristotle's reasoning, that if something has lungs, it has red blood; but Aristotle is careful not to imply that all red-blooded animals have lungs, so the reasoning here is not bidirectional.&lt;ref name=Lennox/&gt;

===Contents===
'''Book I''' The grouping of animals and the parts of the [[human body]]. Aristotle describes the parts that the human body is made of, such as the skull, [[brain]], face, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, thorax, belly, [[heart]], [[viscera]], [[genitalia]], and limbs.

'''Book II''' The different parts of red-blooded animals. Aristotle writes about limbs, the teeth of dogs, horses, man, and elephant; the elephant's tongue; and of animals such as the [[ape]]s, [[crocodile]], [[chameleon]], birds especially the [[wryneck]], fishes and snakes.

'''Book III''' The internal organs, including generative system, veins, sinews, bone etc. He moves on to the [[blood]], [[bone marrow]], [[milk]] including [[rennet]] and [[cheese]], and [[semen]].

'''Book IV''' Animals without blood ([[invertebrates]]) – [[cephalopods]], [[crustaceans]], etc. In chapter 8, he describes the [[sense organ]]s of animals. Chapter 10 considers sleep and whether it occurs in fish.

'''Books V and VI''' Reproduction, spontaneous and sexual of marine invertebrates, birds, quadrupeds, snakes, fish, and terrestrial arthropods including ichneumon wasps, bees, ants, scorpions, spiders, and grasshoppers.

'''Book VII''' Reproduction of man, including puberty, conception, pregnancy, lactation, the embryo, labour, milk, and diseases of infants.

'''Book VIII''' The character and habits of animals, food, migration, health, animal diseases including bee parasites, and the influence of climate.

'''Book IX''' Social behaviour in animals; signs of intelligence in animals such as sheep and birds.

A Book X is included in some versions, dealing with the causes of barrenness in women, but is generally regarded as not being by Aristotle. In the preface to his translation, [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] calls it "spurious beyond question".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1910, page iv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations===
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

The ''History of Animals'' contains a large number of eye-witness observations, in particular of [[marine biology]], in sharp contrast to Plato's "symbolic zoology". Aristotle's style and precision can be seen in the passage where he discusses the behaviour and anatomy of the cephalopods, mentioning the [[anti-predator adaptation#Distraction|use of ink against predators]], [[camouflage]], and [[Signalling theory|signalling]]. This is D'Arcy Thompson's translation:&lt;ref name=Camouflage&gt;Aristotle (c. 350 BC). ''Historia Animalium''. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.9.ix.html IX, 621b-622a]. Cited in Borrelli, Luciana; [[Francesca Gherardi|Gherardi, Francesca]]; Fiorito, Graziano (2006). ''A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda''. Firenze University Press. {{ISBN|978-88-8453-377-7}}. [http://www.fupress.com/scheda.asp?IDV=487 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Octopus macropus.jpg|thumb|upright|Aristotle observed that the [[Octopus macropus|octopus]] can [[Deimatic behaviour|change colour when disturbed]].]]

{{blockquote|Of molluscs the [[Cuttlefish|sepia]] is the most cunning, and is the only species that employs its dark liquid for the sake of [[anti-predator adaptation#Distraction|concealment as well as from fear]]: the octopus and [[Squid|calamary]] make the discharge solely from fear. These creatures never discharge the pigment in its entirety; and after a discharge the pigment accumulates again. The sepia, as has been said, often uses its [[Sepia (color)|colouring pigment]] for concealment; it shows itself in front of the pigment and then retreats back into it; it also hunts with its long tentacles not only little fishes, but oftentimes even mullets. The octopus is a stupid creature, for it will approach a man's hand if it be lowered in the water; but it is neat and thrifty in its habits: that is, it lays up stores in its nest, and, after eating up all that is eatable, it ejects the shells and sheaths of crabs and shell-fish, and the skeletons of little fishes. It seeks its prey by so [[active camouflage|changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it]]; it does so also [[Deimatic behaviour|when alarmed]].|Historia Animalium IX.621b-622a}}

His observations were almost all accurate, according to the philosopher Anthony Preus, though [[Mario Vegetti]] argues that Aristotle sometimes let theory cloud observation.&lt;ref name=Campbell2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Gordon Lindsay |title=The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrrQCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA517 |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-103515-9 |page=517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG|thumb|left|Aristotle recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|&lt;!--a different species shown--&gt;a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the yolk sac).]]

Some of Aristotle's observations were not taken seriously by science until they were independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a [[hectocotylus]], a [[tentacle]] which stores [[sperm]] and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Book IV.I (D'Arcy Thompson, page 524)&lt;/ref&gt; The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist [[Georges Cuvier]] described it in his 1817 ''[[Le Règne Animal]]''.&lt;ref name=Allaby&gt;{{cite book |last=Allaby |first=Michael |title=Animals: From Mythology to Zoology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtKZ12YN9qcC&amp;pg=PT34 |year=2010 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-6101-3 |pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also noted that the young of the [[Mustelus canis|dogfish]] grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a [[placenta]] (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist [[Johannes Peter Müller]].&lt;ref name=Allaby/&gt; Aristotle noted, too, that [[Silurus aristotelis|a river catfish]] which he called the ''glanis'' cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist [[Louis Agassiz]] found the account to be correct in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi|first=Armand Marie |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU4gBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69 |year=2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-4088-3620-0 |pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's methods of observation included [[dissection]] (Aristotle's lost companion work, ''The Dissections'', contained illustrations of these&lt;ref name=Haworth&gt;{{cite book |last=Haworth |first=Alan |title=Understanding the Political Philosophers: From Ancient to Modern Times |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZUWqnGiTfsC&amp;pg=PA37 |year=2011 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-135-19896-1 |pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so he observed animal [[anatomy]] directly, though his interpretations of the functions of the structures he observed were subject to error. Like other classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]], Aristotle also gathered evidence from travellers and people with specialised knowledge, such as fishermen and [[beekeeper]]s, without much attempt to corroborate what they said.&lt;ref name=Lang2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Philippa |title=Science: Antiquity and its Legacy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzDPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60 |year=2015 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0-85773-955-1 |pages=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apparent errors===
[[File:Ephemerellidae sp 01.jpg|thumb|[[Mayfly|Mayflies]] walk on four legs, as Aristotle stated.]]

The text contains some claims that appear to be errors. Aristotle asserted that the females of any species have a smaller number of teeth than the males. This apparently readily falsifiable claim could have been a genuine observation, if as Robert Mayhew suggests&lt;ref name=Mayhew&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayhew |first1=Robert |title=The Female in Aristotle's Biology |date=2004 |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-51200-6 |pages=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; women at that time had a poorer diet than men; but the claim is not true of other species either. Thus, Philippa Lang argues, Aristotle may have been [[empiricism|empirical]], but he was quite [[laissez-faire]] about observation, "because [he] was not expecting nature to be misleading".&lt;ref name=Lang2015/&gt;

In other cases, errors may have been wrongly attributed to Aristotle.&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilkins |first1=John S. |title=Aristotle on the mayfly |url=http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2008/09/16/aristotle-on-the-mayfly/&lt;!--blog of a reputable philosopher of science--&gt; |website=Evolving Thoughts |accessdate=16 October 2016 |date=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katrin Weigmann wrote "[Aristotle's] statement that flies have four legs was repeated in natural history texts for more than a thousand years despite the fact that a little counting would have proven otherwise."&lt;ref name="Weigmann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigmann |first1=Katrin |title=The Consequence of Errors |journal=EMBO Reports |date=2005 |volume=6 |pages=306–309 |url=http://embor.embopress.org/content/6/4/306 |quote=Aristotle's belief that the brain is a cooling organ for the blood was definitely not based on anything that scientists today would consider scientific evidence. He also thought that in humans, goats and pigs, males have more teeth than females, a notion easy enough to correct. His statement that flies have four legs was repeated in natural history texts for more than a thousand years despite the fact that a little counting would have proven otherwise. |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400389|pmc=1299297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the historian and philosopher of biology John S. Wilkins notes that Aristotle did not say "all flies have four legs"; he wrote that one particular animal, the ''ephemeron'' or [[mayfly]], "moves with four feet and four wings: and, I may observe in passing, this creature is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence, whence it receives its name, but also because though a quadruped it has wings also." Mayflies do in fact walk on four legs, the front pair not being adapted for walking, so, Wilkins concludes, Aristotle was correct.&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt;

==Influence==
{{further|Aristotle's biology#Influence}}

The comparative anatomist [[Richard Owen]] said in 1837 that "Zoological Science sprang from [Aristotle's] labours, we may almost say, like [[Minerva]] from the Head of [[Jupiter|Jove]], in a state of noble and splendid maturity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Owen |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Sloan|editor1-first=Phillip Reid|title=The Hunterian Lectures in Comparative Anatomy (May and June 1837) |date=1992 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Waggoner of the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] wrote that

{{quote|Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time, and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death. His observations on the anatomy of octopus, cuttlefish, crustaceans, and many other marine invertebrates are remarkably accurate, and could only have been made from first-hand experience with dissection. Aristotle described the embryological development of a chick; he distinguished whales and dolphins from fish; he described the chambered stomachs of ruminants and the social organization of bees; he noticed that some sharks give birth to live young — his books on animals are filled with such observations, some of which were not confirmed until many centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waggoner |first1=Ben |title=Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |accessdate=27 November 2014 |date=9 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Walter Pagel]] comments that Aristotle "perceptibly influenced" the founders of modern zoology, the Swiss [[Conrad Gessner]] with his 1551–1558 ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]'', the Italian [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522–1605), the French [[Guillaume Rondelet]] (1507–1566), and the Dutch [[Volcher Coiter]] (1534–1576), while his methods of looking at time series and making use of [[comparative anatomy]] assisted the Englishman [[William Harvey]] in his 1651 work on embryology.&lt;ref name="Pagel1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Pagel |title=William Harvey's Biological Ideas: Selected Aspects and Historical Background |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0cQQlZK43cC&amp;pg=PA335 |year=1967 |publisher=Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers |isbn=978-3-8055-0962-6|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Location of the Ryukyu Islands.JPG|thumb|The [[Ryukyu Islands]] form an island arc.]]
An '''island arc''' is a type of [[archipelago]], often composed of a chain of [[volcanoes]], with arc-shaped alignment, situated parallel and close to a boundary between two [[Convergent boundary|converging tectonic plate]]s.

Most of these island arcs are formed as one oceanic tectonic plate [[subduction|subducts]] another one and, in most cases, produces [[magma]] at depths below the over-riding plate. However, this is only true for those island arcs that are part of the group of mountain belts which are called [[volcanic arc]]s, a term which is used when all the elements of the arc-shaped mountain belt are composed of volcanoes. For example, large parts of the Andes-Central American-Canadian mountain chain may be known as a volcanic arc, but they are not islands (being situated upon and along a continental area) and are thus not classified as an island arc. On the other hand, the Aegean or [[Hellenic arc]] in the [[Mediterranean]] area, composed of numerous islands such as [[Crete]], is an island arc, but is not volcanic. Parallel to it is the [[South Aegean Volcanic Arc]], which is the volcanic island arc of the same tectonic system.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Classification==
There is some debate about the usefulness of the distinction between island arcs and volcanic arcs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The term "volcanic island arc" is merely a sub-classification of "island arc." Island arcs are tectonically created arc-shaped mountain belts that are partly below sea level. Essentially, they represent a specific geographic-topographic situation in which a mountain belt is partly submerged in ocean. Many of these are composed of volcanoes, and can thus be further classified as volcanic island arcs.

==Tectonic formation==
{{see also|Subduction}}

In the subduction zone, the dehydration of the subducting slab releases volatiles into the overriding [[mantle wedge]]. The addition of volatile components (e.g., water) induces partial melting by lowering the solidus of the wedge. This process, called [[flux melting]], generates varying degrees of [[calc-alkaline]] [[magma]] that buoyantly rises to intrude and be extruded through the lithosphere of the overriding plate. The resulting [[volcano]] chain has the shape of an arc parallel to the convergent plate boundary and convex toward the subducting plate. One of the theories to explain the arc shape views this as a consequence of the geometry of the spherical plate crumpling along a line on a spherical surface, but only the more broadly shaped arcs can be explained in this way.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

On the subducting side of the island arc is a deep and narrow [[oceanic trench]], which is the trace at the Earth’s surface of the boundary between the downgoing and overriding plates. This trench is created by the gravitational pull of the relatively dense subducting plate pulling the leading edge of the plate downward. Multiple [[earthquake]]s occur along this subduction boundary with the [[seismic]] [[hypocenter]]s located at increasing depth under the island arc: these quakes define the [[Wadati–Benioff zone]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Ocean basins that are being reduced by subduction are called 'remnant oceans' as they will slowly be shrunken out of existence and crushed in the subsequent [[orogeny|orogenic]] collision. This process has happened repeatedly in the geological history of the Earth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9210">The '''junkyard tornado''' is an argument used to deride the probability of [[abiogenesis]] as comparable to "the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a [[Boeing 747]]."&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/abioprob.html |title=Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations |work=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |first=Ian |last=Musgrave |date=December 21, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Johnson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/weekinreview/28johnson.html |title=Bright Scientists, Dim Notions |work=NY Times |date=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gatherer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gatherer |first1=Derek |year=2008 |title=Finite Universe of Discourse: The Systems Biology of Walter Elsasser (1904-1991) |journal=The Open Biology Journal |volume=1 |pages=9–20 |doi=10.2174/1874196700801010009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used originally by [[Fred Hoyle]], in which he applied statistical analysis to the origin of life, but similar observations predate Hoyle and have been found all the way back to Darwin's time,&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt; and indeed to [[Cicero]] in [[Classical era|classical times]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]. ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 2.37&lt;/ref&gt; While Hoyle himself was an atheist, the argument has since become a mainstay of [[creationist]] and [[intelligent design]] [[criticism of evolution|criticisms of evolution]].

This argument is rejected by the vast majority of [[biology|biologists]].  From the modern [[evolution]]ary standpoint, while the odds of the sudden construction of higher lifeforms are indeed improbably remote, evolution proceeds in many smaller stages, each driven by [[natural selection]] rather than by chance, over a long period of time.  The transition as a whole is plausible, as each step improves survivability; the Boeing 747 was not designed in a single unlikely burst of creativity, and modern lifeforms were not constructed in one single unlikely event, as the junkyard tornado posits.

==Hoyle's statement==
According to [[Fred Hoyle]]'s analysis, the probability of cellular life's arising from non-living matter ([[abiogenesis]]) was about one-in-10&lt;sup&gt;40,000&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Fred |last1=Hoyle |year=1983 |title=The Intelligent Universe |page=17}} The Boeing 747 metaphor is reported in Nature, 294 (1981), p.10{{failed verification |which article? http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v294/n5836/index.html|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented:

{{quote|The chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way is comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a [[Boeing 747]] from the materials therein.}}

This echoes his stance, reported elsewhere:

{{quote|Life as we know it is, among other things, dependent on at least 2000 different enzymes. How could the blind forces of the primal sea manage to put together the correct chemical elements to build enzymes?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Fred Hoyle |first=Fred |last=Hoyle |title=The Intelligent Universe |year=1983 |isbn=0-7181-2298-4}}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hoyle used this to argue in favor of [[panspermia]], that the origin of life on earth was from preexisting life in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoyle|first1=Fred|last2=Wickramasinghe|first2=N. C.|title=Astronomical Origins of Life|date=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-9401058629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The junkyard tornado derives from arguments most popular in the 1920s, prior to the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], which are rejected by evolutionary biologists.&lt;ref name="Gatherer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMSmith"/&gt; A preliminary step is to establish that the [[phase space]] containing some biological entity (such as humans, working cells, or the eye) is enormous, something not contentious.  The argument is then to infer from the huge size of the phase space that the probability that the entity could appear by chance is exceedingly low, ignoring the key process involved, [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Gatherer"/&gt;

Sometimes, arguments invoking the junkyard tornado analogy also invoke [[Borel's Law]], which claims that highly improbable events do not occur.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt;  The usual argument against Borel's "Law" is that if ''all'' possible outcomes of a natural process are highly improbable when taken individually, then a highly improbable outcome is certain.  The true law being referenced is actually the [[law of large numbers|Strong Law of large numbers]], but creationists have taken a simple statement made by Borel in books written late in his life concerning probability theory and called this statement Borel's Law.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

This "Borel's Law" is actually the [[universal probability bound]], which when applied to evolution is axiomatically incorrect. The universal probability bound assumes that the event one is trying to measure is completely random, and some use this argument to prove that evolution could not possibly occur, since its probability would be much less than that of the universal probability bound. This, however, is fallacious, given that evolution is not a completely random effect ([[genetic drift]]), but rather proceeds with the aid of natural selection.

The junkyard tornado is also applied to cellular biochemistry. This is comparable to the older [[infinite monkey theorem]] but instead of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], the claim is that the probability that a [[protein]] molecule could achieve a [[function (biology)|functional]] sequence of [[amino acids]] is too low to be realised by chance alone.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gatherer"/&gt;  The argument conflates the difference between the complexity that arises from living organisms that are able to reproduce themselves (and as such may evolve under natural selection to become better adapted and perhaps more complex over time) with the complexity of inanimate objects, unable to pass on any reproductive changes (such as the multitude of parts manufactured in [[Boeing 747]]). The comparison breaks down because of this important distinction.

According to Ian Musgrave in ''Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations'':
{{quote|These people, including Fred, have committed one or more of the following errors.
#They calculate the probability of the formation of a "modern" protein, or even a complete bacterium with all "modern" proteins, by random events. This is not the [[abiogenesis]] theory at all.
#They assume that there is a fixed number of proteins, with fixed sequences for each protein, that are required for life.
#They calculate the probability of sequential trials, rather than simultaneous trials.
#They misunderstand what is meant by a probability calculation.
#They underestimate the number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt;}}

==Reception==
The junkyard tornado argument is rejected by evolutionary biologists,&lt;ref name="Gatherer"/&gt; since, as the late [[John Maynard Smith]] pointed out, "no biologist imagines that complex structures arise in a single step."&lt;ref name="JMSmith"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]], ''The Problems of Biology'', p.49. (1986), {{ISBN|0-19-289198-7}}, "What is wrong with it? Essentially, it is that no biologist imagines that complex structures arise in a single step."&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Evolutionary biology]] explains how complex [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] structures evolved by analysing the intermediate steps required for [[precellular]] life. It is these intermediate steps that are omitted in creationist arguments, which is the cause of their overestimating of the improbability of the entire process.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt;

Hoyle's argument is a mainstay of [[creationist]], [[intelligent design]], [[orthogenetic]] and other criticisms of evolution. It has been labeled a [[fallacy]] by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his two books ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' and ''[[Climbing Mount Improbable]]''.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt; Dawkins argues that the existence of God, who under theistic uses of Hoyle's argument is implicitly responsible for the origin of life, defies probability far more than does the spontaneous origin of life even given Hoyle's assumptions, with Dawkins detailing his counter-argument in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', describing God as the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]].

[[Sites of Special Scientific Interest|SSSIs]] in the UK are [[SSSI notification|notified]] using the concept of an [[Area of Search]] (AOS), an area of between {{convert|400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1998 revision); ''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', section 4.11, p. 17. {{ISBN|1873701721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Areas of Search were conceived and developed between 1975 and 1979 by the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] (NCC), based on regions created by the [[Local Government Act 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1998 revision); ''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', section 4.5, pp. 14–15. {{ISBN|1873701721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 [[Districts of Wales|districts]]. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties ([[Dyfed]], [[Powys]] and [[Gwynedd]]) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. [[Mid Glamorgan|Mid]] and [[South Glamorgan]] were merged into a single AOS, whilst [[Llanelli (district)|Llanelli district]] was included in the [[West Glamorgan]] AOS.

Due to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed. Using the AOS system alone would make it difficult to search for individual SSSI citations via the [[Countryside Council for Wales]] (CCW) database without knowing 1972 region divisions. As a result, the CCW groups Welsh SSSIs using the [[Local government in Wales|subdivisions of Wales]] formed in April 1996 by the [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]], resulting in 22 [[Principal areas#Wales|principal areas]].

Preseli &amp; South Pembrokeshire AOS lies within the county of [[Pembrokeshire]].

One of the less common plantain diseases is ''exostentialis clittellus'' referred to by most plantain and banana farmers as "segmented banana". This is a result of the peel forming tiny inter-fruit membranes which cause the banana to appear as though it has been sliced before it is peeled. This is generally a result of freezing the fruit, and occurs most commonly in fruit that is sold in large stores or supermarkets.

'''List of placental mammals''' contains the [[placentalia|placental]] mammals. The class Mammalia ([[mammal]]s) is divided into two subclasses based on [[sexual reproduction|reproductive]] techniques: [[Monotreme]]s, which lay eggs, and [[theria]]ns, mammals which give live birth, which has two infraclasses: [[Marsupials]], [[pouch (marsupial)|pouched]] mammals and placental mammals. See [[List of monotremes and marsupials]], and for the [[clade]]s and families, see [[mammal classification]]. Classification updated from Wilson and Reeder's [[Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference ]] using the ''[[Planet' Mammifères]] website.&lt;ref name="Planet' Mammifères"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boudet Ch.|title=Planet' Mammiferes|url=http://www.planet-mammiferes.org/drupal/en/node/20|website=Planet' Mammiferes|accessdate=2016-04-17 |version=4.1 of 2013/12/23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 3 of the project that ran until 2012 and was the installing of fuel cell [[micro combined heat and power]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islenet.net/?secid=2&amp;pid=49 Lolland-Falster, Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the city of [[Nakskov]] on the island of [[Lolland]], where [[wind power]] is abundant, the hydrogen energy plant was received with funding from the Danish Energy Authority, which is a joint partnership between the Municipality of Lolland, IRD Fuel Cells, and Baltic Sea Solutions.

The island of [[Lolland]] is producing 50% more energy from [[renewable energy]] sources [[EROEI|than it consumes]], and the hydrogen project was seeking to locally store excess wind power in the form of [[hydrogen]], for use in residential and industrial facilities.&lt;ref name="renewable"/&gt;

Hydrogen is produced by using excess wind power to electrolyze water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is used in the municipal water treatment plant nearby to speed up the biological process. The hydrogen is stored in low-pressure storage tanks at six [[Bar (unit)|bars]] and fuels two PEM Fuel Cell Micro Combined Heat and Power (CHP) stations of 2 [[kilowatt]]s (kW) and 6.5&amp;nbsp;kW, respectively.&lt;ref name="renewable"/&gt;

The '''Lorentz factor''' or '''Lorentz term''' is the factor by which time, length, and [[relativistic mass]] change for an object while that object is moving. The expression appears in several equations in [[special relativity]], and it arises in derivations of the [[Lorentz transformation]]s. The name originates from its earlier appearance in [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentzian electrodynamics]] – named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/oneuniverse/motion_knowledge_concept_12.html One universe], by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], Charles Tsun-Chu Liu, and Robert Irion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its ubiquity, it is generally denoted ''γ'' (the Greek lowercase letter [[gamma]]). Sometimes (especially in discussion of [[superluminal motion]]) the factor is written as ''Γ'' (Greek uppercase-gamma) rather than ''γ''.

==Definition==
The Lorentz factor ''&amp;gamma;'' is defined as&lt;ref name=Forshaw&gt;{{cite book |title=Dynamics and Relativity |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Forshaw |first2=Gavin |last2=Smith |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-118-93329-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5TaiAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{dt}{d\tau} &lt;/math&gt;,
where:
*''v'' is the [[relative velocity]] between inertial reference frames,
*''c'' is the ''[[speed of light]] in a vacuum'',
*''β'' is the ratio of ''v'' to ''c'',
*''t'' is [[coordinate time]],
*{{mvar|&amp;tau;}} is the [[proper time]] for an observer (measuring time intervals in the observer's own frame).

This is the most frequently used form in practice, though not the only one (see below for alternative forms).

To complement the definition, some authors define the reciprocal&lt;ref&gt;Yaakov Friedman, ''Physical Applications of Homogeneous Balls'', Progress in Mathematical Physics '''40''' Birkhäuser, Boston, 2004, pages 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{\gamma} = \sqrt{1- \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \ = \sqrt{1- {\beta}^2} ;&lt;/math&gt;
see [[velocity addition formula]].

==Occurrence==
Following is a list of formulae from Special relativity which use ''γ'' as a shorthand:&lt;ref name=Forshaw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sears' and Zemansky's University Physics |last=Young |last2=Freedman |edition=12th |publisher=Pearson Ed. &amp; Addison-Wesley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-321-50130-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[Lorentz transformation]]:''' The simplest case is a boost in the ''x''-direction (more general forms including arbitrary directions and rotations not listed here), which describes how spacetime coordinates change from one inertial frame using coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t'') to another (''x''{{′}}, ''y''{{′}}, ''z''{{′}}, ''t''{{′}}) with relative velocity ''v'':
:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right ), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x' = \gamma \left( x - vt \right ). &lt;/math&gt;
Corollaries of the above transformations are the results:
* '''[[Time dilation]]:''' The time (∆''t''{{′}}) between two ticks as measured in the frame in which the clock is moving, is longer than the time (∆''t'') between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock:
*: &lt;math&gt;\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''[[Length contraction]]:''' The length (∆''x''{{′}}) of an object as measured in the frame in which it is moving, is shorter than its length (∆''x'') in its own rest frame:
*:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x' = \Delta x/\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation]] of [[Conservation of linear momentum|momentum]] and energy leads to these results:
* '''[[Relativistic mass]]:''' The [[mass]] ''m'' of an object in motion is dependent on &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and the [[invariant mass|rest mass]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
*:&lt;math&gt;m = \gamma m_0.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''[[Relativistic momentum]]:''' The relativistic [[momentum]] relation takes the same form as for classical momentum, but using the above relativistic mass:
*:&lt;math&gt;\vec p = m \vec v = \gamma m_0 \vec v.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''[[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|Relativistic kinetic energy]]:''' The relativistic kinetic [[energy]] relation takes the slightly modified form:
:*&lt;math&gt;E_k = E - E_0 = (\gamma - 1) m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Alternative representations==
{{Main|Momentum|Rapidity}}

There are other ways to write the factor. Above, velocity ''v'' was used, but related variables such as [[momentum]] and [[rapidity]] may also be convenient.

===Momentum===
Solving the previous relativistic momentum equation for ''γ'' leads to
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \sqrt{1+\left ( \frac{p}{m_0 c} \right )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;.
This form is rarely used, although it does appear in the [[Maxwell–Jüttner distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;Synge, J.L (1957). The Relativistic Gas. Series in physics. North-Holland. LCCN 57-003567&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapidity===
Applying the definition of [[rapidity]] as the [[hyperbolic angle]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2005/reviews/kinemarpp.pdf Kinematics], by [[John David Jackson (physicist)|J.D. Jackson]], See page 7 for definition of rapidity.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \tanh \varphi = \beta&lt;/math&gt;
also leads to ''γ'' (by use of [[Hyperbolic function#Useful relations|hyperbolic identities]]):
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \cosh \varphi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \tanh^2 \varphi}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the property of [[Lorentz transformation]], it can be shown that rapidity is additive, a useful property that velocity does not have. Thus the rapidity parameter forms a [[one-parameter group]], a foundation for physical models.

===Series expansion (velocity)===
The Lorentz factor has the [[Taylor series|Maclaurin series]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\gamma &amp; = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \\
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \beta^{2n}\prod_{k=1}^n \left(\dfrac{2k - 1}{2k}\right) \\
&amp; = 1 + \tfrac12 \beta^2 + \tfrac38 \beta^4 + \tfrac{5}{16} \beta^6 + \tfrac{35}{128} \beta^8 + \tfrac{63}{256} \beta^{10} + \cdots ,\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which is a special case of a [[binomial series]].

The approximation ''γ'' ≈ 1 + {{sfrac|1|2}} ''β''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; may be used to calculate relativistic effects at low speeds. It holds to within 1% error for ''v'' &amp;lt; 0.4 c (''v'' &amp;lt; 120,000&amp;nbsp;km/s), and to within 0.1% error for ''v'' &lt; 0.22&amp;nbsp;''c'' (''v'' &amp;lt; 66,000&amp;nbsp;km/s).

The truncated versions of this series also allow [[physics|physicists]] to prove that [[special relativity]] reduces to [[Newtonian mechanics]] at low speeds. For example, in special relativity, the following two equations hold:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\vec p &amp; = \gamma m \vec v, \\
E &amp; = \gamma m c^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For ''γ'' ≈ 1 and ''γ'' ≈ 1 + {{sfrac|1|2}} ''β''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, these reduce to their Newtonian equivalents:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\vec p &amp; = m \vec v, \\
E &amp; = m c^2 + \tfrac12 m v^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Lorentz factor equation can also be inverted to yield
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} .&lt;/math&gt;
This has an asymptotic form 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = 1 - \tfrac12 \gamma^{-2} - \tfrac18 \gamma^{-4} - \tfrac{1}{16} \gamma^{-6} - \tfrac{5}{128} \gamma^{-8} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.

The first two terms are occasionally used to quickly calculate velocities from large ''γ'' values. The approximation ''β'' ≈ 1 − {{sfrac|1|2}} ''γ''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; holds to within 1% tolerance for ''γ'' &gt; 2, and to within 0.1% tolerance for ''γ'' &gt; 3.5.

==Applications in astronomy==
The standard model of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) holds that these explosions are ultra-relativistic (initial &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; greater than approximately 100), which is invoked to explain the so-called "compactness" problem: absent this ultra-relativistic expansion, the ejecta would be optically thick to pair production at typical peak spectral energies of a few 100&amp;nbsp;keV, whereas the prompt emission is observed to be non-thermal.&lt;ref&gt;Cenko, S. B. et al., ''iPTF14yb: The First Discovery of a Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow Independent of a High-Energy Trigger'', Astrophysical Journal Letters '''803''', 2015, L24 (6 pp).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subatomic particles called [[muon]]s, have a relatively high lorentz factor and therefore experience extreme [[time dilation]]. As an example, muons generally have a half-life of about {{val|2.2|u=us}} which means muons generated from cosmic ray collisions at about 10&amp;nbsp;km up in the atmosphere should be non-detectable on the ground due to their decay rate. However, it has been found that ~10% of muons are still detected on the surface, thereby proving that to be detectable they have had their decay rates slow down relative to our inertial frame of reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/muon.html|title=Muon Experiment in Relativity|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxian economics}}
'''Marxian class theory''' asserts that an individual’s position within a class hierarchy is determined by his or her role in the production process, and argues that political and ideological consciousness is determined by class position.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, F. Marx’s Theory of History: A Bourgeois Critique. New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[social class|class]] is those who share common economic interests, are [[class consciousness|conscious]] of those interests, and engage in [[collective action]] which advances those interests.&lt;ref name=CJPSEA&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edward Andrew|title=Class in Itself and Class against Capital: Karl Marx and His Classifiers|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science|date=September 1983|volume=16|issue=3|pages=577–584|jstor=3227396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Marxian class theory, the structure of the production process forms the basis of class construction.

To Marx, a class is a group with intrinsic tendencies and interests that differ from those of other groups within society, the basis of a fundamental antagonism between such groups. For example, it is in the laborer's best interest to maximize wages and benefits and in the capitalist's best interest to maximize profit at the expense of such, leading to a contradiction within the capitalist system, even if the laborers and capitalists themselves are [[False consciousness|unaware of the clash of interests]].

Marxian class theory has been open to a range of alternate positions, most notably from scholars such as E. P. Thompson and Mario Tronti. Both Thompson and Tronti suggest class consciousness within the production process precedes the formation of productive relationships. In this sense, Marxian class theory often relates to discussion over pre-existing class struggles.

==Origins of Marx's theory==
[[Karl Marx]]'s class theory derives from a range of philosophical schools of thought including left Hegelianism, Scottish Empiricism, and Anglo-French political-economics. Marx's view of class originated from a series of personal interests relating to social alienation and human struggle, whereby the formation of class structure relates to acute historical consciousness.  Political-economics also contributed to Marx's theories, centering on the concept of "origin of income" where society is divided into three sub-groups: Rentier, Capitalist, and Worker. This construction is based on [[David Ricardo]]'s theory of capitalism. Marx strengthened this with a discussion over verifiable class relationships.

Marx sought to define class as embedded in productive relations rather than social status. His political and economic thought developed towards an interest in production as opposed to distribution, and this henceforth became a central theme in his concept of class.

==Class structure==
Marx distinguishes one class from another on the basis of two criteria: ownership of the [[means of production]] and control of the [[labor power]] of others. From this, Marx states "Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other":

I. Capitalists, or bourgeoisie, own the means of production and purchase the labor power of others

II. Workers, or proletariat, do not own any means of production or the ability to purchase the labor power of others. Rather, they sell their own labor power.

Class is thus determined by property relations, not by income or status. These factors are determined by distribution and consumption, which mirror the production and power relations of classes.

[[The Manifesto of the Communist Party]] describes two additional classes that “decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry”:

iii. A small, transitional class known as the [[Petite Bourgeoisie|petite bourgeoisie]] own sufficient means of production but do not purchase labor power.  Marx's [[Communist Manifesto]] fails to properly define the petite bourgeoisie beyond “smaller capitalists” (Marx and Engels, 1848, 25).

iv. The “dangerous class”, or [[Lumpenproletariat]], “the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society.”

==The nature of class relations: conflict==
"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles… Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.... The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.” – Communist Manifesto

Marx established conflict as the key driving force of history and the main determinant of social trajectories (Kingston).  However, in order to understand the nature of “[[class conflict]],” we must first understand that such conflict arises from a unified class interest, also known as class consciousness.  [[Class consciousness]] is an aspect of Marxist theory, referring to the self-awareness of social classes, the capacity to act in its own rational interests, or measuring the extent to which an individual is conscious of the historical tasks their class (or class allegiance) sets for them.

Moreover, by definition, the objective interests of classes are fundamentally in opposition; consequently, these opposing interests and consciousnesses eventually lead to class conflict.

Marx first saw the development of class conflict confined to individual factories and capitalists.  However, given the maturation of capitalism, the life conditions of bourgeoisie and proletariat began to grow more disparate.  This increased polarization and homogenization within classes fostered an environment for individual struggles to become more generalized.  When increasing class conflict is manifested at the societal level, class consciousness and common interests are also increased.  Consequently, when class consciousness is augmented, policies are organized to ensure the duration of such interest for the ruling class.  Here begins the use of the struggle for political power and classes become political forces.

Since the distribution of political power is determined by power over production, or power over capital, it is no surprise that the bourgeois class uses their wealth to legitimatize and protect their property and consequent social relations.  Thus the ruling class is those who hold the economic power and make the decisions ([[Dahrendorf]]).

== Class structure of capitalism ==
In [[Marxist theory]], the [[capitalist]] stage of production consists of two main classes: the [[bourgeoisie]], the capitalists who own the means of production, and the much larger [[proletariat]] (or 'working class') who must sell their own labour power (See also: [[wage labour]]). This is the [[relations of production|fundamental economic structure of work and property]] (See also: [[wage labour]]), a state of inequality that is normalised and [[Base and superstructure|reproduced through cultural ideology]]. Thus the proletariat, in itself, is forced into a subservient position by the power of capital, which has stripped the means of production from them. As the proletariat becomes conscious of its situation and power, organizes itself, and takes collective political action it becomes a class for itself which has the revolutionary potential to become the ruling class.&lt;ref name=CJPSEA/&gt;

[[Max Weber]] critiqued [[historical materialism]], positing that stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities but on other status and power differentials. Social class pertaining broadly to material wealth may be distinguished from status class based on honour, prestige, religious affiliation, and so on. The conditions of capitalism and its class system came together due to a variety of "elective affinities". {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Marxism|Marxists]] explain the history of "civilized" societies in terms of a [[class conflict|war of classes]] between those who control production and those who produce the goods or services in society. In the Marxist view of [[capitalism]], this is a conflict between capitalists ([[bourgeoisie]]) and [[working class|wage-workers]] (the [[proletariat]]). For Marxists, class antagonism is rooted in the situation that control over social production necessarily entails control over the class which produces goods—in capitalism this is the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of workers by the [[bourgeoisie]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Marx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace the capitalist system with [[socialism]], changing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which: "..the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." ([[Communist Manifesto]]) This would mark the beginning of a [[classless society]] in which human needs rather than profit would be motive for production. In a society with democratic control and [[production for use]], there would be no class, no state and no need for money.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

For Marx, class has three primary facets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanagan, Michael P.|chapter=Class|editor=Stearns, Peter N.|title=Encyclopedia of social history|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8153-0342-8|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkIeyCEedrsC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Objective factors: A class shares a common [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]].  That is, all people in one class make their living in a common way in terms of ownership of the things that produce social goods.  A class may own things, own land, own people, be owned, own nothing but their labor.  A class will extract tax, produce agriculture, enslave and work others, be enslaved and work, or work for a wage.
;Subjective factors: The members will necessarily have some perception of their similarity and common interest. Marx termed this [[Class consciousness]].  Class consciousness is not simply an awareness of one's own class interest (for instance, the maximisation of shareholder value; or, the maximization of the wage with the minimization of the working day), class consciousness also embodies deeply shared views of how society should be organized legally, culturally, socially and politically.
;Reproduction of class relations: Class as a set of social relationships that is reproduced from one generation to the next.

The first criterion divides a society into the owners and non-owners of means of production. In capitalism, these are capitalist (bourgeoisie) and [[proletariat]]. Finer divisions can be made, however: the most important subgroup in capitalism being [[petite bourgeoisie]] (small bourgeoisie), people who possess their own means of production but utilize it primarily by working on it themselves rather than hiring others to work on it. They include self-employed [[artisan]]s, small shopkeepers, and many [[professional]]s. Jon Elster has found mention in Marx of 15 classes from various historical periods.&lt;ref&gt;''The classes are: "bureaucrats and theocrats in the Asiatic mode of production; freemen, slaves, plebeians, and patricians under slavery; lord, serf, guild master and journeyman under feudalism; industrial capitalists, financial capitalists, landlords, peasantry, petty bourgeoisie, and wage laborers under capitalism."'' Jon Elster, ''An Introduction to Karl Marx'', (Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] has defined classes as "large groups of people differing from each other by the place they occupy in a historically determined system of social production, by their relation (in most cases fixed and formulated in law) to the means of production, by their role in the social organization of labor, and, consequently, by the dimensions of the share of social wealth of which they dispose and the mode of acquiring it." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/jun/19.htm ''A Great Beginning'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proletarianisation ==
The most important transformation of society for Marxists has been the massive and rapid growth of the proletariat over the last two hundred and fifty years. Starting with agricultural and domestic textile laborers in England and Flanders, more and more occupations only provide a living through wages or salaries. Private manufacturing, leading to self-employment, is no longer as viable as it was before the industrial revolution, because automation made manufacturing very cheap. Many people who once controlled their own labor-time were converted into proletarians through industrialization. Today groups which in the past subsisted on stipends or private wealth—like doctors, academics or lawyers—are now increasingly working as wage laborers.  Marxists call this process [[proletarianization]], and point to it as the major factor in the proletariat being the largest class in current societies in the rich countries of the "first world."&lt;ref&gt;this is the main thesis of Marx's "Capital"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inevitability of socialist revolution==
Marx assumes the inevitability of the revolution of capitalist society into socialist society because of eventual discontent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  The socialization of labor, in the growth of large-scale production, capitalist interest groups and organizations, as well as in the enormous increase in the dimensions and power of finance capital provides the principal material foundation for the unavoidable arrival of socialism. The physical, intellectual and moral perpetrator of this transformation is the proletariat.  The proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie inevitably becomes a political struggle with the goal of political conquest by the proletariat. With the domination of the proletariat, the socialization of production cannot help but lead to the means of production to become the property of society.  The direct consequences of this transformation are a drop in labor productivity, a shorter working day, and the replacement of small-scale unified production by collective and improved labor conditions.  
Capitalism breaks for all time the ties between producer and owner, once held by the bond of class conflict.  Now a new union will be formed based on the conscious application of science and the concentration of collective labor.

He also extended this redistribution to the structure of power in families.  Marx imagined that with [[socialism]] women’s status would increase, leading to the break-up of the patriarchal family...

"Modern industry, by assigning as it does, an important part in the socially organized process of production, outside the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes… Moreover, it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages, must necessarily, under suitable conditions, become a source of human development; although in its spontaneously developed, brutal, capitalistic form, where the laborer exists for the process of production, and not the process of production for the laborer, that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery." (Capital, Vol. I, Chapter 13).

==Objective and subjective factors in class in Marxism==
Marxism has a rather heavily defined dialectic between  [[objective factors]] (i.e., material conditions, the social structure) and [[subjective factors]] (i.e. the conscious organization of class members). While most forms of Marxism analyses people's class based on objective factors (class structure), major Marxist trends have made greater use of subjective factors in understanding the history of the working class. [[E.P. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is a definitive example of this "subjective" Marxist trend. Thompson analyses the English working class as a group of people with shared material conditions coming to a positive self-consciousness of their social position. This feature of social class is commonly termed [[class consciousness]] in Marxism, a concept which became famous with [[Georg Lukács]]' ''History and Class Consciousness'' (1923). It is seen as the process of a "class in itself" moving in the direction of a "class for itself", a collective agent that changes history rather than simply being a victim of the historical process. In Lukács' words, the proletariat was the "[[subject (philosophy)|subject]]&amp;ndash;[[object (philosophy)|object]] of history", and the first class which could separate [[false consciousness]] (inherent to the [[bourgeois]]'s consciousness), which [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]] [[law (principle)|economic laws]] as [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] (whereas they are only a consequence of historic capitalism).&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Thompson, ''The Making of the English Working Class''; Georg Lukács (1923) ''History and Class Consciousness&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2012}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2012}}

==Transnational capitalist class==
Globalization theorists, such as [[William I. Robinson]], [[Leslie Sklair]], [[Kees Van Der Pijl]], and Jerry Harris, argue that today a [[transnational capitalist class]] has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf Transnational Capitalist Class] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816014925/http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf |date=2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Mexican Plateau''', also known as the '''Mexican Altiplano''' ({{lang-es|Altiplanicie Mexicana}}), is a large arid-to-semiarid [[plateau]] that occupies much of northern and central [[Mexico]]. Averaging {{convert|1825|meters|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, it extends from the [[US-Mexico border|United States border]] in the north to the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] in the south, and is bounded by the {{lang|es|[[Sierra Madre Occidental]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|es|[[Sierra Madre Oriental]]|italic=no}} to the west and east, respectively.

A low east-west mountain range in the state of [[Zacatecas]] divides the plateau into northern and southern sections. These two sections, called the Northern Plateau ({{lang|es|Mesa del Norte}}) and Central Plateau ({{lang|es|Mesa Central}}), are now generally regarded by geographers as sections of one plateau.

The Mexican Plateau is mostly covered by [[deserts and xeric shrublands]], with [[madrean pine-oak woodlands|pine-oak forests]] covering the surrounding mountain ranges and forming [[sky island]]s on some of the interior ranges. The Mexican Altiplano is one of six distinct physiographic sections of the [[Basin and Range Province]], which in turn is part of the [[Intermontane Plateaus]] physiographic division.

In [[phytogeography]], the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran [[Floristic province|Floristic Province]] of the [[Madrean Region]] in southwestern [[North America]], part of the [[Holarctic|Holarctic Kingdom]] of the northern [[Western Hemisphere]].

While the plateau stretches from north to south, the southern east-west arc of the Central Mexican Plateau from Jalisco to Veracruz states historically as well as today has served as the population nexus of the Mexican nation, it is home to its biggest metro areas of Guadalajara, Leon, Querétaro, Morelia, Mexico City, Toluca, Cuernavaca, and Puebla.

==Geography==
[[File:Chihuahua Steppe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mesa del Norte is part of the extreme northern part of the Mexican Plateau.]]

The Mesa del Norte or northern plateau averages {{convert|1100|m|ft}} in elevation [[above mean sea level]] and extends south from the [[Rio Grande]] (Río Bravo del Norte) through the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potosí]]. Various narrow, isolated ridges cross the Mesa del Norte and numerous depressions also dot the region, the largest of which is the [[Bolsón de Mapimí]]. The Río Bravo del Norte and its tributary, the [[Río Conchos]], drain portions of the northern plateau, and the [[Pánuco River|Río Pánuco]] and its tributaries drain the southeastern corner. Both drain to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Much of the northern plateau comprises internal drainage basins that do not drain to the sea. The [[Chihuahuan Desert]] extends across the northern portion of the northern plateau, while the [[Meseta Central matorral]] covers the central portion, and the [[Central Mexican matorral]] extends from the southern portion of the northern plateau across the southern plateau.

The Mesa Central or southern plateau is higher than its northern counterpart, averaging {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in elevation. The southern plateau contains numerous valleys originally formed by ancient lakes. It extends across the states of [[Aguascalientes]], [[Jalisco]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Querétaro]], [[Michoacán]]. Several of Mexico's most prominent cities, including [[Guadalajara]], are located in the valleys of the southern plateau. Much of the southern plateau is drained by the [[Río Grande de Santiago]] and its tributaries, including the [[Río Lerma]], which drain west into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Tributaries of the Río Pánuco drain the eastern portion of the southern plateau. The Central Mexican matorral covers much of the southern plateau, with the subtropical [[Bajío dry forests]] occupying the lower portions of the Lerma–Río Grande de Santiago basin. Higher altitudes are covered by [[Mixed Forest]]s, then Temperate [[Coniferous Forest]]s, up to the snow line in the top of the volcanoes that surround the southern and western edges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amatciems July 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Amatciems, a settlement of [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasians]] in [[Drabeši Parish]], [[Latvia]]. Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

[[File:Jerash Nymphaeum.jpg|thumb|The Jerash nymphaeum.]]

A '''''nymphaeum''''' or '''''nymphaion''''' ({{lang-grc|νυμφαῖον}}), in [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], was a [[monument]] consecrated to the [[nymph]]s, especially those of [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]].

These monuments were originally natural [[grotto]]es, which tradition assigned as habitations to the local nymphs. They were sometimes so arranged as to furnish a supply of water, as at Pamphylian [[Side, Turkey|Side]]. A nymphaeum dedicated to a local water nymph, [[Coventina]], was built along [[Hadrian's Wall]], in the northernmost reach of the Roman Empire. Subsequently, artificial grottoes took the place of natural ones.

==Roman period==
The nymphaeum in [[Jerash]], [[Jordan]] (''illustration, right''), was constructed in 191 AD. The fountain was originally embellished with marble facing on the lower level, painted plaster on the upper level, and topped with a half-dome roof, forming a giant [[niche (architecture)|niche]]. Water cascaded through seven carved lion's heads into small basins on the sidewalk.
[[File:Nymphenbad 1.JPG|thumb|The ''Nymphenbad'', the nymphaeum of the [[Zwinger, Dresden|Zwinger]] palace in [[Dresden]]]]
 
The nymphaea of the Roman period, which extended the sacral use to purely recreational ones,&lt;ref&gt;A. R. A. van Aken, "Some Aspects of Nymphaea in Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia" ''Mnemosyne'', Fourth Series, '''4'''.3/4 (1951:272-284), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; were borrowed from the constructions of the [[Hellenistic]] east. The majority of them were [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotundas]], and were adorned with statues and paintings. They served the threefold purpose of sanctuaries, reservoirs and assembly-rooms. A special feature was their use for the celebration of marriages. Such nymphaea existed in [[Corinth]], [[Antioch]] and [[Constantinople]]; the remains of some twenty have been found in Rome and many in [[Africa]]. The so-called exedra of [[Herodes Atticus]] (which corresponds in all respects to a nymphaeum in the Roman style), the nymphaeum in the palace of [[Domitian]] and those in [[Hadrian's Villa]] in [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] (''Tibur'') — five in number — may be specially mentioned.

==Mosaics==
Nymphaea were important in the architectural movement of [[mosaic]] from floor to walls and ceiling vaults in the 1st century.  Initially they were often decorated with geometrical mosaics often incorporating shells, but by the end of the century could contain ambitious figure subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''Mosaics of the Greek and Roman world'', pp. 236-50, Katherine M. D. Dunbabin,  Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-00230-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-00230-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U7Uu_Dq8oY4C&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=Domus+Aurea+mosaic&amp;ei=0pHnSZmABIyENKapuLQB#PPA242,M1 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later periods==
[[File:Issy_seminaire_Saint-Sulpice_nymphee.jpg|thumbnail| Ceiling of the 17th-century nymphaeum of the Saint-Sulpice Seminary in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], France.]]
The term nymphaeum was also applied to the fountains of water in the atrium of the [[Christian]] [[basilica]], which according to [[Eusebius]] were symbols of purification. [[Phiale (building)|Phiale]] is an equivalent Greek term.

A nymphaeum for ''al fresco'' summer dining featuring artificial grottoes with waterflows was designed by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] (1550‑1553), and was reintroduced at the [[Villa Giulia]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;John Coolidge, "The Villa Giulia: A Study of Central Italian Architecture in the Mid-Sixteenth Century" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''25'''.3 (September 1943:177-225).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:rww.jpg]] --&gt;
White was born in [[Ashland, Ohio]], and spent his early life on a small farm outside [[Pioneer, Ohio]]. His summers were spent in [[Rockingham, North Carolina]], his mother's hometown. In the 1960s his family moved to [[Davenport, Iowa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Relentless Randy Wayne White| url=http://fortmyers.floridaweekly.com/news/2010-03-03/Arts_%28and%29_Entertainment_News/THE_RELENTLESS_RANDY_WAYNE_WHITE.html| work=Florida Weekly| date=3 March 2010| last=Williams| first=Evan| accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; where White attended Davenport Central High School and competed in baseball, football, and springboard diving.   After graduating in 1968, he spent time in travel before settling in Southwest Florida in 1972. After "traveling" for five years after high school, White worked for the ''[[Fort Myers News-Press]]'' for four years during which time he obtained a captain's license. He then bought a used charter boat and operated as a light-tackle fishing guide at the Tarpon Bay Marina on [[Sanibel Island]] for thirteen years.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Literary career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2015}}
White began writing novels while working as a fishing guide. He wrote seven novels under the [[pen name]] Randy Striker and eleven novels under the pen name Carl Ramm. After the federal government closed Tarpon Bay to powerboat traffic, he became a full-time adventurer and writer.

White has traveled extensively and participated in a wide variety of adventures, including dog sledding in Alaska, helping to re-establish Little League baseball in Cuba, and ferrying Cuban refugees to safety during the [[Mariel boatlift]].

St. Martin's Press published his first Doc Ford novel, ''Sanibel Flats'' in 1990 with a three-book contract and option for the fourth. Dissatisfied with the money paid for and the scant promotion of his first three books, White signed with [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]] for the fourth book under much more favorable terms and has been with that publisher ever since.

'''Rosie Swale-Pope''', [[MBE]], [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society|FRSGS]]  (born 2 October 1946) is a British author, adventurer and [[marathon]] runner who successfully completed a five-year around-the-world run, raising £250,000 for a charity that supports orphaned children in Russia&lt;ref name="indi" /&gt; and to highlight the importance of early diagnosis of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name="Rosieweb"&gt;{{cite web
   | url=http://www.rosiearoundtheworld.co.uk/
   | title=Rosie's Web Site|accessdate=2009-07-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other achievements include sailing single-handed across the [[Atlantic]] in a small boat, and trekking {{convert|3000|mi|km|-2}} alone through [[Chile]] on horseback.

==Early life==
Rosie Swale-Pope was born as Rosie Griffin in [[Davos]], Switzerland. Her Swiss mother was suffering from [[tuberculosis]], and her Irish father Ronnie Griffin was serving in the [[British Army]], so she was brought up by the wife of the local postman. She was two when her mother died, and she went to live with her paternal grandmother, called Carlie, who was bedridden with [[osteoarthritis]], in [[Askeaton]] in [[County Limerick]], Ireland.

When she was five, her father remarried and moved to Ireland, with his French wife Marriane. They had four children, Maude, Greald, Nicholas and Ronnie. Although they were only in the next cottage, Rosie stayed with her grandmother&lt;ref name="Justalittlerun" /&gt; and looked after four orphaned donkeys, seven goats, and a pet cow called Cleopatra.&lt;ref name="Mysport" /&gt; Rosie learnt to ride, often going out on her black horse ''Columbine'' all day exploring the countryside.&lt;ref name="Return" /&gt;

Her grandmother was very religious and worried that the local school would be a bad influence, so Rosie was schooled at home. Although her coursework mostly consisted of simply writing about what she had done each day, it proved to be useful training for her later writing about her travels and adventures.

Her father died in 1957, and when she was thirteen, Rosie was sent to a strict boarding school for girls in [[Cork (city)|Cork]].&lt;ref name="Justalittlerun" /&gt;

At 18 her first job was as a [[news reporter|reporter]] for a regional newspaper, the ''Surrey Advertiser''.&lt;ref name="wwales"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It didn't last long however, and she hitch-hiked to [[Delhi]], [[Nepal]] and Russia, with almost no money or luggage.&lt;ref name="Darling"&gt;{{cite book
   | last=Swale | first=Rosie | title=Rosie Darling
   | publisher=Pan Books Ltd | year=1974
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosie was married to Colin Swale in her early twenties.&lt;ref name="Mail Online"&gt;{{cite web
   | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1185191/The-woman-ran-world-The-inspirational-story-widow-conquered-grief-jogging-round-globe.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originally lived in a small flat in London, but when their daughter Eve was born, they bought a [[catamaran]] (named the ''Anneliese'' in memory of Rosie's sister she only knew from a photo) and sailed to Italy, where Rosie's son James was born on board the boat.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt;

==Sailing round the world==
[[File:Gibraltar.jpg|right|thumb|Gibraltar, where the voyage began.]]
Beginning in December 1971, Rosie sailed around the world from [[Gibraltar]] via Australia, with her first husband, Colin Swale and daughter Eve on their {{convert|30|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[catamaran]], the ''Anneliese''. The trip was part sponsored by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper and also by [[ITN|Independent Television News (ITN)]] who provided them with a camera to record their own news reports of the journey.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt; They sailed {{convert|30000|mi|km|-2}} across the Atlantic, through the [[Panama Canal]] and across the Pacific, stopping at the [[Galapagos Islands]], the [[Marquesas]], [[Tahiti]] and [[Tonga]], before reaching Australia in 1973.  They were the first catamaran to round [[Cape Horn]].&lt;ref name="Timesonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1164630.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0|title=Rose sets off on a 20,000-mile global run|last=Gornall |first=Jonathan|date=30 September 2003|work=Tomes Online|accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although both Swale and her husband were able to sail and had prepared as well as they could, the trip had its risks, and it nearly ended in disaster 3 times: when Rosie fell overboard in the [[Caribbean]] {{convert|900|mi|km|-1}} from the closest land; again when she needed emergency medical treatment in hospital; and a third time when the whole family suffered [[arsenic poisoning]] from a meal of unsoaked beans. The hardships were survived, however, and the voyage was a significant navigational achievement, using only an old [[Spitfire]] [[compass]], nautical charts and a [[sextant]], in the days before [[GPS]].  By the time the family finally returned to [[Plymouth]], Rosie had not only completed her first book, ''Rosie Darling'' (often working below decks on her typewriter for up to six hours at a time), but had also written her second book, ''Children of Cape Horn''.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite book

==Atlantic Crossing==
In 1983, Rosie Swale sailed solo across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in a small {{convert|17|ft|m|1|adj=on}} cutter, which she had found in a [[cowshed]] in Wales and named ''Fiesta Girl''. Aiming to be the fourth woman to sail alone to America in a small boat from England (the first being [[Ann Davison]] in 1952–1953, followed by [[Nicolette Milnes-Walker]] in 1972 and [[Clare Francis]] in 1973), she also wanted to raise funds for a [[Computed tomography|CAT Scanner]] for the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{cite web
   | url=http://www.campevans.org/articles/280-philip-b-petersen-collection-rosie-swale-pope
   | title=Lady Mariner|author=Philip Petersen|accessdate=2009-07-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorced from Colin Swale, Rosie also found her second husband, sailor and photographer Clive Pope, during the preparations for the trip, when he rigged the boat for her.&lt;ref name="Timesonline" /&gt;

Departing from [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]] in Wales on 13 July 1983, she sailed to the [[Azores]] and [[Caribbean Islands]].&lt;ref name="LM" /&gt; Simply equipped, Rosie navigated by the stars and was nearly run down by an [[oil tanker]].&lt;ref name="Mysport" /&gt; When she was {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} north of [[Puerto Rico]], she was becalmed for so long she was without food and water for five days and nearly drowned when she was swept overboard in storms.  She arrived at [[Staten Island]], New York, after completing her record-breaking {{convert|4800|mi|km|-1}} in 70 days – navigating by the stars with the aid of her Timex watch.&lt;ref name="LM" /&gt;

==Chile on horseback==
[[File:CapeHorn.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cape Horn]], in Chile, at the southern tip of South America.]]
A year after returning from her Atlantic crossing, Rosie decided that she really wanted to see [[Cape Horn]] again and decided to plan a trek {{convert|3000|mi|km|-1}} through [[Chile]] on horseback. The journey took her from the northern port of [[Antofagasta]] to [[Cape Horn]], and she rode two Chilean [[Aculeos]] horses named 'Hornero' and 'Jolgorio'.&lt;ref name="Chile"&gt;{{cite web
   | url=http://www.thelongridersguild.com/Timeline-80s.htm
   | title=Long Rider's Guild | accessdate=2009-07-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Los Lingues|Hacienda Los Lingues]], the horses of the Aculeo Stables were originally brought to Chile by the Spanish [[Conquistadors]] in 1492.&lt;ref name="Aculeo"&gt;{{cite web
   | url= http://www.hiddentrails.com/general/breeds/aculeo_creole_horse.htm
   | title=Aculeo Creole Horse | accessdate=2009-07-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving Antofagasta on 22 July 1984, Rosie had secured the protection of [[César Mendoza|General César Mendoza]], who was the head of Chile's Military Police (and later the leader of the military [[Military junta|Junta]] there). An Olympic horseman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1952/EQU/mens-jumping-individual.html|title=Equestrianism at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Games|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendoza provided her with an armed escort for the first stage. The whole trip was planned to take four months but actually took fourteen.&lt;ref name="Timesonline" /&gt; In the first week of her journey, Rosie was caught in a desert sand storm which scattered the horses and all her equipment. Later she fell from one of the horses and broke two ribs. She also faced starvation when she became lost in the southern rain forests and ran out of food. Delayed by bad weather, Rosie arrived at [[Cape Horn]] on 2 September 1985, a total of 409 days after she had set out. Rosie wrote of her experiences in Chile in her book ''Back to Cape Horn'' in 1986.&lt;ref name="Return"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walks, runs and marathons==

===Walk around Wales===
On 25 September 1987, Rosie set off from the beach near her home in [[Tenby]] to walk around [[Wales]] in winter.  She was carrying everything she needed, including a small tent to sleep in, and was supported by her husband Clive, who also walked with her when other commitments permitted. Rosie completed {{convert|1375|mi|km|0}} on foot and wrote about her experiences in her book ''Winter Wales''.&lt;ref name="wwales" /&gt;

===London Marathon===
In 1995 Rosie ran her first [[London Marathon]] in a time of six hours and described it as her most memorable sporting moment.&lt;ref name="Mysport" /&gt;

===Sahara run===
[[File:MDS2.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Racers at a large ridge in the [[Marathon des Sables]].]]

In 1997 Rosie ran {{convert|243|km|mi|abbr=on}} across the [[Sahara desert]] in the [[Sahara marathon]]. Described as 'the toughest footrace on earth', the '[[Marathon des Sables]]' is run over six days and is the equivalent of five and a half normal marathons.&lt;ref name="Sables"&gt;{{cite web
   | url=http://www.saharamarathon.co.uk/about.html
   | title=The Marathon Des Sables | accessdate=2009-07-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all the other competitors, Rosie had to carry everything she needed on her back in a rucksack.  She ran across the Sahara a second time in 2000.&lt;ref name="Mysport"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania run===
In 1997 Rosie ran through [[Romania]] to the Hungarian border.&lt;ref name="Mysport" /&gt;

===Iceland run===
In 1999 Rosie ran {{convert|1000|mi|km|-1}} solo across [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="Mysport" /&gt; The run took her from the [[Arctic Circle]] to the capital, [[Reykjavík]].&lt;ref name="Cuba" /&gt;

===South Africa Ultramarathons===
To mark the millennium, Rosie Swale achieved a long-standing ambition and successfully completed the challenging '[[Comrades Marathon]]', one of the world's oldest and largest [[ultramarathon]]s, run over a distance of approximately {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} between the capital of the [[Kwazulu-Natal Province]] of South Africa, [[Pietermaritzburg]], and the coastal city of [[Durban]]. The direction of the race alternates each year between the up run starting from [[Durban]] and the down run starting from [[Pietermaritzburg]]. Equivalent to running two marathons, Rosie Swale Pope completed it in 11 hours 1 minute 1 second.&lt;ref name="Mysport" /&gt; She was awarded a bronze medal for completing the race, which has been described as the roadrunner's equivalent to climbing [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.normanphillips.co.uk/rosie_swale_pope_bio.htm |title=Aventurers and Explorers – Rosie Swale |accessdate=2009-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821092428/http://www.normanphillips.co.uk/rosie_swale_pope_bio.htm |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania run===
In 2000 Rosie ran through the [[Balkans]] from [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].  It was a dangerous run, and she was held up at gunpoint but managed to escape to reach the border.&lt;ref name="Mysport" /&gt; She flew into [[Skopje]] on 11 April 2001 and ran across the then-closed border into [[Kosovo]], then across a closed border through [[Montenegro]], where she ran for twenty-four hours, through deserted villages and deep snow until she reached northern [[Albania]].&lt;ref name="Balkans"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba run===
On 8 November 2001, Rosie set off to run {{convert|1360|mi|km|-1}} across [[Cuba]].  It took 46 days and she was running the marathon distance every day (and several nights) with a {{convert|12|kg|lb|0}} rucksack on her back and camping in a lightweight [[Bivouac sack|bivouac]].  She lived on rice and sugar cane and had to avoid the Cuban Police, who were concerned for her safety. She also entered and completed the [[Havana]] Marathon, finishing in 4 hours and 52 minutes.&lt;ref name="Mysport" /&gt; Crossing from West to East, and running alone to raise money for the charity [[Age Concern]], the straight-line distance was {{convert|750|mi|km|-1}}, but Rosie covered over {{convert|1000|mi|km|-1}}, camping by the side of the road and in the jungle. The run took almost seven weeks. She reached the [[Punta de Maisi]] lighthouse, her finish point, on Christmas Day 2001.&lt;ref name="Cuba"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff Marathon===
[[File:Rosie2.jpg|thumb|right|Rosie completing [[Cardiff Marathon]] in 2002.]]
Rosie ran the [[Cardiff Marathon|Marathon in Cardiff]] in 2002, in aid of her local Hospital in West Wales where her husband Clive had died of [[prostate cancer]] ten weeks before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
   | title=Rosie's marathon is £1000 pledge | date=29 August 2002
   | work=The Western Mail
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finished in a time of 4.15.35 (h.m.s), despite a nasty fall six miles (9.7&amp;nbsp;km) from the finishing line, and received the award for the fastest 55-year-old competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rosie's on the run for hospital ward|date=30 October 2202|work=Western Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepal run===
In April 2003 Rosie ran across [[Nepal]] to raise money for the Nepal Trust, a small charity which carries out development work in the remote rural areas of North-West Nepal in a region referred to as the 'Hidden Himalayas'. The journey from one end of Nepal to the other was {{convert|1700|km|mi|-1}} and established a new world-record time of 68 days.  Rosie also raised over US$8000 which was used to help sponsor a health camp at the district headquarters of [[Simikot]], [[Humla]].&lt;ref name="nepal"&gt;{{cite web
   | url=http://www.nepaltrust.org/index.php?page=77
   | title=Nepal Trust |accessdate=2009-07-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Running around the world===
When her second husband, Clive, 73, died of prostate cancer in 2002, Rosie decided to run around the world to raise money for the [[Prostate Cancer]] Charity and an orphanage in [[Kitezh]], Russia which provides children with education and care.&lt;ref name="Justalittlerun"&gt;{{cite book
   | last=Swale-Pope | first=Rosie | publisher=HarperTrue
   | title=Just a Little Run Around the World
   | date=28 May 2009 | pages=324 |isbn=0007306202
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her aim was to run around the northern hemisphere taking in as much land mass as possible, with no support crew and just minimal supplies and sponsorship. Rosie started from her home town of [[Tenby]] in Wales on her 57th birthday, 2 October 2003, where her first footfall is engraved in a flagstone on her front step. Equipped with just a small specially designed cart of food and basic camping equipment, the trip was funded by renting out her cottage. By 5 April 2004, she reached Moscow, Russia, and on 15 September 2005, she reached [[Magadan]] in far eastern Russia. After facing extreme conditions in the [[Alaska]]n Winter, she reached the road again on 17 April 2006, and in October 2006, she was in [[Edmonton]], Canada. Four years after the departure, on 2 October 2007, she reached New York City, US.&lt;ref name="Justalittlerun" /&gt;

She ran harnessed to her cart, which was designed for sleeping, shelter and storage. Her son James maintained a website that was followed closely by her supporters and provided regular updates and messages about her progress. Her supporter Geoff Hall organised supplies and equipment to reach her around the world. In the [[Faroes]], she took part in an organised midnight hike to take in the scenery. She also gave cultural talks while on the road, and described how she met a naked man with a gun, how Siberian wolves ran with her for a week, and taking a break to run the [[Chicago marathon]] along the way.&lt;ref name="Justalittlerun" /&gt;

Surviving on minimal rations, Rosie fell ill near [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia, possibly from a [[tick]] bite, and wandered into the path of a bus. She was knocked unconscious and taken in the bus to hospital.  In [[Alaska]], she had to cope with temperatures of {{convert|-60|F|C|1}} and nearly froze in her sleeping bag at night. She was stuck in a [[blizzard]] by the [[Yukon River]] and got severe frostbite of her foot. She had no alternative but to call friends in [[Wales]] for help, who then called the Alaskan National Guard, who helped her get the frostbite treated, so she could continue on her run.&lt;ref name="Mail Online" /&gt;

She left Canada by air from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]] (Newfoundland) on 24 January 2008, to make a short visit to [[Greenland]] before flying to [[Iceland]] on 9 February 2008, and continued running to eastern Iceland. While running, she slipped on the ice, breaking several ribs and cracking her hip. She was over a hundred miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) from the nearest house from where she fell and had to walk two miles (3.2&amp;nbsp;km), with her injuries, before she was found and got medical attention.&lt;ref name="Timesonline" /&gt;

On 18 June 2008, she arrived at [[Scrabster]], in [[Scotland]]'s far north, by ferry from Iceland, and ran from Scrabster back home to Tenby. Rosie successfully completed the journey, and despite stress fractures in both legs, which turned the final few miles back to Tenby into a hobble on crutches, she returned to her home on 25 August 2008, at 14:18 local time. A large crowd of Tenby residents and Bank Holiday visitors turned out to witness her return and welcome her home.&lt;ref name="Justalittlerun" /&gt; Her distance travelled was {{convert|32000|km|mi|-2}}.&lt;ref&gt;

   [http://www.worldrecordsacademy.org/travel/longest_journey_around_the_world-world_record_set_by_Rosie_Swale_Pope_80263.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Swale wrote a book about her experiences entitled ''"Just a Little Run Around the World: 5 Years, 3 Packs of Wolves and 53 Pairs of Shoes"'', which was released on 28 May 2009.&lt;ref name="Justalittlerun" /&gt;

The British progressive rock band [[Big Big Train]]'s song The Passing Widow (from the 2017 album [[The Second Brightest Star (Big Big Train album)|The Second Brightest Star]]) was written about Swale's round-the-world run.

===Chicago Marathon===
While running around the world, she took a break from it during a week after having reached Edmonton, Canada. She took part in the 2006 Chicago Marathon, to which she was invited in order to support charity work. The marathon race took 4:40. After the race, she flew back to Edmonton and continued running around the world.

===Ireland Run===
In September 2009, Rosie Swale Pope ran {{convert|236|mi|km|0}} along the east coast of Ireland, from [[Rosslare Harbour|Rosslare]] to the [[Giant's Causeway]], pulling her cart which she named 'Icebird' to highlight the importance of cancer awareness.&lt;ref name="Rosieweb" /&gt; She completed the run on her birthday, 2 October 2009 and the anniversary of setting out on her round-the-world run in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''scolecodont''' is the jaw of a [[Polychaeta|polychaete]] [[Annelida|annelid]], a common type of [[fossil]]-producing [[segmented worm]] useful in [[invertebrate paleontology]]. Scolecodonts are common and diverse [[microfossil]]s, which range from the [[Cambrian]] period (around half a billion years ago at the start of the [[Paleozoic]] era) to the [[Holocene|present]]. They diversified profusely in the Ordovician,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hints | first1 = O.| last2 = Eriksson | first2 = M.| title = Diversification and biogeography of scolecodont-bearing polychaetes in the Ordovician| journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume = 245| pages = 95| year = 2007| doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2006.02.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are most common in the [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] deposits of the [[Paleozoic]] era.

Relatedly, more problematic [[worm]]-like [[fossil]]s have been described in even older, [[Neoproterozoic]] era deposits in the [[Ediacaran]] Hills of southern Australia and in mid-[[Cambrian]] deposits of [[Burgess shale]] in British Columbia.

Since the other classes of annelids (specifically, the [[earthworm]]s and [[leech]]es) lack hard parts, only the sea-dwelling polychaetes are frequently represented in the [[fossil record]].  Polychaetes are commonly [[fossilization|fossilized]] due to their [[chitin]]ous teeth and their dwelling tubes made of durable [[calcite]] (a [[calcium carbonate]]), hardened [[mucus]] (a.k.a. parchment), and/or [[chitin]]-like cement.

==Taxonomy==

Scolecodonts belonging to the [[extinct]] families Atraktoprionidae, Hadoprionidae, Kalloprionidae, Mochtyellidae, Paulinitidae, Polychaetaspidae, Ramphoprionidae, Rhytiprionidae, Skalenoprionidae, Symmetroprionidae, Xanioprionidae, and the still-[[Extant taxon|extant]] (living) family Oenonidae (which includes the Arabellidae) are known from [[Silurian]] rocks in Scotland. Scolecodonts representing the present-day families Onuphidae and Dorvilleidae first appeared in [[Mesozoic]] era deposits.

==History==

Segments of the fossil jaw of a polychaete worm were first reported from Silurian strata on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]] in 1854,&lt;ref&gt;EICHWALD, E. 1854. Die Grauwackenschichten von Lieu-und Esthland. Bulletin de la Societe Imperiale des Naturalistes de Moscou, 27, 1-111.&lt;/ref&gt; but they were misinterpreted as fish teeth. A year later, impressions of whole polychaete worms with poorly preserved jaws were described from Italian Tertiary deposits.&lt;ref&gt;MASSALONGO, A. 1855. Monografica delle Nereidi fossili del Monte Bolca. Antonelli, Verona, 55 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently E. Ehlers, a specialist on recent polychaetes, recorded them from the Jurassic Solenhofen Stone of Bavaria, Germany, demonstrating their affinity and proposing the generic names ''Eunicites'' and ''Lumbriconereites''.&lt;ref&gt;EHLERS, E. 1868a. 12Iber eine fossile Funicee aus Solenhofen (Eunicites aritus), nebst Bemerkungenvtiber fossile Wtirmer tiberhaupt. Zeitschrifl ftir wissenschaftliche Zoologie, 18, 421-443.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EHLERS, E. 1868b. Ueber fossiler Würmer aus dem lithographischen Schiefer in Bayern. Palaeontographica, 17, 145-175.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive studies in the late 19th century by [[George J. Hinde]] of material from England, Wales, Canada and Sweden&lt;ref&gt;HINDE, G. J. 1879. On annelid jaws from the Cambro-Silurian, Silurian and Devonian Formations in Canada and from the Lower Carboniferous in Scotland. Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, 35, 370-389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HINDE, G. J. 1880. On annelid jaws from the Wenlock and Ludlow Formations of the west of England. Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, 36, 368-378.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HINDE, G. J. 1882. On annelid remains from the Silurian strata of the Isle of Gotland. Geologiska Föreningen i Stockholm Förhandlingar, 6(6): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HINDE, G. J. 1896. On the jaw-apparatus of an annelid (''Eunicites reidiae sp. nov.'') from the Lower Carboniferous of Halkin Mountain, Flintshire. Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, 52, 438-450.&lt;/ref&gt; established a basis for the nomenclature of what he regarded as isolated components of annelid jaws; but study of them lapsed thereafter for almost 50 years.

'''''Valdiviathyris''''' is a genus of [[Craniata (brachiopods)|craniate]] [[brachiopod]]s that has changed little since the [[Silurian]], from when [[fossil]]s are known.&lt;ref name="HPB"&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Lars E.|last1= Holmer|first2= Leonid|last2= Popov|first3= Michael G.|last3= Bassett|year= 2013|title= Silurian Craniide brachiopods from Gotland|journal= Palaeontology|volume= 56|issue= 5|pages= 1029–1044|url= https://www.academia.edu/4625326/SILURIAN_CRANIIDE_BRACHIOPODS_FROM_GOTLAND}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extant species ''V. quenstedti'' is known from the late Eocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey H.

This has an irregular conical shape, with the tip (or apex) not coinciding with the middle, and is on the outside only adorned by growth lines. On the inside it has pits (or punctae) that branch into four or five canals further to the outside. More recent specimens have been found near New Zealand. As long as no fossils of ''Vadiviathyris'' are found dating between the Silurian and the Eocene, this genus can be regarded a [[Lazarus taxon]].&lt;ref name="HPB"/&gt;

A '''volcano-sedimentary sequence''' is a [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] [[Sequence (geology)|sequence]] derived from the alternation and combination of [[Volcanism|volcanic]] and [[Sedimentary rocks|sedimentary]] events. The volcanic material of these sequences may include [[lava flow]]s and [[tephra]] or reworked volcanic material, for example [[basalt]]ic sand or pebbles.    

Areas surrounding [[volcanic arc]]s are common settings for volcano-sedimentary sequences. Edvard G Svendsen is a famous Norwegian geologist who first discovered these sequences in the deepest depths of Portswood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2244">'''Classification of wetlands''' has been a problematical task, with the commonly accepted definition of what constitutes a [[wetland]] being among the major difficulties. A number of national wetland classifications exist. In the 1970s, the [[Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance]] introduced a first attempt to establish an internationally acceptable wetland classification scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/u8369p6443506u73 " Classification and inventory of wetlands: A global overview"], D. A. Scott and T. A. Jones, ''[[Plant Ecology]],'' Volume 118, Numbers 1-2, 1995, pp. 3-16, {{doi|10.1007/BF00045186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ramsar classification==
{{main|Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Type}}
The Ramsar classification of wetland types is intended as a means for fast identification of the main types of wetlands for the purposes of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/ris/key_ris_e.htm#type "Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Type"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wetlands are classified into three major classes:

*Marine/coastal wetlands
*Inland wetlands
*Human-made wetlands

These are further subdivided by the type of water: [[fresh water|fresh]] / [[saline water|saline]] / [[brackish water|brackish]] / [[alkaline]]; and may be further classified  by the substrate type of other characteristics.
==National systems of classification==
===Australia===
Wetlands in [[Australia]] that considered to be of national importance are so classified by criteria published in association with the [[Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia]] (DIWA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/water/wetlands/australian-wetlands-database/directory-important-wetlands|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===United States===
[[Wetlands of the United States]] are classified according to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]'s [[National Wetlands Inventory]] (NWI).&lt;ref&gt;http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/NWI/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Five years before ''The Communist Manifesto'', this phrase appeared in the 1843 book ''The Workers' Union'' by [[Flora Tristan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Flora Tristan: Forgotten Feminist and Socialist |author=Marie M. Collins and Sylvie Weil-Sayre |journal=Nineteenth-Century French Studies |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1973 |pages=229–234 |jstor=23535978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Workingmen's Association]], described by Engels as "the first international movement of the working class" was persuaded by Engels to change its motto from the [[League of the Just]]'s "all men are brothers" to "working men of all countries, unite!".&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Pradella in 'The Elgar Companion to Marxist Economics.' Edited by Ben fine and Alfredo Saad-Filho, 2012, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflected Marx's and Engels' view of [[proletarian internationalism]].

The phrase has overlapping meanings: first, that workers should unite in unions to better push for their demands such as workplace pay and conditions;&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:workers of the world, unite|Wiktionary, entry for "Workers of the World"]]&lt;/ref&gt; secondly, that workers should see beyond their various craft unions and unite against the capitalist system;&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], ''The Communist Manifesto'', 1848. [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/]&lt;/ref&gt; and thirdly, that workers of different countries have more in common with each other than workers and employers of the same country.

The phrase was used by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in their publications and songs&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Grim Feinberg, "The Gifts of the IWW," ''Against the Current'' 117, July–August 2005. [http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melvyn Dubofsky 1969"&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, ''We Shall Be All'', Quadrangle Books, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a mainstay on banners in [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] demonstrations. The IWW used it when opposing [[World War I]] in both the United States&lt;ref name="Melvyn Dubofsky 1969"/&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Armstrong, "The Industrial Workers of the World," ''Socialist Alternative'', June 2005. [http://www.sa.org.au/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=5592:the-industrial-workers-of-the-world&amp;Itemid=412]&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan was the [[Soviet Union]]'s state [[motto]] (Пролетарии всех стран, соединяйтесь!; ''Proletarii vsekh stran, soyedinyaytes'!'') and it appeared in the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union]], on 1919 [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] banknotes (in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian and Russian), on Soviet coins from 1921 to 1934 and in most Soviet newspapers. The nascent Soviet Union under [[Vladimir Lenin]] was oriented toward [[World communism|international communism]].

Contemporarily, some socialist and communist parties{{Who|date=May 2012}} continue using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thurston|first1=Robert W.|last2=Bonwetsch|first2=Bernd|title=The People's War: Responses to World War II in the Soviet Union|date=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252026003|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qHiCuLQx168C&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is a common usage in popular culture, often chanted during labor strikes and protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialistworld.net/eng/2008/05/06kashma.html |title=May Day celebrated on both sides of Line of Control |date=6 May 2008 |publisher=socialistworld.net |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
[[File:Karl Marx Grave.jpg|thumb|The [[tomb of Karl Marx]] at [[Highgate Cemetery]] bearing the slogan "Workers of All Lands Unite"]]
In the first [[Swedish language|Swedish]] translation of ''The Communist Manifesto'', published in 1848, the translator [[Pehr Götrek]] substituted the slogan ''Folkets röst, Guds röst!'' (i.e. ''[[Vox populi|Vox populi, vox Dei]]'', or "The Voice of the People, the Voice of God"). However, later translations have included the original slogan.

Amongst [[Marxism-Leninism-Maoism|Maoist]]-oriented groups a variation invented by [[Vladimir Lenin]], "Workers and Oppressed Peoples and Nations of the World, Unite!", is sometimes used. This slogan was the rallying cry of the 2nd [[Comintern]] congress in 1920 and denoted the [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] and anti-[[Colonialism|colonialist]] agenda of the Comintern.

[[File:The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg|thumb|''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a photograph of the planet Earth made on December 7, 1972 by the crew of the [[Apollo 17]] spacecraft.]]
[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016.svg|thumb|A [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] [[world map]] of shorelines and national borders under the [[Robinson projection]]]]

The '''world''' is the planet [[Earth]] and all [[life]] upon it, including [[human civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world Merriam-webster.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423111522/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world |date=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a philosophical context, the "world" is the whole of the physical [[Universe]], or an [[ontology|ontological]] world (the "world" of an [[individual]]). In a theological context, the ''world'' is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. "[[Eschatology|End of the world]]" scenarios refer to the end of human history, often in religious contexts.

The [[history of the world]] is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] to the present. In terms such as [[world religion]], [[world language]], [[world government]], and [[world war]], the term ''world'' suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.

The [[world population]] is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, the [[world economy]] is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of [[globalization]]. Terms such as "[[world championship]]", "[[gross world product]]", and "[[world flags]]" imply the sum or combination of all [[sovereign state]]s.

==Etymology and usage==
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)'', a compound of ''[[were|wer]]'' "man" and ''eld'' "age," which thus means roughly "Age of Man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html ''American Heritage Dictionary'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075921/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old English is a reflex of the [[Common Germanic]] ''*wira-alđiz'', also reflected in [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old Dutch]] ''werilt'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verǫld'' (whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:en:veröld|veröld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' Leiden: Brill. pg. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corresponding word in [[Latin]] is ''mundus'', literally "clean, elegant", itself a loan translation of Greek ''[[cosmos]]'' "orderly arrangement." While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare [[Midgard]]), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the [[chthonic]] sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of [[creation myth|creation]] as an act of establishing order out of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

"World" distinguishes the entire [[planet]] or [[population]] from any particular [[country]] or [[region]]: ''world affairs'' pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and ''[[world history]]'' is a field of [[history]] that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. ''Earth'', on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.

"World" was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: "The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R|last=Record|year=1556|title=Castle of Knowledge}} cited in {{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|at=World, sense 8|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230262?rskey=BRZMwD|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earth was often described as "the center of the world".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book|author=Sacrobosco|title=Treatise on the Sphere|year=1230|at=trans by Lynn Thorndike, 1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519151919/http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|archivedate=2013-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used attributively, to mean "global", or "relating to the whole world", forming usages such as [[world community]] or world canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawpark.jimdo.com''World Canonical Texts'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a ''world'' may refer to any planet or [[heavenly body]], especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of [[science fiction]] or [[futurology]].

''World'', in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of [[human]] [[experience]].

* The ''world of work'' describes paid work and the pursuit of a [[career]], in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and [[academia|academic]] study.
* The ''fashion world'' describes the environment of the designers, [[fashion house]]s and [[consumer]]s that make up the [[fashion industry]].
* historically, the ''[[New World]]'' vs. the ''[[Old World]]'', referring to the parts of the world colonized in the wake of the [[age of discovery]]. Now mostly used in zoology and botany, as in [[New World monkey]].

==Philosophy==
[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' triptych by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] ({{Circa|1503}}) shows the "garden" of mundane pleasures flanked by [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]]. 

The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a [[flat earth|disc]] enclosed in a [[firmament|sphere]].]]

In philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up [[reality]] or the physical [[universe]]. In others, it can mean have a specific [[ontology|ontological]] sense (see [[world disclosure]]). While clarifying the [[concept]] of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of [[Western philosophy]], this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heidegger |first=Martin |title=Basic Problems of Phenomenology |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1982 |page=165 |isbn=0-253-17686-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.

===Parmenides===
The traditional interpretation of [[Parmenides]]' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in ''[[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.

===Plato===
In his [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Plato]] distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.

===Hegel===
In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]], the expression ''Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht'' (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.

===Schopenhauer===
''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].
Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.

===Wittgenstein===
Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. "The world is everything that is the case," wrote [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his influential ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', first published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=3 December 2017|first1=Anat|first2=Anat|last1=Biletzki|last2=Matar|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition would serve as the basis of [[logical positivism]], with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.

===Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]], meanwhile, argued that "the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1982), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already "thrown" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of "[[world disclosure]]" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work ''[[Being and Time]]''.

===Freud===
In response, [[Sigmund Freud]] proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.

===Other===
Some philosophers, often inspired by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing ''the'' world to a range of [[possible world]]s; a view commonly known as [[modal realism]].

==Religion and mythology==

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Yggdrasil]], a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse [[world tree]] which connects the [[heaven]]s, the world, and the [[underworld]].]]
[[Mythological cosmology|Mythological cosmologies]] often depict the world as centered on an ''[[axis mundi]]'' and delimited by a boundary such as a [[Oceanus|world ocean]], a [[Jörmungandr|world serpent]] or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality{{citation needed|date=October 2018}})&lt;ref&gt;Hemer, C. J. “Worldly.” Edited by Geoffrey W. Bromiley. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised. Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979–1988.&lt;/ref&gt; is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.

===Buddhism===

In [[Buddhism]], the world means society, as distinct from the [[monastery]]. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.

===Christianity===

In [[Christianity]], the term often connotes the concept of the [[fall of man|fallen]] and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the [[World to Come]]. The world is frequently cited alongside ''the [[flesh (theology)|flesh]]'' and ''the [[Devil]]'' as a source of [[temptation]] that Christians should flee. [[Monk]]s speak of striving to be "''in'' this world, but not ''of'' this world"—as [[Jesus]] said—and the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "monkhood", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.

This view is clearly expressed by king [[Alfred the Great]] of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the ''[[Cura Pastoralis]]'':
{{quote|"Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs ''([[Old English]]: woruldðinga)'' as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices."}}

Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning "world" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of [[Jesus]] according to the [[Gospel of John]], e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. For contrast, a relatively newer concept is [[Catholic imagination]].

''[[Contemptus mundi]]'' is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140237/http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been criticized as a "pastoral of fear" by modern historian [[Jean Delumeau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605035017/http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', ''[[Unitatis redintegratio]]'' and ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.

====Eastern Christianity====

In Eastern Christian monasticism or [[asceticism]], the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called "the world". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the [[Philokalia]] and the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] (the works of Evagrius and [[John Climacus]] are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is [[hesychasm]] which culminates into the [[theoria|Vision of God]].

====Orbis Catholicus====

''Orbis Catholicus'' is a Latin phrase meaning ''Catholic world'', per the expression [[Urbi et Orbi]], and refers to that area of [[Christendom]] under [[papal supremacy]]. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and [[Islamic world]].

===Islam===
{{Main|Dunya}}
''Dunya'' derives from the root word "dana" that means to bring near. In that sense, "dunya" is "what is brought near".&lt;ref&gt;Attas, Islam and Secularism, p.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Hinduism===
'''Hinduism''' is an [[Indian religion]] and ''[[dharma]]'', or a way of life,{{refn|group=note|name="definition"}} widely practised in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It includes a number of Indian religious traditions with a loose sense of interconnection, as different from Jainism and Buddhism, and (since medieaval and modern times) Islam and Christianity. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,{{refn|group=note|See:
