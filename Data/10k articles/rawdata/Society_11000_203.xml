The '''1911 Australian census''' was the first [[Census in Australia|national population census]] held in Australia. The day used for the census, was taken for the night between the 2 and 3 April 1911. The total population of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] was counted as 4,455,005 - an increase of 681,204 people, 18.05% since the 1901 "[[Federation of Australia|Federation]]" Census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2112.01911?OpenDocument Census of the Commonwealth of Australia, 1911], Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|(Excluding the Dwellings occupied solely by Full-blooded Aboriginals).}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/2DB1C328DD893466CA257839001412DE/$File/1911%20Census%20-%20Volume%20III%20-%20Part%20XIV%20Summary.pdf Census of The Commonwealth Of Australia, 1911.] PART XIV.-SUMMARY TABLES&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census Volumes II and III were published on 30 September 1914. At that time it was intended to issue
shortly thereafter Volume 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/A81792B5E5298F70CA25783900108ACB/$File/1911%20Census%20-%20Volume%20I%20Statisticians%20Report.pdf VOLUME I.] STATISTICIAN'S REPORT INCLUDING APPENDICES]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection method==
The first [[Australian Statistician|Commonwealth Statistician]] was [[George Handley Knibbs]]. He began his career as a licensed surveyor in government service. On Monday 3 April 1911, census collectors set out all over Australia under mostly clear skies to begin gathering in Australia's first national census forms. 
They covered suburbs to rural towns and the [[outback]]. They travelled by bike or [[horse]] where they had the transport that was needed to cover large areas, however, most travelled by foot. Some in [[Northern Queensland]] had to find their way through a flooded landscape while others in South Australia had difficulties finding water and [[fodder]] for their horses due to droughts. They had distributed the forms prior to the census day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/2071.0Feature%20Article1July%202011?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=2071.0&amp;issue=July%202011&amp;num=&amp;view= Reflecting a Nation:] - Stories from the 1911 - 2011 Census, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rialto Towers in Melbourne.jpg|thumb|175px|right|''The Rialto'' building, 497-503 [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], where G. H. Knibbs and his staff worked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/2071.0Feature%20Article1July%202011?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=2071.0&amp;issue=July%202011&amp;num=&amp;view= Reflecting a Nation:] Stories from the 2011 Census, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There was a permanent staff of the ‘Bureau of Census and Statistics’ which consisted of the [[Statistician]] (Knibbs) and many [[wikt:assistant|assistant]]s, some young men working as [[clerks]] as well as a couple of messenger boys. A female [[wikt:typist|typist]] had joined soon after. They worked in the old Rialto Building in [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/2071.0Feature%20Article1July%202011?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=2071.0&amp;issue=July%202011&amp;num=&amp;view= Reflecting a Nation:] - Stories from the 1911 - 2011 Census, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectors had to supply their own transport and cover any associated costs such as fodder and petrol. They were paid according to their method of transport. Collectors [[Walking|on foot]] were paid ten shilling a day, those on bicycle fifteens shillings a day and those on horse 20 [[Australian pound|shillings]] a day. Police were  used in the days immediately following the census to get travellers, swagmen and campers to provide their information. Train conductors and ships' captains were also used as collectors in the 1911 census and several subsequent censuses, to cover people travelling overnight on census night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/2071.0Feature%20Article1July%202011?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=2071.0&amp;issue=July%202011&amp;num=&amp;view= Reflecting a Nation:] - Stories from the 1911 - 2011 Census, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===
At the first Australian census in 1911 only those "aboriginal natives" living near European settlements were enumerated, and the main population tables included only those of half or less Aboriginal descent.

'''Arnold Rikli''' (13 February 1823 – 30 April 1906) was a Swiss [[Naturopathy|natural healer]].

Rikli proposed various therapies, mostly based on exposing the body to sun and air, called [[sun tanning]], preferably done while naked. He is one of the forefathers of a movement called [[naturism]] today.

== History ==
Rikli was born in a wealthy Swiss family as one of three sons. His father was involved with politics and had his own factory. Fathers wish was that his sons would inherit his knowledge and ambitions, therefore he sent Rikli and his brother Karl in the village Seebach near [[Spittal an der Drau|Spittal]], [[Austria]]. There they build a new factory for [[Leather crafting#Dyeing|leather dyeing]]. Rikli became very unwell with [[diarrhea]], blaming exposure to chemicals. He was looking for a place to rest and heal himself. He found [[Bled]] in [[Slovenia]] and went there in 1852 for the first time, where he thrived. After two years, he developed centres for helio-hydroscopic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resonantfm.com/a-very-brief-history-of-red-light/|title=A Very Brief History of Red Light|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned the family business and started his own healing method in Bled instead. His healing was founded on swimming in cold water, sun tanning and walking. For him the air, sun and water were the source of health. His famous quote was "''Water is good, air is better and most of all the sunlight''". Guests were residing in special houses, washing in tubs and walking naked in the surroundings area, most of all on the neighbouring hill called Straža, where today is a [[skiing|ski]], walking, trim and [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] areas. Unfortunately, Rikli wasn't very popular among the local people;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zupanic-Slavec|first1=Z|last2=Toplak|first2=C|title=Water, air and light--Arnold Rikli (1823-1906).|journal=Gesnerus|date=1998|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=58–69|pmid=9684537|doi=10.5169/seals-520867}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was considering them rustic, and locals considered Rikli to have odd practices. This may have followed from public nakedness in his park, the fact that he never learned the Slovenian language (despite living there for 52 years), and that he never accepted local customs. Signs and guides in his park were written in German. Locals nicknamed Rikli as "Švajcar" (Swiss guy) because of his nationality or "Sun doctor", because he promoted sun tanning.

== Rikli's contribution to health tourism in Bled, Slovenia ==
Among the first visitors of Bled were probably the [[pilgrim]]s, who came from various parts of Slovenia and [[Friuli–Venezia Giulia]] and were visiting the church on Bled island. Rikli was among the first people who noticed the healing effect of the natural environment in Bled. He has created baths, walking paths, hiking paths and housing. In the year 1895 he has built a wooden house and  baths in Swiss style and a hospital with his own examination office. Because the word spread across [[Europe]] about the healing power of Bled, they built a larger swimming place in 1899. Besides the people who were looking for healing, Bled started to attract people who wanted to spend their holidays in a healthy and clean environment. The number of visitors started to rise in 1870, after the new railway connection between [[Ljubljana]] and [[Tarvisio]], where the place got his own [[railway station]] in [[Lesce]]. In the year 1903 Bled was awarded with a [[gold medal]] on international fair of healing places in [[Vienna]], in the year 1906 Bled was classified among the best tourist destinations in Austro-Hungarian Empire. The healing place was operating until the [[First World War]], and was later abandoned. Rikli has received a statue at his 50th healing anniversary. His methods combined with the new therapy are continued at present times in Hotel Golf in medico-regenerative programs. Every year, starting with July, Bled organizes Rikli's sport days and hiking on Rikli's paths. At that time hikers walk, run and climb on the hills above Bled and talk about the healing powers of Rikli. Rikli's Villa is under the cultural guidance, but it is sadly falling apart. The owner of the building is Nicholas Oman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siol.net/slovenija/lokalne_novice/gorenjska/2010/07/propadajoca_riklijeva_vila_znova_ostala_brez_drzavne_pomoci.aspx |title=Propadajoča Riklijeva vila znova ostala brez državne pomoči |publisher=Siol |accessdate=1 January 2011 |date=5 July 2010 |language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zurnal24.si/gorenjska/riklijeva-vila-je-izvisela-176816/clanek |title=Riklijeva vila je izvisela |publisher=Žurnal 24 |language=Slovenian |accessdate=1 January 2011 |date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bibliography ==
His books discussed the theory and practical methods of healing with air, sun and steam baths. The books show a broad spectrum of natural healing place in Bled. Five of the books from the years 1872–1894 are held by the [[National and University Library of Slovenia]]. All the books are made out of wooden paper, which is in need of conservation. They are one of the most precious possessions of the National and University Library of Slovenia, because this is the only library which keeps the original examples. There is no other archive of these books available or other copies in Slovenia.

His books are:

Subba Rao'', Parupalli, Addanki and others.&lt;ref name="hinduonnet2006"/&gt;

He played Sri Krishna in ''Sri Krishna Tulabaram'' and ''Radhakrishna'', Ramadas in ''Bhakta Ramadasu'' and Tukaram in ''Bhakta Tukaram'', which got him wide recognition.

'''Chinese dragons''', also known as '''East Asian dragons''', are [[legendary creature]]s in [[Chinese mythology]], [[Chinese folklore]], and East Asian culture at large. Chinese dragons have many [[Outline of life forms|animal-like forms]] such as [[Bixi (mythology)|turtles]] and [[Chiwen|fish]], but are most commonly depicted as [[snake]]-like with four legs. They traditionally symbolize potent and [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods. The [[dragon]] is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who are worthy of it in East Asian culture. During the days of Imperial China, the [[Emperor of China]] usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ingersoll |first=Ernest |year=2013 |title=The Illustrated Book of Dragons and Dragon Lore |location=Chiang Mai |publisher=Cognoscenti Books |isbn= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;!-- that's an illustrated ebook for kids; doesn't even have an ISBN; credible source? --&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chinese culture, excellent and outstanding people are compared to a dragon, while incapable people with no achievements are compared to other, disesteemed creatures, such as a worm. A number of Chinese [[proverb]]s and [[Chengyu|idiom]]s feature references to a dragon, such as "Hoping one's son will become a dragon" ({{Zh |s=望子成龙 |t=朢子成龍 |p=wàng zǐ chéng lóng}}).

==Symbolic value==
Historically, the Chinese dragon was associated with the [[Emperor of China]] and used a symbol to represent imperial power. The founder of Han dynasty [[Liu Bang]] claimed that he was conceived after his mother dreamt of a dragon.&lt;ref name="identity"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7AL_qGOBsYC&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Construction of Racial Identities in China and Japan |first= Frank |last=Dikötter |pages=76–77 |publisher=C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd |date=10 November 1997|isbn= 978-1850652878}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang dynasty]], Emperors wore robes with dragon motif as an imperial symbol, and high officials might also be presented with dragon robes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/eng/dictio/senshoku/48koutei.html |title=Imperial Dragons |work=Kyoto National Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Yuan dynasty]], the two-horned five-clawed dragon was designated for use by the [[Son of Heaven]] or Emperor only, while the four-clawed dragon was used by the princes and nobles.&lt;ref name="komaroff"/&gt; Similarly during the Ming and [[Qing dynasty]], the five-clawed dragon was strictly reserved for use by the Emperor only. The dragon in the [[Qing dynasty]] appeared on the [[Flag of the Qing dynasty|first Chinese national flag]].&lt;ref name="Sleeboom"&gt;Sleeboom, Margaret. [2004] (2004). ''Academic Nations in China and Japan Framed in concepts of Nature, Culture and the Universal''. Routledge publishing. {{ISBN|0-415-31545-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dragon is sometimes used in the West as a [[national emblem]] of [[China]] though such use is not commonly seen in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] or the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. Instead, it is generally used as the symbol of culture. In [[Hong Kong]], the dragon was a component of the [[coat of arms of Hong Kong|coat of arms]] under British rule. It was later to become a feature of the design of [[Brand Hong Kong]], a government promotional symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandhk.gov.hk/brandhk/eview.htm "Brand Overview"], Brand Hong Kong, 09-2004 retrieved on 23-02-2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223104613/http://www.brandhk.gov.hk/brandhk/eview.htm |date=December 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese dragon has very different connotations from the [[European dragon]] – in European cultures, the dragon is a fire-breathing creature with aggressive connotations, whereas the Chinese dragon is a spiritual and cultural symbol that represents prosperity and good luck, as well as a rain deity that fosters harmony. It was reported that the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] decided against using the dragon as its official [[2008 Summer Olympics]] mascot because of the aggressive connotations that dragons have outside of China, and chose more "friendly" symbols instead.&lt;ref name="Chinese Prefer Dragon"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6171963.stm "Fiery Debate Over China's Dragon"], BBC News, an article covering China's decision not to use a dragon mascot and the resulting disappointment.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Metal dragon half frontal view.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|Chinese metal dragon half frontal view, holding a pearl in his paws. It is a [[taboo]] to disfigure a depiction of a dragon.]]
Sometimes Chinese people use the term "[[Han Chinese|Descendants of the Dragon]]" ({{zh|t={{linktext|龍|的|傳|人}}|s={{linktext|龙|的|传|人}}}}) as a sign of ethnic identity, as part of a trend started in the 1970s when different Asian nationalities were looking for animal symbols as representations, for example, the wolf may be used by the [[Mongols]] as it is considered to be their legendary ancestor.&lt;ref name="identity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sleeboom" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.upenn.edu/coursepages/hist086/material/Mongols1.html |title=The Mongolian Message}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dragon was the symbol of the Chinese emperor for many dynasties. During the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Azure Dragon]] was featured on the first Chinese national flag. It featured shortly again on the [[Twelve Symbols national emblem]], which was used during the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], from 1913 to 1928.

===Origin===
The ancient Chinese self-identified as "the descendants of the dragon" because the Chinese dragon is an imagined reptile that represents evolution from the ancestors and ''[[qi]]'' energy.&lt;ref name="Zai 2015"&gt;Dr Zai, J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover1 ''Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more'']. Ultravisum, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of dragons within Chinese culture dates back several thousands of years with the discovery of a dragon statue dating back to the fifth millennium BC from the [[Yangshao culture]] in Henan in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Giskin and Bettye S. Walsh|title=An introduction to Chinese culture through the family|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|year=2001|isbn=0-7914-5047-3|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and jade badges of rank in coiled form have been excavated from the [[Hongshan culture]] circa 4700-2900 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl01.htm "Teaching Chinese Archeology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211223345/http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl01.htm |date=2008-02-11}}, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest Dragon artifacts are the [[pig dragon]] carvings from the [[Hongshan culture]].

The coiled dragon or snake form played an important role in early Chinese culture. The character for "dragon" in the earliest [[Chinese character|Chinese writing]] has a similar coiled form, as do later jade dragon amulets from the Shang period.&lt;ref&gt;Salviati, Filippo (2002). ''The Language of Adornment: Chinese Ornaments of Jade, Crystal, Amber and Glass'', Fig. 17. Ten Speed Press. {{ISBN|1-58008-587-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Chinese referred to unearthed dinosaur bones as dragon bones and documented them as such. For example, [[Chang Qu]] in 300 BC documents the discovery of "dragon bones" in [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Dong Zhiming]]|year=1992|title=Dinosaurian Faunas of China|publisher=China Ocean Press, Beijing|isbn=3-540-52084-8|oclc=26522845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Chinese term for dinosaur is written as ''恐龍/恐龙''("terror dragon"), and villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized "dragon bones" for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink= |title=Dinosaur bones 'used as medicine' |work= |publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6276948.stm|doi= |accessdate=2007-07-06 | date=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[binomial name]] for a variety of dinosaurs discovered in China, ''[[Mei long]],'' in Chinese ([[:wikt:寐|寐 mèi]] and [[:wikt:龙|龙 lóng]]) means ''"sleeping dragon."'' Fossilized remains of Mei long have been found in China in a sleeping and coiled form, with the dinosaur nestling its snout beneath one of its forelimbs while encircling its tail around its entire body.&lt;ref name="Xu&amp;Norell2004"&gt;Xu and Norell, (2004). "A new troodontid dinosaur from China with avian-like sleeping posture". ''Nature'', '''431'''(7010): 838–841. {{doi|10.1038/news041011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythical creature===

[[Image:Qing Dynasty Dish with dragons.jpg|thumb|Dragons chasing flaming pearl, Qing dynasty]]
From its origins as totems or the stylized depiction of natural creatures, the Chinese dragon evolved to become a mythical animal. The [[Han dynasty]] scholar [[Wang Fu (philosopher)|Wang Fu]] recorded Chinese myths that ''long'' dragons had nine anatomical resemblances.&lt;blockquote&gt;The people paint the dragon's shape with a horse's head and a snake's tail. Further, there are expressions as 'three joints' and 'nine resemblances' (of the dragon), to wit: from head to shoulder, from shoulder to breast, from breast to tail. These are the joints; as to the nine resemblances, they are the following: his antlers resemble those of a stag, his head that of a camel, his eyes those of a demon, his neck that of a snake, his belly that of a clam ([[shen (clam-monster)|''shen'']], 蜃), his scales those of a [[carp]], his claws those of an eagle, his soles those of a tiger, his ears those of a cow. Upon his head he has a thing like a broad eminence (a big lump), called [''chimu''] (尺木). If a dragon has no [''chimu''], he cannot ascend to the sky.&lt;ref name="Visser70"&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Visser|first=Marinus Willem|year=1913|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924021444728|title=The Dragon in China and Japan|series=Verhandelingen der Koninklijke akademie van wetenschappen te Amsterdam. Afdeeling Letterkunde. Nieuwe reeks, deel xiii, no. 2|publisher=Johannes Müller|place=Amsterdam|page=70}}
(Also available [http://fax.libs.uga.edu/GR830xD7xV8/ at University of Georgia Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225113412/http://fax.libs.uga.edu/GR830xD7xV8/ |date=2016-12-25}})
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further sources give variant lists of the nine animal resemblances. Sinologist Henri Doré lists these characteristics of an authentic dragon: "The antlers of a deer. The head of a crocodile. A demon's eyes. The neck of a snake. A tortoise's [[viscera]]. A hawk's claws. The palms of a tiger. A cow's ears. And it hears through its horns, its ears being deprived of all power of hearing."&lt;ref name="Doré"&gt;Doré, Henri. 1917. [http://openlibrary.org/b/OL13587109M/Researches-into-Chinese-superstitions ''Researches into Chinese Superstitions'']. M. Kennelly, D. J. Finn, and L. F. McGreat, trs. T'usewei. Ch'eng-wen reprint 1966, 681.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that, "Others state it has a rabbit's eyes, a frog's belly, a carp's scales." The anatomy of other legendary creatures, including the [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] and [[manticore]], is similarly amalgamated from fierce animals.

Chinese dragons were considered to be physically concise. Of the 117 scales, 81 are of the yang essence (positive) while 36 are of the yin essence (negative). Initially, the dragon was benevolent, wise, and just, but the Buddhists introduced the concept of malevolent influence among some dragons. Just as water destroys, they said, so can some dragons destroy via floods, tidal waves, and storms. They suggested that some of the worst floods were believed to have been the result of a mortal upsetting a dragon.

Many pictures of Chinese dragons show a [[Eight Treasures|flaming pearl]] under their chin or in their claws. The pearl is associated with spiritual energy, wisdom, prosperity, power, immortality, thunder, or the moon. Chinese art often depicts a pair of dragons chasing or fighting over the flaming pearl.

Chinese dragons are occasionally depicted with bat-like wings growing out of the front limbs, but most do not have wings, as their ability to fly (and control rain/water, etc.) is mystical and not seen as a result of their physical attributes.

This description accords with the artistic depictions of the dragon down to the present day. The dragon has also acquired an almost unlimited range of supernatural powers. It is said to be able to disguise itself as a [[Bombyx mori|silkworm]], or become as large as our entire universe. It can fly among the clouds or hide in water (according to the ''Guanzi''). It can form clouds, can turn into water, can change color as an ability to blend in with their surroundings, as an effective form of camouflage or glow in the dark (according to the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'').

In many other countries, folktales speak of the dragon having all the attributes of the other 11 creatures of the zodiac, this includes the [[whiskers]] of the [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], the face and horns of the [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]], the claws and teeth of the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]], the belly of the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]], the body of the [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]], the legs of the [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]], the [[goatee]] of the [[Goat (zodiac)|Goat]], the wit of the [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]], the [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]], the ears of the [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]], and the snout of the [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]].

In some circles, it is considered bad luck to depict a dragon facing downwards, as it is seen as disrespectful to place a dragon in such manner that it cannot ascend to the sky. Also, depictions of dragons in [[tattoo]]s are prevalent as they are symbols of strength and power, especially criminal organisations where dragons hold a meaning all on their own. As such, it is believed that one must be fierce and strong enough, hence earning the right to wear the dragon on his skin, lest his luck be consumed by the dragons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Ruler of weather and water===
[[File:Golden canteen with dragon, Ming Dynasty.jpg|thumb|200px|A dragon seen floating among clouds, on a golden canteen made during the 15th century, [[Ming dynasty]]]]
Chinese dragons are strongly associated with water and weather in popular religion. They are believed to be the rulers of moving bodies of water, such as waterfalls, rivers, or seas. The Dragon God is the dispenser of rain as well as the zoomorphic representation of the ''[[yin and yang|yang]]'' masculine power of generation.{{sfnb|Tom|1989|p=55}} In this capacity as the rulers of water and weather, the dragon is more [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] in form, often depicted as a humanoid, dressed in a king's costume, but with a dragon head wearing a king's headdress.

There are four major [[Dragon King]]s, representing each of the [[Four Seas]]: the East Sea (corresponding to the [[East China Sea]]), the South Sea (corresponding to the [[South China Sea]]), the West Sea (sometimes seen as the [[Qinghai Lake]] and beyond), and the North Sea (sometimes seen as [[Lake Baikal]]).

Because of this association, they are seen as "in charge" of water-related weather phenomena. In premodern times, many Chinese villages (especially those close to rivers and seas) had temples dedicated to their local "dragon king". In times of drought or flooding, it was customary for the local gentry and government officials to lead the community in offering sacrifices and conducting other religious rites to appease the dragon, either to ask for rain or a cessation thereof.

The King of [[Wuyue]] in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period was often known as the "[[Dragon King]]" or the "Sea Dragon King" because of his extensive hydro-engineering schemes which "tamed" the sea.

===Symbol of imperial authority===
{{Main|Yellow Dragon}}
[[Image:LongPao.JPG|thumbnail|upright|right|An imperial robe from the [[Qing dynasty]]]]
According to Chinese legend, both Chinese primogenitors, the earliest [[Shennong|Door]] and the [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi), were closely related to 'Long' (Chinese dragon). At the end of his reign, the first legendary ruler, the Yellow Emperor, was said to have been immortalized into a dragon that resembled his emblem, and ascended to Heaven. The other legendary ruler, the Yan Emperor, was born by his mother's telepathy with a mythical dragon. Since the Chinese consider the Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor as their ancestors, they sometimes refer to themselves as "''the descendants of the dragon''". This legend also contributed towards the use of the Chinese dragon as a symbol of [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial]] power.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Dragons (usually with five claws on each foot) were a symbol for the emperor in many [[Chinese dynasties]]. During the Qing dynasty, the imperial dragon was colored yellow or gold, and during the Ming dynasty it was red.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, L. (1923). ''The Chinese Dragon''. Shanghai, China: Commercial Press Ltd. Retrieved from https://archive.org/stream/chinesedragon00hayeuoft#page/n7/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial throne was referred to as the ''Dragon Throne''. During the late Qing dynasty, the dragon was even adopted as the [[List of Chinese flags#Historical|national flag]]. Dragons are featured in carvings on the stairs and walkways of imperial palaces and imperial tombs, such as at the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]].

In some Chinese legends, an emperor might be born with a [[birthmark]] in the shape of a dragon. For example, one legend tells the tale of a peasant born with a dragon birthmark who eventually overthrows the existing dynasty and founds a new one; another legend might tell of the prince in hiding from his enemies who is identified by his dragon birthmark.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In contrast, the [[List of Chinese consorts|Empress of China]] was often identified with the [[Fenghuang|Chinese phoenix]].

===Modern belief===
Worship of the Dragon God is celebrated throughout China with sacrifices and processions during the fifth and sixth moons, and especially on the date of his birthday the thirteenth day of the sixth moon.{{sfnb|Tom|1989|p=55}} A folk religious movement of [[associations of good-doing]] in modern [[Hebei]] is primarily devoted to a generic Dragon God whose icon is a tablet with his name inscribed, for which it has been named the "movement of the Dragon Tablet".&lt;ref&gt;Zhiya Hua.

==Depictions of the dragon==

===Neolithic depictions===
[[Image:Chinese - Dragon - Walters 492425 - Profile.jpg|thumb|upright|Symbols of dragons were placed in tombs as means to get to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]|url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/33988|title= Chinese Dragon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
Dragons or dragon-like depictions have been found extensively in neolithic-period archaeological sites throughout China. The earliest depiction of dragons was found at [[Xinglongwa culture]] sites. [[Yangshao culture]] sites in [[Xi'an]] have produced clay pots with dragon motifs. A burial site [[Xishuipo]] in [[Puyang]] which is associated with the Yangshao culture shows a large dragon mosaic made out of clam shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMfOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The Dragon in the Cockpit: How Western Aviation Concepts Conflict with Chinese Value Systems |author=Hung-Sying Jing |author2=Allen Batteau |page=83 |publisher=Routledge |year=2016 |isbn= 9781317035299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liangzhu culture]] also produced dragon-like patterns. The [[Hongshan culture]] sites in present-day [[Inner Mongolia]] produced jade dragon objects in the form of [[pig dragon]]s which are the first 3-dimensional representations of Chinese dragons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Atlas of World Art|author= John Onians |page=46|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|date=26 April 2004|isbn= 978-1856693776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such early form was the pig dragon. It is a coiled, elongated creature with a head resembling a [[boar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/china1999/037_010.htm "Jade coiled dragon, Hongshan Culture (c. 4700-2920 B.C.)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313003502/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/china1999/037_010.htm |date=2007-03-13}}, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Retrieved on 23-02-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The character for "dragon" in the earliest [[Chinese character|Chinese writing]] has a similar coiled form, as do later [[jade]] dragon [[amulet]]s from the [[Shang dynasty]].

===Classical depictions===
[[File:Phra Maha Chedi Chai Mongkol Naga emerging from mouth of Makara.jpg|thumb|Phra Maha Chedi Chai Mongkol Naga emerging from mouth of Makara]]
Chinese literature and myths refer to many dragons besides the famous ''long''. The linguist Michael Carr analyzed over 100 ancient dragon names attested in [[Chinese classic texts]].&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, Michael. 1990. [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/carr1990chinese.pdf "Chinese Dragon Names"], ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'' 13.2:87–189. He classified them into seven categories: Rain-dragons, Flying-dragons, Snake-dragons, Wug-dragons [''wug'' refers to "worms, bugs, and small reptiles"], Crocodile-dragons, Hill-dragons, and Miscellaneous dragons.&lt;/ref&gt; Many such Chinese names derive from the [[suffix]] -''long'':
*''[[Tianlong]]'' ({{zh|c=天龍|p=tiānlóng| w=t'ien-lung |l=heavenly dragon}}), celestial dragon that guards heavenly palaces and pulls divine chariots; also a name for the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]]

It supposedly had a human's face and snake's body, created day and night by opening and closing its eyes, and created seasonal winds by breathing. (Note that this ''zhulong'' is different from the similarly named Vermilion Dragon or the [[Pig dragon]]).
*''[[Chi (mythology)|Chilong]]'' ({{zh|c=螭龍 or 魑龍|p=chīlóng|w=ch'ih-lung|l=demon dragon}}), a hornless dragon or mountain demon
Fewer Chinese dragon names derive from the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''long''-:
*''[[Longwang]]'' ({{zh|c=龍王|p=lóngwáng| w=lung-wang|l=[[Dragon King]]s}}) divine rulers of the Four Seas
*''[[Longma]]'' ({{zh|c=龍馬|p=lóngmǎ| w=lung-ma|l=dragon horse}}), emerged from the Luo River and revealed [[ba gua]] to [[Fu Xi]]

Some additional Chinese dragons are not named with ''long'' 龍, for instance,
*[[Hong (rainbow-dragon)|Hong]] ({{zh|c=虹|p=hóng| w=hung|l=rainbow}}), a two-headed dragon or [[rainbow serpent]]
*[[Shen (clam-monster)|Shen]] ({{zh|c=蜃|p=shèn| w=shen|l=giant clam}}), a [[shapeshifting]] dragon or [[sea monster]] believed to create [[mirage]]s

Chinese scholars have classified dragons in diverse systems. For instance, [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] of the [[Song dynasty]] canonized five colored dragons as "kings".
*The Azure Dragon [''Qinglong'' 青龍] spirits, most compassionate kings.
*The Vermilion Dragon [''Zhulong'' 朱龍 or ''Chilong'' 赤龍] spirits, kings that bestow blessings on lakes.
*The Yellow Dragon [''Huanglong'' 黃龍] spirits, kings that favorably hear all petitions.
*The White Dragon [''Bailong'' 白龍] spirits, virtuous and pure kings.
*The Black Dragon [''Xuanlong'' 玄龍 or ''Heilong'' 黑龍] spirits, kings dwelling in the depths of the mystic waters.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Doré 682.&lt;/ref&gt;
With the addition of the Yellow Dragon of the Center to Azure Dragon of the East, these Vermilion, White, and Black Dragons coordinate with the Four Symbols, including the [[Vermilion Bird]] of the South, [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] of the West, and [[Black Tortoise]] of the North.

Several [[Ming dynasty]] texts list what were claimed as the Nine Offspring of the Dragon (龍生九子), and subsequently these feature prominently in popular Chinese stories and writings. The scholar Xie Zhaozhe ([[:zh:謝肇淛|謝肇淛]], 1567–1624) in his work ''Wu Za Zu'' ([[:zh:五雜俎|五雜俎]], c. 1592) gives the following listing, as rendered by M.W. de Visser:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A well-known work of the end of the sixteenth century, the ''Wuzazu'' [[:zh:五雜俎|五雜俎]], informs us about the nine different young of the dragon, whose shapes are used as ornaments according to their nature.
*The [''[[pulao (dragon)|pulao]]'' [[:zh:蒲牢|蒲牢]]], dragons which like to cry, are represented on the tops of bells, serving as handles.
*The [''qiuniu'' [[:zh:囚牛|囚牛]]], which like music, are used to adorn musical instruments.
*The [''[[chiwen]]'' [[:zh:螭吻|螭吻]]/鴟吻], which like swallowing, are placed on both ends of the ridgepoles of roofs (to swallow all evil influences).
*The [''chaofeng'' [[:zh:嘲风|嘲風]]], lion-like beasts which like precipices, are placed on the four corners of roofs.
*The [''yazi'' [[:zh:睚眦|睚眦]]/睚眥], which like to kill, are engraved on sword guards.
*The [''[[Bixi (mythology)|bixi]]'' [[:zh:赑屃|贔屭]]], which have the shape of the [''chilong'' 螭龍], and are fond of literature, are represented on the sides of grave-monuments.
*The [''bi'an'' [[:zh:狴犴|狴犴]]], which like litigation, are placed over prison gates (in order to keep guard).
*The [''suanni'' [[:zh:狻猊|狻猊]]], which like to sit down, are represented upon the bases of Buddhist idols (under the Buddhas' or Bodhisattvas' feet).
*The [''baxia'' [[:zh:𧈢𧏡|𧈢𧏡]]], finally, big tortoises which like to carry heavy objects, are placed under grave-monuments.

Further, the same author enumerates nine other kinds of dragons, which are represented as ornaments of different objects or buildings according to their liking prisons, water, the rank smell of newly caught fish or newly killed meat, wind and rain, ornaments, smoke, shutting the mouth (used for adorning key-holes), standing on steep places (placed on roofs), and fire.&lt;ref name="Visser101"&gt;{{harvnb|de Visser|1913|pp=101–102}}. The primary source is [[:zh:s:五雜俎/卷09|Wu Za Zu, chapter 9]], beginning with "龍生九子...". The title of Xie Zhaozhe's work, ''Wu Za Zu'', has been variously translated into English as ''Five Assorted Offerings'' (in [https://web.archive.org/web/20020126162753/http://www.renditions.org/renditions/authors/xiezz.html Xie Zhaozhe]), ''Five Sundry Bands'' (in "[http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/57/2/177?ck=nck Disease and Its Impact on Politics, Diplomacy, and the Military ...]")
or ''Five Miscellanies'' (in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju3N4VeiQ28C&amp;pg=PA48 Changing clothes in China: fashion, history, nation], p. 48).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Sheng'an waiji'' (升庵外集) collection by the poet [[Yang Shen]] (楊慎, 1488–1559) gives different 5th and 9th names for the dragon's nine children: the ''[[taotie]]'' ([[:zh:饕餮|饕餮]]), which loves to eat and is found on food-related wares, and the ''jiaotu'' ([[:zh:椒图|椒圖]]), which looks like a conch or clam, does not like to be disturbed, and is used on the front door or the doorstep. Yang's list is ''bixi'', ''chiwen'' or ''cháofēng'', ''pulao'', ''bi'an'', ''taotie'', ''qiuniu'', ''yazi'', ''suanni'', and ''jiaotu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=962-07-1846-1|author=吾三省 (Wu Sansheng)|title=中國文化背景八千詞 (Eight thousand words and expressions viewed against the background of Chinese culture)|publisher= 商務印書館(香港) (Commercial Press, Hong Kong)|year=2006|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQJ_tIU1ixoC&amp;pg=PA345|page=345|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldest known attestation of the "children of the dragon" list is found in the ''Shuyuan Zaji'' (椒园杂记, ''Miscellaneous records from the bean garden'') by [[Lu Rong]] (1436–1494); however, he noted that the list enumerates mere synonyms of various antiques, not children of a dragon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vip.book.sina.com.cn/book/chapter_69989_55313.html 九、龙的繁衍与附会——龙生九子 (1)] ("Chapter 9, Dragon's derived and associated creatures: Nine children of the dragon (1)"), in [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]. The full text of ''Shuyuan Zaji'', from which Yang and Liu quote, is available in electronic format at a number of sites, e.g. here: [http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html 菽園雜記] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306151643/http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html |date=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nine sons of the dragon were commemorated by the Shanghai Mint in 2012's year of the dragon with two sets of coins, one in silver, and one in brass. Each coin in the sets depicts one of the 9 sons, including an additional coin for the father dragon, which depicts the nine sons on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;CCT4243: [https://www.coincompendium.com/w/index.php/CCT4243 2012 lunar dragon nine sons of the dragon 20 coin set]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dragon claws===
[[File:Freer 013.jpg|thumb|200px|Reverse of bronze mirror, 8th century, [[Tang dynasty]], showing a dragon with three toes on each foot]]
The early Chinese dragons can be depicted with two to five claws. Different countries that adopted the Chinese dragon have different preferences; in Mongolia and Korea, the four-clawed dragons are used, while in [[Japanese dragon]] three-clawed dragons are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dragonsinn.net/eastjap-2.htm |title=Famous Japanese Dragons}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Yuan dynasty]], the five-clawed dragons became reserved for use by the emperor while the princes used four-clawed dragons.&lt;ref name="komaroff"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUgyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Beyond the Legacy of Genghis Khan|editor= Linda Komaroff |page=320 |publisher= Brill Academic Publishers |isbn=9789047418573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the dragon motif was codified during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasty, and phoenixes and five-clawed two-horned dragons may not be used on the robes of officials and other objects such as plates and vessels.&lt;ref name="komaroff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&amp;chapter=991360 |title=《志第二十八 輿服一》 |work= The [[History of Yuan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further stipulated that for commoners, "it is forbidden to wear any cloth with patterns of [[Qilin]], Male [[Fenghuang]] (Chinese phoenix), [[Moon rabbit|White rabbit]], [[Lingzhi mushroom|Lingzhi]], Five-Toe Two-Horn Dragon, Eight Dragons, Nine Dragons, '[[Ten thousand years]]', [[Fu Lu Shou|Fortune-longevity]] character and Golden Yellow etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&amp;chapter=311790 |title=《本紀第三十九 順帝二》 |quote=禁服麒麟、鸞鳳、白兔、靈芝、雙角五爪龍、八龍、九龍、萬壽、福壽字、赭黃等服 |work= The [[History of Yuan]], [[Ukhaantu Khan, Emperor Huizong of Yuan|Emperor Shundi]] ([[:zh:元史|元史]]·順帝紀), compiled under [[Song Lian]] ([[:zh:宋濂|宋濂]]), AD 1370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] emulated the [[Yuan dynasty]] rules on the use of the dragon motif and decreed that the dragon would be his emblem and that it would have five claws. The four-clawed dragon would become typically for imperial nobility and certain high-ranking officials. The three clawed dragon was used by lower ranks and the general public (widely seen on various Chinese goods in the Ming dynasty). The dragon, however, was only for select royalty closely associated with the imperial family, usually in various symbolic colors, while it was a capital offense for anyone—other than the emperor himself—to ever use the completely gold-colored, five-clawed ''Long'' dragon [[motif (art)|motif]]. Improper use of claw number or colors was considered treason, punishable by execution of the offender's entire clan. The convention was carried into the [[Qing dynasty]], and portraits of the Qing emperors were usually depicted with five-clawed dragons.

In works of art that left the imperial collection, either as gifts or through pilfering by court eunuchs (a long-standing problem) where practicable one claw was removed from each set, as in several pieces of [[carved lacquerware]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessica Rawson|Rawson, Jessica]] (ed). ''The British Museum Book of Chinese Art'', p. 177, 2007 (2nd edn), British Museum Press, {{ISBN|9780714124469}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the well known [[Chinese lacquerware table]] in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Clunas|Clunas, Craig]] and Harrison-Hall, Jessica, ''Ming: 50 years that changed China'', p. 107, 2014, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|9780714124841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number nine===
{{Clear}}
{{Panorama|image = File:Chen Rong - Nine Dragons.jpg|height = 230|alt = |caption = A close up view of one full dragon (and the tail end and claw of another) from the ''[[Nine Dragons (painting)|Nine Dragons]]'' handscroll painted in 1244 by [[Song dynasty]] artist [[Chen Rong (painter)|Chen Rong]] |dir = rtl}}
The number [[9 (number)|nine]] is special in [[China]] as it is seen as number of the heaven, and Chinese dragons are frequently connected with it. For example, a Chinese dragon is normally described in terms of nine attributes and usually has 117 (9x13) scales—81 (9x9) Yang and 36 (9x4) Yin.
This is also why there are nine forms of the dragon and there are [[9 sons of the dragon]] (see [[#Classical depictions|Classical depictions]] above). The [[Nine-Dragon Wall]] is a [[spirit wall]] with images of nine different dragons, and is found in imperial Chinese palaces and gardens. Because nine was considered the number of the emperor, only the most senior officials were allowed to wear nine dragons on their robes—and then only with the robe completely covered with [[surcoat]]s. Lower-ranking officials had eight or five dragons on their robes, again covered with surcoats; even the emperor himself wore his dragon robe with one of its nine dragons hidden from view.

There are a number of places in China called "Nine Dragons", the most famous being [[Kowloon]] (in Cantonese) in Hong Kong. The part of the [[Mekong]] in Vietnam is known as ''[[Cửu Long]]'', with the same meaning.

===Chinese zodiac===
{{main|Dragon (zodiac)}}
The [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] is one of the 12 animals in the [[Chinese zodiac]] which is used to designate years in the [[Chinese calendar]]. It is thought that each animal is associated with certain personality traits. [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] years are usually the most popular to have children. There are more people born in [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] years than in any other animal years of the [[zodiac]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Constellations===
{{see also|Five elements (Chinese philosophy)}}
The Azure Dragon ([[Azure Dragon (Chinese constellation)|Qing Long]], 青龍) is considered to be the primary of the four [[Chinese constellation|celestial guardians]], the other three being the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|Zhu Que]]—朱雀 (Vermilion Bird), [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|Bai Hu]]—白虎 (White Tiger), [[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Xuan Wu]]—玄武 (Black Tortoise-like creature). In this context, the Azure Dragon is associated with the East and the element of Wood.

===Dragonboat racing===
{{main|Dragon boat}}

At special festivals, especially the [[Duanwu Festival]], dragon boat races are an important part of festivities. Typically, these are boats paddled by a team of up to 20 paddlers with a drummer and steersman. The boats have a carved dragon as the head and tail of the boat. Dragon boat racing is also an important part of celebrations outside of China, such as at [[Chinese New Year]]. A similar racing is popular in India in the state of Kerala called Vallamkali and there are records on Chinese traders visiting the seashores of Kerala centuries back (Ibn Batuta).

===Dragon dancing===
{{main|Dragon dance}}
On auspicious occasions, including [[Chinese New Year]] and the opening of shops and residences, festivities often include dancing with dragon puppets. These are "life sized" cloth-and-wood puppets manipulated by a team of people, supporting the dragon with poles. They perform choreographed moves to the accompaniment of drums, drama, and music. They also wore good clothing made of silk.

===Dragons and nāgas===
[[File:Ulmus pumila 'Pendula', 1908.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'Dragon's-Claw Elm', [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]], 1908]]
In many [[Buddhist]] countries, the concept of the [[nāga]] has been merged with local traditions of great and wise serpents or dragons, as depicted in this stairway image of a multi-headed nāga emerging from the mouth of a [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] in the style of a Chinese dragon at Phra Maha [[stupa|Chedi]] Chai Mongkol on the premises of [[Wat]] Pha Namthip Thep Prasit Vararam in Thailand's Roi Et Province [[Amphoe Nong Phok#Places|Nong Phok District]].

===Dragons and tigers===
The tiger is considered to be the eternal rival to the dragon, thus various artworks depict a dragon and tiger fighting an epic battle. A well used [[Chengyu|Chinese idiom]] to describe equal rivals (often in sports nowadays) is "''Dragon versus Tiger''". In [[Chinese martial arts]], "''Dragon style''" is used to describe styles of fighting based more on understanding movement, while "''Tiger style''" is based on brute strength and memorization of techniques.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Dragons and botany===
The [[elm]] cultivar [[Ulmus pumila 'Pendula'|''Ulmus pumila'' 'Pendula']], from northern China, called 'Weeping Chinese Elm' in the West, is known locally as ''Lung chao yü shu'' (: 'Dragon's-claw elm') owing to its branching.&lt;ref&gt;U. pumila 'Pendula', 'Inventory of Seeds and Plants Imported ...

* As a part of traditional folklore, dragons appear in a variety of [[mythic fiction|mythological fiction]]. In the classical novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', the son of the [[Dragon King]] of the West was condemned to serve as a horse for the travelers because of his indiscretions at a party in the heavenly court. [[Sun Wukong]]'s [[Gun (staff)|staff]], the [[Ruyi Jingu Bang]], was robbed from Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the [[Donghai (Chinese mythology)|East Sea]]. In ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' and other stories, [[Nezha]], the boy hero, defeats the Dragon Kings and tames the seas. Chinese dragons also appear in innumerable Japanese [[anime]] films and television shows, [[manga]], and in Western [[political cartoons]] as a personification of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese respect for dragons is emphasized in [[Naomi Novik]]'s ''[[Temeraire (series)|Temeraire]]'' novels, where they were the first people to tame dragons and are treated as equals, intellectuals, or even royalty, rather than beasts solely bred for war in the West. [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] is a large Chinese dragon that appears in the Godzilla storyline. A golden three-headed dragon also appears in the comic book series ''[[God Is Dead (comics)|God Is Dead]]''.
* Red dragon is a symbol of China which appears in many [[Mahjong]] games.
* A Chinese Water-Dragon is used as the main antagonist in Season 3 of the Australian television series ''[[Mako Mermaids]]''. The Dragon is heavily based on Chinese mythology to coincide with a new Chinese mermaid on the show.

==Regional variations across Asia==
While depictions of the dragon in art and literature are consistent throughout the cultures in which it is found, there are some regional differences.

'''Colony collapse disorder''' ('''CCD''') is the phenomenon that occurs when the majority of [[worker bee]]s in a colony disappear and leave behind a [[queen bee|queen]], plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of [[Beekeeping|apiculture]], and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease),&lt;ref name = "Oldroyd"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oldroyd |first1=Benjamin P. |title=What's Killing American Honey Bees? |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=e168 |year=2007 |pmid=17564497 |pmc=1892840 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050168}}&lt;/ref&gt; the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006&lt;ref name=Prelim&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dennis vanEngelsdorp |author2=Diana Cox-Foster |author3=Maryann Frazier |author4=Nancy Ostiguy |author5=Jerry Hayes |title=Colony Collapse Disorder Preliminary Report|url=http://www.beekeeping.com/articles/us/ccd.pdf|publisher = Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium (MAAREC)&amp;nbsp;– CCD Working Group|page = 22|date = 5 January 2006|accessdate = 2007-04-24|quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with a drastic rise in the number of disappearances of [[western honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera'') colonies in North America.&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite news|title = Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop Growers and Researchers|url = http://agsci.psu.edu/news/radio/2007/dramatic-honey-bee-die-off-worries-beekeepers-and-crop-producers|publisher = Pennsylvania State University College of Agricultural Sciences|date = 29 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain,&lt;ref name=Monde&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dupont|first1=Gaëlle|title=Les abeilles malades de l'homme|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2007/08/29/les-abeilles-malades-de-l-homme_948835_3244.html|accessdate=2018-03-23|work=[[Le Monde]]|date=29 August 2007|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree,&lt;ref name=sueddeutsche&gt;{{cite news|author = Petra Steinberger|title = Das spurlose Sterben|url = http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/raetselhafter-exitus-der-bienen-das-spurlose-sterben-1.911906|publisher = sueddeutsche.de|date = 12 March 2007|language = German|accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] received reports of a decline greater than 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/ni/?id=2009-06-08.9.1 |title=Minutes of Northern Ireland Assembly |publisher=Theyworkforyou.com |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colony collapse disorder causes significant economic losses because [[List of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops]] worldwide are [[Pollination|pollinated]] by western honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, the worth of global crops with honey bee pollination was estimated at close to $200 billion in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0512sp1.htm Spotlight: Protecting the pollinators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708064328/http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0512sp1.htm |date=8 July 2013 }}.

In the six years leading up to 2013, more than 10 million [[beehive]]s were lost, often to CCD,&lt;ref name="Benjamin2013" /&gt; nearly twice the normal rate of loss. To put this in perspective, according to [[Food and Agriculture Organization|U.N. FAO]] [[List of world stocks of beehives|data]], the world's beehive stock rose from around 50 million in 1961 to around 83 million in 2014, which is about 1.3% average annual growth. Average annual growth has accelerated to 1.9% since 2009.

Several possible causes for CCD have been proposed, but no single proposal has gained widespread acceptance among the scientific community. Suggested causes include: infections with ''[[Varroa]]'' and [[Acarapis woodi|''Acarapis'']] [[mite]]s; [[malnutrition]]; various [[pathogen]]s; [[genetics|genetic factors]]; [[immunodeficiency|immunodeficiencies]]; [[habitat destruction|loss of habitat]]; changing [[beekeeping]] practices; or a combination of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Multiple-causes-for-colony-collapse---report/tabid/1160/articleID/296401/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Multiple causes for colony collapse – report| date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large amount of speculation has surrounded a family of pesticides called [[neonicotinoid]]s as having caused CCD.

Limited occurrences resembling CCD have been documented as early as 1869&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robyn M.

The cause of the appearance of this [[syndrome]] has never been determined. Upon recognition that the syndrome does not seem to be seasonally restricted, and that it may not be a "disease" in the standard sense—that there may not be a specific [[Disease causative agent|causative agent]]—the syndrome was renamed.&lt;ref name=Prelim /&gt;

A well-documented outbreak of colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight to the rest of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, [[List of diseases of the honey bee#Acarine (tracheal) mites|Acarine (tracheal) mites]], and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1= Peter |last2=Carreck|first2= Norman L.|year=2010|title=Honey bee colony losses|journal=Journal of Apicultural Research|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.3896/IBRA.1.49.1.01|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/43682/1/Neumann_%26_Carreck%2C_2010.pdf}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.

From 1972 to 2006, dramatic reductions continued in the number of [[feral]] honey bees in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Watanabe"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Watanabe, M.|title = Pollination worries rise as honey bees decline|journal = Science|volume = 265|issue = 5176|page = 1170|year = 1994|doi =10.1126/science.265.5176.1170|pmid=17787573|bibcode = 1994Sci...265.1170W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a significant though somewhat gradual decline in the number of colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, [[Acarapis woodi|tracheal]] and ''[[Varroa]]'' mites, and commercial [[beekeeper]]s' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term ''colony collapse disorder'' to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes ''spontaneous hive collapse'' or the ''[[Mary Celeste]] syndrome'' in the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="Penn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7360832.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wild bee decline 'catastrophic' | date=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losses had remained stable since the 1990s at 17–20% per year attributable to a variety of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress.&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33938.pdf |title=Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder |publisher=Congressional Research Service |first=Renée |last=Johnson |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first report of CCD was in mid-November 2006 by a Pennsylvania beekeeper overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses of nearly all of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might no longer be able to pollinate or produce honey.&lt;ref name="ars.usda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/ccd/ccdprogressreport2010.pdf |title=Colony Collapse Disorder Progress Report |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |date=June 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 2007, some larger nonmigratory beekeepers in the mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest regions also reported significant losses of more than 50%.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; Colony losses also were reported in five Canadian provinces, several European countries, and countries in South and Central America and Asia. In 2010, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] reported that data on overall honey bee losses for 2010 indicated an estimated 34% loss, which is statistically similar to losses reported in 2007, 2008, and 2009.&lt;ref name="ars.usda.gov"/&gt;  Fewer colony losses occurred in the U.S. over the winter of 2013–2014 than in recent years.  Total losses of managed honey bee colonies from all causes were 23.2% nationwide, a marked improvement over the 30.5% loss reported for the winter of 2012–2013 and the eight-year average loss of 29.6%.&lt;ref name="USDA2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Inspecting the bees' work.JPG|thumb|Visit to a bee colony in West Virginia]]
In collapsed colonies, CCD is suspected when a complete absence of adult bees is found in colonies, with little or no buildup of dead bees in the hive or in front of the hive.  A colony that has collapsed from CCD is generally characterized by all of these conditions occurring simultaneously:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://honeycouncil.ca/users/news_view.asp?FolderID=3219&amp;NewsID=1146|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729004717/http://honeycouncil.ca/users/news_view.asp?FolderID=3219&amp;NewsID=1146|archivedate=29 July 2007|title=Discussion of phenomenon of Colony disorder collapse|publisher=Canadian Honey Council|date=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Presence of [[Brood (honey bee)|capped brood]] in abandoned colonies: Bees normally do not abandon a hive until the capped brood have all hatched.
* Presence of food stores, both [[honey]] and [[bee pollen]]:
** that are not immediately robbed by other bees
** that, when attacked by [[Beehive|hive]] [[Pest (organism)|pests]] such as [[Lesser wax moth|wax moths]] and [[small hive beetle]]s, the attack is noticeably delayed
* Presence of the [[queen bee]]: If the queen is not present, the hive died because it was queenless, which is not considered CCD.

Precursor symptoms that may arise before the final colony collapse are:
* Insufficient [[Worker bee|workforce]] to maintain the brood that is present
* Workforce seems made up of young adult bees
* Colony members are reluctant to consume provided feed, such as sugar syrup and [[Dietary supplement|protein supplement]].

The National Agriculture Statistics Service reported  2.44 million honey-producing hives were in the United States in February 2008, down from 4.5 million in 1980, and 5.9 million in 1947, though these numbers underestimate the total number of managed hives, as they exclude several thousand hives managed for pollination contracts only, and also do not include hives managed by beekeepers owning fewer than five hives. This under-representation may be offset by the practice of counting some hives more than once; hives that are moved to different states to produce honey are counted in each state's total and summed in total counts.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004071 |pmid=19115015 |title=A Survey of Honey Bee Colony Losses in the U.S., Fall 2007 to Spring 2008 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=12 |page=e4071 |publisher=PLoS ONE |year=2008 |last1=Vanengelsdorp |first1=Dennis |last2=Hayes |first2=Jerry |last3=Underwood |first3=Robyn M. |last4=Pettis |first4=Jeffery |pmc=2606032|bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.4071V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-CCD winter losses as high as 50% have occurred in some years and regions (e.g., 2000–2001 in [[Pennsylvania]]). Normal winter losses are typically in the range of 15–25%. In many cases, beekeepers reporting significant losses of bees did not experience true CCD, but losses due to other causes.

In 2007 in the US, at least 24 different states&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|author = Amy Sahba|title = The mysterious deaths of the honeybees|url = http://money.cnn.com/2007/03/29/news/honeybees/|publisher = [[CNN Money]]|date = 29 March 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  had reported at least one case of CCD.&lt;ref name = "ABJ707"&gt;Van Engelsdorp, D., Underwood, R., Caron, D.

American Bee Journal.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 survey of 384 responding beekeepers from 13 states, 23.8% met the specified criterion for CCD (that 50% or more of their dead colonies were found without bees and/or with very few dead bees in the hive or apiary).&lt;ref name = ABJ707/&gt;

In the US in 2006–2007, CCD-suffering operations had a total loss of 45% compared to the total loss of 25% of all colonies experienced by non-CCD suffering beekeepers.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABJ707/&gt;

A 2007–2008 survey of over 19% of all colonies revealed a total loss of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, the same number of colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations were more likely to have this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt;

In 2010, the USDA reported that data on overall honey bee losses for the year indicate an estimated 34% loss, which is statistically similar to losses reported in 2007, 2008, and 2009.&lt;ref name="ars.usda.gov"/&gt; In 2011, the loss was 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/ccd/ccdprogressreport2011.pdf "2011 CCD Progress Report"], United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service.

=== Europe ===
According to the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the [[British Beekeepers Association]] reported the bee population in the United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA study revealed that in Italy the mortality rate was 40–50%. However, EFSA officials point out the figures are not very reliable because before the bees started dying, no harmonisation was used in the way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the varroa mite, two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides.&lt;ref name="BBC NEWS"/&gt;

In 2009, Tim Lovett, president of the British Beekeepers' Association, said: "Anecdotally, it is hugely variable. There are reports of some beekeepers losing almost a third of their hives and others losing none." John Chapple, chairman of the London Beekeepers' Association, put losses among his 150 members at between a fifth and a quarter. "There are still a lot of mysterious disappearances; we are no nearer to knowing what is causing them."  The government's [[National Bee Unit]] continued to deny the existence of CCD in Britain; it attributes the heavy losses to the varroa mite and rainy summers that stop bees foraging for food.&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/02/food-fear-mystery-beehives-collapse | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Alison | last=Benjamin | title=Fears for crops as shock figures from America show scale of bee catastrophe | date=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, David Aston of the British Beekeepers' Association stated, "We still do not believe CCD (which is now better defined) is a cause of colony losses in the UK, however we are continuing to experience colony losses, many if not most of which can be explained." He feels recent studies suggest "further evidence to the evolving picture that there are complex interactions taking place between a number of factors, pathogens, environmental, beekeeping practices and other stressors, which are causing honey bee losses described as CCD in the US".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

Beekeepers in Scotland also reported losses for the past three years.&lt;ref name="Benjamin" /&gt; Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed the losses to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread because of a lack of bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.&lt;ref name="Benjamin"/&gt;

In Germany, where some of the first reports of CCD in Europe appeared, and where, according to the German national association of beekeepers, 40% of the honey bee colonies died,&lt;ref name=Echos&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Mga|url=http://www.lesechos.fr/20/08/2007/LesEchos/19985-063-ECH_la-mort-des-abeilles-met-la-planete-en-danger.htm|title=La mort des abeilles met la planète en danger|work=[[Les Échos (France)|Les Échos]]|date=20 August 2007|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was no scientific confirmation; in early May 2007, the German media reported no confirmed CCD cases seemed to have occurred in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=n-tv|url=http://www.n-tv.de/wissen/Deutschen-Bienen-geht-es-gut-article341072.html|title=Immer weniger Imker&amp;nbsp;– Deutschen Bienen geht es gut|date=11 May 2007|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alison Benjamin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/02/food-fear-mystery-beehives-collapse |title=Fears for crops as shock figures from America show scale of bee catastrophe &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-22|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a report was published stating the first case of CCD, according to more stringent definitions, occurring outside of the US was in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dainat, B., vanEngelsdorp, D. and Neumann, P.|title=Colony collapse disorder in Europe|journal=Environmental Microbiology Reports|volume=4|issue=1|year=2012|pages=123–25|doi=10.1111/j.1758-2229.2011.00312.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of May 2012, the Swiss government reported about half of the bee population had not survived the winter. The main cause of the decline was thought to be the parasite ''[[Varroa destructor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.rts.ch/info/sciences-tech/4011954-hiver-fatal-pour-la-moitie-des-colonies-d-abeilles-en-suisse.html | publisher = Radio Télévision Suissse | date = 22 May 2012 | accessdate = 22 May 2012 |title=Hiver fatal pour la moitié des colonies d'abeilles en Suisse|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, a three-year survey from 2010 to 2013 (using COLOSS questionnaires) showed colony losses of 10.1% on average. Comb renewal and queen problems were identified as significant risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00218839.2016.1193375 Survey results of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony losses in China (2010–2013)].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible causes ==
The mechanisms of CCD are still unknown, but many causes are currently being considered, such as [[Pesticide toxicity to bees|pesticides]], [[mite]]s, fungi, beekeeping practices (such as the use of [[antibiotics]] or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other [[pathogen]]s, and [[immunodeficiency|immunodeficiencies]]. The current scientific consensus is that no single factor is causing CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Colony Collapse Disorder in context | journal = BioEssays | volume =32 | issue = 10 |  pages =845–46 | year =2010 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.201000075/full | accessdate = 5 June 2014 | doi=10.1002/bies.201000075| pmid = 20730842 | last1 = Williams | first1 = Geoffrey R. | last2 = Tarpy | first2 = David R. | last3 = Vanengelsdorp | first3 = Dennis | last4 = Chauzat | first4 = Marie-Pierre | last5 = Cox-Foster | first5 = Diana L. | last6 = Delaplane | first6 = Keith S. | last7 = Neumann | first7 = Peter | last8 = Pettis | first8 = Jeffery S. | last9 = Rogers | first9 = Richard E.

In 2006, the [[Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group]], based primarily at [[Pennsylvania State University]], was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions.&lt;ref name=Prelim/&gt; A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was the leading cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (''Varroa'' mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were the leading cause of colony mortality.&lt;ref name = ABJ707/&gt; A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.&lt;ref name="Oldroyd"/&gt;

In July 2007, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) released a ''CCD Action Plan'', which outlined a strategy for addressing CCD consisting of four main components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colony Collapse Disorder Action Plan |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/ccd/ccd_actionplan.pdf |publisher=[[USDA]] |date=20 June 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; survey and data collection; analysis of samples; hypothesis-driven research; mitigation and preventive action. The first annual report of the U.S. Colony Collapse Disorder Steering Committee was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/c/c7/CCDReport2009.pdf |title=CCD Steering Committee, ''Colony Collapse Disorder Progress Report'' (US Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, 2009) |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718044124/http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/c/c7/CCDReport2009.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It suggested CCD may be caused by the interaction of many agents in combination.&lt;ref name="science-08-01-2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ratnieks |first1=F.L.W. |last2=Carreck |first2=N.L. |title=Clarity on Honey Bee Collapse? |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5962 |pages=152–53 |year=2010 |pmid=20056879 |doi=10.1126/science.1185563|bibcode = 2010Sci...327..152R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the CCD Working Group published a comprehensive descriptive study that concluded: "Of the 61 variables quantified (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single factor was found with enough consistency to suggest one causal agent. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with more pathogens than control populations, suggesting either greater pathogen exposure or reduced defenses in CCD bees."&lt;ref name = "Vanengeletal2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Vanengelsdorp | first1 = D.| last2 = Evans | first2 = J.| last3 = Saegerman | first3 = C.| last4 = Mullin | first4 = C.| last5 = Haubruge | first5 = E.| last6 = Nguyen | first6 = B.| last7 = Frazier | first7 = M.| last8 = Frazier | first8 = J.| last9 = Cox-Foster | first9 = D.| last10 = Chen | first10 = Y.| last11 = Underwood | first11 = R.| last12 = Tarpy | first12 = D.R.| last13 = Pettis | first13 = J.S.| editor1-last = Brown| editor1-first = Justin| title = Colony collapse disorder: a descriptive study| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 4| issue = 8| pages = e6481| year = 2009| pmid = 19649264| pmc = 2715894| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0006481|bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.6481V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second annual Steering Committee report was released in November 2010. The group reported that although many associations—including pesticides, parasites, and pathogens—had been identified throughout the course of research, "it is becoming increasingly clear that no single factor alone is responsible for [CCD]". Their findings indicated an absence of damaging levels of the parasite ''Nosema'' or parasitic ''Varroa'' mites at the time of collapse.&lt;ref name="ars.usda.gov"/&gt; They did find an association of sublethal effects of some pesticides with CCD, including two common miticides in particular, coumaphos and fluvalinate, which are pesticides registered for use by beekeepers to control varroa mites. Studies also identified sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and fungicides, pesticides that may impair the bees' immune systems and may leave them more susceptible to bee viruses.&lt;ref name="ars.usda.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis vanEngelsdorp, [http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=10521 Why are the bees dying?], [[The Real News Network]], 2013.08.04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis vanEngelsdorp, [http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=11484 Stop Selling Bee-Harming Plants], [[The Real News Network]], 2014.02.14&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 review examined 170 studies on colony collapse disorder and stressors for bees, including [[pathogen]]s, [[agrochemical]]s, declining [[biodiversity]], [[climate change]] and more. The review concluded that "a strong argument can be made that it is the interaction among parasites, pesticides, and diet that lies at the heart of current bee health problems."&lt;ref name = "sciencebees"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Bees of all species are likely to encounter multiple stressors during their lives, and each is likely to reduce the ability of bees to cope with the others. A bee or bee colony that appears to have succumbed to a pathogen may not have died if it had not also been exposed to a sublethal dose of a pesticide and/or been subject to food stress (which might in turn be due to drought or heavy rain induced by climate change, or competition from a high density of honey bee hives placed nearby). Unfortunately, conducting well-replicated studies of the effects of multiple interacting stressors on bee colonies is exceedingly difficult. The number of stressor combinations rapidly becomes large, and exposure to stressors is hard or impossible to control with free-flying bees. Nonetheless, a strong argument can be made that it is the interaction among parasites, pesticides, and diet that lies at the heart of current bee health problems."&lt;ref name = "sciencebees"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jrbees"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scientists have long been concerned that pesticides, including possibly some [[fungicide]]s, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Desneux N, Decourtye A, Delpuech JM |date = 2007|title = The sublethal effects of pesticides on beneficial arthropods |journal = [[Annual Review of Entomology]]|volume = 52|pages = 81–106|doi = 10.1146/annurev.ento.52.110405.091440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of special interest is the class of insecticides called [[neonicotinoids]], which contain the active ingredient [[imidacloprid]], and other similar chemicals, such as [[clothianidin]] and [[thiamethoxam]]. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known to work their way through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krupke|first=Christian H.|last2=Hunt|first2=Greg J.|last3=Eitzer|first3=Brian D.|last4=Andino|first4=Gladys|last5=Given|first5=Krispn|date=2012-01-03|title=Multiple Routes of Pesticide Exposure for Honey Bees Living Near Agricultural Fields|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029268|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=1|pages=e29268|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029268|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3250423|pmid=22235278|bibcode=2012PLoSO...729268K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blacquière|first=Tjeerd|last2=Smagghe|first2=Guy|last3=van Gestel|first3=Cornelis A.M.|last4=Mommaerts|first4=Veerle|date=2016-11-21|title=Neonicotinoids in bees: a review on concentrations, side-effects and risk assessment|journal=Ecotoxicology (London, England)|volume=21|issue=4|pages=973–92|doi=10.1007/s10646-012-0863-x|issn=0963-9292|pmc=3338325|pmid=22350105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in [[pneumatic]] planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/13/honeybee-problem-critical-point?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Honeybee problem nearing a 'critical point' |publisher=Guardian |date= 13 January 2012|accessdate=2012-05-24 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.

A 2010 survey reported 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in aggregate concentrations up to 214 ppm in bee pollen; this figure represents over half of the individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. It was suggested that "while exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009754 |title=High Levels of Miticides and Agrochemicals in North American Apiaries: Implications for Honey Bee Health |publisher=[[PLoS ONE]] |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluating pesticide contributions to CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, the variety of pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD makes it difficult to test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances over the course of a season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place [[pollen]] and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.

[[File:Imidacloprid USA 2012.png|thumb|left|Imidacloprid map of use, US, 2012 (estimated)]]
To date, most of the evaluation of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied on the use of surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid [[Imidacloprid effects on bee population|imidacloprid]] (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbgnetwork.org/Ubersicht/Zeitschrift_SWB/SWB_2003/SWB_02_2003/Gaucho_02_03/gaucho_02_03.html|title=Französische Regierung verlängert Teilverbot von Gaucho&amp;nbsp;– Bienensterben jetzt auch in Deutschland|author=Philipp Mimkes|date=February 2003|publisher=[[CGB Network]]|language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on [[termite]]s include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbgnetwork.org/536.html|author=Sven Preger|title=Verstummtes Summen&amp;nbsp;– Französische Forscher: Insektizid ist Grund für Bienensterben|publisher=[[CGB Network]]|date=23 November 2003|language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, about 40 French deputies, led by [[Jacques Remiller]] of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]], requested the creation of a parliamentary investigation commission on overmortality of bees, underlining that honey production had decreased by 1,000 tons a year for a decade. By August 2007, no investigation had opened.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Maria Mancilla, [http://rue89.com/2007/08/29/les-abeilles-sont-elles-en-train-de-disparaitre Les abeilles sont-elles en train de disparaître?], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 29 August 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Five other insecticides based on fipronil were also accused of killing bees.

Research, in 2008, by scientists from Pennsylvania State University found high levels of the pesticides [[fluvalinate]] and [[coumaphos]] in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides.&lt;ref name = "Vanengeletal2010"/&gt; These chemicals have been used to try to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. Researchers from [[Washington State University]], under entomology professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.&lt;ref name="Environment News Service"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists Untangle Multiple Causes of Bee Colony Disorder|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2009/2009-07-29-094.asp|publisher=[[Environment News Service]]|accessdate=20 January 2011|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSU work also focused on the impact of the [[microsporidia]]n pathogen ''[[Nosema ceranae]]'', the build-up of which was high in the majority of the bees tested, even after large doses of the antibiotic [[fumagillin]]. Penn State's Dr. Maryann Frazier said, "Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD. We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors, possibly including mites, viruses and pesticides."&lt;ref name="Environment News Service"/&gt;

In 2010, [[fipronil]] was blamed for the spread of CCD among bees, in a study by the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France, which found that even at very low nonlethal doses, this pesticide still impairs the ability to locate the hive, resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding any of the other symptoms of CCD;&lt;ref name="globo1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lima|first1=P|title=Abelhas com microchip|url=http://revistagloborural.globo.com/GloboRural/0,6993,EEC1707683-5809,00.html|publisher=GloboRural|accessdate=2017-08-20|language=pt|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of fipronil on honey bees.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popups.ulg.ac.be/NFG/document.php?id=1258|title=No acute mortalities in honey bee colonies (''Apis mellifera'') after the exposure to sunflower cultures|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (''[[Vespula germanica]]'') and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads the pesticide among the brood.&lt;ref name="autogenerated811"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1603/0022-0493-94.4.811 |last1=Sackmann |first1=P |last2=Rabinovich |first2=M |last3=Corley |first3=JC |title=Successful removal of German yellowjackets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) by toxic baiting |journal=[[Journal of Economic Entomology]] |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=811–16 |year=2001 |pmid=11561837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large 2010 survey of healthy and CCD-affected colonies also revealed elevated levels of pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations have led to the hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.&lt;ref name="ars.usda.gov"/&gt;

In 2010, a sequencing of the honey bee genome provided a possible explanation for the sensitivity of bees to pesticides. Its genome is deficient in the number of genes encoding detoxification enzymes, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione-S-transferases, and carboxylesterases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pesticides and honey bee toxicity – USA|last = Johnson|first = Reed|date = 2010|journal = Apidologie|doi = 10.1051/apido/2010018|volume=41|issue = 3|pages=312–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, researchers announced findings that sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered honey bees significantly more susceptible to infection by the fungus ''Nosema'', thereby suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that ''Nosema'' is increasingly considered to contribute to CCD.&lt;ref name=Pettis/&gt;

Neonicotinoids may interfere with bees' natural homing abilities, causing them to become disoriented and preventing them from finding their way back to the hive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6079/351.abstract |title=Neonicotinoid Pesticide Reduces Bumble Bee Colony Growth and Queen Production |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelland |first=Kate |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/29/science-pesticides-bees-idUSL6E8ET2JM20120329 |title=Studies show how pesticides make bees lose their way |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date= 29 March 2012|accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6079/348.abstract |title=A Common Pesticide Decreases Foraging Success and Survival in Honey Bees |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 2012, researchers in Italy published findings that the pneumatic drilling machines that plant corn seeds coated with clothianidin and imidacloprid release large amounts of the pesticide into the air, causing significant mortality in foraging honey bees. According to the study, "Experimental results show that the environmental release of particles containing neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with colony losses phenomena observed by beekeepers."&lt;ref name=Tapparo/&gt; Commonly used pesticides, such as the imidacloprid, reduce colony growth and new queen production in experimental exposure matched to field levels.&lt;ref name=whitehorn&gt;{{cite web|title=Neonicotinoid Pesticide Reduces Bumble Bee Colony Growth and Queen Production |first1=Penelope R. |last1=Whitehorn |first2=Stephanie |last2=O'Connor |first3=Felix L. |last3=Wackers |first4=Dave |last4=Goulson |date=29 March 2012 |page=1 |doi=10.1126/science.1215025  |work=Sciencexpress |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/recent|bibcode=2012Sci...336..351W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lu ''et al.''

A 2012 ''in situ'' study provided strong  evidence that exposure to sublethal levels of imidacloprid in [[high fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) used to feed honey bees when forage is not available causes bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks after imidacloprid dosing. The researchers suggested, "the observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies."&lt;ref name="Lu2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Chensheng| last1=Lu |first2=Kenneth M. |last2=Warchol |first3=Richard A. |last3=Callahan |year=2012|title=''In situ'' replication of honey bee colony collapse disorder|journal=[[Bulletin of Insectology]]|volume=65|issue=1|pages=99–106|url=http://www.bulletinofinsectology.org/pdfarticles/vol65-2012-099-106lu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/pesticide-tied-to-bee-colony-collapse/ |title=Pesticide tied to bee colony collapse |publisher=[[Harvard Gazette]] |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bees Collecting Pollen 2004-08-14.jpg|left|thumb|Bees collecting pollen]]In July 2013, scientists from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found that a combination of pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by ''Nosema ceranae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/107970/scientists-discover-whats-killing-the-bees-and-its-worse-than-you-thought/|title=Scientists discover what's killing the bees and it's worse than you thought|first=Todd|last=Woody|date=July 24, 2013|publisher=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis study published in February 2016 strongly suggests a pattern linking imidacloprid to sublethal effects on honey bees, stating: "trace dietary imidacloprid at field-realistic levels in nectar will have no lethal effects, but will reduce expected performance in honey bees by between 6 and 20%. Statistical power analysis showed that published field trials that have reported no effects on honey bees from neonicotinoids were incapable of detecting these predicted sublethal effects with conventionally accepted levels of certainty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A meta-analysis of experiments testing the effects of a neonicotinoid insecticide (imidacloprid) on honey bees |author=James E.

[[File:Pollinationn.jpg|thumb|Pollination]]In March 2013, professional beekeepers and environmentalists jointly filed a lawsuit against the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for continuing to allow the use of neonicotinoids in the United States. The suit specifically asks for suspension of clothianidin and thiamethoxam. The lawsuit follows a dramatic die off of bees in the United States, with some beekeepers losing 50% of their hives.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|last=Wozniacka|first=Gosia|title=Beekeepers sue EPA to ban pesticide, protect bees|url=https://news.yahoo.com/beekeepers-sue-epa-ban-pesticide-194327726.html|accessdate=22 August 2013|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA responded to the suit by issuing a report blaming the ''Varroa'' mite for the decline in bees and claiming the role of neonicotinoids in bee extinction has been overstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyle|first=Alan|title=Pesticides aren't the biggest factor in honeybee die-off, EPA and USDA say|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/pesticides-arent-biggest-factor-honeybee-die-epa-usda-say-6C9745740|accessdate=22 August 2013|newspaper=[[NBC News]]|date=2 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123222126/http://www.nbcnews.com/science/pesticides-arent-biggest-factor-honeybee-die-epa-usda-say-6C9745740|archivedate=23 January 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathogens and immunodeficiency theories ===
{{Further|Pathogen|immunodeficiency|diseases of the honey bee}}
Early researchers  commented that the pathway of propagation functions in the manner of a [[contagious disease]]; however, some sentiment existed that the disorder may involve an [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] mechanism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date = 23 January 2007|title =Colony Collapse Disorder|publisher = Pennsylvania State University|volume = 26|issue = 1|url = http://fruittimes.cas.psu.edu/FT2601.html#Colony|work = Fruit Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially linked to  "stress" leading to a weakened immune system. Specifically, according to research done in 2007 at the Pennsylvania State University: "The magnitude of detected infectious agents in the adult bees suggests some type of immunosuppression". These researchers initially suggested a connection between ''[[Varroa destructor]]'' mite infestation and CCD, suggesting that a combination of these bee mites, [[Deformed Wing Virus|deformed wing virus]] (which the mites transmit) and bacteria work together to suppress immunity and may be one cause of CCD.&lt;ref name=Prelim/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beemites"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/05/050517110843.htm|title=Bee Mites Suppress Bee Immunity, Open Door For Viruses And Bacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parasites, such as varroa mites ''(Varroa destructor''), honey bee tracheal mites ''(Acarapis woodi)'', fungal, bacterial and viral diseases, and kleptoparasites such as small hive beetles (''Aethina tumida''), are all problems that have been introduced within the last 20 years in the continental U.S., and are faced by beekeepers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When a colony is dying, for whatever cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a [[bee yard]]), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions for their own use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, in typical CCD cases, provisions of dying colonies are not robbed, suggesting that toxins do not spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation,&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{cite news|author = JR Minkel|title = Mysterious Honeybee Disappearance Linked to Rare Virus|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bees-ccd-virus&amp;page=1|work = Science News|publisher = Scientific American|date = 7 September 2007|accessdate = 2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.&lt;ref name = "Vanengeletal2010"/&gt;

==== ''Varroa'' mites ====
According to a 2007 article, the [[mite]] ''[[Varroa destructor]]'' remains the world's most destructive honey bee killer, due in part to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and [[acute bee paralysis virus]], which have both been implicated in CCD.&lt;ref name=Beemites/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, Jennifer (7 June 2012) [http://www.livescience.com/20815-honeybee-collapse-mite-virus.html Mites and Virus Team Up to Wipe Out Beehives] Live Science, Retrieved 11 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Affliction with ''Varroa'' mites also tends to weaken the [[immune system]] of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the [[University of Guelph]] in Canada, studied 413 [[Ontario]] bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of ''Varroa'' mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the ''Varroa'' mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzmán-Novoa|first1=Ernesto|last2=Eccles|first2=Leslie|last3=Calvete|first3=Yireli|last4=Mcgowan|first4=Janine|last5=Kelly|first5=Paul G.|last6=Correa-Benítez|first6=Adriana|title=''Varroa destructor'' is the main culprit for the death and reduced populations of overwintered honey bee (''Apis mellifera'') colonies in Ontario, Canada|journal=Apidologie|date=8 January 2010|volume=41|issue=4|pages=443–450|doi=10.1051/apido/2009076}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Varroa'' mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Colony Collapse Disorder: A Descriptive Study|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006481|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2009-08-03|pmc = 2715894|pmid = 19649264|pages = e6481|volume = 4|issue = 8|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0006481|first = Dennis|last = vanEngelsdorp|first2 = Jay D.|last2 = Evans|first3 = Claude|last3 = Saegerman|first4 = Chris|last4 = Mullin|first5 = Eric|last5 = Haubruge|first6 = Bach Kim|last6 = Nguyen|first7 = Maryann|last7 = Frazier|first8 = Jim|last8 = Frazier|first9 = Diana|last9 = Cox-Foster|bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.6481V}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''Varroa'' mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pestalert.ifas.ufl.edu/Colony_Collapse_Disorder.htm|author= Jamie Ellis|title=Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) in Honey Bees|publisher=University of Florida|date=16 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118144423/http://pestalert.ifas.ufl.edu/Colony_Collapse_Disorder.htm|archivedate=18 January 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Varroa destructor'' is a parasitic mite that colonizes beehives and preys on honey bees by consuming their hemolymph. ''Varroa'' mites parasitize all types of honey bees (workers, nurse bees, larvae) depending on their life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, ''Varroa'' prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness leading into the reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during their reproductive stage and increased fitness leads to an increase in mite fecundity (# of female offspring).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Xianbing|last2=Huang|first2=Zachary Y.|last3=Zeng|first3=Zhijiang|date=2016-06-15|title=Why do Varroa mites prefer nurse bees?|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep28228|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep28228|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4908398|pmid=27302644|page=28228|bibcode=2016NatSR...628228X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to ''Varroa''{{'}}s ability to feed on all types of honey bees, they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter.

==== Israeli acute paralysis virus ====
In 2004, [[Israeli acute paralysis virus]] (IAPV), was discovered in [[Israel]] and at one time it was considered the cause of CCD. It was named after the place it was first identified; its place of origin is unknown. In September 2007, results of a large-scale statistical [[RNA]] [[sequencing]] study of afflicted and unafflicted colonies were reported. RNA from all organisms in a colony was sequenced and compared with sequence databases to detect the presence of pathogens.  All colonies were found to be infected with numerous pathogens, but only the IAPV virus showed a significant association with CCD: the virus was found in 25 of the 30 tested CCD colonies, and only in one of the 21 tested non-CCD colonies.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytvirus&gt;{{cite news|author = Andrew C. Refkin|title = Virus Is Seen as Suspect in Death of Honeybees|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/science/07bees.html|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = 7 September 2007|accessdate = 2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in 2009 has found that an indicator for an impaired protein production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that [[Dicistroviridae]], like the IAPV, cause degradation of the [[ribosome]]s, which are responsible for [[protein synthesis|protein production]] of [[cell (biology)|cells]], and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them more vulnerable to factors that might not otherwise be lethal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090824151256.htm ''Genomic Study Yields Plausible Cause Of Colony Collapse Disorder''] at [[Science Daily]] on 2009-8-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=R.M. |last2=Evans |first2=J.D. |last3=Robinson |first3=G.E. |last4=Berenbaum |first4=M.R. |title=Changes in transcript abundance relating to colony collapse disorder in honey bees (Apis mellifera) |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=35 |pages=14790–95 |year=2009 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0906970106 |pmc=2736458 |pmid=19706391|bibcode = 2009PNAS..10614790J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Nosema'' ====
Some have suggested the syndrome may be an inability by beekeepers to correctly identify known diseases such as [[European foulbrood]] or the [[microsporidia]]n fungus ''[[Nosema apis]]''. The testing and diagnosis of samples from affected colonies (already performed) makes this highly unlikely, as the symptoms are fairly well known and differ from what is classified as CCD. A high rate of ''Nosema'' infection was reported in samples of bees from Pennsylvania, but this pattern was not reported from samples elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Prelim/&gt;

When healthy bees are fed pollen filled with fungicides, insecticides and other agriculture chemicals, they are more likely to be infected by ''[[Nosema ceranae]]'', a parasitic microsporidian fungus associated with widespread death of honey bees.&lt;ref name="Benjamin2013" /&gt;  Hives of western honey bees infected with ''Nosema ceranae'' are wiped out within eight days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Higes |first1=M |last2=Martin |first2=R |last3=Meana |first3=A |title=''Nosema ceranae'', a new microsporidian parasite in honeybees in Europe |journal=Journal of Invertebrate Pathology |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=93–95 |year=2006 |pmid=16574143 |doi=10.1016/j.jip.2006.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that CCD may be caused by ''N. ceranae''.

=== Fungicides ===
In 2013, researchers collected pollen from hives and fed it to healthy bees.  The pollen had an average of nine different pesticides and fungicides.  Further, the researchers discovered that bees that ate pollen with fungicides were three times more likely to be infected by parasites. Their study shows that fungicides, thought harmless to bees, may actually play a significant role in CCD. Their research also showed that spraying practices may need to be reviewed because the bees sampled by the authors foraged not from crops, but almost exclusively from weeds and wildflowers, suggesting that bees are more widely exposed to pesticides than thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070182 | title= Crop Pollination Exposes Honey Bees to Pesticides Which Alters Their Susceptibility to the Gut Pathogen Nosema ceranae | journal=PLoS ONE | volume= 8 | issue= 7 | pages= e70182 |author= Jeffery S.

[[Dennis vanEngelsdorp]], an entomologist at the University of Maryland, has been quoted as saying "Fungicides, which we didn't expect to harm insects, seem to have a sub-lethal effect on bee health".  He went on further to state this is important because fungicides are not heavily regulated.&lt;ref name="Benjamin2013" /&gt;

=== Antibiotics and miticides ===
Most beekeepers affected by CCD report that they use [[antibiotic]]s and [[Acaricide|miticides]] in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use&lt;ref name=Prelim/&gt; makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, it is possible that not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Oldroyd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawthorne DJ, Dively GP | year = 2011 | title = Killing Them with Kindness? In-Hive Medications May Inhibit Xenobiotic Efflux Transporters and Endanger Honey Bees | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 11| page = e26796 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0026796 |bibcode = 2011PLoSO...6E6796H | editor1-last = Smagghe | editor1-first = Guy | pmid=22073195 | pmc=3206626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of ''Varroa'' infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides for an extended period of time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Roy M.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Steen L.|last3=Kryger|first3=Per|date=2013-03-19|title=Varroa-Virus Interaction in Collapsing Honey Bee Colonies|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057540|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=3|pages=e57540|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0057540|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3602523|pmid=23526946|bibcode=2013PLoSO...857540F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fluvalinate/coumaphos ====
In 2008 high levels of the pesticides [[fluvalinate]] and [[coumaphos]] were found in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides.&lt;ref name = "Vanengeletal2010"/&gt; These chemicals have been used to try to eradicate [[varroa mite]]s, a bee pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. A 2009 study confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between the pesticide and reduced bee longevity.&lt;ref name="Environment News Service"/&gt; ''Nosema ceranae'', was found in high concentrations in the majority of the bees tested, even after administering large doses of the antibiotic [[fumagillin]]. Maryann Frazier commented, "Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD. We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors, possibly including mites, viruses and pesticides."&lt;ref name="Environment News Service"/&gt;

===Climate change===
Environmental changes may have an effect on honey bee development, but the precise impact of potential environmental changes on honey bees as a result of climate change is unknown.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Conte, Y.L. |author2=Navajas, M. |date=2008|title=Climate change: impact on honey bee populations and diseases|journal=Rev Sci Tech off Int Epiz |volume=27 |pages=499–510|pmid=18819674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bee rentals and migratory beekeeping ===
{{Further|Beekeeping}}
Since U.S. beekeeper [[Nephi Miller]] first began moving his hives to different areas of the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Berenbaum|first = Prof. May R.|title = Colony Collapse Disorder and Pollinator Decline|work = Presentation to Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture, U.S. House of Representatives|publisher = The National Academies|date = 29 March 2007|url = http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/testimony/Colony_Collapse_Disorder_and_Pollinator_Decline.asp|accessdate = 2007-10-22 }}, specifically, ''"Close to 100 crop species in the U.S. rely to some degree on pollination services provided by this one species—collectively, these crops make up approximately 1/3 of the U.S. diet [...] Although economists differ in calculating the exact dollar value of honey bee pollination to American agriculture, virtually all estimates are in the range of billions of dollars"''.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.

Researchers are concerned that trucking colonies around the country to pollinate crops, where they intermingle with other bees from all over, helps spread viruses and mites among colonies. Additionally, such continuous movement and re-settlement is considered by some a strain and disruption for the entire hive, possibly rendering it less resistant to all sorts of systemic disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1FF8355A0C748EDDAB0894DF404482|author=Alexi Barrionuevo|title=Honeybees, Gone With the Wind, Leave Crops and Keepers in Peril|publisher=New York Times|date=27 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selective commercial breeding and lost genetic diversity in industrial apiculture ===
Most of the focus on CCD has been toward environmental factors. CCD is a condition recognised for greatest impact in regions of 'industrial' or agricultural use of commercially bred bee colonies. Natural breeding and colony reproduction of wild bees is a complex and highly selective process, leading to a [[genetic diversity|diverse genetic makeup]] in large populations of bees, both within&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibra.org.uk/articles/20100421_1 |title=Levels of polyandry and intracolonial genetic relationships in Apis koschevnikovi – International Bee Research Association |publisher=Ibra.org.uk |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401094244/http://www.ibra.org.uk/articles/20100421_1 |archivedate=1 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and between colonies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Genetic diversity]] through sexual reproduction is a significant evolutionary factor in resistance to parasites and infectious diseases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Many artificially bred species, especially domestic and agricultural species, suffer from lack of genetic variation. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} resulting in increased risk of hereditable diseases, loss of vitality or [[heterosis|vigour]], and heightened uniform susceptibility to infectious diseases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} There may be an analogy in artificially introduced invasive ants, which displace native species by their [[ecological release]] and supercolonies (a manifestation of genetic homogeneity), only to suffer collapse of colonies attributed to lack of genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sponsored by |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21540980 |title=Invasive species: Boom and bust |publisher=The Economist |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The widespread collapse of an invasive species: Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in New Zealand |first1=Meghan |last1=Cooling |first2=Stephen |last2=Hartley |first3=Dalice A. |last3=Sim |first4=Philip J. |last4=Lester |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/11/22/rsbl.2011.1014.abstract?sid=971f3ea6-dadd-47bd-b782-dd0c9d47be45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displaced indigenous species rebounded from residual populations.

Industrial apiculture has adopted simple breeding programs for uniform desired traits, and seasonal transportation of colonies over vast distances causes increased infectious exposures from mixing of these domestic and residual displaced wild populations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Brood incubation conditions may be stressful with respect to deficient nutrition, temperature&lt;ref name="Oldroyd" /&gt; and other basics. This combination of ecological factors, especially the host factor of loss of genetic variation and [[hybrid vigor]], may account for the apparent multifactorial environmental 'causes' of CCD including concurrent infections.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

=== Malnutrition ===
In 2007, one of the patterns reported by the CCD Study Group at Pennsylvania State was that all producers in a preliminary survey noted a period of "extraordinary stress" affecting the colonies in question prior to their die-off, most commonly involving poor nutrition and/or drought.&lt;ref name="Prelim" /&gt; This was the only factor that ''all'' of the cases of CCD had in common in the report; accordingly, there appeared to be at least some significant possibility that the phenomenon was correlated to nutritional stress that may not manifest in healthy, well-nourished colonies. This was similar to the findings of another independent survey done in 2007 in which small-scale beekeeping operations (up to 500 colonies) in several states reported their belief that malnutrition and/or weak colonies was the factor responsible for their bees dying in over 50% of the cases, whether the losses were believed to be due to CCD or not.&lt;ref name="ABJ707" /&gt;

Some researchers have attributed the syndrome to the practice of feeding [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) to supplement winter stores. The variability of HFCS may be relevant to the apparent inconsistencies of results. One European writer has suggested a possible connection with HFCS produced from [[genetically modified maize|genetically modified corn]].&lt;ref name=sueddeutsche /&gt; &lt;!-- However, at least one researcher states that if this were the sole factor involved, this should also lead to the exclusive appearance of CCD in wintering colonies being fed HFCS, but many reports of CCD occur in other contexts with beekeepers who do not use HFCS. -This sentence is sourced to J. Bromenshenk, Professor of Research Division of Biological Sciences at the University of Montana, one of the primary researchers into the CCD phenomenon. I'm sure there is a better source somewhere, but in the meantime his comments on this topic can be found in the BEE-L archives (http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/archives/bee-l.html). --&gt;

Other researchers state that colony collapse disorder is mainly a problem of feeding the bees a [[monoculture]] diet when they should receive food from a variety of sources/plants. In winter, these bees are given a single food source such as [[corn syrup]] (high-fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer, they may only pollinate a single crop (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1884835,00.html|title=Postcard from Hughson|last=Pickert|first=Kate |date=12 March 2009|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monoculture diet is attributed to bee rentals and migratory bee keeping. Honey bees are only being introduced to select commercial crops such as corn. These single pollen diets are greatly inferior to mixed pollen diets. However, there are a few pollens that are acceptable for honey bees to be introduced to exclusively, including [[Melilotus|sweet clover]] and [[Mustard plant|mustard]].&lt;ref name="Brodschneider 278–294"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodschneider|first1=Robert|last2=Crailsheim|first2=Karl|title=Nutrition and health in honey bees|journal=Apidologie|date=21 April 2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=278–294|doi=10.1051/apido/2010012}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drohnenpuppen 79d.jpg|thumb|left|Pupae of honeybee drones in opened cells at both sides of a honeycomb. The drones at the right side are some days older and more developed.]]

A study published in 2010 found that bees that were fed pollen from a variety of different plant species showed signs of having a healthier immune system than those eating pollen from a single species. Bees fed pollen from five species had higher levels of [[glucose oxidase]] than bees fed pollen from one species, even if the pollen had a higher protein content. The authors hypothesised that CCD may be linked to a loss of plant diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8467746.stm Bee decline linked to falling biodiversity] Richard Black, BBC News, 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Researches found a proper diet that does lead to a healthy honey bee population. "The authors recommended a diet containing 1000 ppm potassium, 500 ppm calcium,300 ppm magnesium and 50 ppm each of sodium, zinc, manganese, iron and copper."&lt;ref name="Brodschneider 278–294"/&gt;

A 2013 study found that [[p-Coumaric acid|''p''-Coumaric acid]], which is normally present in honey, assists bees in detoxifying certain pesticides. Its absence in artificial nutrients fed to bees may therefore contribute to CCD.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1303884110  | title = Honey constituents up-regulate detoxification and immunity genes in the western honey bee Apis mellifera | year = 2013 | vauthors = Mao W, Schuler MA, Berenbaum MR | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | issue = 29 April 2013 | volume = 110 | pages = 8842–46|bibcode = 2013PNAS..110.8842M | pmid=23630255 | pmc=3670375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electromagnetic radiation ===
A study on the non-thermal effects of [[radio frequency]] (RF) on honey bees (''[[Carniolan honey bee|Apis mellifera carnica]]'') reported there were no changes in behavior due to RF exposure from [[DECT]] [[Cordless telephone|cordless phone]] base stations operating at 1,880–1,900&amp;nbsp;MHz&lt;ref name="Stever Kuhn 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Stever, H. |author2=J.

In April 2007, news of this study appeared in various media outlets, beginning with an article in ''[[The Independent]]'', which stated that the subject of the study included mobile phones and had related them to CCD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/are-mobile-phones-wiping-out-our-bees-444768.html Are mobile phones wiping out our bees?] The Independent.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Mobile phone|cellular phones]] were implicated by other media reports at the time, they were not covered in the study. Researchers involved have since stated that their research did not include findings on cell phones, or their relationship to CCD, and indicated that the ''Independent'' article had misinterpreted their results and created "a horror story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/22/news/wireless23.php|title=Wireless: Case of the disappearing bees creates a buzz about cellphones|author=Eric Sylvers|date=22 April 2007|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203191231/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/22/news/wireless23.php|archivedate=2009-02-03|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Researchers: Often-cited study doesn't relate to bee colony collapse|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070422/GJNEWS_01/104220119|date=22 April 2007|author=Chloe Johnson|publisher=[[Foster's Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of 919 peer-reviewed scientific studies investigating the effects of EMF on wildlife, humans and plants&lt;ref&gt;[http://moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/final_mobile_towers_report.pdf Report on possible impact of communication tower on wildlife birds and bees] Ministry of Environment and Forests, GOI 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102091739/http://moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/final_mobile_towers_report.pdf |date=2 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included seven studies involving honey bees; six of these reported negative effects from exposure to EMF radiation, but none specifically demonstrated any link to CCD. The review noted that according to one study,&lt;ref name=Sahib2011&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sainudeen Sahib, S. |year= 2011| title=Impact of mobile phone on the density of Honey Bees | journal = Mun. Ent. Zool.| url=http://www.munisentzool.org/yayin/vol6/issue1/396-399.pdf |format=PDF|volume=6|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; when active mobile phones were kept inside beehives, worker bees stopped coming to the hives after 10 days. The same study also found drastic decrease in the egg production of queen bees in these colonies and stated "electromagnetic radiation exposure provides a better explanation for Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) than other theories".  The review authors concluded: "existing literature shows that the EMRs are interfering with the biological systems in more ways than one" and recommended recognising EMF as a pollutant. However, they also noted that "these studies are not representative of the real life situations or natural levels of EMF exposure. More studies need to be taken up to scientifically establish the link, if any, between the observed abnormalities and disorders in bee hives such as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)".

=== Parasitic phorid fly ===
In 2012, a parasitic fly (''[[Apocephalus borealis]]'') larva, known to prey on bumble bees and wasps, was found in a test tube containing a dead honey bee believed to have been affected by CCD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaex.edu/news/january2012/0113Zombees.html |title=Zom-bees? Parasitic fly of bees different from fire-ant attacker |publisher=Uaex.edu |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   possibly indicating the [[Phoridae|phorid]] fly may be one cause of CCD. The mature fly lays eggs in the bee's abdomen, which feed on the bee after hatching. Infected bees behave abnormally, foraging at night and gathering around lights like moths. Eventually the bee leaves the colony to die. The phorid fly larvae then emerge from the neck of the bee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029639|title=A New Threat to Honey Bees, the Parasitic Phorid Fly Apocephalus borealis|accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/01/03/parasitic-fly-spotted-in-honeybees-causes-workers-to-abandon-colonies/|title=Parasitic fly spotted in honeybees, causes workers to abandon colonies|accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetically modified crops ===
In 2008 a meta-analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duan | first1 = JJ | last2 = Marvier | first2 = M | last3 = Huesing | first3 = J | last4 = Dively | first4 = G | last5 = Huang | first5 = ZY. | year = 2008 | title = A meta-analysis of effects of Bt crops on honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 1| page = e1415 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001415 | pmid=18183296 | pmc=2169303|bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.1415D }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 25 independent studies assessing effects of [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt]] Cry proteins on honeybee survival (mortality) showed that Bt proteins used in commercialized [[genetically modified crops|GE crops]] to control lepidopteran and coleopteran pests do not negatively impact the survival of honeybee larvae or adults. Additionally, larvae consume only a small percent of their protein from pollen, and there is also a lack of geographic correlation between GM crop locations and regions where CCD occurs.&lt;ref name=lemaux&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lemaux | first1 = Peggy G. | year =  2009| title = Genetically Engineered Plants and Foods: A Scientist's Analysis of the Issues (Part II) | url = | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 511–59 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092013 | pmid = 19400729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
[[File:Beekeeper keeping bees.jpg|thumb|Beekeeper managing bees]]{{As of|2007|3|alt=As of 1 March 2007}}, the [[Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium]] (MAAREC) offered the following tentative recommendations for beekeepers noticing the symptoms of CCD:&lt;ref name="MAAREC"/&gt;

# Do not combine collapsing colonies with strong colonies.
# When a collapsed colony is found, store the equipment where you can use preventive measures to ensure that bees will not have access to it.
# If you feed your bees sugar syrup, use [[Fumagillin]].
# If you are experiencing colony collapse and see a secondary infection, such as [[European foulbrood|European Foulbrood]], treat the colonies with [[oxytetracycline]], not [[tylosin]].

Another proposed remedy for farmers of pollinated crops is simply to switch from using beekeepers to the use of [[native bee]]s, such as [[bumble bee]]s and [[mason bee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/nativebee.html |title=Alternative Pollinators: Native Bees (Summary) |publisher=Attra.ncat.org |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/40824563/Alternative-Pollinators-Native-Bees |title=Alternative Pollinators: Native Bees |publisher=Scribd.com |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationinformation.org/partners/090107/rnt2.asp |title=Establishing a healthy population of native bees on your land |publisher=Conservationinformation.org |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/06/beecounting/ |title=Use of native bees to counter colony collapse disorder |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=2010-06-22 |first=Alexis |last=Madrigal |date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a national bee database was set up in March 2009 to monitor colony collapse as a result of a 15% reduction in the bee population that had taken place over the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prince|first1=Rosa|title=National Bee Database to be set up to monitor colony collapse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/4963510/National-Bee-Database-to-be-set-up-to-monitor-colony-collapse.html|accessdate=2017-08-20|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=9 March 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the register, funded by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] and administered by the [[National Bee Unit]], will be used to monitor health trends and help establish whether the honey industry is under threat from supposed colony collapse disorder. Britain's 20,000 beekeepers have been invited to participate. In October 2010, David Aston of the British Beekeepers' Association stated, "We still do not believe CCD is a cause of colony losses in the UK, however we are continuing to experience colony losses, many if not most of which can be explained. The approach being taken in UK beekeeping is to raise the profile of integrated bee health management, in other words identifying and trying to eliminate factors that reduce the health status of a colony. This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions."&lt;ref name="BBC NEWS"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739798.stm | work=BBC News | title=Why are Europe's bees dying? | date=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/beekeeping/8050583/Study-finds-causes-of-Colony-Collapse-Disorder-in-bees.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ian | last=Douglas | title=Study finds causes of Colony Collapse Disorder in bees | date=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic and ecological impact ==
{{see also|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}
Honey bees are not native to [[the Americas]], therefore their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in [[monoculture]] situations—where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).

The phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as [[almond]] growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Nesting site density and distribution affect Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) reproductive success and almond yield in a commercial orchard|last = Artz|first = DR|date = November 2013|journal = Insect Conservation and Diversity|doi = 10.1111/icad.12026|volume=6|issue = 6|pages=715–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Morse, R.A. |author2=Calderone, N.W. |title=The value of honey ees as pollinators of US crops in 2000 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |year=2000 |url=http://www.beeculture.com/content/PollinationReprint07.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815060751/http://www.beeculture.com/content/PollinationReprint07.pdf |archivedate=15 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almonds.com/pollination|title=Honey Bees Are Essential for a Successful Almond Crop|publisher=California Almonds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.&lt;ref name="Oldroyd" /&gt;

They are responsible for [[pollination]] of approximately one third of the United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, [[peach]]es, apples, pears, [[cherry|cherries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[Cranberry|cranberries]], [[watermelon]]s, [[cantaloupe]]s, [[cucumber]]s, and [[strawberry|strawberries]]. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., [[squash bee]]s on cucurbits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Vincent J. |last1=Tepedino |date=April 1981 |title=The Pollination Efficiency of the Squash Bee (''Peponapis pruinosa'') and the Honey Bee (''Apis mellifera'') on Summer Squash (''Cucurbita pepo'') |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=359–77 |jstor=25084168}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).

However, even though on a per-individual basis, many other species are actually more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or as effectively as honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via [[saturation pollination]] for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the [[beekeeping]] industry. In [[PRC|China]], hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly.&lt;ref&gt;Partap, Uma Partap and Tej. Pollination of apples in China. 2 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Partap, U.M.A.|author2=T.E.J. Partap |author3=H.E.

In regions of the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (''Apis mellifera'') are among the most important pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for human societies (to sustain food resources).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:32251|title = Global honey bee colony disorders and other threats to insect pollinators|date = 2010|last = Kluser|first = S|last2 = Neumann|first2 = P|quote="Pollination services are provided both by wild, free-living organisms (mainly bees, but also to name a few many butterflies, moths and flies), and by commercially managed bee species. Bees are the predominant and most economically important group of pollinators in most geographical regions."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where honeybee populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534710000364|title = Global pollinator declines: trends, impacts and drivers|date = June 2010|last = Potts|first = Simon|last2 = Biesmeijer|first2 = Jacobus|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2010.01.007|volume=25|issue = 6|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|pages=345–53|pmid=20188434}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees to pollinate them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better and healthier fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specialist plants that require honeybees will be at more risk if honeybees decline, whereas generalist plants that use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer less because they have other sources of pollination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With that said, honeybees perform some level of pollination of nearly 75% of all plant species directly used for human food worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534705001333|title = Buzziness as usual?

Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because of dependence on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for honeybee pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Background==
Serious crimes were very uncommon in Bhutan throughout most of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=LIC&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bt0087) A Country Study: Bhutan] ''Federal Research Division'', ''[[Library of Congress]]''&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports of increased criminal activity since the 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name=LIC/&gt; The main causes of the rise in crime are the influx of foreign laborers, widening economic disparities, and more contact with foreign cultures.&lt;ref name=LIC/&gt;&lt;ref name="WPE98"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1999, [[television]] was introduced in the country and Bhutan became the last nation in the world to have television.&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,975769,00.html Fast forward into trouble] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of television is often regarded as incompatible with Bhutanese culture and a cause behind the increase in crime.  An editorial in ''[[Kuensel]]'', the national newspaper of Bhutan, suggested:
{{quotation|We are seeing for the first time broken families, school dropouts and other negative youth crimes. We are beginning to see crime associated with drug users all over the world - [[shoplifting]], [[burglary]] and violence."&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN/&gt;}}

A study conducted by some Bhutanese academics found that [[cable television]] has caused strong desire for western products among the people of the country and resulted in the increase in crime rate.&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN/&gt;

==Non-political crime==
[[Violent crime]] is extremely low in Bhutan.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/india/publications/south_Asia_Regional_Profile_Sept_2005/09_bhutan.pdf Bhutan] ''[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of [[theft]] are low.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; [[Petty crime]] like [[pickpocketing]] are occasionally reported in the country.&lt;ref name=BCA/&gt; Juvenile crime has relatively increased; the highest rate of juvenile crime was reported in 2003, and 63 youths were convicted across the nation.&lt;ref name="WPE98"/&gt; [[Rape]] is not an extensive problem; in 1999 only 10 incidents of rape were reported in Bhutan.&lt;ref name=SDSUBHUTAN/&gt; Homicide rate is low. In 1998, homicide rate per 100,000 citizens was 2.78.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; Bhutan is a source and transit country for [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; Women are trafficked from Bhutan to other countries for commercial sexual exploitation. But Bhutan is not a destination country; women from other nations are not trafficked into Bhutan.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;

In April 2002, Bhutan suffered a wave of crime.&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN/&gt; Although there were some reports of [[fraud]], violence and few cases of [[homicide]] from many towns and villages, Bhutan never experienced serious violation of law before it.&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN/&gt; The first case of corruption in Bhutan was reported on April 5, 2002, when Parop Tshering, a 42-year-old chief accountant of the State Trading Corporation, was charged with [[embezzlement]].&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN/&gt; Four cases of [[white-collar crime]] and violent crime were reported in April 2003.&lt;ref name="WPE98"/&gt;

In the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] 2012, Bhutan is ranked 33rd out of 174 countries for corruption (least corrupt countries are at the top of the list).&lt;ref name=TICPI2012&gt;[http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results/#myAnchor1] ''[[Transparency International]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutan ranks as the least corrupt nation in South Asia and sixth least corrupt in Asia (after, in order, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Qatar and UAE).&lt;ref name=TICPI2012/&gt;

==Drug-related crime==
Slight drug abuse has appeared in the country. Free trade with neighboring [[India]], presence of porous borders and the refugee population make Bhutan vulnerable to drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; Bhutan has proximity to certain areas in [[Nepal]] and [[North-East India]] where [[Intravenous drug use (recreational)|intravenous drug use]] is relatively high.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; Due to such geographical location, Bhutan also becomes vulnerable to an increase in intravenous drug use.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; [[Marijuana]], which grows as a shrub in Bhutan, was only used to feed pigs before the introduction of television.&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN/&gt; But hundreds were arrested in recent years for using marijuana.&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN/&gt; Use of [[amphetamines]] and [[benzodiazepines]] smuggled from India is rising in [[Thimpu]] and in the Southern Bhutan.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; However, drug trafficking and production of [[opium]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and other drugs is not any significant problem in the country.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;

Alcohol consumption is the most serious addiction related problem in the nation. Alcohol abuse is reported in nearly 80% cases associated with [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;

There are some characteristics of the situation on drug abuse in Bhutan.
*Most of the users of narcotic substances are male and students.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;
*Majority of the narcotic users are under the age of twenty-five.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;
*A growing portion of the youth population use multiple drugs.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;
*Some cases of [[Intravenous drug use (recreational)|intravenous drug use]] are reported in Bhutan, but it is minimal compared to other countries in the region.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;
*A [[social stigma]] is attached to [[Substance dependence|addiction]] in the country. Because of this, the full nature of the situation becomes difficult to know.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;

The Government of Bhutan has taken several measures to counter these problems. Bhutan is a party of the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] (1988).&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; Many laws have been enacted which include the Civil and Criminal Procedure Code (2000), the Sales Tax, Customs and Excise Act (2000), the Medicines Act (2003), the Penal Code of Bhutan (2004), and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and Substance Abuse Act (2005).&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NA05&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oag.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Narcotic-DrugsPsychotropic-Substance-Substance-Abuse-Act-of-BhutanDE.pdf |format=PDF |title=Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and Substance Abuse Act 2005 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date= 2005-11-30 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, selling of [[tobacco]] products to Bhutanese citizens was outlawed in the country&lt;ref name=BBCBFTS&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4012639.stm Bhutan forbids all tobacco sales] ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and thus Bhutan became the first nation in the world to [[Tobacco Control Act|ban tobacco sales]].&lt;ref name=NATIONBFNBTS&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/dec-2004/17/latest.php Latest News: Bhutan becomes first nation to ban tobacco sales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811093118/http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/dec-2004/17/latest.php |date=2007-08-11 }} ''[[The Nation (Pakistani newspaper)|The Nation]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BNET&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmafp/is_200412/ai_n8606432 Bhutan becomes first nation to ban tobacco sales]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=INDIANENEWSTYTBBSAL&gt;[http://www.indiaenews.com/nepal/20070520/52549.htm Two years after tobacco ban, Bhutan still awaits law] ''Indiaenews.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCNEWSBBTS&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/12/17/1268016.htm Bhutan bans all tobacco sales] ''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Severe punishment was introduced for selling of tobacco.&lt;ref name=BBCBFTS/&gt; A fine of $210 was imposed for the culprits and cancellation of business licenses for owners of shops and hotels illegally selling tobacco.&lt;ref name=BBCBFTS/&gt; Karma Tshering of the Bhutanese Customs said, "If any foreigner is caught selling tobacco products to Bhutanese nationals, he will be charged with smuggling. Tobacco will be treated as contraband."&lt;ref name=BBCBFTS/&gt; However a black market in tobacco has flourished in the country.&lt;ref name=INDIANENEWSTYTBBSAL/&gt;

==Terrorism==
Many insurgent groups from neighboring countries have set up training camps in the southern part of the country.&lt;ref name="WPE102"/&gt; The [[United Liberation Front of Asom]] (ULFA), the [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland]] (NDFB) and the [[Bodo Liberation Tigers Force]] (BLTF) had bases in Bhutan in 2002.&lt;ref name="WPE102"/&gt; Terrorists were involved in murders, extortion and kidnappings.&lt;ref name="WPE102"/&gt; Under increasing pressure from the [[Government of India]], Bhutan issued an ultimatum to the terrorists for leaving the country by December 2001, and in December 2003, the [[Royal Bhutan Army]],  
aided by the [[Special Frontier Force]], launched a military campaign.&lt;ref name="WPE103"&gt;{{cite book

The Government of Bhutan has taken several legal and military actions for combating terrorism.&lt;ref name="WPE103"/&gt; On September 4, 2004, one hundred and eleven people received various sentences ranging from four years to [[life imprisonment]] for helping terrorist organizations camped illegally in Bhutan.&lt;ref name="WPE103"/&gt; The offenders included civil servants, businesspersons, and laborers.&lt;ref name="WPE103"/&gt;

{{distinguish|Data publishing}}
{{For|the company formerly known as Database Publications|Europress}}
'''Database publishing''' is an area of automated media production in which specialized techniques are used to generate paginated documents from source data residing in traditional [[database]]s. Common examples are [[mail order catalogue]]s, [[direct marketing]], report generation, price lists and [[telephone directory|telephone directories]]. The database content can be in the form of text and pictures but can also contain metadata related to formatting and special rules that may apply to the document generation process. Database publishing can be incorporated into larger workflows as a component, where documents are created, approved, revised and released.

The basic idea is using database contents like article and price information to fill out pre-formatted template documents. Templates are typically created in a normal desktop layout application where certain boxes or text are designated as placeholders. These placeholders are then targeted with new content which flows in from the database. This allows for quick generation of final output and, in case of changes to the database, quickly perform updates, with limited or no manual intervention. 

Another model of database publishing is found in many web-to-print sites where users browse templates from an online catalog (such as business cards or brochures), personalize the selected template by filling in a form and then view the rendered result. In this case the initial source of data is from user input, but it is captured in a database so that if the same user revisits the site later, they can resume editing where they left off. The form is then pre-filled from the database-stored variables the user entered before.

The main layout applications for this workflow are: Datalogics Pager, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [[Framemaker|FrameMaker]] / [[Indesign|InDesign]], [[QuarkXPress]], [[Xyvision]], [[Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher]] (formerly 3B2) and  [[priint:suite]]. Generally, these layout applications have a corresponding server version, which receives commands via web interfaces rather than desktop interaction. QuarkXPress Server and Adobe InDesign Server both take full advantage of the design features available in their respective desktop versions.

These applications make their broad spectrum of features available for extension and integration with vertical products, that can be developed either internally, through some form of scripting (e.g. [[JavaScript]] or [[AppleScript]] for InDesign), or externally, through some [[API]] and corresponding [[developer kit]]s.

Other variants of database publishing are the rendering of content for direct PDF output. This approach prevents manual intervention on the final output, since PDF is not (comfortably) editable. This may not be perceived as a limitation in situations like report generation where manual editability is not needed or not desired.

The '''Davie-Brown Index''' (DBI) is an independent index for [[brand]] marketers and agencies that quantifies consumer perceptions of more than 2,900 celebrities, including TV and film stars, musical artists, reality TV stars, news personalities, politicians, athletes, and business leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/16143/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed in 2006 by Sharp Analytics and white labeled by celebrity talent division of [[The Marketing Arm]], an [[Omnicom Group]] Inc. promotion agency, the DBI provides marketers with a systematic approach for quantifying the use of celebrities in their advertising and marketing initiatives. DBI data is designed to help determine a celebrity's ability to influence brand affinity and consumer purchase intent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB113979992994972159]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various news articles, the DBI consists of a 1.5 million-member consumer research panel which evaluates a celebrity’s awareness, appeal and relevance to a brand’s image and their influence on [[consumer]] buying behavior. Respondents who are aware of a certain celebrity are asked a standard set of questions about that celebrity.  Using a six-point scale, consumers evaluate celebrities across seven key attributes:  Appeal, Breakthrough, Trendsetter, Influence, Trust, Endorsement, and Aspiration. An overall DBI score is developed each time a [[celebrity]] is indexed and can be narrowed down to key [[demographics]], including [[gender]], age and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/news/new-index-rates-oprahs-and-other-celebs-marketing-muscle-3256/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Updated weekly, DBI attribute rankings are dynamic and change depending on major events (e.g., industry awards, positive/negative news, etc.).

In 2013, The Marketing Arm partnered with Repucom, a market research firm, to launch the Index in 12 international markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research-live.com/news/analytics/celebrity-index-goes-international/4009836.article]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dyadic developmental psychotherapy''' is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] treatment method for families that have children with symptoms of [[emotional disorder]]s, including [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] and disorders of [[Attachment disorder|attachment]].&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman, A. 2008 pp.329-337"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A., &amp; Hughes, D., (2008) "Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: An evidence-based treatment for children with complex trauma and disorders of attachment," Child &amp; Adolescent Social Work, 13, pp.329-337&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally developed by Daniel Hughes as an intervention for children whose emotional distress resulted from earlier separation from familiar caregivers.&lt;ref name="hughes2003"&gt;Hughes, D. (2003). Psychological intervention for the spectrum of attachment disorders and intrafamilial trauma. Attachment &amp; Human Development, 5, 271–279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; Hughes cites [[attachment theory]] and particularly the work of [[John Bowlby]] as theoretical motivations for [[Wiktionary:dyadic|dyadic]] developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Hughes D|year= 2004|title= An attachment-based treatment of maltreated children and young people|journal= Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume= 3|pages= 263–278|url= http://www.attachmentcoalition.org/DDP.pdf|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022654/http://www.attachmentcoalition.org/DDP.pdf|archivedate= 25 July 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bretherton, I., 1992"&gt;Bretherton, I.,(1992) "The origins of attachment theory," Developmental Psychotherapy, 28:759-775.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes, J., (1993)"&gt;Holmes, J.(1993) John Bowlby and Attachment Theory, London:Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-07729-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyadic developmental therapy principally involves creating a "playful, accepting, curious, and empathic" environment in which the therapist attunes to the child's "subjective experiences" and reflects this back to the child by means of eye contact, facial expressions, gestures and movements, voice tone, timing and touch, "co-regulates" emotional affect and "co-constructs" an alternative autobiographical narrative with the child. Dyadic developmental psychotherapy also makes use of [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] strategies. The "dyad" referred to must eventually be the parent-child dyad. The active presence of the primary caregiver is preferred but not required.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

A study by Arthur Becker-Weidman in 2006, which suggested that dyadic developmental therapy is more effective than the "usual treatment methods" for [[reactive attachment disorder]] and [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]],&lt;ref name="bw1"&gt;Becker-Weidman. ''Treatment for Children with Trauma-Attachment Disorders: Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy'', Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal. 23(2), April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bw3"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A., (2006b). Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: a multi year follow-up. in Sturt, S., (ed) New Developments in Child Abuse Research. NY: Nova&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticised by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC). According to the APSAC Taskforce Report and Reply, dyadic developmental psychotherapy does not meet the criteria for designation as "evidence based" nor provide a basis for conclusions about "usual treatment methods".&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al." &gt;Chaffin, M. et al. (2006) Report of the APSAC Task Force on Attachment Therapy, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and Attachment problems. | Journal= Child Maltreatment 2006;11;76| page=78 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559505283699}} |&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reply&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders  Reply to Letters  Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 research synthesis described the approach as a "supported and acceptable" treatment,&lt;ref name= "Craven"&gt;Craven &amp; Lee, (2006), "Therapeutic Interventions for Foster Children: A systematic Research Synthesis," Research on Social Work Practice, Vol. 16, #3, May 2006, pp. 287-304&lt;/ref&gt; but this conclusion has also proved controversial.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; A 2013 review of research recommended caution about this method of therapy, arguing that it has "no support for claims of effectiveness at any level of evidence" and a questionable theoretical basis.&lt;ref name="mercer2014"&gt;Mercer, Jean (2014). "Examining Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy as a Treatment for Adopted and Foster Children: A Review of Research and Theory", ''Research on Social Work Practice November'', 24(6), pp. 715-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

Dyadic developmental psychotherapy is based on the theory that maltreated infants not only frequently have [[Attachment in children|disorganized attachments]] but also, as they mature, are likely to develop rigid self-reliance that becomes a compulsive need to control all aspects of their environment. Hughes cites Lyons-Ruth &amp; Jacobvitz (1999) in support of this theory. Caregivers are seen as a source of fear with the result that children endeavour to control their caregivers through manipulation, overcompliance, intimidation or role reversal in order to keep themselves safe. Such children may also suffer intrusive memories secondary to trauma and as a result may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in treatment. It is anticipated that such children will try to actively avoid the exposure involved in developing a therapeutic relationship and will resist being directed into areas of shame and trauma. Hughes proposes that an attachment based treatment may be more effective for such foster and adoptive children than traditional treatment and parenting interventions.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

It is stated that once an infant's safety needs are met (by attachment) they become more able to focus on learning and responding to the social and emotional needs of caregivers. (Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states "Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

The therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.

==Methods==

Firstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes "The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.

The aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. "As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words." (Hughes 2004 p18)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment. However Hughes considers that attachment based treatment can be undertaken with just the therapist.(Hughes 2004 p25)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

==Controversy==
DDP has been criticised for the lack of a comprehensive manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making "a real logical jump" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"&gt;Pignotti, M., &amp; Mercer, J. (2007). Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions: A systematic research synthesis revisited.   Research on Social Work Practice, 17 (4),  pp. 513–519.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities to certain [[attachment therapy]] practices have also provoked controversy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; It has been suggested that the therapy appears to use age regression and holding techniques—features of attachment therapy not congruent with [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; Becker-Weidman cites Daniel Hughes's 1997 book "Facilitating Developmental Attachment", which contains sections on the use of age regression and holding therapy, as a source document for dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; The advocacy group [[Advocates for Children in Therapy]] include dyadic developmental psychotherapy in their list of "attachment therapies by another name", and continue to list Hughes as a proponent of attachment therapy, citing statements of his that appear to endorse [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/hughes.html Advocates for Children in Therapy - Daniel Hughes].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they cite material from Hughes's website about the use of physical contact in therapy as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To be effective, the child must be engaged by the therapist at the level of preverbal attunement rather than in a setting of rational discussions.  The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self."&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997"&gt;Daniel A. Hughes (1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205224739/http://danielahughes.homestead.com/fdaintro.html Facilitating Developmental Attachment: The Road to Emotional Recovery and Behavioral Change in Foster and Adopted Children]. Publisher Jason Aronson Inc. Retrieved 30 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The APSAC Taskforce report on attachment disorder, reactive attachment disorder and attachment therapy, published in 2006, places Hughes and Becker-Weidman within the attachment therapy paradigm and indeed specifically cites Becker-Weidman for, amongst other things, the use of age regression, though not for coercive or restraining practices (p.&amp;nbsp;79). They also describe DDP as an attachment therapy in their November 2006 Reply to Letters.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}} "Dr. Becker-Weidman is cited three times in the body of the report, none of which refer to coercive techniques. The first citation references his Web site's assertion that traditional therapies are either ineffective or harmful (p. 78). The second citation references his recommendation that children be encouraged to regress to an earlier age as part of treatment (p. 79). The third citation references his assertions, which we believe are unsupported, about practicing an evidence-based treatment (p. 85)."&lt;/ref&gt; Becker-Weidman had stated in his letter to the Taskforce that it was essential to treat a child at its developmental rather than chronological level, but the Taskforce in its November 2006 Reply to Letters disagreed (p.&amp;nbsp;382).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman Letter"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman, Letter to the Editor, Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 379, {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292632}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taskforce in their ''Reply to Letters'' describe Hughes as "a leading [[Attachment therapy|attachment therapist]]" and cite Hughes (together with Kelly and Popper) as examples of attachment therapists who have more recently developed their practices away from the more concerning attachment therapy techniques (p.&amp;nbsp;383).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply3"&gt;"Hughes went on to describe how his own practice of attachment therapy has changed during the years, specifically in terms of less emphasis on parental victory in power struggles, less use of holding techniques, and rejection of cathartic or dysregulated ventilation of past trauma in favor of approaches that sound very similar to well-supported gradual exposure techniques. Along with this, he offered some discussion of how he came to reconsider some of his own past attachment therapy practices."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kansas University/SRS ''Best Practices Report'' (2004) considered that dyadic developmental psychotherapy as described by Becker-Weidman, appeared to be somewhat different from that as described by Hughes. They state that in 2004 Becker-Weidman's claim that dyadic developmental psychotherapy was "evidence based" cited studies on [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]] by Myeroff, Randolph and Levy from the Attachment Center at Evergreen.&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman/Kansas"&gt;Becker-Weidmann, A. (3/7/2004). Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, retrieved
3/20/2004 from http://www.center4familydevelop.com/developmentalpsych.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uta et al."&gt;Uta M. Walter, U., M. and Petr, C. Best Practices in Children's Mental Health: "Reactive Attachment Disorder: Concepts, Treatment and Research" Produced by the University of Kansas School of Social Welfare in conjunction with Kansas Social Rehabilitation Services pp 10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' model is described as more clearly incorporating researched concerns about 'pushing' children to revisit trauma (as this can re-traumatize victims) and as having integrated established principles of trauma treatment into his approach. Avoiding dysregulation is described by Hughes as a primary treatment goal.&lt;ref name="Uta et al."/&gt;

Prior and Glaser state that Hughes's therapy 'reads' as good therapy for abused and neglected children, though with 'little application of attachment theory', but do not include it in their section on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Prior 2006"&gt;Prior, V., and Glaser, D. (2006). ''Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders: Theory, Evidence and Practice'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers, Child and adolescent mental health series. | p268 | {{ISBN|1-84310-245-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trowell, while admiring Hughes's clinical skills, stated that "Parents and carers need their own specific parent work and the children and young people need specific work tailored to their needs ... parents with their own unmet attachment needs from childhood may significantly inhibit their ability to speak frankly with, and feel supported by professionals aiming to help their children".&lt;ref&gt;Trowell, J. (2004). Reflections on 'an attachment-based treatment of maltreated children and young people'. Attachment &amp; Human Development, 6(3), 279-283&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the use of facial expressions in attempts at attunement, Trowell noted, "although the therapist may look and feel sad, the young person may see this as a provocation-- either hit out or the therapist may be perceived to be triumphant (the facial expression may be misread)" (p.&amp;nbsp;281). Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that "There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice. But the ideas in [Hughes's 2004 paper] do not provide a sufficient basis for a treatment manual, and are not to be followed uncritically."

==Evidence==
Two research reports by Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow-up of the first, are the only empirical examination of dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; They reported DDP to be an effective treatment for children with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] who met the [[DSM IV]] criteria for [[reactive attachment disorder]].&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bw3"/&gt; The first report concluded that children who received dyadic developmental psychotherapy had clinically and statistically significant improvements in their functioning as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], while the children in the control group showed no change one year after treatment ended.  The study also used the [[Attachment therapy|Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire]] as a measure,&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; which has not been empirically validated for reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt; Statistical comparisons were performed using multiple [[t-test]]s rather than an [[analysis of variance]]; this has been criticized because t-tests increase the chance of finding any significant differences.&lt;ref name="mercer2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mercer J | year = 2015 | title = Revisiting an Article About Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: The Life Cycle of a Woozle | journal = Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal | doi  = 10.1007/s10560-015-0399-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment group comprised thirty-four subjects whose cases were closed in 2000/01. This was compared to a "usual care group" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of "usual care" or clarify why the "usual care" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

In the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

Becker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"/&gt; The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt; Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.&lt;ref name="Letter to the Editor"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | 
&lt;/ref&gt; The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.&lt;ref name="Reply p3"&gt;"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time." Reply to Letters p3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven &amp; Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, &amp; Hanson (2004) system.&lt;ref name= "Craven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saunders 2004"&gt;Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., &amp; Hanson, R.F.

Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 29, 303-313&lt;/ref&gt; They placed both in Category 3 as "supported and acceptable". This classification means that the evidence basis is weak, but that there is no evidence of harm done by the treatment. The Craven &amp; Lee classification report has been criticized as unduly favourable.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; This critique noted the absence of a comprehensive manual giving details of the dyadic developmental psychotherapy intervention—one of the necessary criteria for assessment using the Saunders et al. guidelines, and one without which no outcome study can be placed in any of the available categories. Craven and Lee rebutted this paper in a reply that concentrated on holding therapy rather than dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="Craven &amp; Lee 2007"&gt;Lee, R.E., &amp; Craven, P. (2007). Reply to Pignotti and Mercer: Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions.  Research on Social Work Practice, 17(4),  pp 520-521.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears from the reports that attachment therapy techniques may have been used in addition to standard DDP. The therapist in Becker-Weidman's study instructed parents to use the "[[Attachment therapy#Parenting techniques|attachment parenting methods]]" of two authors who are described by Jean Mercer as advocating "coercive and intimidating approaches to children in treatment", specifically physical restraint and withholding of food and drink. Because of this deviation from the modern presentation of DDP, Mercer argues that the study cannot be considered a test of DDP in its current form.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Mercer cites Becker-Weidman's research as an example of the [[Woozle effect]], in which "flawed, limited, or exaggerated data" is uncritically repeated and republished until it achieves popular acceptance.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt;

== Product design ==
EcoZoom stoves use a [[rocket stove]] design for efficient combustion of fuel. As a result, less fuel is used compared to an open fire with less smoke emitted, helping cooks from inhaling harmful smoke while using less natural resources.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite web | title = EcoZoom: a model for selling clean cookstoves in Africa | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/Change-Agent/2013/1129/EcoZoom-a-model-for-selling-clean-cookstoves-in-Africa | publisher = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 29 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==
EcoZoom sells stoves direct-to-consumer in the US while completing multiple international projects in Haiti, Kenya, Mexico, Rwanda, Somalia, and South Africa.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

The '''''Environment and Planning''''' journals are five [[academic journal]]s. They are described as "interdisciplinary", though they have a highly [[space|spatial]] focus, meaning that they are of most interest to [[human geography|human geographers]] and city planners. The journals are also of interest to the scholars of [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], [[ecology]] and [[cultural studies]].

The five journals are:
* ''Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space'': The original ''Environment and Planning'' journal, launched in 1969. It focuses on [[urban area|urban]] and [[regional geography|regional]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epn.sagepub.com/|title=Environment and Planning A|publisher=SAGE Publications|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science'': Introduced in 1974 as 'Planning and Design' to provide a focus on methodological urban issues, focusing again on the design and planning methods, [[built environment]], [[town planning|planning]] and [[policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epb.sagepub.com/|title=Environment and Planning B|publisher=Pion|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space'': Established in 1983 as 'Government and Policy'. Beginning in 2017, the focus changed to critical and interdisciplinary research on the 'spatialization of politics and the politicization of spatial relations'.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/environment-and-planning-c-politics-and-space/journal203386#description/|title=Environment and Planning C|publisher=Pion|accessdate=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space'': Launched as ''Society and Space'' in 1979 and joined the ''Environment and Planning'' series in 1983. Initially devoted to human geography, the journal is now broadening its scope and welcomes submissions from geography, cultural studies, economics, [[anthropology]], sociology, politics, [[international relations]], [[literary studies]], architecture, planning, [[history]], [[women's studies]], [[art history]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epd.sagepub.com/|title=Environment and Planning D|publisher=Pion|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space'': focussing on nature and society issues launched in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/home/ene|title=Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space: SAGE Journals|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] in the United Kingdom, the highest number of submissions from geographers were articles from ''Environment and Planning A'', with ''Environment and Planning D'' fourth in the list.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Ron|date=2003|title=Geography: A different sort of discipline?|journal=[[Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers]]|volume=28|issue=2|pages=133–141|doi=10.1111/1475-5661.00083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journals were published by Pion, a small publisher, until 2015, when Pion was taken over by [[Sage Publications|Sage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/press/sage-strengthens-geography-and-psychology-portfolio-with-acquisition-of-pion|title=SAGE strengthens geography and psychology portfolio with acquisition of Pion|publisher=Sage|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the "big four" academic publishers.

'''GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBT Equality''' ('''GLMA''') is an [[international]] organization of approximately 1,000 [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], and ally ([[LGBT]]) healthcare professionals and students of all disciplines, including physicians, advanced practice nurses, physician assistants, nurses, behavioral health specialists, researchers and acamedicians, and their supporters in the [[United States]] and internationally. Founded in 1981 as the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights, GLMA "[[Coming out|came out of the closet]]" and changed its name in 1994 to the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association. GLMA changed its name again in 2012 to GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBT Equality.

GLMA’s mission is to ensure equality in healthcare for LGBT individuals and healthcare professionals. GLMA achieves its goals by using the health and medical expertise of its members in professional education, public policy work, patient education and referrals, and the promotion of research.

GLMA’s Annual Conference on LGBT Health, generally held in the fall, is the world’s largest scientific gathering devoted to LGBT health issues and concerns. GLMA’s Annual Conference on LGBT Health educates practitioners and students—from across the health professions—about the unique health needs of LGBT individuals and families. The conference is a forum for discussion and exploration of how best to address these needs as well as the needs of LGBT health professionals and health profession students. GLMA’s Annual Conference on LGBT Health also reports on research into the health needs of LGBT people.

GLMA "works to combat homophobia within the medical profession and in society at large; to promote quality health care for LGBT and HIV-positive people; to foster a professional climate in which our diverse members can achieve their full potential; and to support members challenged by discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebody.com/glma/glmapage.html |title=Gay and Lesbian Medical Association |publisher=TheBody.com |date=2010-11-20 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GLMA worked with the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) to adopt measures requiring "the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation and behavior," and to reverse a 13-year-old AMA policy of encouraging programs to acquaint gay patients with "the possibility of [[sexual orientation change efforts|sex preference reversal]] in selected cases." &lt;ref name="dunlap2004"&gt;Dunlap, David (December 25, 1994). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E0DB163BF936A15751C1A962958260&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=%22Gay%20and%20Lesbian%20Medical%20Association%22&amp;st=cse A.M.A. States New Policy On Sexuality.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; They also have published the ''Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association''.

==Research activities==
The mission of the Lesbian Health Fund (LHF), a project of GLMA, is to improve the health of lesbians and other sexual minority women (SMW) and their families through research. Founded in 1992, LHF has awarded more than $754,000 to fund lesbian health research, and is the only U.S. research fund dedicated solely to the unique health needs of lesbians and other SMW.

In the summer of 2006, GLMA undertook a project to investigate the causes and extent of [[Methamphetamine and sex|methamphetamine use among gay men]] and other [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), options for treating methamphetamine dependence, and how best to get methamphetamine-dependent gay men into appropriate treatment, as well as to explore other issues and controversies associated with these issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glma.org/_data/n_0001/resources/live/BreakingtheGrip.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goldman Environmental Prize''' is a prize awarded annually to grassroots [[environmentalism|environment]]al activists, one from each of the world's six geographic regions:{{r|usatoday}} Africa, Asia, Europe, Islands and Island Nations, North America, and South and Central America. Since the prize was established in 1989, a total of $15.9 million has been awarded to 157 people from more than 79 countries, as of 2013.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; The award is given by the Goldman Environmental Foundation headquartered in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; It is also called the ''Green Nobel.''{{r|reuters}}

The Goldman Environmental Prize was created in 1989 by civic leaders and philanthropists [[Richard N. Goldman]] and [[Rhoda H. Goldman]].&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; 

The winners are selected by an international jury who receive confidential nominations from by a worldwide network of environmental organizations and individuals. Prize winners participate in a 10-day tour of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., for an awards ceremony and presentation, news conferences, media briefings and meetings with political, public policy, financial and environmental leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2009 Goldman Environmental Prize Winners Beat 'Insurmountable' Odds|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2009/2009-04-20-02.asp|newspaper=Environment News Service|date=April 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-commitment management''' emphasizes personal responsibility, independence, and [[empowerment]] of employees across all levels instead of focusing on one higher power; it always intended to keep commitment at high level  “calling all the shots”.&lt;ref name="WesenbergSean"&gt;Wesenberg, Sean. Phone Interview. 18 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

A high commitment system is unusual in its job design and cultural structure. These practices emphasize getting the tasks complete, but do it in a way that their employees enjoy doing it. According to Harvard Business School Professor Michael Beer, “leaders develop an organizational design, business processes, goals and measures, and capabilities that are aligned with a focused, winning strategy.”&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Michael and Russell A. Eisenstat. ''High Commitment, High Performance: How to Build a Resilient Organization for Sustained Advantage''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of environment allows employees to approach tasks at ease, wearing jeans instead of suits and staying home to watch their children get on the bus for school before coming to work. Technology also plays a role in this system. Recently,{{When|date=November 2012}} technology has slaughtered barriers of communication, which makes this high-commitment model fit that much better. That father waiting for the bus can still answer phone calls and check emails for work, so is he working or is he spending time with his daughter? He can be doing both.&lt;ref name="WesenbergSean" /&gt; As long as the job gets done, this system is casual on how it gets done, relieving employees of constant stress.

A flat organizational structure is one of the biggest success factors. Individuals are responsible for their own decision-making and these decisions, their skill, and their performance is how they get paid. Instead of putting too much weight on the individual, “people are likely to see the locus of the control coming from ‘within’ through the adoption of self-created demands and pressures as opposed to external and making them feel subordinate.” &lt;ref name="LoweJim" /&gt; While these companies allow each employee to be a manager in their own way and try not to distinguish its structure by higher levels of employment, it doesn’t mean that they lack these higher powers entirely. It's that under this system people aren’t relying on the general managers, CEOs, or other employees to do their work for them. This personal discipline is what drives the employees to help the company be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Jim, and Nick Oliver. "The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a Hi-Tech Industry." ''Work, Employment &amp; Society'' 5.3 (1991): 437-50. Print&lt;/ref&gt; and eliminates the chance at a thought like, “Why would I want to help my company become better if I know I’m just going to get yelled at?” &lt;ref&gt;Wesenberg, Sean. Phone Interview. 18 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus of high commitment practices is their employee relationships. They only hire people who are flexible, determined, and are willing to handle challenges. Because this system relies on individual performance, there is a big emphasis on hiring the right people for the job. The detailed recruitment process can consist of many interviews with different members of the company, an induction course, and in some cases, team-building exercises.&lt;ref name="LoweJim" /&gt; Once found, the right employees help create a strong bond and high trust throughout the entire company.

High commitment workplaces are successful through their importance on an individual’s responsibility in order to help the team prosper. By creating a culture that motivates individuals to want to succeed while sustaining high commitment, “these firms stand out by having achieved long periods of excellence.” &lt;ref&gt;Beer, Michael and Russell A. Eisenstat. ''High Commitment, High Performance: How to Build a Resilient Organization for Sustained Advantage''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

High-commitment management firms are designed by their founders or transformational chief executives to achieve sustained high [[Organizational commitment|commitment]] from employees. The application of high-commitment management in firms today originated from an alignment of the employees’ and the firm’s mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beer|first=Michael|title=High Commitment, High Performance|year=2009|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|Sociologist]]s{{Who|date=November 2012}} attribute this congruence as a product of [[job performance|performance]] and psychological collaboration between the firm and its employees. Since its initial developments, high commitment management has been driven by self-regulated behavior and performance-driven group dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, Nathaniel. "High Commitment, High Performance Management” HBS Working Knowledge. Harvard Business School, 10 August 2009. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6119.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the top-down leadership practices, high-commitment management took form as leaders engaged and listened to people, allowing ideas from different levels of the organization to push the firm forward.

===Self-directed work teams===
In a study of illumination in the workplace of [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne]] and the [[Western Electric Company]], a sociologist from [[Harvard Business School]], [[Elton Mayo]], concluded that when the organization established experimental work groups, “the individuals became a team and the team gave itself wholeheartedly and spontaneously to cooperation.”&lt;ref name="MayoElton"&gt;Mayo, Elton 1984 [1949]. ― Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company.‖ Pp. 279-292 in ''Organization Theory: Selected Readings''. Second Edition. Edited by D.S. Pugh. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a natural system{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} of collaboration, the teams are not only responsible for the work but also the management of their group. Mayo’s research uncovered that teams under their own direction established a capacity for self-motivated learning and change.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Elton 1984 [1949]. ―Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company.‖ Pp. 279-292 in Organization Theory: Selected Readings. Second Edition. Edited by D.S. Pugh. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of designing the work system with the full participation of the people proved to be a breakthrough for organizations during the 1990s. During that time, employees closest to the product and customer began to have increasing decision making capacities and capabilities.&lt;ref name="fic.wharton.upenn"&gt;Hunter, Larry W., and Lorin M. Hitt. "What Makes a Committed Workplace?" Wharton Business School. University of Pennsylvania, 24 July 2002. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/papers/00/0030.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview programs===
The Hawthorne Experiments sought to determine a correlation between light levels and productivity. Researchers had divided the employees into teams of six and interviewed the individuals to determine the effect of the lighting. Mayo discovered that the interview program set up by the study inherently gave the employees a sense of higher purpose.&lt;ref name="MayoElton" /&gt; Exposure of employee thoughts and concerns to managers appeared to be a fundamental aspect of the relation between managers and employees. Evidently, by having the ability to speak to their managers, the employees at Western Electric exhibited a dramatic improvement in their attitudes towards work.&lt;ref&gt;Mifflin, Jeffrey. "Western Electric Company. Hawthorne Studies Collection, 1924-1961 (inclusive): A Finding Aid." Western Electric Company. Hawthorne Studies Collection, 1924-1961 (inclusive): A Finding Aid. Harvard Business School, 04 Jan. 1998. Web. 16 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~bak00047&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Essential to a highly committed work force, the interview program formally developed and sustained cooperation with management.

===Problem-solving teams===
The Hawthorne experiment further highlighted that teams working without coercion from above or limitation from below could astonish even their own expectations of themselves. Sociologist [[Fritz Roethlisberger]] argued that this informal organization left the team responsible for addressing the myriad of problems that continuously arose. Roethlisberger noted by studying the chemistry of informal groups that human interactions and collaboration have the potential to set when teams have to face problems on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Roethlisberger, Fritz J. and William J. Dickson. 1981 [1939]. ―Human Relations.‖ Pp. 67-83 in The Sociology of Organizations: Basic Studies. Second Edition. Edited by O. Grusky and G. A. Miller. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Together the individuals of the team strive to improve the processes of the team by adapting to different demands and learning from each other.

===Cross training===
Cross training began to be heavily examined through the scope of modern Japanese management in the automobile industry in the 1970s. Sociologists examined the way in which the Japanese automobile firms cross-trained its employees through a company wide orientation and training program. As Japanese firms trained their employees in a multitude of aspects in the production process, sociologists discovered that the training brought the employees together and formed a connection in which all the employees were dedicated to the company’s mission.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Laurie 1993. ―Inside a Japanese Transplant: A Critical Perspective.‖ Work and Occupations. 20(2):147-173.&lt;/ref&gt; These established connections appeared to solicit cooperation among the work force.&lt;ref name="fic.wharton.upenn" /&gt; The Japanese auto plants revealed that flexibility within the production teams allowed employees to work on their own tasks while keeping others efficient.

==Difference from other management strategies==

High-commitment practices are spin-offs from the natural system of managements.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin"&gt;Frank Dobbin, “From Incentives to Teamwork: Rational and Natural Management Systems” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 1 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Like other management strategies in the natural system of management,&lt;ref&gt;E. Mayo.'Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company'.The Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization. Routledge, 1949. chapter 4. pp. 60-76.&lt;/ref&gt; High-commitment practices assume natural theories of motivation &lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt; rather than the considerably different rational theories of motivation.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt;
[[File:Rational and Natural Theories of Motivation.jpg|thumb|Differences between rational and natural management systems &lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt;]] Because most management strategies before High Commitment practices assumed rational theories of motivation, high-commitment practices differ from these strategies in three primary aspects.

===Employee motivation===
In terms of methods of motivating workers, differences between High Commitment Practices and strategies from the rational system of management are extreme. The rational system of management focuses on either punishments or incentives.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt; For example, the earliest form of rational management, ''direct control'', encourages employee productivity by having supervisors oversee the production process and punish workers who are not producing enough outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Managing the Workforce” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 17 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of rational management, ''bureaucratic control'', encourages productivity through career incentives like bonuses and promotions. However, High Commitment Practices, unlike any rational management, aim to stimulate productivity by encouraging employee commitment to the institution.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a"&gt;Frank Dobbin, “High Commitment Practices” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 10 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Data General, a corporation which advocates High Commitment Practices, manages to make employees love their tasks and grow attached to the corporation so much that many employees elect to work twelve hours, four more than Data General prescribes.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Kidder, The Soul of a New Machine, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to rational management, High Commitment Practices attempt to create scenarios in which employees aspire to deliver their best efforts.

===Employee control===
High Commitment Practices also differ from practices in the rational management system with regards to employee control. The rational system of management discourages job autonomy, believing that such freedom will only lower productivity because employees will elect not to work. For example, in ''[[scientific management]]'' and ''Fordism'',&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Federick W. "Scientific Management." CLASSICAL THEORETICAL PERSPECTlVES : 54-66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; employees are micro-managed- they are given specific instructions  on how to perform certain tasks. However, High Commitment Practices encourage job autonomy, creativity, and innovation,&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a" /&gt; all of which institutions with High Commitment Practices believe will increase job satisfaction and commitment leading to increased outputs. While the rational system of management attempts to micro-manage employees, High Commitment Practices greatly encourage independence.

===Influence on corporate structure===
With respect to corporate structure, institutions employing rational management and institutions employing high commitment practices also differ. Institutions with rational management tend to have a steep hierarchy with many ranks between floor-workers and executives.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Internal Labor Market” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 14 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, institutions employing bureaucratic control often have one entry level at the bottom of the hierarchy, and new recruits slowly work their ways up the seemingly endless ladder. Because these institutions have a steep hierarchy, those near the bottom of the chain are often alienated from higher ups&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Alienation” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 19 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, relationship between executives and workers are minimal. However, institutions which employ High Commitment Practices have fairly flat hierarchy and intra-firm networking is easy. As a result, most employees readily develop attachment to their on-job peers, bosses, and the institution, increasing their commitment. While the rational system of management maintains distance between executive and lower employees, High Commitment Practices foster good relationship between the two.

===Other natural managements===
While high-commitment practices are similar to other strategies in the system, particularly the Human Relations School, in terms of the three aspects previously discussed, their goals are different. Although both attempt to increase job satisfaction and make employees feel valued, High Commitment Practices seek to make employees feel attached to their institutions while the Human Relations School simply seek to make employees aspire to work because of the satisfaction gained from contributing outputs.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a" /&gt;

With the significant shift in the way firms are motivating their employees in recent years,{{When|date=November 2012}} many companies are beginning to realize that having a “strong [[corporate culture]]” is an important ingredient in organizational success.  Employee commitment is “replacing traditional controls such as direct supervision and bureaucratic arrangements.” &lt;ref name="LoweJim"&gt;Lowe, Jim, and Nick Oliver. "The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a Hi-Tech Industry." Work, Employment &amp; Society 5.3 (1991): 437-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; No longer do these high commitment workplaces rely on their CEOs to force the workers to produce, but instead, these workers are self-motivated to bring their best to the company.

One company that follows this high commitment model is [[Google]].  A little over a decade ago,{{When|date=November 2012}} Google was an unknown. Today, Google not only refers to the multinational corporation which provides Internet-related products and services, but it has also become a common verb many use every day—“just Google it.”  What sets Google apart from many companies, however, is its unique{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} corporate culture.  Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the two men wanted Google to be a place where people would enjoy work.  The company’s philosophies, which include principles such as “work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun” and “you can be serious without a suit”, are consistent with its innovative and informal environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Things We Know to Be True." Google Company. Google, n.d. Web. 18 Nov. 2012. &lt;https://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of organization, Google maintains “a casual and democratic atmosphere, resulting in its distinction as a ‘Flat’ company.”&lt;ref name="JohanssonGreg"&gt;Johansson, Greg. "Google: The World's Most Successful Corporate Culture." Weblog post.Suite 101. N.p., 29 May 2010. Web. 17 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earlier years, Google had a fairly informal product-development system.  Ideas moved upwards from “Googlers” without any formal review process from senior managers, and teams working on innovative projects were kept small.  However, with the continuing expansion of the company, Google now holds weekly, all-hands (‘TGIF’) meetings at which employees ask questions directly to Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and other executives about any number of company issues.  This is consistent with the idea that high commitment work systems “typically involve practices that enhance communication across organizational levels.” &lt;ref&gt;Burton, M. Diane, and Charles O'Reilly. Walking the Talk: The Impact of High Commitment Values and Practices on Technology Start-ups. Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, employees are encouraged to propose wild, ambitious ideas, and supervisors are assigned small teams to test if these ideas will work.  Teams are made up of members with equal authority—“there is no top-down hierarchy”—and nearly everyone at Google carries a generic job title, such as “product manager.” &lt;ref name="JohanssonGreg" /&gt;

Google hires those who are “smart and determined,” and it favors “ability over experience.” &lt;ref&gt;"Our Culture." Google Company. Google, n.d. Web. 18 Nov. 2012. &lt;https://www.google.com/ about/company/facts/culture/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview on the company’s corporate culture and hiring, Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, stressed the importance of evaluating potential hires’ passions and commitments in addition to their technical qualifications.  He said that “people are going to do what they’re going to do, and you (company, leader) just assist them.” &lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Eric. "Corporate Culture Example: Google’s Eric Schmidt On Culture &amp; Hiring." Interview. Weblog post. Culture Matters: Corporate Culture Pros Blog. Corporate Culture Pros, 6 July 2011. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.corporateculturepros.com/2011/07/corporate-culture-example-google-hiring/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Google does not believe that its job is to manage the company; instead, it believes that its greatest task is to hire the right people.  And once the company has those people, it “will see a building of ‘self-initiative’ behavior”—one of the important characteristics of people working in high commitment workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Eric. "Corporate Culture Example: Google’s Eric Schmidt On Culture &amp; Hiring." Interview. Weblog post. Culture Matters: Corporate Culture Pros Blog. Corporate Culture Pros, 6 July 2011. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.corporateculturepros.com/2011/07/corporate-culture-example-google-hiring/&gt;.).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, all engineers at Google are allotted 20 percent of their time to work on their own ideas—some of which yield public offerings, such as [[Google News]] and [[Orkut]], a [[social networking]] website.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}


==Implementation difficulties and disadvantages==

While there is substantial evidence that high commitment management practices have many benefits to the efficiency and well-being of the workplace as seen above, there are some disadvantages and difficulties found in the system.

Much of the research presenting strong evidence of success with high commitment management practices may actually be due to confounding variables. An example of this can be seen in research by Burton and O’Reilly &lt;ref name="BurtonDiane"&gt;Burton, Diane O’Reilly, Charles. “Walking the Talk: The Impact of High Commitment Values and Practices on Technology Start-ups”, 14 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that the benefits seen from high commitment practices may not be due to the practices themselves, but may result from on overarching system architecture or organizational logic. Another possibility they suggested was that good managers themselves pick this form of managing practice &lt;ref name="BurtonDiane" /&gt; and therefore good managers may be a confounding variable. Thus it is possible that the relative success of these practices is in fact a result of reasons other than the practices themselves.

In the process of becoming a workplace with high commitment management practices, the transition &lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Walton, Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zuZ3HEi4dXIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=difficulty+implementing+high+commitment+management+practices&amp;ots=vCvhLn2uKL&amp;sig=7ogbuhmp2Syqoofx-DxG17te-cM#v=onepage&amp;q=difficulty%20implementing%20high%20commitment%20management%20practices&amp;f=false “From Control to Commitment in the Workplace”], Chapter 10. September 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; can be difficult and in order to gain the full benefits of such practices full implementation is required.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Sue Purcell, John Kinnie, Nick. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9pzmzba&amp;s=229f7c2b19333a8c5ffdde32dceee06d1cdb9cf2 “Evolving High Commitment Management and Experience of the RAC Calling Centre”], ‘’[[Human Resource Management Journal]]’’, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; All companies must go through a transitioning stage from their previous form of management to high commitment management practices, however not all of the changes can be made at once. This transition can often be difficult for managers to find the right balance between enough and too much worker influence &lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; and change the management philosophy along with the practices.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b"&gt;Guest, David. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.1999.tb00200.x/asset/j.1748-8583.1999.tb00200.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9onltqr&amp;s=2c3caa172d412fdfb8492d663f574f38ff2bd31c “Human Resource Management – The Workers’ Verdict”], ‘’[[Human Resource Management Journal]]’’, July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Full implementation of high commitment management practices is required in order to receive the full benefits of the system,&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley"&gt;Hutchinson, Sue Purcell, John Kinnie, Nick. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9pzmzba&amp;s=229f7c2b19333a8c5ffdde32dceee06d1cdb9cf2 “Evolving High Commitment Management and Experience of the RAC Calling Centre”], ''[[Human Resource Management Journal]]'', January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore during the transition period firms may not experience positive changes right away, which may provide disincentives for continuing the transition. This may explain why very few firms in the US have comprehensive commitment practices.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

High-commitment management practices are currently considered a universal approach &lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_a"&gt;Kinnie, Nicholas et al. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2005.tb00293.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2005.tb00293.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9oopqht&amp;s=1ecc68cf20ac62f41211644da8d74baa49492042 “Satisfaction with HR Practices and Commitment to the Organisation: Why one size does not fit all”], ''[[Human Resource Management Journal]]''. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; seen to be effective in all firms, however the best form of management for a firm with a price-sensitive, high-volume commodity market will differ from a firm with a high-quality, low-volume market.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley" /&gt; This has been seen within the private and public sectors, where only some high-commitment management practices in the private sector have the same benefits in the public sector and the entire program cannot be transported.&lt;ref&gt;Gould-Williams, Julian. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.0033-3298.2004.00383.x/asset/j.0033-3298.2004.00383.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9ookh58&amp;s=3a667459d7c3ef22f27834e079cc4538fd9e470f “The Effects of ‘High Commitment’ HRM Practices on Employee Attitude: The Views of Public  Sector Workers”], ‘’[[Public Administration]]’’, March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Managers may also face difficulty when implementing high commitment management practices as they face a tension between a consistent approach using the same practices throughout the entire workforce or adjusting their practices based on specific needs of different groups.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_a" /&gt; As workforces become more diverse, this tension may become more pronounced.

While it has been proven that workers feel positively towards high commitment management practices, it is also admitted that these practices portray workers as a resource or commodity that will be exploited by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, David Shields, John. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/1472-9296.00052/asset/1472-9296.00052.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9oo3t4y&amp;s=f9138b30fb74c34e15f4600805a88b424433ea8d “In Search of the Subject: Researching Employee Reactions to Human Resource Management”], ‘’[[The Journal of Industrial Relations]]’’, September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even though positive effects have been shown, these practices are also seen as another management initiative to try to gain greater control and efficiency from employees.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b" /&gt; Therefore, these practices are still exploiting the worker. Workers do express excessive pressure &lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b" /&gt; and high insecurity &lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Jim Oliver, Nick [http://wes.sagepub.com/content/5/3/437 “The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a High-Tech Industry”], ‘’[[Work, Employment and Society]]’’, September 1, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; when high commitment management practices are implemented. However, even though companies may have high commitment practices, which in itself mean companies will have little employee flexibility, if the nature of the company is such that they embrace change, then it is possible for these to coexist.

Therefore, while there are many benefits proven to exist as a result of high commitment management practices, there are also disadvantages and difficulties incurred by management.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
{{see|Niger–Congo homeland}}
The [[Igboid languages]] form a cluster within the [[Volta–Niger]] phylum, most likely grouped with [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] and [[Edoid languages|Edoid]].&lt;ref&gt;Williamson &amp; Blench (2000) 'Niger–Congo', in Heine &amp; Nurse, ''African Languages''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The greatest differentiation within the Igboid group is between the [[Ekpeye people|Ekpeye]] and the rest.
Williamson (2002) argues that based on this pattern, proto-Igboid migration would have moved down the Niger from a more northern area in the savannah and first settled close to the delta, with a secondary center of Igbo proper more to the north, in the [[Awka]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Williamson in Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa, F. N. Anozie, Nwanna Nzewunwa (eds.), ''The Early History of the Niger Delta'' (1988) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ7KylvsgYEC&amp;pg=PA92 92f].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pottery dated at around 2500 BC showing similarities with later Igbo work was found at [[Nsukka]] in the 1970s, along with pottery and tools at nearby Ibagwa; the traditions of the [[Umueri]] clan have as their source the [[Anambra River|Anambra valley]].  In the 1970s the [[Owerri]], [[Okigwe]], [[Orlu, Nigeria|Orlu]], [[Awgu]], [[Udi people|Udi]] and [[Awka]] divisions were determined to constitute "an Igbo heartland" from the linguistic and cultural evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elizabeth |first=Isichei |title=A History of the Igbo People |publisher=London: Macmillan |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-333-18556-8}}; excerpted in "[https://books.google.com/books?id=oHt6gmjbpewC&amp;pg=PA75 Cultural Harmony I: Igboland—the World of Man and the World of Spirits]", section 4 of Kalu Ogbaa, ed., ''Understanding Things Fall Apart'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1999; {{ISBN|0-313-30294-4}}), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oHt6gmjbpewC&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 83–85].&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic studies have shown the Igbo to cluster most closely with other Niger-Congo-speaking peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Michael C. Campbell|author2=Sarah A.

The Nri people of Igbo land have a creation myth which is one of the many creation myths that exist in various parts of Igbo land.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each king traces his origin back to the founding ancestor, Eri. Each king is a ritual reproduction of Eri.

Although title holders were respected because of their accomplishments and capabilities, they were never revered as kings, but often performed special functions given to them by such assemblies.

=== Colonial period ===
{{Main|Colonial Nigeria}}
The 19th-century British colonization effort in present-day Nigeria and increased encounters between the Igbo and other ethnicities near the [[Niger River]] led to a deepening sense of a distinct Igbo ethnic identity. The Igbo proved decisive and enthusiastic in their embrace of [[Christianity]] and Western education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Missionary Enterprise and Rivalry in Igboland, 1857–1914

Colonial rule transformed Igbo society, as portrayed in [[Chinua Achebe]]'s novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]''.

Aspects of Igbo culture such as construction of houses, education and religion changed following colonialism.
The tradition of building houses out of [[Mud hut|mud walls]] and [[thatch]]ed roofs ended as the people shifted to materials such as cement blocks for houses and [[zinc]] roofs. Roads for vehicles were built. Buildings such as hospitals and schools were erected in many parts of Igboland. Along with these changes, electricity and [[running water]] were installed in the early 20th century. With electricity, new technology such as radios and televisions were adopted, and have become commonplace in most Igbo households.&lt;ref name=modern&gt;{{cite book|title=Nigeria's Diverse Peoples |first=April A. |last=Gordon |page=87 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-57607-682-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H26pO3vwmHoC&amp;pg=PA87 |accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent history (1970 to present) ===
The Nigerian–Biafran War left Igboland devastated. Fighting had completely destroyed many hospitals, schools, and homes. In addition to the loss of their savings, many Igbo people faced discrimination from other ethnic groups and from the new non-Igbo federal government.&lt;ref name=discrim&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Rights in Commonwealth Africa |first=Rhoda E. |last=Howard-Hassmann |page=95 |isbn=978-0-8476-7433-6 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8wmGpg9nf0C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=igbo+discrimination+nigeria |accessdate=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Igbo subgroups, such as the [[Ikwerre people|Ikwerre]], started dissociating themselves from the larger Igbo population after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Tri-Generational Study of Language Choice &amp; Shift in Port Harcourt |first=Kelechukwu U. |last=Ihemere |page=26 |publisher=Universal-Publishers |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-58112-958-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwk5IkralBAC&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war era, people of eastern Nigeria changed the names of both people and places to non-Igbo-sounding words.

Igboland was gradually rebuilt by its citizens and some contribution from the Nigerian government over a period of twenty years and the economy prospered again due to the rise of the [[petroleum industry]] in the adjacent [[Niger Delta]] region. This led to the establishment of new factories in southern Nigeria.

== Political organization ==
The 1930s saw the rise of Igbo unions in the cities of Lagos and Port Harcourt. Later, the Ibo Federal Union (renamed the Ibo State Union in 1948) emerged as an umbrella [[Panethnicity|pan-ethnic]] organization. Headed by [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], it was closely associated with the [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC), which he co-founded with [[Herbert Macaulay]]. The aim of the organization was the improvement and advancement (such as in education) of the Igbo and their indigenous land and included an Igbo "national anthem" with a plan for an Igbo bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Breakdown and reconstitution: democracy, the nation-state, and ethnicity in Nigeria |first=Abu Bakarr |last=Bah |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7391-0954-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oje32eObrmYC&amp;pg=PA23 |pages= 23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inter-ethnic and religious conflict resolution in Nigeria |first1=Ernest E. |last1=Uwazie |first2=Isaac Olawale |last2=Albert |publisher=Lexington Books |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-7391-0033-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmmA9dcYaGgC&amp;pg=PA11 |pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Igbo culture}}
Igbo culture includes the various [[customs]], practices and [[traditions]] of the people. It comprises archaic practices as well as new concepts added into the Igbo culture either through evolution or outside influences. These customs and traditions include the Igbo people's visual art, use of language, music and dance forms, as well as their attire, cuisine and language [[dialects]]. Because of their various [[:Category:Igbo subgroups|subgroups]], the variety of their culture is heightened further.

The Igbo people have a musical style into which they incorporate various percussion instruments: the [[udu]], which is essentially designed from a clay jug; an [[ekwe]], which is formed from a hollowed log; and the [[ogene]], a hand bell designed from forged iron. Other instruments include opi, a wind instrument similar to the flute, [[igba]], and ichaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5IYAAAAIAAJ |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |publisher=Macmillan Publishers |first=George |last=Grove |author2=Stanley Sadie |edition=6 |page=239 |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-333-23111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular musical form among the Igbo is [[Highlife]]. A widely popular musical genre in [[West Africa]], Highlife is a fusion of [[jazz]] and traditional music. The modern [[Igbo highlife]] is seen in the works of [[Dr Sir Warrior]], [[Oliver De Coque]], [[Bright Chimezie]] and [[Chief Osita Osadebe]], who were among the most popular Igbo highlife musicians of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Culture and Customs of Nigeria |first=Toyin |last=Falola |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2001 |pages= 174–183 |isbn=978-0-313-31338-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Masquerade ceremony|Masking]] is one of the most common art styles in Igboland and is linked strongly with Igbo traditional music. A mask can be made of wood or fabric, along with other materials including iron and [[vegetation]].&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; Masks have a variety of uses, mainly in social satires, religious rituals, secret society initiations (such as the [[Ekpe]] society) and public festivals, which now include [[Christmas]] time celebrations.&lt;ref name=christmas&gt;{{cite book|title=Routes to Slavery: Direction, Ethnicity, and Mortality in the Transatlantic Slave Trade |first=David |last=Eltis |author2=David Richardson |page=87 |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuXEzQZQmawC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq | isbn=978-0-7146-4820-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best known include the [[Agbogho Mmuo]] ({{Lang-ig|Maiden spirit}}) masks of the Northern Igbo which represent the spirits of deceased maidens and their mothers with masks symbolizing beauty and Ijele.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

Other impressive masks include Northern Igbo [[Ijele Masquerade|Ijele]] masks.

There are many Igbo dance styles, but perhaps, Igbo dance is best known for its [[Atilogwu]] dance troops. These performances include acrobatic stunts such as high kicks and [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]], with each rhythm from the indigenous instruments indicating a movement to the dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=384736&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=57106 |title=African dance |location=18th paragraph under 'Dance style' |last=Harper |first=Peggy |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |publisher=[[Britannica Online Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the unique structures of Igbo culture was the [[Step pyramid#Africa|Nsude Pyramids]], at the town of Nsude, in Abaja, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first base section was 60&amp;nbsp;ft. in circumference and 3&amp;nbsp;ft. in height. The next stack was 45&amp;nbsp;ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god [[Ala (Odinani)|Ala]]/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Basden, G. S. (1966). ''Among the Ibos of Nigeria, 1912''.

The Igbos were unaffected by the Islamic jihad waged in Nigeria in the 19th century, but a small minority converted to Islam in the 20th century.

These draw their inspiration from [[Olaudah Equiano]], a Christian-educated freed slave who remarked in his autobiography of 1789 on "the strong analogy which... appears to prevail in the manners and customs of my countrymen and those of the Jews, before they reached the Land of Promise, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that pastoral state which is described in Genesis—an analogy, which alone would induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the other." Equiano's speculation has given rise to a great debate on the origins of the Igbo.

====Native religion====
The Igbo traditional religion is known [[Odinani]].&lt;ref name=isichei246&gt;{{cite book |author=Isichei, Elizabeth Allo |title=A History of African Societies to 1870 |publisher=Cambridge University Press Cambridge, UK |year=1997 |page=512 |isbn=978-0-521-45599-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgnhYDozENgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The supreme deity is called [[Chukwu]] ("great spirit"); Chukwu created the world and everything in it and is associated with all things on Earth. They believe the [[Cosmos]] is divided into four complex parts: creation, known as Okike; supernatural forces or deities called [[Alusi]]; [[Odinani#Spirits|Mmuo]], which are spirits; and Uwa, the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M.

[[Chukwu]] is the supreme deity in Odinani as he is the creator, and the Igbo people believe that all things come from him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Among the Ibos of Nigeria |year=1912 |first=G.T. |last=Basden |author2=John Ralph Willis |page=216 |publisher=Seeley, Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that everything on earth, [[heaven]] and the rest of the spiritual world is under his control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Doing Justice Without the State: The Afikpo (Ehugbo) Nigeria Model |first=O.

Thus the Igbos say that the siblings may come of the same mother but no two people have the same Chi and thus different destinies for all. [[Alusi]], alternatively known as Arusi or Arushi (depending on dialect), are minor [[deity|deities]] that are worshiped and served in Odinani. There are many different Alusi, each with its own purpose. When an individual deity is no longer needed, or becomes too violent, it is discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Island Societies: Archaeological Approaches to Evolution and Transformation |first=Patrick Vinton |last=Kirch |edition=illustrated |publisher=CUP Archive |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-521-30189-3 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv48AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ikenga Igbo god.JPG|left|upright|thumb|Wooden sculpture of [[Ikenga]], an [[Alusi]], in the [[British Museum]]]]
The Igbo have traditionally believed in [[reincarnation]]. People are believed to reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive. Before a relative dies, it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues of who they will reincarnate as in the family. Once a child is born, he or she is believed to give signs of who they have reincarnated from. This can be through behavior, physical traits and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from. It is considered an insult if a male is said to have reincarnated as a female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancestors |first=William Hare |last=Newell |pages= 293–294 |isbn=978-90-279-7859-2 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1976 |chapter=Ancestoride!

Children are not allowed to call elders by their names without using an [[honorific]] (as this is considered disrespectful). As a sign of respect, children are required to greet elders when seeing them for the first time in the day. Children usually add the Igbo honorifics ''Mazi'' or ''Dede'' before an elder's name when addressing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Igbo Transformational Syntax: The Ngwa Dialect Example |first=Benson Omenihu A. |last=Oluikpe |publisher=Africana Publishers |year=1979 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4QOAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Njoku&gt;{{cite book|last=Njoku |first=John E.

==== Burials ====
After a death, the body of a prominent member of society is placed on a stool in a sitting posture and is clothed in the deceased's finest garments. Animal sacrifices may be offered and the dead person is well perfumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano |last=Equiano |first=Olaudah |page=24 |publisher=I.

In the 21st century, the head of a home is usually buried within the compound of his residence.&lt;ref name="Njoku" /&gt; Different types of deaths warrant different types of burials. This is determined by an individual's age, gender and status in society. Children are buried in hiding and out of sight; their burials usually take place in the early mornings and late nights.

==== Marriage ====
{{See also|Polygamy in Nigeria}}

The process of marrying usually involves asking the young woman's consent, introducing the woman to the man's family and the same for the man to the woman's family, testing the bride's character, checking the woman's family background, and paying the brides' wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Igbo Life and Thought |first=Joseph Thérèse |last=Agbasiere |author2=Shirley Ardener |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-22703-2 |page=114 |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWONlZ-OsiUC&amp;pg=PA114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages were sometimes arranged from birth through negotiation of the two families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Social Problems: A Comparative International Perspective |first=George |last=Ritzer |page=248 |publisher=SAGE |year=2004 |others=Contributor George Ritzer |isbn=978-0-7619-2610-8 |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yu-sX3qBh9YC&amp;pg=PA248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Traditional Wedding Nnewi.jpg|thumb|A modern Igbo wedding, [[Nnewi]], Nigeria]]
In the past, many Igbo men practiced [[polygamy]]. The polygamous family is made up of a man and his wives and all their children.&lt;ref name="Njoku" /&gt; Men sometimes married multiple wives for economic reasons so as to have more people in the family, including children, to help on farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Education and the Changing Economic Role of Nigerian Women |first=Patrick Kenechukwu |last=Uchendu |publisher=Fourth Dimension Publishing |date=1995 |isbn=978-978-156-403-1 |page=114 |quote=Formerly, there were many polygamous marriages because of the need for many hands to work in the farm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian and civil marriages have changed the Igbo family since [[Colonial Nigeria|colonization]].

=== Attire ===
Traditionally, the attire of the Igbo generally consisted of little clothing, as the purpose of clothing originally was simply to conceal private parts.[[Uli (design)|Uli]] body art was used to decorate both men and women in the form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body.&lt;ref name="clothing2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3jouPZxPC4C&amp;pg=PA135 |last=Chuku |first=Gloria |title=Igbo Women and Economic Transformation in Southeastern Nigeria, 1900–1960: 1900–1960 |page=135 |isbn=978-0-415-97210-9 |publisher=Routledge |year=2005|accessdate=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Igbo hat and Isiagu.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Men wearing contemporary [[Isiagu]] with the ceremonial Igbo men's hat ''okpu agu'']]

Women traditionally carry their babies on their backs with a strip of clothing binding the two with a knot at her chest, a practice used by many ethnic groups across Africa.&lt;ref name="clothing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirt, Undress, and Difference: Critical Perspectives on the Body's Surface |first=Adeline Marie |last=Masquelier |isbn=978-0-253-34628-5 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2005 |pages= 38–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZV9C2AjtFfsC&amp;pg=PA38 |accessdate=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method has been modernized in the form of the [[child carrier]]. Maidens usually wore a short wrapper with beads around their waist and other ornaments such as necklaces and beads.&lt;ref name="clothing" /&gt; Both men and women wore wrappers.&lt;ref name="clothing2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clothing" /&gt; Men would wear [[loin cloth]]s that wrapped round their waist and between their legs to be fastened at their back, the type of clothing appropriate for the intense heat as well as jobs such as farming.&lt;ref name="clothing2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clothing" /&gt;

In [[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano|Olaudah Equiano's narrative]], Equiano describes fragrances that were used by the Igbo in the community of Essaka:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our principal luxury is in perfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of which thrown into the fire diffuses a most powerful odor. We beat this wood into powder, and mix it with [[palm oil]]; with which both men and women perfume themselves.

'''Kalief Browder''' (May 25, 1993{{Spaced ndash}}June 6, 2015) was an [[African American]] man from [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 2010, at the age of 16, Browder was accused of the theft of a backpack and its contents including a camera, $700, a credit card, and an [[iPod Touch]]. Awaiting trial, Browder was jailed on [[Rikers Island]] for three years with nearly two years of time spent in [[solitary confinement]]. He was released when the prosecutor's case was  found to be lacking any evidence against Browder and the case's main witness was found to have left the United States. Two years following his release from prison, Browder died by suicide, hanging himself from an air conditioning unit outside of his mother's home. Browder's supporters say his suicide was the result of mental and physical abuse sustained in prison. His case has been cited by activists who call for the reform of the [[New York City]] criminal justice system, and attracted widespread attention in the years following his death. In 2017, [[Jay-Z|Jay Z]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] released the docuseries ''[[Time: The Kalief Browder Story]]''.

== Early life ==
Browder was placed into the care of [[Child Protective Services]] at birth due to his mother’s drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/600550/time-the-kalief-browder-story-will-make-your-blood-boil|title="Time: The Kalief Browder Story" will make your blood boil|date=2017-02-28|website=Flavorwire|access-date=2017-09-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browder was the youngest of seven biological siblings and one of five of the siblings who were given up for adoption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Browder's adoptive mother, [[Venida Browder]], was experienced in child care, having raised thirty-four children including [[Foster care in the United States|fostered children]], adopted children, and her biological children by 2015. The family lived in a two-story brick house on [[Prospect Avenue (IRT White Plains Road Line)|Prospect Avenue]] near the [[Bronx Zoo]].&lt;ref name=spike/&gt;

Browder attended the New Day Academy. Staff described Browder as very smart and a "fun guy". Browder said his report cards were "populated with Cs".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/episode-33-awkward-dog-banter-and-the-marxist-who-brought-us-hamilton|title=Episode 33: awkward dog banter and the Marxist who brought us "Hamilton"|last=Remnick|first=David|date=2016-06-03|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-11-21|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight months before the arrest that led to his imprisonment, Browder was charged with third-degree [[grand larceny]]. Police testified that Browder crashed a stolen bakery truck into a stationary car while [[joyride (crime)|joyriding]]. Browder was charged as an adult due to the former New York law to charge juveniles as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/new-york-will-no-longer-prosecute-16-and-17-year-olds-as-adult-criminals-d0d6b9019677/|title=New York will no longer prosecute 16 and 17 year olds as adult criminals|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded guilty but later said he was only a bystander.

== Arrest ==
On May 15, 2010, Browder and a friend were apprehended by police on [[Arthur Avenue]] near East 186th Street in [[the Bronx]]. Browder said he was on his way home from a party. He thought the police were carrying out a routine [[Stop-and-frisk in New York City|stop-and-frisk]]; he had undergone this police procedure on a number of occasions.

Police officers were responding to a [[9-1-1]] call placed by Roberto Bautista, a [[Mexican immigration to United States|Mexican immigrant]], about the theft of a [[backpack]] containing a camera, $700, a credit card and an [[iPod Touch]].

He identified Browder and his friend as the thieves. He then said the theft had not taken place that night but two weeks earlier. Bautista's testimony of the date of the theft varied between interviews.&lt;ref name=spike/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spike.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spike.com/shows/time-the-kalief-browder-story|title=Time: the Kalief Browder story |website=Spike.com |publisher=[[Spike (TV network)]] |access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Browder asked the officers, "What am I being charged for?" He said, "I didn't do anything!" A police officer said to Browder, "We're just going to take you to the precinct. Most likely you can go home."&lt;ref name=three/&gt; Browder and his friend were taken to the [[48th Police Precinct Station]]. They were fingerprinted and kept in a holding cell for a few hours. Then, they were taken to the [[Bronx County Criminal Court]], where they were processed at the court's central booking.

Seventeen hours after the arrest, Browder was interrogated by a police officer and a prosecutor. The following day, Browder was charged with robbery, [[grand larceny]], and assault. As he was on probation, Browder was not released. At Browder's [[arraignment]], the charge given was second-degree robbery. [[Bail]] was set at $3,000. With a [[bail bondsman]], the amount might have been $210-$450 (7%-15% of $3,000), but Browder's family could not raise this amount, so he was imprisoned at [[Rikers Island]].&lt;ref name="Newyorker.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law|title=Three Years on Rikers Without Trial|website=The New Yorker|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imprisonment ==
Browder was imprisoned at the Robert N. Davoren Center (R.N.D.C.) on Riker's Island. [[Preet Bharara]], the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] said that the R.N.D.C. had a "deep-seated culture of violence" where inmates suffered "broken jaws, broken orbital bones, broken noses, long bone fractures, and lacerations requiring stitches."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-takes-legal-action-address-pattern-and-practice-excessive-force-and|title=Department of Justice takes legal action to address pattern and practice of excessive force and violence at NYC jails on Rikers Island that violates the Constitutional Rights of young male inmates|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Browder said that inmates washed their own clothes with soap and a metal bucket, giving the clothes rust stains. Browder's mother began visiting every week and provided him with clean clothes and snack money. To avoid becoming a target among the inmates, he slept on top of his belongings, including his bucket. Browder said he felt the pressure to gain physical strength to defend himself from [[prison violence]]. He said, "Every here and there I did a couple pullups or pushups. When I went in there, that's when I decided I wanted to get big".&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

Browder was a victim of [[prison violence]]. On one occasion, he and other inmates were lined up against a wall. Correction Officers (CO) wanted to find the instigator of a prison fight. Browder and the inmates were punched, one by one. Browder said, "Their noses were leaking, their faces were bloody, their eyes were swollen." The guards threatened the inmates with [[solitary confinement]] if they reported their injuries.&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

On October 20, 2010, a gang member spat in Browder's face. Later in the day, Browder punched the gang leader and then was set upon by fifteen gang members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law|title=Three years on Rikers without trial|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, 2012, a film of Browder in handcuffs being assaulted by guards was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://video.newyorker.com/watch/a-reporter-at-large-inside-rikers|title=Violence inside Rikers|website=The New Yorker Videos|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a fight with an inmate, Browder was put in [[solitary confinement]] for two weeks. He later said, "He was throwing shoes at people. I told him to stop. I actually took his sneaker and I threw it, and he got mad. He swung on me, and we started fighting."&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

Altogether, Browder spent nearly two years in solitary confinement, mostly after fights with inmates. Browder later said that while in solitary confinement, he was beaten by corrections officers when in the shower. He said a verbal confrontation with a guard would escalate into a physical altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/24/watch_explosive_footage_from_inside_rikers|title=Watch: explosive footage from inside Rikers jail shows guard beating teen accused of backpack theft|website=Democracy Now!|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his time in solitary confinement, Browder was allowed activities such as reading and also studied for the [[General Educational Development]] (G.E.D) exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/nyregion/after-a-shocking-death-a-renewed-plea-for-bail-reform-in-new-york-state.html |title=A life that frayed as bail reform withered |last=Dwyer |first=Jim|date=June 9, 2015|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |access-date=March 16, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==
Brendan O'Meara was appointed Browder's [[Public defender (United States)|public defender]]. Browder always maintained that he was innocent. Although the [[assistant district attorney]] called Browder's a "relatively straightforward case", his trial was delayed by a backlog of work at the [[Bronx County District Attorney]]'s office.

Seventy-four days after his arrest, in July 2010, Browder was brought before a judge at the [[Bronx County Hall of Justice]]. The [[grand jury]] indicted Browder on a charge second-degree robbery. A second charge of punching and pushing Bautista was heard. Browder made a [[plea]] of "not guilty". Browder's family went to a local [[bail bondsman]] about the new charge but the posting of bail was denied due to Browder's prior violation of his probation.

On December 10, 2010, a potential trial date was made as prosecution and defense had submitted notices of readiness. Two hundred and fifty-eight days after his arrest, on January 28, 2011, Browder appeared in court. The prosecution requested a deferment of proceedings. Browder's record shows on June 23, 2011, the People not ready, request 1 week; August 24, 2011, the People not ready, request 1 day; November 4, 2011, the People not ready, prosecutor on trial, request 2 weeks; and December 2, 2011, prosecutor on trial, request January 3, 2012.

Browder's communication with O'Meara was mostly through Browder's mother. O'Meara said Browder was "quiet, respectful, he wasn't rude" but appeared "tougher and bigger" over time. Browder instructed O'Meara he wanted to go to trial. Browder was offered a [[plea bargain]] of 3.5 years in prison if he pleaded guilty. In June 2012, this amount was reduced to 2.5 years. Browder declined the plea bargain.

Browder's record shows on June 29, 2012, the People not ready, request one week; September 28, 2012, the People not ready, request two weeks; November 2, 2012, the People not ready, request one week; December 14, 2012, the People not ready, request one week. After 961 days in prison, Browder had appeared before eight judges. Browder later said, "these guys are just playing with my case".&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

On March 13, 2013, Browder appeared before a [[Brooklyn]] judge, [[Patricia DiMango]]. She offered Browder a plea bargain of immediate release for his admission of guilt to two [[misdemeanor]]s with consideration of time already served. Browder refused the offer and was returned to prison. On May 29, 2013, DiMango freed Browder in anticipation of the dismissal of the charges against him one week hence. Bautista had returned to [[Mexico]] and could not give testimony against Browder.&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

== Legal action ==
After his release, Browder and his brother, Akeem, sought legal representation.&lt;ref name="spike" /&gt; A family member found the Brooklyn prosecutor, Paul V. Prestia. In 2011, Prestia had represented a Haitian man who had been arrested in the Bronx and was wrongfully imprisoned for eight days.&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

In November 2013, Browder filed a lawsuit against the [[New York City Police Department|New York Police Department]], the Bronx District Attorney, and the [[Department of Corrections]].&lt;ref name="spike" /&gt; Prestia put that there had been a [[malicious prosecution]] and the court had been misled as to whether the prosecution would ever be ready for trial. Prestia also put to the court that the prosecution knew they would have no witness when Bautista went to Mexico. The [[Government of New York City|City of New York]] denied these allegations.&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

In 2014, [[Preet Bharara]], the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] took action against the City of New York for its use of "unnecessary and excessive force" on adolescents in Riker's Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/lawsuit-end-abuse-rikers|title=A Lawsuit to End Abuse at Rikers|date=December 19, 2014|website=The New Yorker|access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the [[New York City Council]] voted unanimously to end solitary confinement for inmates under the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/01/14/376708912/new-solitary-confinement-plan-at-rikers-humane-or-putting-officers-at-risk|title=New Solitary Confinement Plan For Younger Inmates At Rikers |website=NPR.org |access-date=March 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and employment ==
Soon after his release, Browder passed the G.E.D. exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-1993-2015|title=Kalief Browder, 1993 {{ndash}} 2015|last=Gonnerman|first=Jennifer|date=June 7, 2015 |magazine= [[The New Yorker]] |access-date=March 13, 2017|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then enrolled at the [[Bronx Community College]] (BCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-learned-how-to-commit-suicide-on-rikers|title=Kalief Browder learned how to commit suicide on Rikers|date=June 2, 2016 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browder participated in the [[City University of New York]]'s "Future Now" program, which offered a college education to previously incarcerated youths. Browder completed 11 credits and finished his semester with a [[grade point average]] of 3.562.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/06/18/essay-death-kalief-browder-student-bronx-community-college|first=Eduardo J.|last=Marti|title=Essay on the death of Kalief Browder, a student at Bronx Community College|newspaper=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=June 18, 2015 |access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to depression, Browder did not attend college in the fall semester but re-enrolled in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-new-york-kalief-browder-20150607-story.html|title=Kalief Browder, jailed for 3 years in N.Y. without a trial, commits suicide|last=Pearce|first=Matt|date=June 7, 2015 |newspaper==[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=March 13, 2017|language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2015, Browder submitted a paper titled "A Closer Look at Solitary Confinement in the United States" for which he was scored an "A". He wrote "Solitary confinement should be looked at as a whole around the United States and even though changes toward the solitary confinement system have begun in some states, more needs to be done and addressed around the country. In a lot of jails and prisons there are a lot of living circumstances and practices that go on within that are not addressed that people need to shed light on like solitary confinement, for example. Maybe another form of punishment or segregation should be implemented to deal with inmates who break jail rules as opposed to inmates who cause severe harm to other inmates and correction officers because the mental health risk it poses are too great."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/23/kalief-browder-solitary-confinement-research-paper_n_7646492.html|title=Here's Kalief Browder's heartbreaking research paper on solitary confinement|last=Mathias|first=Christopher|date=June 23, 2015 |website=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=March 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.essence.com/2015/06/24/kalief-browder-essay-solitary-confinement-month-committing-suicide|title=Kalief Browder penned essay on solitary confinement one month before committing suicide|last=Lewis|first=Taylor |date=June 24, 2015|magazine=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]] |access-date=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also handed out flyers near Wall street. Browder said, "I see businessmen and businesswomen dressed in suits...I want to be successful, like them."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law|title=Three years on Rikers without trial|website=The New Yorker|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spike.com"/&gt;

== Suicide ==
He attempted suicide in early 2011 and on February 8, 2012 when he tried to hang himself using strips of sheet tied to a ceiling light in the cell. Browder later said the CO's goaded him to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-1993-2015|title=Kalief Browder, 1993 {{ndash}} 2015|last=Gonnerman|first=Jennifer|date=June 7, 2015|work=The New Yorker|access-date=March 30, 2017|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-learned-how-to-commit-suicide-on-rikers|title=Kalief Browder learned how to commit suicide on Rikers|date=June 2, 2016|website=The New Yorker|access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, after an appearance before a judge, Browder made a sharp implement from the bucket in his cell and started to [[Wrist slitting|slit his wrists]]. An officer intervened.&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

After his release, Browder's symptoms of depression persisted. He said, "People tell me because I have this case against the city I'm all right. But I'm not all right. I'm messed up. I know that I might see some money from this case, but that's not going to help me mentally. I'm mentally scarred right now. That's how I feel. Because there are certain things that changed about me and they might not go back." He also said, "Before I went to jail, I didn't know about a lot of stuff, and, now that I'm aware, I'm paranoid. I feel like I was robbed of my happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/featured/kalief-browder-siblings-interview-spike-tv/|title=Kalief Browder's siblings work to preserve his legacy|date=March 1, 2017|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe magazine]] |access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Browder made a suicide attempt and was admitted to the psychiatric ward of [[St Barnabas Hospital (Bronx)|St. Barnabas Hospital]].&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt; This was the first of three admissions to the ward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Supporters===
On June 11, 2015, mourners came together. A vigil lasting three hours was held near the Manhattan Detention Center. Mourners chanted, "Justice for Kalief". At the same time, a vigil was held on Rikers Island. People held up signs reading "[[Black Lives Matter]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/11/vigil-to-honor-kalief-browder.html |title=New Yorkers gather in vigil to honor Kalief Browder |website=[[Aljazeera.com]] |access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2015, an event on Rikers Island was organized through [[Facebook]] under the banner, "March to shut down Rikers -- Justice for Kalief Browder! No to criminalization!" and the [[hashtag]]s "#resist Rikers" and "#Shutdown Rikers". The event gained 500 Facebook responses. At the event, protesters held signs with the slogan "Black Lives Matter" written on them, photographs and paintings of Browder. The [[New York City Police Department]] and the Department of Corrections responded in a peaceful manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/kalief-browder-protest-rikers-draws-dozens-police-officers-prison-reform-advocates-1986895 |title=Kalief Browder protest at Rikers draws dozens of Police Officers, prison reform advocates|date=June 27, 2015 |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2015, fifty peaceful protesters led by Akeem, gathered at the Bronx Supreme Court, chanting "Black Lives Matter". It was the anniversary of the [[Shooting of Michael Brown|shooting death of Michael Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/11/protests-echo-across-country/31495583/ |title=Protests echo across the country|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |access-date=March 16, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2016, Browder's mother, Venida Browder died of complications of a heart attack. Prestia said, "In my opinion, she literally died of a broken heart" because the "stress from this crusade coupled with the strain of the pending lawsuits against the city and the pain from the death were too much for her to bear." Akeem Browder shared similar thoughts, saying, "My mother has been holding herself strong, but she's heartbroken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/10/18/kalief-browder-hanged-himself-after-jail-destroyed-him-then-a-broken-heart-killed-his-mother/|title=Kalief Browder hanged himself after jail destroyed him.

In October 2016, the New York City Correction Commissioner, Joseph Ponte, penned an op-ed in the [[Gotham Gazette]] stating that New York City will cease locking prisoners in solitary confinement if they are between 16 and 21 years of age. He wrote, "This is an unprecedented milestone in New York State correctional history and, even more important, across the nation. To date, no other city or state has accomplished comparable punitive-segregation reforms for the 19 {{ndash}} 21 year-old age group."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/opinion/6566-leading-the-way-on-ending-punitive-segregation|title=Leading the Way on Ending Punitive Segregation|last=Ponte |first=Joseph |website=[[Gotham Gazette]] |access-date=March 16, 2017 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] said, "Today's announcement shows that New York City is leading the nation down a new path toward rehabilitation and safety. New Yorkers can be proud that their correctional facilities are pioneering these smarter, more humane approaches." This marked the implementation of the measure that New York City officials had originally voted on in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/new-york-city-is-finally-done-sending-teens-to-solitary |title=New York City Is Finally Done Sending Teens to Solitary&amp;nbsp;— VICE |website=[[Vice.com]] |language=en-us|access-date=March 17, 2017|date=2016-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, "New York City will close the Riker's Island jail facility. It will take many years. It will take many tough decisions. But it will happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jay-z-applauds-new-yorks-promise-to-close-rikers-island-w474554|title=Jay Z Applauds New York Mayor's Promise to Close Rikers Island|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/nyregion/mayor-de-blasio-is-said-to-back-plan-to-close-jails-on-rikers-island.html|title=Mayor Backs Plan to Close Rikers and Open Jails Elsewhere|last=Goodman|first=J.

On April 10, 2017, Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] signed into law the "Raise the Age" initiative, which would send the majority of cases involving 16 and 17 year old defendants to the [[New York Family Court|Family Court]] or be reviewed by judges with special training in social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/nyregion/raise-the-age-new-york.html|title='Raise the Age', Now Law in New York, Is Still a Subject of Debate|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|date=2017-04-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
In the October 2014 issue of ''The New Yorker'', Jennifer Gonnerman wrote an article about Browder.&lt;ref name="gonnerman" /&gt;

In November 2014, Browder and Prestia appeared on [[The View (U.S. TV series)|''The View'']], a morning [[talk show]] hosted by [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. On the show, Browder said his appearance on the show was a "good opportunity to get [his] voice heard". He also said it was difficult to speak about his experience in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/the-view/video/pl5554876/VDKA0_ozeda6pr|title=Kalief Browder Story (part one)|website=ABC|access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rapping|rapper]] and businessman, [[Jay Z]] also contacted Browder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-1993-2015|title=Kalief Browder, 1993 {{ndash}} 2015|last=Gonnerman|first=Jennifer|date=June 7, 2015 |magazine= [[The New Yorker]] |access-date=March 17, 2017|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, a detailed six part [[television documentary]] series produced by [[Jay Z]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] was broadcast on the [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]] television network. It was titled ''[[Time: The Kalief Browder Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/watch-trailer-for-jay-z-prouced-time-the-kalief-browder-story-w456272 |title=Watch harrowing trailer for "Time: the Kalief Browder story"|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=March 17, 2017|date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Z said, "I knew right there that [Kalief] was a prophet. Some of our prophets go with tragedy, Martin Luther King, it ends tragically. But what comes from it, the life, the next iteration, the lives saved, and how this young man has moved culture forward is incredible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/2016/10/jay-z-kalief-browder-spike-tv/|title=Jay Z shares the story of the day he met Kalief Browder|date=October 6, 2016 |magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay, the singer, [[John Legend]] wrote, "New York failed Kalief. The list of things that went wrong in his case begins with his first encounter with the NYPD, whose practice of targeting black teens is well documented. The idea that being accused of stealing a backpack would lead to his arrest and detention would be absurd if it weren't actually tragic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/2015/06/john-legend-kalief-browder-system-is-broken/ |title=John Legend writes pensive letter on death of Kalief Browder|date=June 13, 2015 |magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Kazakhstan}}

'''Kangar union, {{lang-kk |Қaңғар Oдағy}}''' (''Qanghar Odaghu'') was a [[Turkic people|Turkic]] state in the territory of the entire modern [[Kazakhstan]] without [[Zhetysu]]. The ethnic name Kangar is a medieval name for the [[Kankalis|Kangly]] people, who are now part of the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoi V.P. ''Origin of the Karakalpak people''//KSIE, Moscow, 1947. p.75&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]] nations. The '''Kangly''' ('''Qangly''', '''Kang''', '''Kangar''', '''Kengeres''', '''Kangdy''', '''Kangarlyk''', '''Kankalis''') were a Turkic tribe known from the 2nd century BCE to past the 12th century CE. The [[Pechenegs|Western Branch of Kangars]] after a defeat from [[Kypchaks]] of the [[Kimek Khanate|Kimek Kaganate]] attacked and defeated the [[Bulgars]], establishing the Kangar state in Eastern Europe (840-990 CE). The capital of the Kangar union was located in the Ulytau mountains.

== Etymology ==
A modern interpretation of the etymology is that ethnonym ''Kangar'' consists of two roots, ''Kang/Kang'' (''Qang/Qang''), a Turkic for "father, primogenitor", and ''är'' "people, men", '''Kanger'''.&lt;ref&gt;M.Zakiev, ''Origin of Türks and Tatars'', p.361, Moscow, "Insan", 2002, {{ISBN|5-85840-317-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate etymology is that the word ''kangly'' in Old Turkic meant "wagon, vehicle", and is homonymous with the name of the Kangly tribe.

'''Kengeres'''' of the [[Orkhon inscriptions]] were known in the Islamic world and in the west as [[Bajanaks]] (Lat. ''[[Pechenegs|Besenyo]]'',  Turcic ''Pechenek'', ''[[Pechenegs]]'') whose self-designation was Kangar.&lt;ref&gt;P.Golubovsky, ''Pechenegs, Torks, and Polovetses before Tatar invasion'', SPb, 1884. p.55, in L.Gumilev, ''Ancient Türks'', [http://gumilevica.kulichki.net/OT/ot20.htm Ch.20] (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] wrote that "Kangar" meant nobleness and bravery.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Porphyrogenitus, ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independence ==
After the capture of [[Zhetysu]] by the [[Tang Empire|Chinese]], Kangars become independent from the [[Göktürks|Turkic Kaganate]]. They repulsed Chinese from the southern [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Syr Darya]] cities. The Syr Darya cities retained their autonomy. The [[Oghuz Turks|Oguzes]] in the southern [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kimek Khanate|Kimaks]] in the [[Irtysh River]] valley, [[Cumans]] in Mugodjar, and [[Kypchaks]] in the northern Kazakhstan became the vassals of the Kangar union.

At the end of the 7th century the Syr Darya cities rebelled and formed an alliance with the [[Sogdiana]]. The revolt was successful, but the [[Moslem]] [[Arab]] armies attacked Sogdiana from the south. The revolt has waned, and Kangars consented to the continued autonomy of the Syr Darya cities.

== Fall of the Union ==
At the beginning of the 8th century the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] confederation and the city of [[Tashkent]] seceded from the Kangar union. The Arabs continued raiding [[Sygnakh]], Jend, and other rich Kangar cities.

After the [[Arabs]] captured [[Sogdiana]], they attacked the Kangar cities along the Syr Darya. The [[Arabs]] captured the southern [[Kazakhstan]], and the [[Oghuz Yabgu State|Oguz confederation]] took control over the other Kangar cities along the Syr Darya. The Oguzes formed an alliance with the [[Kimek Khanate|Kimak Kaganate]]. The Kangar Union dissolved. The western branch of the Kangars, known in the west under the name of their allied tribe of [[Pechenegs]], captured the lands of the [[Khazars|Khazar Kaganate]], and created a Kangar successor state in the Eastern Europe.

==Kangar migration and  North Pontic Kangar state==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
A mass migration of the Oghuz tribes in the middle of the 8th c. displaced population of the [[Kangar Union]] on the eastern borders of the Khazar Kaganate, forcing it to move into Khazarian territories.  At first, [[Kangar people|Kangars]] settled in the territory between [[Yaik]]-[[Emba River|Emba]] ''(Geeh)'' and [[Itil (river)|Itil]] ''(Volga)'' rivers, then they advanced into the Khazar domain territories. The forceful influx of Kangars and their allied tribes seriously impacted Khazar populations with destruction of settlements and population, and the population mass escape to safer areas to the north and south, and the [[Magyars]] of Lebedia to the west. The Kangar tribal Union, better known in Europe as [[Pechenegs]] under a Slavic name of their subject allies, occupied a large swath of Khazaria extending from [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] in the east to [[Pannonia]] in the west. Between the rivers Yaik and Emba, they controlled the Khazar trading route from Itil to Khorezm, dealing a hard blow to the Khazarian trade. The North Pontic Kangar state eventually established coexistent with Khazaria, while dominating North Pontic area of Khazaria from ca. 750 to ca. 900. [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] named three Kangar tribes ''(Chor (Charvat), Ertim, Yula)'', and four Bechen tribes ''(Kapan, Karabai, Kulbei, Tolmach)'', and their respective locations. [[Gardizi]] (ca. 1050) reported on the situation around 950: "Bechens are nomads following rain and pasturage. Their territory extends a distance of thirty days in either direction ''(i.e. about 1,000x1,000 km)'', bordering Kipchaks in the north, Khazars on southwest, Oguz in the east, and Saqlabs ''(bilad as-Saqaliba, Bulgars)'' to the west. All these peoples raid Bechens, who likewise raid them...". At the end, Kangars were displaced further west by the migration of the [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] tribes, who ca. 990 embarked on a massive migration into the E.Europe, supplanting Kangars-Bosnyaks in the east of the Kangar North Pontic state.

The '''Khmer Krom''' ({{lang-km|ខ្មែរក្រោម}}, {{lang-vi|Khơ Me Krom}}) are ethnically [[Khmer people]] living in the south western part of [[Vietnam]], where they are recognized as one of Vietnam's fifty-three [[ethnic minorities]]. 

In the [[Khmer language]], Krom means "lower" or "below", as it refers to an area of {{convert|89000|km2|sqmi|0}} around modern day Saigon and the  [[Mekong Delta]], which used to be the southeasternmost territory of the [[Khmer Empire]] until its incorporation into Vietnam under the [[Nguyễn lords]] in the early 18th century.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Cambodia}}

===Absorption of the Mekong Delta by Vietnam===

In the 17th century a weakened Khmer state left the Mekong Delta poorly administered after repeated warfare with [[Siam]]. Concurrently Vietnamese refugees fleeing the [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War]] in Vietnam migrated into the area. In 1623 Cambodian king [[Chey Chettha II]] (1618–1628) officially sanctioned the Vietnamese immigrants to operate a custom house at Prey Nokor, then a small fishing village. The settlement steadily grew soon becoming a major regional port, attracting even more settlers.

In 1698 the [[Nguyễn Lords]] of [[Huế]] commissioned [[Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh]], a Vietnamese noble to organize the territory along Vietnamese administrative lines, thus by ''de facto'' detaching it from the Kingdom of Cambodia and incorporating it into Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.kh/books?id=8S5PXyWMEeAC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;lpg=PT24&amp;dq=16th+century+cambodia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eynkhcs4Pc&amp;sig=zVa0fNgkJmhjpz9FnNp2evYd9Aw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBTgKahUKEwjxjYnKuYnGAhXEKqYKHS8NAEc#v=onepage&amp;q=16th%20century%20cambodia&amp;f=false  |title= MA Short History of South-East Asia  edited by Peter Church   |date= | publisher= Google Books  |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the loss of the port of Prey Nokor, then renamed [[Sài Gòn]], Cambodia's control of the area grew increasingly tenuous while increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers to the Delta isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from the Cambodian kingdom. By 1757 the Vietnamese had absorbed the provinces of Psar Dèk (renamed [[Sa Đéc]] in Vietnamese) on the [[Mekong]] itself, and Moat Chrouk (Vietnamized to [[Châu Đốc]]) on the [[Bassac River]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Minh Mạng]] enacted assimilation policies upon the Khmer such as forcing them to adopt Sino-Vietnamese surnames, culture, and clothing.

On June 4, 1949 the French President [[Vincent Auriol]] signed the accord reincorporating [[Cochinchina]] to Vietnam. This was done without consulting the indigenous Khmer Krom.

===Separatist movements===
Khmer nationalist [[Son Ngoc Thanh]] (1908–77) was a Khmer krom, born in [[Trà Vinh]], Vietnam. Thanh was active in the independence movement for Cambodia. With Japanese support he became the prime minister of Cambodia in March 1945 but was then quickly ousted with the return of the French later that year. Widely supported by the Khmer Krom during the [[First Indochina War]], Thanh's role faded in Vietnam after 1954 as he became more embroiled with politics in Cambodia proper, forming an opposition movement against Prince [[Sihanouk]].

During the [[Vietnam War]] and direct American involvement between 1964 and 1974, the Khmer Krom were recruited by the [[United States Armed Forces]] to serve in [[MIKE Force]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/Vietnam/90-23/90-23C.htm ''Vietnam Studies, U.S. Army Special Forces 1961-1971''], CMH Publication 90-23, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C. 1989 (First Printed, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The force fought on the side of [[South Vietnam]] against the [[Viet Cong]] but in time the militia regrouped as the "Front for the Struggle of Kampuchea Krom" ({{lang-fr|Front de Lutte du Kampuchea Krom}}). Headed by a Khmer Krom [[Buddhist monk]], Samouk Sen, the group was nicknamed the "White Scarves" ({{lang-km|Kangsaing Sar}}; {{lang-vi|Can Sen So}}) and allied itself with [[FULRO]] against South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Radu, M. ''The New Insurgencies'', Transaction Publishers, 1990, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; FULRO was an alliance of Khmer Krom, Montagnard, and Cham groups.

The anti-Communist prime minister of the [[Khmer Republic]] (1970 - 1975) [[Lon Nol]] planned to recapture the [[Mekong Delta]] from South Vietnam.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

After the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and the Communist take-over of all of Vietnam, the Kampuchea Krom militia found itself embattled with [[People's Army of Vietnam]]. Many of the fighters fled to [[Khmer Rouge]]-controlled [[Democratic Kampuchea]] hoping to find a safe haven to launch their operations inside Vietnam. The "White Scarves" arrived in [[Kiri Vong District]] in 1976, making overture to the Khmer Rouge and appealing to the leader [[Khieu Samphan]] directly for assistance. The force was disarmed and welcomed initially. Subsequent orders from the Khmer Rouge leadership however had Samouk Sen arrested, taken to Phnom Penh, tortured, and killed. His force of 67 Khmer Krom fighters were all massacred. During the following months, some 2,000 "White Scarves" fighters crossing into Kampuchea were systematically killed by the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kiernan, ''The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power, and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge'', 1975–79. New Haven: Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-14434-5}}, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, the [[Kampuchean Revolutionary Army]] attacked Vietnam in an attempt to reconquer the areas which were formerly part of the Khmer Empire, but this military adventure was a total disaster and precipitated the invasion of Democratic Kampuchea by the People's Army of Vietnam and subsequent downfall of the [[Khmer Rouge]], with Vietnam occupying Kampuchea.

==Human rights==
[[File:Flag of KKF.svg|thumb|Flag of Khmers Kampuchea-Krom Federation (KKF)]]

Many independent [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] report that the human rights of the Khmer Krom are being violated by the Vietnamese government. Khmer Krom are reportedly forced to adopt Vietnamese family names and speak the [[Vietnamese language]].&lt;ref name=RCUSA&gt;[http://www.rcusa.org/uploads/pdfs/HRW%20Khmer,%20January%202009.pdf Human Rights Watch: "On the Margins: Rights and Abuses of Ethnic Khmer in Vietnam's Mekong Delta"] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khmerkrom.org/node/25 |title=Rearhoo (The Dark Age) - KKF |date=6 August 2009 |publisher= |accessdate=21 September 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806184840/http://www.khmerkrom.org/node/25 |archivedate= 6 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the Vietnamese government has cracked down on non violent demonstrations by the Khmer Krom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/01/21/margins/rights-abuses-ethnic-khmer-vietnams-mekong-delta|title=On the Margins|date=21 January 2009|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some other minority people groups in Vietnam{{who|date=April 2018}}, the Khmer Krom are largely unknown by the Western world, despite efforts by associations of exiled Khmer Krom such as the [[Khmers Kampuchea-Krom Federation]] to publicize their plight with the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]]. No Western government has yet raised the matter of the Khmer Krom's human rights with the Vietnamese government.&lt;ref name=RCUSA/&gt;

The "Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review Working Group" was visited by the Khmer Kampuchea Krom Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/16831|title=UNPO: Khmer Krom Attend UPR Session on Vietnam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lipo''' (autonym: ''{{IPA|li˥pʰɔ˨˩}}''; {{zh|里泼}}), or '''Eastern Lisu''', is a language of the [[Lisu people]] of China, similar to but not intelligible with [[Lisu language|Lisu proper]]. Some Lipo are classified by the government as Lisu, others as [[Yi people|Yi]]. In some areas, the people prefer the name ''Lolopo'' or ''Lolongo''.

Some Lipo (''Lipa'' 利帕) speakers in Eryuan and Yongsheng counties are also referred to as ''Tujia'' (土家) (Yunnan 1956:19-20).&lt;ref&gt;Yunnan provincial ethnic classification research unit [云南省民族识别研究组]. 1956.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3037">The '''Madjars''' or '''Madi-yar people''' are a Turkic ethnic group in [[Kazakhstan]]. They number about 1,000–2,000 and live mostly in the [[Kostanay Region]]. 

==Ethnonym==
Turkologist scholar Dr. Imre Baski claims that the [[ethnonym]] Madjar means 'faithful Muslim'.{{Quotation|"Madi-yar that proved to be a compound anthroponym (Madi[y]-yar) of Arabic-Persian origin. The paper also provides the explanation of the anthroponyms Aldi-yar (’Allah’s friend/follower’) and Ḫudi-yar (’God’s friend/follower’), the “relatives” of Madi(y)-yar (’Muhammad’s friend/follower’)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/107/03%20baski.pdf|title=A kazak madijar nemzetségnév és a magyar népnév állítólagos közös eredetéről|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Genetic researches==



Madjars have the highest recorded rate of [[Y-DNA]] [[haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup G]]: a level of 86.7% (45 individuals).&lt;ref name="Biro 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Biro, A. Zalan, A., et al., |title=A Y-Chromosomal Comparison of the Madjars (Kazakhstan) and the Magyars (Hungary) |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology  |volume=139  |issue=3  |pages=305–10 |year=2009 |pmid=19170200  |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20984 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the Madjars are linked genetically to the neighbouring [[Argyn]] people of Kazakhstan, as well as various [[peoples of the Caucasus]], and modern [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]].  

While the Madjars have sometimes been linked [[onomastic]]ally to the [[Magyars]] (Hungarians).  Proponents of this view include supporters of "[[Hungarian Turanism]]", such as Zsolt András Biró. However, it is not supported by any strong material evidence. In fact, haplogroup G is rare in Hungary (at a rate around 3%) and has much higher rates in parts of Western and Southern Europe (e.g. Italy and France). Southern German populations also have a higher rate of Haplogroup G than the Hungarian population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eupedia.com/europe/european_y-dna_haplogroups.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mahafaly''' are an [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group of Madagascar]] that inhabit the plains of the [[Betioky]]-Ampanihy area. Their name means either "those who make holy"{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=867}} or "those who make happy", although the former is considered more likely by linguists. In 2013 there were an estimated 150,000 Mahafaly in Madagascar.{{sfn|Diagram Group|2013}} The Mahafaly are believed to have arrived in Madagascar from southeastern Africa around the 12th century. They became known for the [[Architecture of Madagascar#Tomb construction|large tombs]] they built to honor dead chiefs and kings. Mainly involved in farming and cattle raising, they speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]].

==Ethnic identity==
[[File:Ethnic_groups_of_Madagascar_Map.png|thumb|left|200px|Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups]]
This ethnic group label has been used by other Malagasy and foreigners to describe the people who traditionally inhabited the southwestern coast of Madagascar, bounded inland by the [[Menarandra River|Menarandra]] and [[Onilahy River|Onilahy]] rivers.{{sfn|Eggert|1981|p=149}} The people themselves do not use this label or identify as part of a single ethnic group, however, and prefer to identify along other kinship or geopolitical lines; the name Mahafaly holds no meaning for the people originating from this area and instead is a label imposed from the outside.{{sfn|Eggert|1981|pp=150-51}} The majority of the population is concentrated along the banks of the rivers that run through the otherwise largely arid territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | last = Zimmermann  | first = Maurice   | year = 1911   | title = Le pays Mahafaly dans le sud Malgache   | journal = [[Annales de Géographie]]  | volume = 20 | issue = 110   | pages = 189–191  | url = http://www.persee.fr/doc/geo_0003-4010_1911_num_20_110_7420 | language = French  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to oral histories, the Mahafaly people trace their origins back to an early Maroserana noble, Olembetsitoto,{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=856}} who emerged as a leader in the 1500s with the migration of the Maroserana into the southwestern part of Madagascar.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=867}} Prior to the arrival of the Maroserana, people settled in this portion of the island lived in communities ruled by chiefly families called ''andriantsileliky''. Maroserana migrants initially formed alliances with these families, but this eventually turned to conflict, with the Maroserana emerging as the victors; as the Maroserana came to power, they allowed the Andriantileliky to retain certain privileges and special status.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=859}}

After reigning for some years, Olembetsitoto went into seclusion. His followers believed that he had become holy (''faly'') and made his land and people holy (''maha-faly'') through this act, which mirrored popular belief around the principal Maroserana deity Andriamaro, which could not be seen, communicated through a medium intermediary, and commanded obedience by inspiring fear and awe. The followers of this noble remained united in their allegiance to him through the ''ombiasy'' (holy adviser) who served as an intermediary between the ruler and his people.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=867}} One of the earliest documented Mahafaly political actions was In June 1649, when twelve Mahafaly envoys visited the French settlement at Fort Dauphin to successfully obtain the paid services of French mercenaries to help fight the [[Masikoro]] people who had stolen their king's cattle.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=868}}

The Mahafaly polity began to splinter into independent kingdoms beginning around 1650 with the Sakatovo and Menarandra kingdoms. The Linta kingdom split away around two decades later, and the Onilahy kingdom was formed from the remaining territory around 1750. A conflict between the king of Menarandra and the neighboring Antandroy people to the west resulted in the annexation of the Antandroy province of Karimbola in the first half of the 18th century.  Although the specifics of the history of these kingdoms before 1800 is not well known, the frequent changes in rulers within each kingdom points to instability and turmoil within the Maroserana dynasty:  Linta had seven rulers, Sakatovo had six, Menarandra had three between 1750-1800, and Onilahy had two.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|pp=867-68}} The Onilahy kingdom reflected some [[Antemoro people|Antemoro]] influences, such as calling their king by the title ''andrianony''.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=868}}

The Mahafaly kingdom was one of the few that did not come under the control of the [[Merina Kingdom]] in the 19th century.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi|1998|p=422}} The last Mahafaly king was Tsiampondy, who ruled from 1890 to 1911.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=868}}

==Society==
[[File:IMG 6026 Mahafaly men.jpg|thumbnail|Mahafaly men]]
Mahafaly society is generally patriarchal.{{sfn|Eggert|1981|p=151}} It is expected that male family members (fathers, sons, brothers) should live in close proximity to one another, while women are expected to move to their husband's village.{{sfn|Eggert|1981|p=153}} Society is primarily structured around five types of kinship groups, with the immediate household as the most important. As in other parts of Madagascar, ancestors are venerated.

Historically, beginning with the first Maroserana ruler, the Mahafaly were ruled by kings of the Maroserana line. Kings were buried in tombs called ''volamena'' ("gold"){{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=858}} and they were renamed after their death, a practice called ''anaratahina'', as it was taboo after death to speak the name a king had in life;{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=868}} all his followers were required to cut their hair at the start of the mourning period and any who did not comply were expelled from the community.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=103}} Early Mahafaly kings lived in compounds that had paths radiating out toward each of the major surrounding villages in his territory,{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=857}} and his power was compounded by the possession of royal relics believed to hold supernatural powers.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=96}} The king ruled over a society that was divided into those of privilege (''renilemy''), commoners (''valohazomanga'') and migrants to the area from elsewhere (''folahazomanga''). The ''renilemy'' consisted of those who were descendants of the most powerful chief during the establishment of the Maroserana dynasty, Tsileliky ("not conquerable"); the descendents of Tsileliky's companions and favored subjects; and particular individuals (or their descendants) who had received a royal favor. The king was supported by a councillor (''ombiasy'') as well as a priest (''mpisoro'') who was responsible for conducting animal sacrifices at the communal altar (''hangomaza-lava''). The society was divided into numerous clans, some of which held particular responsibilities such as blacksmithing and honey collecting. Heads of these clans were elected under the title of "royal friend" (''rainitsy ny mpanjaka'') and had an official councillor (''ondaty-be'') similar to the king himself.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=867}} Only the heads of clans and the king were authorized to carry a large iron spear (''beraha''), which served as a symbol of their status.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=90}}

===Family affiliation===
The household is the most important social affiliation among the Mahafaly. A household is defined as a group of cohabiting family members led by and "belonging to" the oldest male in the group. Children remain a member of their father's household until reaching adulthood, at which point young men establish their own house and family near their father's house, while young women marry and move into their husband's house. Men retain custody of children in the event of a divorce.{{sfn|Eggert|1981|p=151}} It is not uncommon among traditional families for a man to have more than one wife. Immediate family members living together in a household are responsible for organizing the weddings and funerals of their family members, as well as covering expenses related to healing ceremonies (''rombo'') for ill family members.{{sfn|Eggert|1981|p=152}}

A Mahafaly individual's social identity is also defined by his or her ''foko'' - a grouping of all descendants of a living man or woman; an individual belongs simultaneously to multiple foko. Members of a foko typically only gather or work together when the head of the foko is ill, in need of assistance, or has died, in which case the members will organize to take action as needed.{{sfn|Eggert|1981|p=152}} An even stronger identity is one's ''tariha'', the living descendants of a male line of descent traced back to a common male ancestor who died recently enough that the oldest members of the group can trace their kinship ties to him and remember some features about him as a person. All sacrifices to the ancestors (''soro'') are made in the name of this common ancestor, and the oldest male ''tariha'' member is responsible for carrying out these rituals on behalf of the group. Members of a tariha typically live near each other and form a village or cluster of villages.{{sfn|Eggert|1981|p=153}}
&lt;!--===Religious affiliation===--&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Mahafaly tomb with aloalo detail south Madagascar 2.jpg|thumbnail|Mahafaly tomb]]
The Mahafaly are mainly involved in farming and cattle raising.{{sfn|LeHoullier|2010|p=50}} Zebu hold an important place in society for both economic and spiritual reasons, being seen as symbolic of life and nobility, as well as a means of linking the living to the ancestors.&lt;ref name = Speech/&gt; Members of a household work together to undertake farming and other livelihood activities to meet the family's subsistence needs.  The younger male family members are typically responsible for herding the family's cattle{{sfn|Eggert|1981|p=152}} and men of all ages work in the fields. Women assist with work in the fields and are also responsible for household tasks like cooking and fetching water, often assisted by their children and sometimes by their husband.&lt;ref name = ACF&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Mattern  | first1 = Chiarella | last2 = Ravelomandeha | first2 = Farasoa  |title= Etude anthropologique exploratoire: l'organisation sociale et les structures politiques sur le plateau Mahafaly Madagascar, Region Atsimo Andrefana |publisher = Action Contre la Faim |url=http://madagascar-unesco.com/Anatole.pdf |year = 2012 |accessdate=20 February 2017 |language = French | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clothing in this region was traditionally made of spun cotton, which was cultivated locally; less frequently, locally spun silk was also sometimes used.{{sfn|Condra|2013|p=456}}

===''Fady''===
''[[Fady (taboo)|Fady]]'' (taboos) have long played an important role in the cultural life of the Mahafaly. Historically, common taboos among the Mahafaly included a prohibition against women drinking from the same cup or sitting on the same mat as their husband,{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=157}} standing while speaking to a king,{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=86}} Mahafaly women were historically allowed to smoke tobacco but not to chew it.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=299}} Throughout Mahafaly country it was forbidden for white people to enter; if one managed to penetrate the territory, the chief of that land was put to death.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=42}} Kings had the power to place a taboo on certain words that could never be spoken again by members of the community.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=337}}

===Funeral rites===
As in much of Madagascar, the Mahafaly bury their dead in tombs. The tombs of family members were historically located in sacred forest areas far from the houses of the living, although due to deforestation and other factors this is no longer always the case. Tombs are typically clustered together and laid out according to the rank and role of the family members, with the eldest ancestor's tomb the furthest south, his descendants to his north, and wives and unmarried family members to his west. Funerals consist of several ceremonies, and zebu are sacrificed at each; their skulls are placed on top of the tomb. The first ceremony is one of preparation for the following events and the ''ombilahy'' zebu sacrificed at this ceremony is particularly important because the meat is shared with all those gathered as a gesture of unity and friendship.&lt;ref name = Speech&gt;{{cite web|title=L'art funeraire Mahafaly |author= UNESCO |url=http://madagascar-unesco.com/Anatole.pdf |accessdate=20 February 2017 |language = French | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahafaly also decorate their tombs with ''[[aloalo]]'', tall wooden posts carved with geometric patterns and occasionally topped with carved zebu or other figures that hold significance for the deceased. These posts are meant to indicate that a person has died and attained the status of "ancestor" (''razana''), which serve as intermediaries between the living and God; the tomb is the ancestor's new home, as death is not seen as an ending but as a transformation into another phase of life.  Aloalo today are considered an iconic symbol of Madagascar, and the Mahafaly homeland encompassing its semi-arid ecosystem and wealth of tombs and funerary art has been added to the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Tomb sites may only be visited during funerals or to retrieve wandering cattle but are otherwise strictly off limits.&lt;ref name = Speech/&gt;

Households are not allowed to produce their own aloalo or coffins or make use of their own tomb construction materials or ''ombilahy'' zebu - all must be purchased or commissioned from a specialized clan that the household has historically relied on to produce these items, and the household must pay for them in zebu and food. Carrying out the various ceremonies and tomb construction can take a year or more, during which time the wife of the deceased must stay with the corpse in the deceased's home. His oldest son is responsible for procuring the ''vatolahy'' - upright stone markers up to two meters tall that form part of the tomb structure - while his daughters are responsible for procuring the aloalo and sacrificial zebus; the remaining family members and friends procure the stones required for the construction of the tomb. The tomb's size is consequently dependent on the size of the family and the deceased's social standing.&lt;ref name = Speech/&gt;
&lt;!--===Dance and music===--&gt;

==Language==
The Mahafaly speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] derived from the [[Barito languages]], spoken in southern [[Borneo]].{{sfn|Shoup|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Various|2003|p=205}}

In December 2016, Bhupathi was appointed as India's next non-playing Davis Cup captain and took over the reins from [[Anand Amritraj]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Indian Express|title=Mahesh Bhupathi named India’s non-playing Davis Cup captain|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/mahesh-bhupathi-india-davis-cup-captain-anand-amritraj-440013/|website=Indian Express|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a part of the Hon. Board of Advisors of [[IIMUN]].

==Career==

===1995–2006===
Mahesh Bhupathi is known as one of the top doubles players in the 1990s and 2000s. In 1999, Bhupathi won three doubles titles with [[Leander Paes]], including the [[French Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. He and Paes became the first doubles team to reach the finals of all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]]s, the first time such a feat has been achieved in the open era and the first time since 1952. On 26 April of that year, they became the world no. 1 doubles team. Bhupathi also won the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] [[Mixed doubles (tennis)|mixed doubles]] with [[Ai Sugiyama]] of Japan.

In 2006, Bhupathi teamed with [[Martina Hingis]] in the Australian Open mixed doubles competition. Entering the tournament unseeded and as wildcards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/includes/TrackIt.asp?file=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/Pdfs/events/2006/melbourne_draws.pdf Source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001073233/http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/includes/TrackIt.asp?file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonyericssonwtatour.com%2F3%2Fglobal%2FPdfs%2Fevents%2F2006%2Fmelbourne_draws.pdf |date=1 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first-time pair defeated four seeded opponents along the way, while only dropping a single set throughout. Bhupathi and Hingis defeated the sixth-seeded team of [[Daniel Nestor]] and [[Elena Likhovtseva]] in straight sets, 6–3, 6–3, to capture the championship. It was the sixth mixed doubles Grand Slam for Bhupathi, and a first for Hingis. By winning the Australian Open, Bhupathi completed a career Grand Slam in mixed doubles.

===2007–2008===
In 2007, Bhupathi and [[Radek Štěpánek]] reached the [[2007 Australian Open]] [[2007 Australian Open – Men's Doubles|men's doubles event]]'s quarterfinals. Bhupathi teamed with Štěpánek at the [[2007 French Open]] to make the [[2007 French Open – Men's Doubles|doubles]] semifinals, defeating two-year defending champions [[Jonas Björkman]] and [[Max Mirnyi]] in the quarterfinals. The team lost to the eventual champions [[Mark Knowles]] and [[Daniel Nestor]]. After [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Bhupathi teamed with [[Pavel Vízner]] to win the [[2007 Canada Masters]], defeating the top-ranked doubles team [[Bob Bryan|Bob]] and [[Mike Bryan]] en route. After this victory, he won a tournament in [[2007 Pilot Pen Tennis|New Haven]] with [[Nenad Zimonjić]]. At the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]], he and Zimonjić paired in [[2007 US Open – Men's Doubles|doubles]]. After the US Open, the team that beat Bhupathi and Štěpánek in the French Open semifinals, Knowles and Nestor, split up. Bhupathi became Knowles' partner,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/doubles/profiles/bhupathiknowles.asp Team profile]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Zimonjić became Nestor's, but back surgery meant he was out until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2007/oct/02bhup.htm|title=Bhupathi to undergo back surgery|website=www.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2012===
In 2009, Bhupathi and compatriot [[Sania Mirza]] won the mixed doubles title at the Australian Open, beating [[Nathalie Dechy]] and [[Andy Ram]], 6–3, 6–1, in the final. The Indian pair thus made up for the disappointment of the previous year's final when they were beaten by [[Sun Tiantian]] and [[Nenad Zimonjić]]. With this win, Bhupathi's count in mixed doubles Grand Slam titles increased to seven.

Bhupathi broke up his partnership with Knowles and began playing once again with [[Max Mirnyi]], with whom he played to win the [[2002 US Open (tennis)|2002 US Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2002/sep/07bhup.htm|title=Bhupathi-Mirnyi win US Open doubles
|accessdate=7 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Bhupathi reunited with former playing partner [[Leander Paes]] for the [[2011 Australian Open]]. The team reached the final, but lost 3–6, 4–6 to the Bryan brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2011/01/29/sports-leander-paes-bhupathi-lose-australian-open-aid0033.html|title= Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi lose Australian Open|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 7 June 2012, Bhupathi and [[Sania Mirza]] won the French Open mixed doubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open-2012/indian-challenge/Mahesh-Bhupathi-and-Sania-Mirza-win-French-Open-mixed-doubles-crown/articleshow/13909650.cms|title= Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza win French Open mixed doubles crown

===2013===
Bhupathi and Bopanna played with different partners for the first three months of 2013, Bhupathi winning the tournament in Dubai in March with [[Michaël Llodra]], but rejoined starting with the Monte-Carlo Masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/news/205686-mahesh-bhupathi-rohan-bopanna-back-together|title=Mahesh Bhupathi-Rohan Bopanna back together – NDTV Sports|first=|last=NDTVSports.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing Style==
Mahesh Bhupathi is known for his big serve. According to Nadal, his strong back hand makes him the best for an Ad Court player. Roger Federer acclaims him as one of the best players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imdi0_BLz40|title=TWTP - DOUBLES SPECIALIST (Roger Federer talks about Mahesh Bhupathi)|first=|last=twtpofficial|date=29 June 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often discusses strategies between the serves with his partner during the match and also communicates using finger-at-the-back signals.

==Year-end finals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Mahesh-Bhupathi.aspx|title=Mahesh Bhupathi - Overview - ATP World Tour - Tennis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Bhupathi appeared with Paes in six season finales. In 2011, they appeared, for the first time since 2002, after securing qualification in mid-October.

Bhupathi played at the year-end championships with Paes from 1997–2000 and in 2002, reaching three finals. In 1997, they lost the final to [[Rick Leach]] and [[Jonathan Stark (tennis)|Jonathan Stark]]. They lost the 1999 final to [[Sébastien Lareau]] and [[Alex O’Brien]]. In 2000, they lost the final to [[Donald Johnson]] and [[Pieter Norval]].

Bhupathi also qualified with [[Max Mirnyi]] in 2003, 2004, and 2010, when they finished runners-up to [[Daniel Nestor]] and [[Nenad Zimonjić]].

He appeared at the finals with [[Mark Knowles]] in 2008 and 2009. In 2012, he and [[Rohan Bopanna]] made it to the final, where they lost to [[Marcel Granollers]] and [[Marc López]].

==Partnership with Leander Paes==
[[File:LeeAndHesh1.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Bhupathi (right) and Leander Paes]]
Bhupathi and Leander Paes partnered in the men's doubles event at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, but lost the quarterfinals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atptennis.com/en/common/TrackIt.asp?file=http://www.atptennis.com/1/posting/2008/440/mdd.pdf 2008 Ordina Open Men's Doubles Draw]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Roger Federer]] and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] of Switzerland, who went on to win the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2008/aug/16swiss.htm|title = Federer leads Swiss to doubles gold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paes and Bhupathi decided to team up again at the Australian Open 2011, ending a nine-year separation on the ATP circuit. They reached the finals of the event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Doubles pair Paes, Bhupathi to reunite|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/21/3072309.htm|accessdate =29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhupathi-Paes To Reunite in 2011 in Bid To Complete Career Grand Slam|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/11/46/Finals-Paes-Bhupathi-To-Reunite-In–2011.aspx|date=20 November 2010|accessdate=9 December 2010|first=James|last=Buddell|publisher=ATPWorldTour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost to American twins [[Bob and Mike Bryan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/sports/tennis/30doubles.html|title= Bryans Win Doubles Again|accessdate=29 January 2011 | work=The New York Times|first=Christopher|last=Clarey|date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paes stated at the time that the best thing has been to have their friendship back.&lt;ref&gt;ATP World Tour Finals interview&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian duo has a 303–103 career record together. They have a Davis Cup record of longest winning streak in doubles, with 23 straight wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/history/records.aspx|title=Davis Cup - Page Not Found|website=www.daviscup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leander Paes wanted to play with Mahesh Bhupathi in the men's doubles event of the [[London Olympics]], to be held July–August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tournaments/london-olympics/Mahesh-Bhupathi-declines-to-play-with-Leander-Paes/articleshow/14235780.cms|title=Mahesh Bhupathi declines to play with Leander Paes
|date=18 June 2012 | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 19 June 2012, the All India Tennis association relented to the demands of Bhupathi and Bopanna of not playing along Paes. Two teams were sent for the London Olympics- 2012, with Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna as one team and the other team consisting of Leander Paes and Vishnu Vardhan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tournaments/london-olympics/AITA-may-send-two-teams-to-London-Olympics/articleshow/14265577.cms|title= AITA may send two teams to London Olympics
|date=19 June 2012 | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhupathi also accused AITA of using Sania Mirza as bait for Leander's participation in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/news/32440491_1_mahesh-bhupathi-doubles-sania-mirza | work=The Times Of India | title=Sania Mirza was used without even being consulted: Bhupathi – The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; When AITA relented to the wishes of Bhupathi and Bopanna and permitted them to play together, they lost in the second round to the unseeded French pairing of [[Richard Gasquet]] and [[Julien Benneteau]].

== Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) ==
{{main | Alliance for Affordable Internet }}

The Alliance for Affordable Internet is a coalition of private sector, public sector, and not-for-profit organisations who have come together to advance the shared aim of affordable access to both mobile and fixed-line Internet in developing countries. The World Wide Web Foundation serves as the secretariat for the Alliance. The primary goal is to see the UN Broadband Commission Broadband Target of entry-level broadband services priced at less than 5% of average monthly income realised. Malaysia tops the list of 46 countries, in particular emerging economies, on the Affordability Index followed by Mauritius and Brazil. The internet access price that reach majority of the people was the result of the success of National Broadband Initiative (NBI), application of technology advancement along with progressive policy and regulatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a4ai.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Affordability-Report-2013_Final-2.pdf|title=The Affordability Report|publisher=Alliance for Affordable Internet|year=2013|accessdate=30 September 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programmes and initiatives==
* '''Click Wisely (''Klik Dengan Bijak'')'''. The rapid development of communications and multimedia technology, as well as the positive growth of broadband penetration throughout the country may have an untoward affect on the Malaysian values and culture if immediate steps are not taken to nurture positive internet use based on the country's ''Rukun'' ''Negara'' (National Principles). The worrisome rise in cybercrime would be best mitigated and reduced through enforcement activities and educational-based approach for the masses. Among the proactive actions taken by MCMC is initiating a Public Awareness on Internet Safety Campaign called '''Klik dengan Bijak''' ("Click Wisely") which stresses on safety, security and responsibility of internet users.
* '''1Malaysia Netbooks'''. MCMC through the Universal Service Provision (USP) programme has allocated one million 1Malaysia netbooks to be distributed to eligible recipients such as secondary school and university students from lower-income groups to ensure that they have the opportunity to access the internet and also to increase broadband usage throughout the country. This will contribute to the nation's broadband penetration rate as well as extend the benefits of broadband to students and the nation.
* '''Wireless Village (''Kampung'' ''Tanpa'' ''Wayar'')'''. Wireless Village initiative was inspired by YB Minister of Information, Communications and Culture, as part of ongoing initiatives by MCMC towards realising the USP objectives as outlined under the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, USP Regulations 2002 (the Regulations) i.e. provisioning of collective and individual access to Internet access service in underserved areas.
* '''U-Library (''U-Pustaka'')''', an information delivery service.
* '''Youth Communication Package''' '''(''Pakej Komunikasi Belia'')'''. Youths aged 21 to 30 able to apply for the RM200 rebate off selected 3G smartphones from celco nominated registered dealers. The Youth Communication Package (YCP) (or Pakej Komunikasi Belia (PKB)) scheme is on a first-come-first served basis and will be for the first 1.5 million eligible youths who may claim their smartphones while stocks last.
* '''1Malaysia Internet Centre''' '''(''Pusat Internet 1Malaysia'')'''. 1Malaysia Internet Centre is an ongoing initiative to help increase the socio economic state of underprivilage groups within the community by providing network services and applications services in rural areas.
* '''Get Malaysian Business Online'''. Announced in Budget 2013, the Get Malaysian Business Online grant is offered on a first-come-first-served basis for up to 50,000 businesses, and ends when the limit is reached or on 31 December 2013.

The '''Max Delbrück Medal''' has been awarded annually since 1992 by the [[Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine]] (German: ''Max - Delbrück - Centrum für Molekulare Medizin'' or MDC). Named after the German biophysicist [[Max Delbrück]], it is presented in Berlin to an outstanding scientist on the occasion of the annual "Berlin Lecture on Molecular Medicine", which the MDC organizes together with other Berlin research institutions and Bayer HealthCare. The award recipient usually delivers a lecture after the award.

'''Moral exclusion''' is a psychological process where members of a dominant group view their own group and its norms as superior to others, belittling, marginalizing, excluding, even dehumanizing targeted groups.  A distinction should be drawn between active exclusion and omission. The former requires intent and is a form of injustice, known as moral exclusion; while the latter is thoughtlessness (Leets, 2001, Forsyth, 2010). The targeted group is viewed as undeserving of morally mandated rights and protections (Forsyth, 2010).  When conflict between groups escalates, the in-group/out-group bias between the groups heightens. Severe violence between groups can be either the antecedent or the outcome of moral exclusion. At its extreme it is a bidirectional phenomenon that defies  precise origin.

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
*[[Morton Deutsch]]
:Professor emeritus of psychology and education and founder of the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution (ICCCR) at the Teachers College at Columbia University, Deutsch conducted studies on cooperation and competition, intergroup relations, conflict resolution, social conformity, and the social psychology of justice during his career.
*Susan Opotow 
:Received her PhD in social psychology from Columbia University in 1987. Opotow focuses on research on examples of moral exclusion that occur in adolescents' interpersonal conflicts with peers. 
*[[Ervin Staub]]
:Emeritus professor of psychology at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Staub was born in Hungary, Staub fled from Nazism and communism to Vienna before making his way to the U.S. where he earned a PhD at Stanford.  He is the founding director of the PhD concentration in the psychology of peace and violence at the University of Massachusetts.
*[[Henri Tajfel]]
:Minimal group paradigm shows that "othering" is the basis for discrimination.  Tajfel's intention was to create groups with as little meaning as possible and then add meaning to discover at what point discrimination would occur.

==History==
Throughout the course of history there have been instances in which human beings treat others as less than human and undeserving of equal moral treatment. Occurrences such as the Nazi Genocide during World War II and the African slave trade have led researchers to question whether or not human beings have the tendency to deem others as "worthy" or "unworthy" of moral treatment. Furthermore, if it were the case that humans label one another as acceptable or unacceptable and treat each other accordingly, it is important to examine the rationalization that occurs during this process. This is the type of thinking that spurred [[Morton Deutsch]], Susan Opotow and [[Ervin Staub]] to investigate the processes of [[dehumanization]] and moral exclusion.

[[Susan Sutherland Isaacs]], and other members of the [[object relations theory|object-relations]] school of psychoanalysis, set the stage for moral exclusion research with the theory that perceiving certain people as "allies" and others as "enemies" is intrinsic to human nature (Deutsch, 1990; as cited in Isaacs, 1946). This categorization of persons creates a marked distinction between "good" and "bad", leading to the exclusion of those who are negatively perceived from the [[moral community]]. Deutsch, Opotow and Staub have defined the moral community, or scope of justice, to be a "...psychological boundary for fairness, within which concerns with justice and moral rules govern our conduct," (Deutsch, 1974, 1985; Opotow, 1990; Staub, 1987, 1990). Such exclusion has been thought to be evolutionary, as it is beneficial to individuals to avoid others who are harmful and seek out those that are helpful.

[[Henri Tajfel]] conducted multiple experiments that returned the conclusion that people's "...actions are unambiguously directed at favouring the members of their ingroup as against the members of the outgroup (Tajfel, 1971). Moreover, Tajfel reported that individuals can be placed in an outgroup for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to), "ideology, skin color, age, and cognitive capacity," (Tajfel, 1978; as cited in Opotow, 1995). Given these findings, the assumption can be made that human beings have an innate tendency to classify those around them into definite categories, thereby creating a foundation for exclusion. Once these individuals are outside the scope of justice, they are no longer considered to have the right to fair treatment and [[Social equality|equality]] (Opotow, 1995).

==Limitations to existing research==
Moral exclusion has few critiques, but research on this phenomenon has limitations. Allen-Collinson's (2009) study on research administrations was purely restricted to an academic setting and therefore was a small-scale project that had limitations regarding restricted population range, and diverse roles of the research administrators that were interviewed. These factors made it difficult to find conclusive results regarding research administrators as being negatively marked due to moral exclusion.

Leets' discussion regarding moral exclusion and social justice (2001) was limited by the restricted population that was being sampled and the possibility for biases occurring within the self-report measures. Specifically, only university students and focus groups were sampled, which could detract from the generalizability of the study. Furthermore, subjects may have responded in a ''"socially desirable"'' fashion when completing the self-report measures that were utilized to determine participants' assessments of a socially sensitive issue. (Leets, 2001).

Tileaga reported that there was not significant research pertaining to the process by which certain groups become discriminated against. He propounded, "The issue of precisely how some particulars groups of people become (or are made) the target of prejudice (extreme prejudice) has been under-explored," (Tileaga, 2007).&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Dangers==
Every culture has its own set of values for behavior and communication that exist somewhere along a moral continuum.  What constitutes the substance of the continuum may differ by culture, although each culture's continuum has two ends. One pole represents the aforementioned, "scope of justice" and the other pole represents what is considered ''un''just, cruel or dehumanizing ''within'' that culture (Deutsch, 1990).  The root of exclusion begins with basic categorization. The us/them dichotomy is an embedded psychological process, occurring without conscious thought. As humans we make these distinctions repeatedly. Initially, elevating ingroup and diminishing outgroup may occur in inconsequential ways, as demonstrated by Tajifel's [[minimal group paradigm]].  Ordinary behaviors function as dynamic processes that shift cultural norms all the time; for example, American men used to wear top hats as part of everyday dress, but John F. Kennedy changed that. Going hat-less is now a social norm.

However, seemingly benign changes in behavior can function as an entry point for shifting into a system of destruction (Staub, 1992).  People change through their own actions; practicing new habits, seemingly trivial acts, gradually alter both an individual and a collective [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]].  For example, at its inception using the salute, "Heil Hitler," was not explicitly harmful to anyone. Yet scholars now perceive adoption of this greeting as a seminal turning point in the most commonly known system of nefarious acts against a group of people (Staub, 1992). The innocuous becomes insidious. Because individuals hold positions at various levels of corporate and governmental structures, the  institutionalization of particular modes of thinking and behaving happens gradually. When individuals in positions of authority adopt customs they are legitimized. When cultural norms shift toward exclusion of certain groups they can be rationalized; thereby granting legitimization of behavior into the collective consciousness. Ofreneo and de Vela (2006) developed a model to depict systems of violence situated within a society which are co-created by the social psychological process of moral exclusion, cultural norms that justify violence, and the economic and political hierarchies of power that maintain it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isiswomen.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=438&amp;Itemid=207|title=Isis International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Individuals' psyches function in group norms in three levels of society where moral exclusion roots and recreates itself. At the bottom is the social psychological, within an individual psyche. In the middle of the model is the social cultural, informal group level interaction where behavior is either ignored or applauded which normalizes it or condemned and eradicates it. At the top is the social structure, governments, corporations, and institutions that solidify and reify cultural norms through legislation and policy decisions.

== Examples ==
Moral exclusion includes situations of distinct severity, such as war, genocide, and slavery. Some examples are controversial, like [[abortion]], [[immigration]], and the [[death penalty]]. The crux of the matter, invariably, is who has the ability to determine who is worthy of human dignities. In each example, the standard a group or society uses to exclude the other is culturally derived.  That is to say, within each culture the criteria for who is cast out is based on particular values. Intercultural differences in the standard exist, but are associated with power within that culture.

No setting is immune from marginalizing members. For instance, moral exclusion IS an area of academic study, yet within academia, instances of the phenomena exist. Allen-Collinson (2009) analyzes moral exclusion, in the article, Negative 'marking'" University research administrators and the contestation of moral exclusion. The degradation of research administrators among their academic colleagues is examined and findings indicate that research administrators were being subjected to a dimension of excluding practices; such as, negative labeling and marking. Academic staff had been labeled both informally, and through documentation by their colleagues and administration as "assistant" or "support staff", fundamentally downplaying their skills and expertise. Another dimension of moral exclusion that appeared was the rendering of research administrators as invisible by either excluding them from research related committees as actual academic staff or by not acknowledging their presence in regular staff meetings.

===Genocide and war===
[[Genocide]] is the act of purposefully exterminating a mass of people because of their identification with a particular group.  The most commonly known occurrence of genocide is that of the WWII treatment of Jewish people by the Nazis. Nazis took away fundamental rights of Jewish people by forcing them to relocate out of their homes into camps  where they were experimented on, tortured, and killed. Following the war in 1948, a  [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. Genocide is not an outdated relic of war, since 1951 there have been dozens of documented horrific [[Genocides in history]]; many continue.

The centuries-old conflict between the [[Palestinians]] and [[Israelis]] stems from   moral exclusion. Both are convicted in their own belief that they are the "chosen" people and the rightful inhabitant of the land. Each group is intolerant of the other's  beliefs, customs, and perceived rights to the land. Consequently, they are perennially  warring and killing one another because they believe the other has no right to exist.

In the central African states of Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo another territorial dispute over resources, land, and ethnic superiority is that of the [[Tutsi]] and [[Hutu]] peoples.  Although a National policy of reconciliation that prohibits discussion of the 1994 genocide and promotes using the national label of "Rwandan," rather than the ethnic categories of the past, civil unrest continues.

===Slavery===
Within American history, our forefathers believed that they were morally superior to Africans.  Contemporary scholars, such as [[Michel Focault]], describe this as [[cultural imperialism]]. Yet, at the time the forcible kidnapping of Africans from their homes was justified. It was culturally and institutionally sanctioned. Our legal system permitted this practiced. European-Americans who enslaved Africans in United States history took away the basic human rights of African slaves in order to have them subject to their orders. Slaves were brutally beaten and treated inhumanely. Even when slavery was abolished, enactments such as the [[Jim Crow laws]] kept African-Americans from certain basic rights and access to public space, because some European-Americans believed African-Americans were not worthy of equality to them.

===Immigrants===
Another example includes undocumented students, immigrants to the United States, and people who look like immigrants.  Regarding undocumented students, this refers to children born in the United States to parents who had illegally entered the U.S   These students are actual U.S. citizens, but have been in danger of exportation or being denied the opportunity to go to school in the United States because they lack appropriate documentation. This is an issue in many states.  Particular to Arizona, the state legislature passed a law, [[Arizona SB 1070]], granting police officers the capability to stop anyone they suspect may be illegally in the U.S. and ask them to present their birth certificate.   As explored by Mukherjee, Molina and Adams (2012), this legislation may be intended to contain illegal immigration, or it may be ethnic categorization as the basis for excluding rights to certain U.S. citizens who do not look like the dominant group.  A similar type of moral exclusion is seen in the treatment of people in the city of New York. Individuals can be stopped, questioned and frisked without cause, because they "look suspicious" to police officers in the area. The police officers believe they have the authority to violate these peoples' rights in order to meet certain standards in their respective divisions. See video link [1].

===Incarceration===
In the United States every citizen is held to be entitled to [[basic rights]] (the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness). Yet, the justice department has been granted the legitimate power to alter life quality of those in [[prison]]. A person in prison is stripped of their freedom, privacy, right to vote; even their [[right to life]] if placed under the death penalty. Society has deemed it justifiable to deny incarcerated persons many basic rights and privileges. Since the inmate uprising at [[Attica Prison riot|Attica]] in 1971, prison reform has improved conditions, making this 1971 quote from ''The Nation,'' seem implausible to have happened in America.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic fact that prisoners, too, are human is one that society has yet to accept. "WE are MEN!" the Attica inmates wrote in a manifesto addressed to "the people of America." "We are not beasts and do not intend to be beaten or driven as such." At the top of a list of "demands" was the basic request that officials "provide adequate food, water, and shelter for all inmates." Others included "adequate medical treatment," "realistic, effective rehabilitation programs," "true religious freedom," an end to "censorship of newspapers, magazines [and] letters" and, tellingly, "a program for the recruitment and employment of a significant number of black and Spanish-speaking officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/slaughter-attica|title=Slaughter at Attica|publisher=|via=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Capital punishment===
Capital punishment is a controversial issue.  Within the American justice system, the most heinous crimes such as treason, espionage, and murder can incur the death penalty. Those who commit perverse crimes are viewed as unworthy of owning a place within the bounds of  the moral community. In this view, egregious criminal activity is paid for by forfeiting the right to live. Making such a judgement precedes and justifies our decision to execute humans.  In America everybody believes that murder is wrong; humans should not kill each other, yet people are executed when they do things that place them in an extreme outgroup. Additionally, some believe that life imprisonment is inhumane.&lt;ref&gt;http://deathpenalty.procon.org/ pros and cons.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions and prevention==
Opotow, Gerson, and Woodside  (2005), explore moral exclusion theory in terms of teaching peace education and providing a structured and systematic approach to the complex issue of peace. Opotow et al. (2005) lists four key social dilemmas that moral exclusion systematically illustrates in the study of conflict, war, and peace: educating for coexistence, educating for human rights, educating for gender equality, and educating for environmentalism. According to Opotow et al. (2005), pairing moral exclusion with these key areas provides a larger scope for and situates peace education as a grave topic warranting study and understanding  by students of all ages. Furthermore, Opotow and coauthors assert that  moral exclusion should be seen as a human factor, a capacity of every person, rather than its limited scope as malicious actions of certain aberrant people.

When such conceptualized, the value of mindfully considering  habituated behaviors and adopting methods for change is illuminated.  Citizens in the scope of the moral community have a responsibility to extend the circle of humanity and effect change through deliberately  modifying norms. The aforementioned model of Ofrena and de Vela (2006)explains how justness can be cultivated at each of the three levels of society. At the bottom is the social psychological. Within an individual psyche, individuals can recognize and treat all others with basic human dignity. In the middle of the model is the social cultural. Informal group level interaction, including undesirable labeling, marginalizing, or dehumanizing behavior can be redirected.  At the top is the social scaffolding of governments, corporations, and institutions that have the power to redistribute more equitable ideas, thereby solidifying nonviolence as a cultural norm. Norms are social constructions of complex interaction and can be changed through social action, which must occur at each level described.

[[Dissent]] is a valuable tool for [[social change]]. Choosing not to speak against discriminatory, prejudicial, and marginalizing customs, normalizes and recreates them. Speaking out against inappropriate actions can change them; this can take many forms. For example, telling a friend when language or actions are objectionable because they contribute to the [[marginalization]] of others is a simple action with potential larger consequence, although difficult to enact. Participating in more structured forms of dissent may be easier to participate in. Thirteen types of [[activism]] described by [[Roland Watson]] in 2005 are detailed by @lissnup (Anita Hunt) on her blog, with links to Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lissnup.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/13-types-of-activism-r-watson/|title=13 Types of Activism|first=Adriana Goñi|last=Godoy|date=25 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional forms of activism include [[Demonstration (protest)|marches]], [[sit-in]]s, and [[Occupation (protest)|occupations]]; such as, the recent [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement. Less traditional forms of activism are becoming more popular. Social media is increasingly used as a tool to propel activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technorati.com/social-media/article/a-different-type-of-activism/|title=A Different Type of Activism|author=Jeffrey Strain |date= May 2, 2012|work=Technorati|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504203841/http://technorati.com/social-media/article/a-different-type-of-activism|archivedate=May 4, 2012|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music has always been a public forum with the ability to drastically alter culture and carry messages of dissent.

Consequently, when moral exclusion is seen as a human capacity it logically follows that all humans also have the capacity to limit its consequences. As Opotow et al. (2005) suggest, Moral Exclusion Theory can be coupled with peace education to better understand conflict between groups that lead to extreme situations such as genocide, and also shift to educating about the importance of an inclusionary focus for groups and individuals.

==Trial==
Baukus was charged with two counts of second-degree felony intoxication manslaughter and one count of third-degree felony intoxication assault.  After initially pleading not guilty to the charges against her, she pleaded guilty to two counts of vehicular manslaughter on August 1, 2013.&lt;ref name=myfox/&gt; Baukus was sentenced to a maximum of 15 years in prison on each count. She is currently eligible for parole in 2021.  The judge in her trial, [[Micheal_T._Seiler|Michael Seiler]], resigned from the bench to avoid prosecution from matters unrelated to this case.&lt;ref name= "Seiler Resigns"&gt;[http://www.chron.com/neighborhood/woodlands/news/article/Montgomery-County-judge-resigns-after-juror-flap-6834302.php Judge Micheale Seiler Resigns to Avoid Criminal Prosecution], February 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeal==
Baukus filed an appeal of her conviction which was denied with a dissenting opinion in the Texas 9th District Court of Appeals. She filed a Petition for Discretionary Review with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals which was refused.  On September 11, 2017, Ms. Baukus filed a writ of habeas corpus in the 435th District Court of Montgomery County, Texas with allegations of police misconduct, planting of evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of her trial lawyer.  The case is now pending before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.

{{Islamic culture}}
{{Fiqh |etiquette |width=22.0em}}

A '''niqab''' or '''niqāb''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|k|ɑː|b}}; {{lang-ar|[[Wikt:نقاب|نِقاب]]}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|niqāb}}'', "[face] veil"; also called a '''ruband''') is a garment of clothing that covers the face, worn by a small minority of [[Muslim women]] as a part of a particular interpretation of [[hijab]] ("modesty"). According to the majority of Muslim scholars and [[Islamic schools of thought]], the niqab is not a requirement of [[Islam]]; however a minority of Muslim scholars assert that the niqab is required, especially in the [[Hanbali]] Muslim faith tradition. Those Muslim women who observe the niqab, wear it in public areas and in front of non-[[mahram]] (non-related) men.

The face veil pre-dates Islam, and had been used by certain [[Arabian tribes|Arabian]] pre-Islamic [[Clothing#Ethnic and cultural heritage|cultures]]. Culturally, it is "a custom imported from [[Najd]], a region in [[Saudi Arabia]] and the power base of its [[Salafi]] [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist form of Islam]]. Within [[Muslim countries]] it is very contested and considered fringe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/looking-beyond-the-burqa-stunt-20170825-gy4jd6.html|title=Pauline Hanson's Senate stunt shows why we need to confront the ideology behind the burqa|first=Elham|last=Manea|date=27 August 2017|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324201741/https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/looking-beyond-the-burqa-stunt-20170825-gy4jd6.html|archivedate=24 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the niqab is most often worn in its region of origin: the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] — [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[Oman]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. However, even in these countries, the niqab is neither a universal cultural custom nor is it  culturally compulsory. In other parts of the [[Muslim world]] outside of the Arabian Peninsula, where the niqab has slowly spread to a much smaller extent, it is regarded warily by Sunni and non-Sunni Muslims alike "as a symbol of encroaching fundamentalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-australian-diversity-if-youre-not-a-stereotype-you-dont-count-20170420-gvok72.html|title=The uncomfortable truth about Australian 'diversity'|first=Ruby|last=Hamad|date=21 April 2017|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408161000/https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-australian-diversity-if-youre-not-a-stereotype-you-dont-count-20170420-gvok72.html|archivedate=8 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the niqab is worn by a small minority of Muslims in not only Muslim-majority regions such as [[Somalia]], [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], the [[Palestinian territories]], and [[Southern Iran]], but also among a minority of Muslims in regions where Muslims are themselves a minority, like [[India]] and [[Europe]].

The terms niqab and [[burqa]] are often conflated; a niqab covers the face while leaving the eyes uncovered, while a burqa covers the entire body from the top of the head to the ground, with only a mesh screen allowing the wearer to see in front of her.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muhammad and "shameless women" in Hell.jpg|thumb|left|A 15th-century Persian depiction of [[Muhammad]] visiting hell during [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]] and seeing "shameless women" being punished for exposing their hair to strangers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/islamic_mo_full/&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Women who wear the niqab are often called ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|niqābīah}}''; this word is used both as a noun and as an adjective. However, the correct form {{lang|ar|منتقبة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|muntaqabah / muntaqibah}}'' (plural ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|muntaqabāt / muntaqibāt}}'') as ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|niqābīah}}'' is used in a derogatory manner (much as with ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ḥijābīah}}'' versus {{lang|ar|محجبة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|muḥajjabah}}'').&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;[http://www.modernmuslima.com/niqabhow.htm How to Hijab: Face Veils] Modern Muslima and Saraji Umm Zaid Retrieved 16 April 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302122758/http://www.modernmuslima.com/niqabhow.htm |date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varieties of Arabic|Colloquially]], women in niqab are called {{lang|ar|منقبة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|munaqqabah}}'', with the plural {{lang|ar|منقبات}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|munaqqabāt}}''.

==Overview==
===Pre-Islamic use of the face veil===
The face-veil was originally part of women's dress among certain classes in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was adopted into Muslim culture during the Arab conquest of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance F. R. C. Bagley, "Introduction", in B. Spuler, ''A History of the Muslim World. The Age of the Caliphs'', 1995, X; for a different view T. Dawson, "Propriety, practicality and pleasure : the parameters of women's dress in Byzantium, A.D. 1000-1200", in L. Garland (ed.), ''Byzantine women: varieties of experience 800-1200'', 2006, 41-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although Byzantine art before Islam commonly depicts women with veiled heads or covered hair, it does not depict women with veiled faces. In addition, the Greek geographer [[Strabo]], writing in the first century AD, refers to some [[Medes|Median]] women veiling their faces;&lt;ref&gt;''Geography'' 11.13.9-10.:"[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D13%3Asection%3D10 Some say that Medeia introduced this kind of dress when she, along with Jason, held dominion in this region, even concealing her face whenever she went out in public in place of the king] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221063028/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D13%3Asection%3D10 |date=21 December 2016 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; and the early third-century Christian writer [[Tertullian]] clearly refers in his treatise ''The Veiling of Virgins'' to some "pagan" women of "Arabia" wearing a veil that covers not only their head but also the entire face.&lt;ref&gt;''The Veiling of Virgins'' Ch. 17. Tertullian writes, "The pagan women of Arabia, who not only cover their head but their whole face, so that they would rather enjoy half the light with one eye free than prostitute the face, will judge you. (''Judicabunt vos Arabiae feminae ethnicae quae non caput, sed faciem totam tegunt, ut uno oculo liberato contentae sint dimidiam frui lucem quam totam faciem prostituere'')."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement of Alexandria]] commends the contemporary use of face coverings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02093.htm |title=Clement of Alexandria, 'Going to Church' Chapter XI, Book 3, Paedagogus |quote=Woman and man are to go to church decently attired, with natural step, embracing silence, possessing unfeigned love, pure in body, pure in heart, fit to pray to God.

In the case of Tamar, the Biblical text, 'When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face' indicates customary, if not sacral, use of the face veil to accentuate rather than disguise sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lipinski |first= Edward |title= Cult Prostitution in Ancient Israel? |journal= Biblical Archaeology Review |volume= 40 |issue= 1 |date= January–February 2014 |publisher= Biblical Archaeology Society |url= http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=40&amp;Issue=1&amp;ArticleID=10 |accessdate= 6 April 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140705123647/http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=40&amp;Issue=1&amp;ArticleID=10 |archivedate= 5 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Niqab in Islam==

===Views among Muslim scholars===
There is a difference of opinion and interpretation amongst scholars in Islam as to the permissibility or prohibition of covering the face. These fall into three different general interpretations, one held by a majority and two held by a minority.

The first interpretation, the opinion of the overwhelming majority of Islamic scholars, states that the niqab is optional at most. Within this view, there is disagreement as to when the niqab becomes prohibited even for those who would choose to wear it at other times.

The second interpretation, the opinion of a small minority of Islamic scholars, states that the niqab is outright obligatory ([[fard]]) to wear at all times in the presence of non-[[mahram]] males.

The third interpretation, also a small minority opinion, states that the niqab is outright prohibited and against Islam to wear at any time, in any company.

The niqab has continued to arouse debate between Muslim scholars and jurists both past and present concerning whether it is prohibited, fard (obligatory), [[mustahabb]] (recommended/preferable), or 'urf (cultural).&lt;ref name=TantawiPurge&gt;{{Cite news|title=Egypt bans niqab from schools and colleges|first=Adrian|last=Blomfield|date=5 October 2009|accessdate=6 October 2009|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/6262819/Egypt-purges-niqab-from-schools-and-colleges.html|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008110547/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/6262819/Egypt-purges-niqab-from-schools-and-colleges.html|archivedate=8 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2015/10/10/islam-must-be-separated-from-the-niqab-issue |title=Islam must be separated from the niqab issue &amp;#124; Jebara &amp;#124; Columnists &amp;#124; Opinion &amp;#124; O |website=Ottawasun.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807020723/http://www.ottawasun.com/2015/10/10/islam-must-be-separated-from-the-niqab-issue |archivedate=7 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Not obligatory (not fard)====
According to the rulings of mainstream [[Sunni Islam]], nothing at all is mentioned of niqab in the [[Qur'an]]. Moreover, even in some Hadith, it is clearly stated that the Prophet [[Muhammad]] himself taught women, in the example of his companion [[Abu Bakr]]'s daughter [[Asma' bint Abu Bakr]], that they need not veil (niqab) either their face or their hands:

{{Quote|"O Asma', when a woman reaches the age of puberty, nothing should be seen of her except for this and this; the hands and the face." |||Prophet [[Muhammad]], (Narrated by [[Sunan Abu Dawood]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veil.unc.edu/religions/islam/hadith/ |title=The Hadith Tradition &amp;#124; ReOrienting the Veil |website=Veil.unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419152328/http://veil.unc.edu/religions/islam/hadith/ |archivedate=19 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although there is no Islamic scripture, neither Quaranic nor Hadith, where females are required to cover their face and hands, there is on the contrary a Hadith where it is narrated that the Prophet himself taught, in accordance to his Sunnah, that it is in fact forbidden (haraam), at least during Hajj and Umrah, for females to veil (niqab) their face, even if at other times the female insists on wearing niqab, against Islamic scripture: {{Quote|"It is forbidden for a woman who is in the state of Ihram to cover her face." |||Prophet [[Muhammad]], (Narrated by [[Sahih al-Bukhari]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamweb.net/en/article/147830/covering-the-face-during-hajj-or-umrah |title=Covering the face during Hajj or Umrah |website=Islamweb.net |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108014342/http://www.islamweb.net/en/article/147830/covering-the-face-during-hajj-or-umrah |archivedate=8 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Prohibited innovation/cultural practice debate====
Within the majority Islamic legal opinion that the niqab is never obligatory, different schools and scholars disagree as to whether wearing niqab at any time (not just during Hajj and Umrah) is 'urf (a cultural practice) which should merely be discouraged; or if it is [[bid'ah|bid'ah say'iah]], an innovation which opposes the Qur'an and Sunnah contrary to Islam, and is to be prohibited.
 
In deference to the minority legal opinion which rules niqab to be obligatory, most other Muslim scholars and Islamic schools of thought have ruled that the preference is not to prohibit niqab as bid'ah say'iah, but as 'urf to be discouraged.

There are, nevertheless, scholars who have issued [[fatwas]] decreeing niqab to be against Islam, including the [[Grand Mufti]] of Egypt. Notably, the niqab is condemned for the Sunni Islamic world by the [[Grand Imam of Al-Azhar]], Sheikh Haji [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]], in his 7000-page Exegesis (Tafsir) of Al-Qur'an, written over 10 years. A renowned scholar and head of the Islamic world's preeminent religious institute, Tantawy has stated that "the niqab is a cultural tradition and has nothing to do with Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008005732/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1254573360090&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout|title=Azhar Imam Orders Niqab off, Wants Ban |date=8 October 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comments followed an incident in which he forced a school girl to remove her niqab during a visit to an Al-Azhar school, when Tantawy reportedly said that he would call for an official ban for the face veil in Islamic schools.

Tantawy's decision stems from his views that younger Muslims have lost touch with traditional Islamic scholarship and have come under the influence of [[imam]]s from the [[Salafi]] ([[Wahhabi]]) branch in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8299830.stm |title= From our own correspondent, 'No covering up Egypt's niqab row'|date=10 October 2009 |author= Christian Fraser |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharia law]], according to certain public commentators (e.g., Mudar Zahran) and Islamic scholars, in fact bans women from wearing the niqab in [[Mecca]] during worship.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
 
In the majority opinion of Islamic scholars, a woman or girl may lawfully wear the niqab, but in return may not criticize other Muslim women who properly cover their bodies, but do not wear the niqab to cover their face (i.e. hijabis). The niqabi (niqab wearer) is also prohibited from pressing the practice on others. In this practice of mutual tolerance, the niqabi shall also not be criticized for her belief or tradition holding niqab to be obligatory, or for her good-faith error on the side of modesty.

====Sunni====
The opinions of the four traditional mainstream [[Sunni]] schools of [[jurisprudence]] are as follows:
* [[Maliki]]: In the Maliki [[madhhab]], the face and the hands of a woman are not [[awrah]]; therefore covering the face is not obligatory. However, Maliki scholars have stated that it is highly recommended (mustahabb) for women to cover their faces.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* [[Hanafi]]: The Hanafi school does not consider a woman's face to be awrah; however it is still obligatory ([[wajib]]) for a woman to cover her face. While the Hanafi school has not completely forbidden a male's gaze towards a female's face when there exists absolutely no fear of attraction, the woman has no way of knowing whether the gazes directed towards her are free of desire or not, especially when she is out in public. The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deoband.org/2009/04/fiqh/miscellaneous/the-niqab-and-its-obligation-in-the-hanafi-madhhab|title=The Niqab and its obligation in the Hanafi madhhab|date=7 March 2012|author=Ozdawah|publisher=Seeking Ilm|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511225748/http://deoband.org/2009/04/fiqh/miscellaneous/the-niqab-and-its-obligation-in-the-hanafi-madhhab/|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://selfscholar.wordpress.com/tag/niqab-madhab/|title=Niqab in Madhhab|date=7 March 2012|author=Oza|publisher=Silm|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112100117/http://selfscholar.wordpress.com/tag/niqab-madhab/|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2016}}
* [[Shafi'i]]: The Shafi'i school has had two well-known positions on this issue. The first view is that covering of the face is not obligatory (fard).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seekingilm.com/archives/167|title=Shafii stance on women covering their faces|date=7 March 2012|author=Seeking Ilm|publisher=Seeking Ilm|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607221300/http://seekingilm.com/archives/167|archivedate=7 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second view is that covering the face is obligatory only in times of fitnah (where men do not lower their gaze; or when a woman is very attractive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozdawah.com/2011/11/07/the-niqab-fard-or-sunnah-according-to-the-madhaahib/|title=The Niqab – Fard, Or Sunnah?

* [[Hanbali]]: According to the Hanbali school, there are two differing views on whether a woman's whole body is awrah or not. Mālik, Awzāʿī, and Shafiʿī suggest that the awrah of a woman is her entire body excluding her face and her hands. Hence, covering the face would not be obligatory (fard) in this madhhab.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], [http://www.suhaibwebb.com/ummah/women/hijab-niqab/is-wearing-the-niqab-obligatory-for-women-part-1-of-2-by-yusuf-al-qara%E1%B8%8Dawi-translated-by-u-%CA%BFabdullah "Is Wearing the Niqāb Obligatory for Women?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323104956/http://www.suhaibwebb.com/ummah/women/hijab-niqab/is-wearing-the-niqab-obligatory-for-women-part-1-of-2-by-yusuf-al-qara%E1%B8%8Dawi-translated-by-u-%CA%BFabdullah/ |date=23 March 2014 }}, SuhaibWebb.com; accessed 1 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholars like Tirmidhī and Ḥārith b. Hishām, however, all of a woman's body is awrah, including her face, hands, and even fingernails. There is a dispensation though that allows a woman to expose her face and hands, e.g. when asking for her hand in marriage, because it is the centre of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=al-Qaraḍāwī|first1=Yūsuf|title=Is Wearing the Niqāb Obligatory for Women?|url=http://suhaibwebb.com/ummah/women/hijab-niqab/is-wearing-the-niqab-obligatory-for-women-part-1-of-2-by-yusuf-al-qara%E1%B8%8Dawi-translated-by-u-%CA%BFabdullah|website=SuhaibWebb.com|accessdate=16 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709012848/http://www.suhaibwebb.com/ummah/women/hijab-niqab/is-wearing-the-niqab-obligatory-for-women-part-1-of-2-by-yusuf-al-qara%E1%B8%8Dawi-translated-by-u-%CA%BFabdullah|archivedate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Salafi views====
According to the Salafi point of view, it is obligatory (fard) for a woman to cover her entire body when in public or in presence of non-mahram men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/21536|title=Awrah|date=7 March 2008|author=IslamQA.info|publisher=IslamQ&amp;A|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617151221/http://islamqa.info/en/ref/21536|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.com/en/ref/11774|title=Ruling on covering the face, with detailed evidence|date=7 March 2008|author=IslamQA.info|publisher=IslamQ&amp;A|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929001126/http://islamqa.com/en/ref/11774|archivedate=29 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpretations say that a veil is not compulsory in front of blind, asexual or gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/92753/blind |title=Is it permissible to take off the khimar in front of a blind man? |website=Islamqa.info |date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamweb.net/womane/nindex.php?page=showfatwa&amp;FatwaId=113271 |title=Women revealing their adornment to men who lack physical desire - Islam web ladies' |website=Islamweb |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084325/http://www.islamweb.net/womane/nindex.php?page=showfatwa&amp;FatwaId=113271 |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Queer Spiritual Spaces: Sexuality and Sacred Places'', p. 89, Kath Browne, Sally Munt, Andrew K.

The Islamic scholar [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]], while a teacher at [[Islamic University of Madinah]], wrote a book supporting his view that the niqab is not a binding obligation upon Muslim women. His opponents within the Saudi establishment ensured that his contract with the university was allowed to lapse without renewal.&lt;ref name=glo66&gt;Meijer, ''Global Salafism'', pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shia====

In the [[Ja'fari|Shi'a Ja'fari school of fiqh]], covering the face is not obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Marja'|Shia religious leadership]] is divided on the issue of niqab. For example, Ayatollah [[Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei]] was among the learned who, based upon the Quran and the hadith, believed that women should wear the niqab as per "obligatory precaution (Ihtiyat wujubi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021152313/http://www.al-khoei.org/al-huda/download/alh_ja1423.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=21 October 2004|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Shia women living in countries such as Bahrain, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Iraq wear it on a daily basis.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Rationale===
The claimed rationale of the niqab comes from [[Hadith]]. It was known that the wives of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] covered themselves around [[non-mahram]] men. However the Quran explicitly states that the wives of the Prophet are held to a different standard.&lt;ref&gt;Quran, Surah Azhab verse 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that under Islam the niqab is a requirement for the wives of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/niqab_2.shtml |title=Religions - Islam: Niqab |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521233815/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/niqab_2.shtml |archivedate=21 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following verse from the Qur'an is cited as support for this:&lt;ref name="Why Women Should Wear the Veil"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990223202903/http://www.jamiat.org.za/w_veil.html|title=Why Women Should Wear the Veil|date=23 February 1999|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|"O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters, and the ''nisā’il-mu’minīn'' ({{lang-ar|نِـسَـاءِ الْـمُـؤْمِـنِـيْـن}}, "women of the believers"), to draw ''‘alayhinna'' ({{lang-ar|عَـلَـيْـهِـنَّ}}, "over them" (feminine tense)) of their ''jalābīb'' ({{lang-ar|جَـلَابِـيْـب}}, cloaks or veils). That will be better that ''yu‘rafna'' ({{lang-ar|يُـعْـرَفْـنَ}}, they should be known (as respectable woman)) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."{{Cite quran|33|59|t=Ahmed Ali}}}}

This verse was in response to harassment on the part of the "hypocrites",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050223030359/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Feb242y5.htm] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it does not clearly refer to covering the face itself. It is also argued by some Muslims that the reasons for the niqab are to keep Muslim women from worrying about their appearances and to conceal their looks.&lt;ref name="Why Women Should Wear the Veil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/11774|title=Ruling on covering the face, with detailed evidence|website=Islamqa.info|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019075346/http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/11774|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminalization and bans===
The niqab is controversial in [[Islam in Europe|Europe]]. In [[Islam in France|France]] specifically, although the niqab is not individually targeted, it falls within the scope of legislation which bans the wearing of any religious items (Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or other) in certain public areas.

In 2004, the French Parliament passed a law to regulate "the wearing of symbols indicating religious affiliation in public educational establishments".&lt;ref name="fraser"/&gt; This law forbids all emblems that outwardly express a specific religious belief to be worn in French public schools.&lt;ref name="fraser"/&gt; This law was proposed because the Stasi Commission, a committee that is supposed to enforce secularity in French society, was forced to deal with frequent disputes about headscarves in French public schools, as outsiders of the practice did not understand the scarves’ purpose and therefore felt uncomfortable.&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;[http://internationalhumanrightslaw.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Unveiling-the-Headscarf-Debate.pdf Unveiling the Headscarf Debate], Internationalhumanrightslaw.net; accessed 1 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the French law addresses other religious symbols – not just Islamic headscarves and face coverings – the international debate has been centered around the impact it has on Muslims because of the growing population in Europe, especially France, and the increase in Islamophobia.&lt;ref name="fraser"/&gt;

In July 2010, the National Assembly in France passed ''Loi Interdisant La Dissimulation Du Visage Dans L'espace Public'', (Act Prohibiting Concealment of the Face in Public Space). This act outlawed the wearing of clothing that covers one's face in any public space.&lt;ref name="meforum.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.meforum.org/2787/france-ban-the-burqa|title=Ban the Burqa?

The then president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy publicly stated "The burqa is not welcome in France because it is contrary to our values and the ideals we have of a woman's dignity". Sarkozy further explained that the French government sees these enactments as a way to successfully ease Muslims into French society and to promote gender equality.&lt;ref name="meforum.org"/&gt;

In October 2018, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] declared that France's ban disproportionately harmed the right of women to manifest their religious beliefs, and could have the effects of "confining them to their homes, impeding their access to public services and marginalizing them."&lt;ref name="OHCHR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23750&amp;LangID=E|title=France: Banning the niqab violated two Muslim women’s freedom of religion - UN experts|website=OHCHR.org|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
[[File:Woman wearing Niqab.JPG|thumb|A woman wearing a niqab in [[Monterey, California]]]]
[[File:Muslim woman in Yemen.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing a ''niqab'' in Yemen]]
There are many styles of ''niqab'' and other facial veils worn by Muslim women around the world. The two most common forms are the ''half niqab'' and the ''gulf-style'' or ''full niqab''.

The ''half niqab'' is a simple length of fabric with elastic or ties and is worn around the face. This garment typically leaves the eyes and part of the forehead visible.

The ''gulf-style'' or ''full niqab'' completely covers the face. It consists of an upper band that is tied around the forehead, together with a long wide piece of fabric which covers the face, leaving an opening for the eyes. Many full niqab have two or more sheer layers attached to the upper band, which can be worn flipped down to cover the eyes or left over the top of the head. While a person looking at a woman wearing a niqab with an eyeveil would not be able to see her eyes, the woman wearing the niqab would be able to see out through the thin fabric.

Other less common and more cultural or national forms of niqab include the Afghan style burqa, a long pleated gown that extends from the head to the feet with a small crocheted grille over the face. The ''Pak [[Chador]]'' is a relatively new style from Pakistan, which consists of a large triangular scarf with two additional pieces.&lt;ref name="mm"/&gt; A thin band on one edge is tied behind the head so as to keep the chador on, and then another larger rectangular piece is attached to one end of the triangle and is worn over the face, and the simple ''hijāb'' wrapped, pinned or tied in a certain way so as to cover the wearer's face.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Other common styles of clothing popularly worn with a ''niqab'' in Western countries include the [[khimar]], a semi-circular flare of fabric with an opening for the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the ''niqab''. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many ''munaqqabāt'' believe no part of the skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because they do not want to be put in a position where they would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most ''munaqqabāt'' also wear an overgarment ([[jilbab]], [[abaya]] etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Egypt===
The [[niqab in Egypt]] has a complex and long history. On 8 October 2009, Egypt's top Islamic school and the world's leading school of Sunni Islam, Al-Azhar, banned the wearing of the niqab in classrooms and dormitories of all its affiliate schools and educational institutes.&lt;ref name=Egypt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/10/08/87407.html|title=Al-Azhar bans "niqab" in classrooms, dormitories|author=Ahmed al-Sayyed|publisher=Al Arabiya|date=8 October 2009|accessdate=13 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004053418/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/10/08/87407.html|archivedate=4 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
The niqab was traditionally worn in Southern Iran from the arrival of [[Islam]] until the end of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era. There were many regional variations of niqab, which were also called [[ruband]] or [[pushiye]]. Traditionally, Iranian women wore chadors long before Islam arrived.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The 20th century ruler, [[Reza Shah]], banned all variations of face veil in 1936, as incompatible with his modernistic ambitions. Reza Shah ordered the police to arrest women who wore the niqab and to remove their face veils by force. This policy outraged the clerics who believed it was obligatory for women to cover their faces. Many women gathered at the [[Goharshad Mosque]] in [[Mashhad]] with their faces covered to show their objection to the niqab ban.&lt;ref&gt;Asnad e Kashf e Hijab 24:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1941 and 1979 wearing the niqab was no longer against the law, but it was considered by the government to be a "badge of backwardness." During these years, wearing the niqab and chador became much less common and instead most religious women wore headscarves only. Fashionable hotels and restaurants refused to admit women wearing niqabs. High schools and universities actively discouraged or even banned the niqab, though the headscarf was tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;El-Guindi, Fadwa, ''Veil: Modesty, Privacy, and Resistance'', Berg, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

After the new government of 'Islamic Republic' was established, the niqab ban was not enforced by officials.

In modern Iran, the wearing of niqab is not common and is only worn by certain ethnic minorities and a minority of Arab Muslims in the southern Iranian coastal cities, such as Bandar Abbas, Minab and Bushehr. Some women in the Arab-populated province of [[Khuzestan]] still wear niqab.

In 2015, the constitutional [[Council of Islamic Ideology]] issued the [[fatwa]] that women are not required to wear niqab or cover their hands or feet under [[Shariah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/976119/women-not-required-to-cover-faces-hands-and-feet-under-sharia-cii/|title=Women not required to cover faces, hands and feet under Sharia: CII|date=20 October 2015|publisher=[[The Express Tribune]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120212717/http://tribune.com.pk/story/976119/women-not-required-to-cover-faces-hands-and-feet-under-sharia-cii/|archivedate=20 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi women are not required by a secular law{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} to wear the niqab. However, the [[niqab]] is an important part of Saudi culture and in most Saudi cities (including [[Riyadh]], Mecca, [[Medina]], [[Abha]], etc.) the vast majority of women cover their faces.
The Saudi niqab usually leaves a long open slot for the eyes; the slot is held together by a string or narrow strip of cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Moqtasami (1979), pp. 41-44&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Mohammad Habadan, a religious authority in Mecca, reportedly called on women to wear veils that reveal only one eye, so that women would not be encouraged to use eye make-up.&lt;ref name="Saudi cleric favours one-eye veil"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7651231.stm|title=Saudi cleric favours one-eye veil|date=3 October 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004074859/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7651231.stm|archivedate=4 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
1,200 niqab-wearing teachers were transferred to administrative duties in the summer of 2010 in Syria because the face veil was undermining the secular policies followed by the state as far as education is concerned.&lt;ref name=Syria&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/06/29/112596.html|title=Syria suspends fully veiled school teachers|publisher=Al Arabiya|date=29 June 2010|accessdate=13 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702062356/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/06/29/112596.html|archivedate=2 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2010, students wearing the niqab were prohibited from registering for university classes. The ban was associated with a move by the Syrian government to re-affirm Syria's traditional secular atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/world/middleeast/04syria.html "Syria's Solidarity With Islamists Ends at Home"], Nytimes.com, 3 September 2010; retrieved 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2011 it was reported that teachers would be allowed to once again wear the niqab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/06/general-ml-syria_8393538.html|title=Syria reverses ban on Islamic face veil in schools|author= |date=6 April 2011|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=6 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409195853/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/06/general-ml-syria_8393538.html|archivedate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since antiquity, the Arab tradition of wearing the niqab has been practiced by women living in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1140&amp;p=report&amp;a=2|title=Saudi cleric favours one-eye veil|date=3 October 2008|author=Ridhwan Al-Saqqaf and Mariam Saleh Aden Bureau|newspaper=Yemeni Times|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070521/http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1140&amp;p=report&amp;a=2|archivedate=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, girls begin wearing veils in their teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1184&amp;p=report&amp;a=1|title=Girls' niqab|date=3 October 2008|author=Ridhwan Al-Saqqaf and Mariam Saleh Aden Bureau|newspaper=Yemeni Times|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005074959/http://yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1184&amp;p=report&amp;a=1|archivedate=5 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1126&amp;p=lastpage&amp;a=1|title=The niqab through a foreigner's eyes|date=3 October 2008|author=Ridhwan Al-Saqqaf and Mariam Saleh Aden Bureau|newspaper=Yemeni Times|accessdate=2 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617015116/http://yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1126&amp;p=lastpage&amp;a=1|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acceptance of the niqab is not universal in Yemen. Senior member of the [[Yemeni Congregation for Reform|Al-Islah]] political party, [[Tawakel Karman]], removed her niqab at a human rights conference in 2004 and since then has called for "other women and female activists to take theirs off".&lt;ref name="T_Karman_Jun2010_interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Al-Sakkaf|first=Nadia|authorlink=Nadia Al-Sakkaf|title=Renowned activist and press freedom advocate Tawakul Karman to the Yemen Times: "A day will come when all human rights violators pay for what they did to Yemen"|publisher=Women Journalists Without Chains|date=17 June 2010|url=http://womenpress.org/articles.php?id=309|accessdate=30 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w8NYbYFU?url=http://womenpress.org/articles.php?id=309|archivedate=30 January 2011|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===
Covering the face was enforced by the [[Taliban]] regime with the traditional Afghan face veil called the [[burqa|burka]].&lt;ref name="Gohari"&gt;M. J. Gohari (2000). ''The Taliban: Ascent to Power''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 108-10.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
The niqab is outlawed in Azerbaijan, where the overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. Niqabi women, just like women wearing hijab, cannot work as public servants, neither can they continue studies at schools, including the private schools. Although there is no single law banning niqab at private companies, it would be nearly impossible for a niqabi woman to find work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In February 2010, an Arab country's unnamed ambassador to [[Dubai]] had his marriage [[Annulment|annulled]] after discovering that his bride was [[cross-eyed]] and had [[Facial hair#On women|facial hair]]. The woman had worn a niqab on the occasions that the couple had met prior to the wedding. The ambassador informed the [[Islamic Courts Union|Sharia court]] that he had been deliberately deceived by the bride's mother, who had shown him photographs of the bride's sister. He only discovered this when he lifted the niqab to kiss his bride. The court annulled the marriage, but refused a claim for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8508077.stm | work=BBC News|title=Dubai 'bearded lady' marriage off|date=10 February 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1249922/Ambassador-calls-divorce-veil-wearing-bride-reveals-beard-crossed-eyes.html|location=London, UK|work=Daily Mail|title=Ambassador calls for divorce after veil-wearing Muslim bride reveals a beard and crossed eyes|first=Peter|last=Allen|date=11 February 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730210909/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1249922/Ambassador-calls-divorce-veil-wearing-bride-reveals-beard-crossed-eyes.html|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/man-claims-fiancee-hid-beard-under-niqab-1.580722|title=Man claims fiancee hid beard under niqab|publisher=gulfnews|date=10 February 2010|accessdate=15 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105121221/http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/man-claims-fiancee-hid-beard-under-niqab-1.580722|archivedate=5 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fine was issued in [[Hørsholm]] in August 2018 to a woman dressed in a niqab who was in a fistfight with another woman on an escalator in a shopping centre.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Jack Straw (politician)#2006 veil controversy|comments by Jack Straw, MP]] started a [[United Kingdom debate over veils|national debate]] over the wearing of the "veil" (niqab), in October 2006. Around that time there was media coverage of the case of [[Aishah Azmi]], a teaching assistant in [[Dewsbury]], West Yorkshire, who lost her appeal against suspension from her job for wearing the niqab while teaching English to young children. It was decided that being unable to see her face prevented the children from learning effectively. Azmi, who had been interviewed and hired for the position without the niqab, allegedly on her husband's advice, argued it was helping the children understand different people's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/6066726.stm 'No discrimination' in veil row] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029212651/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/6066726.stm |date=29 October 2006 }} [[BBC News]]. 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a man committed a bank robbery wearing a niqab as a disguise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/8665873.stm BBC: "Robber wearing niqab targets Birmingham Lloyds TSB bank - A man wearing a niqab face veil has robbed a security guard outside a bank in Birmingham"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117093919/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/8665873.stm |date=17 November 2015 }}, Bbc.co.uk, 6 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
On 13 July 2010 [[Religion in France|France]]'s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a ban on wearing burqa-style Islamic veils. The [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|legislation]] forbids face-covering Muslim veils in all public places in France and calls for fines or citizenship classes, or both. The bill also is aimed at husbands and fathers — anyone convicted of forcing someone else to wear the garb risks a year of prison and a fine, with both penalties doubled if the victim is a minor.

====Italy====
In Italy, a law issued in 1975 strictly forbids wearing of any attire that could hide the face of a person. Penalties (fines and imprisonment) are provided for such behaviour. The original purpose of the anti-mask law was to prevent crime or terrorism. The law allows for exemptions for a "justified cause", which has sometimes been interpreted by courts as including religious reasons for wearing a veil, but others –including local governments– disagree and claim religion is not a "justified cause" in this context.&lt;ref name="BBCItaly"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8658017.stm |title=Police stop Muslim woman wearing veil in Italy |work=BBC News |date=3 May 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 2017, Norway government adopted a law prohibiting people to wear "attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability" in schools and in universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4595456/Norway-proposes-ban-face-veils-schools.html|title=Norway proposes ban on full-face veils in schools|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222202009/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4595456/Norway-proposes-ban-face-veils-schools.html|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prime Minister of Norway]] [[Erna Solberg]] stated in an interview that in Norwegian work environments it is essential to see each other's faces and therefore anyone who insists on wearing a [[niqab]] is in practice [[unemployable]]. Solberg also views the wearing of the niqab as a challenge to social boundaries in the Norwegian society, a challenge that would be countered by Norway setting boundaries of its own. Solberg also stated that anyone may wear what they wish in their spare time and that her comments applied to professional life but that any immigrant has the obligation to adapt to Norwegian work life and culture.&lt;ref name="nrk_18102016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Erna Solberg: – Du får ikke jobb hos meg hvis du har nikab på|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/erna-solberg-ville-ikke-ha-ansatt-en-med-nikab-1.13184508|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[NRK]]|date=18 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023060427/https://www.nrk.no/norge/erna-solberg-ville-ikke-ha-ansatt-en-med-nikab-1.13184508|archivedate=23 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The niqab is banned in the Canadian province of Quebec in all publicly funded services. One cannot receive public service or provide public service with their faces covered. On October 18, 2017, [[Bill 62]] passed into law after a 66-51 vote in the Quebec National Assembly. The new law is entitled "An Act to foster adherence to State religious neutrality and, in particular, to provide a framework for requests for accommodation on religious grounds in certain bodies". However, regulations regarding the ban's implementation, and religious accommodations, are not expected until July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-62-quebec-vallee-niqab-burqa-ban-bus-public-services-montreal-1.4365153|title=Answers to some key questions on Quebec's face-covering law - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420150013/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-62-quebec-vallee-niqab-burqa-ban-bus-public-services-montreal-1.4365153|archivedate=20 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 2015 the first act of Canada's newly appointed [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] and [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] [[Jody Wilson-Raybould]] was to assure women who chose to wear the niqāb during the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]] of their right to do so.&lt;ref name="CBC_nov_2015" /&gt; In December 2011 then-Citizenship and Immigration Minister [[Jason Kenney]] announced a policy directive from the Federal Government under then-Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] that Muslim women must remove niqābs throughout the citizenship ceremony where they declare their [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/muslim-women-must-show-faces-when-taking-citizenship-oath/article2267972/ | title=Muslim women must show faces when taking citizenship oath | date=12 December 2011 | work=Globe &amp; Mail | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508174715/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/muslim-women-must-show-faces-when-taking-citizenship-oath/article2267972/ | archivedate=8 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zunera Ishaq]], a Sunni Muslim woman living in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], challenged and won the niqāb ban in the case of ''Canada v Ishaq'' on 5 October 2015.

[[Elections Canada]], the agency responsible for elections and referenda, stated that Muslim women can cover their faces while voting. The decision was criticized by the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], [[Bloc Québécois]], and [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. The [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democrats]] were not opposed to the decision.&lt;ref&gt;LeBlanc, Daniel.

The niqāb became an issue in the 2007 election in Quebec after it became public knowledge that women wearing the niqāb were allowed to vote under the same rules as electors who did not present photo identification (ID); namely, by sworn oath in the presence of a third party who could vouch for their identity. The chief electoral officer received complaints that this policy was too accommodating of cultural minorities (a major theme in the election) and thereafter required accompaniment by bodyguards due to threatening telephone calls. All three major Quebec political parties were against the policy, with the [[Parti Québécois]] and [[Action démocratique du Québec]] vying for position as most opposed. The policy was soon changed to require all voters to show their face, even if they did not carry photo ID. However, Quebec residents who wear the niqāb stated they were not opposed to showing their faces for official purposes, such as voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/quebecvotes2007/story/2007/03/23/qc-niqab20070323.html|title=Muslim women will have to lift veils to vote in Quebec election|date=23 March 2007|work=CBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825022554/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/quebecvotes2007/story/2007/03/23/qc-niqab20070323.html|archivedate=25 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam Elmenyawi of the [[Muslim Council of Montreal]] estimated that only 10 to 15 Muslim voters in the province wear the niqāb and, since their veils have become controversial, most would probably not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070511041935/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=006205d2-dc3b-491a-8839-b59562ba52d1&amp;k=58807|title=Veiled threats|date=11 May 2007|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the [[Muslim Canadian Congress]] called for a ban on burqa and niqāb, saying that they have "no basis in Islam".&lt;ref name=Ban&gt;{{Cite news |title=Muslim group calls for burka ban |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/10/08/canada-muslim-burka-niqb-ban-government.html |date=8 October 2009 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=8 October 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011064821/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/10/08/canada-muslim-burka-niqb-ban-government.html |archivedate=11 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spokesperson [[Farzana Hassan]] cited public safety issues, such as identity concealment, as well as [[gender equality]], stating that wearing the burqa and niqāb is "a practice that marginalizes women."&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt;

The {{lang|nl|'''Onafhankelijke Post en Telecommunicatie Autoriteit'''}} ('''OPTA''', {{lang-en|Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority}}) was an independent [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government agency charged with enforcing Dutch law on telecommunication, post and cable TV services that operated between 1997 and 2013.  It was set up in 1997 as part of major government changes in the Dutch telecommunication sector and was absorbed by the [[Consumer and Markets Authority (Netherland)|Consumer and Markets Authority]] in April 2013.

Headquartered in [[The Hague]] it was created to ensure competitiveness in the newly opened Dutch market for telephony and other telecom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opta.nl/en/contact/address-and-contact-details/ |title=Address and contact details - Zurichtoren Muzenstraat 41 2511 WB The Hague |publisher=OPTA |accessdate=18 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opta.nl/en/contact/route-description/ |title=Route Description |publisher=OPTA.  |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 1997, [[KPN]] had a monopoly on the Dutch market, but after [[deregulation]], other companies could also enter the market. It was OPTAs responsibility to make sure that KPN would not push the new players out of the market through its sheer size.

The Dutch cable TV network is one of the densest in the world, with over 95 percent of Dutch households having access to cable TV. OPTA also used to regulate this market, and was a mediator in disputes between providers, although OPTA decisions could be appealed in court.

OPTA's function and legal position were similar to the American [[Federal Communications Commission]].

'''Parallel construction''' is a [[law enforcement]] process of building a parallel—or separate—evidentiary basis for a criminal [[Detective|investigation]] in order to conceal how an investigation actually began.&lt;ref name="Reuters__Shiffman_2013"&gt;{{ cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805 | title = Exclusive: U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans | first = J. | last = Shiffman | author2 = Cooke, K. | date = 2013-08-05 | publisher = Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, a particular form is '''evidence laundering''', where one police officer obtains evidence via means that are in contrast to the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]'s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and then passes it on to another officer, who builds on it and gets it accepted by the court under the [[good-faith exception]] as applied to the second officer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levine |first1=Kay L. |last2=Iontcheva Turner |first2=Jenia|last3=Wright|first3=Ronald F. |date=17 May 2017 |title=Evidence Laundering: How Herring Made Ignorance the Best Detergent |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |language=en|volume=106|issue=4|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2558737|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice gained support after the Supreme Court's 2009 ''[[Herring v. United States]]'' decision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==By the United States Drug Enforcement Administration==
{{expand section|commentary by legal analysts on the legal status of this practice|date=October 2014}}
In August 2013, a report by Reuters revealed that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|Special Operations Division]] (SOD) of the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] advises DEA agents to practice parallel construction when creating [[criminal case]]s against [[Americans]] that are based on [[NSA warrantless surveillance]].&lt;ref name="Reuters__Shiffman_2013" /&gt;   The use of illegally obtained evidence is generally inadmissible under the [[fruit of the poisonous tree]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Gaines | first = L. | author2 = Miller, L. | title = Criminal Justice In Action: The Core | year = 2006 | publisher = Thomson / Wadsworth | location = Belmont, CA | isbn = 0-495-00305-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two senior DEA officials explained that the reason parallel construction is used is to protect sources (such as undercover agents or informants) or methods in an investigation. One DEA official had told Reuters: "Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day. It's decades old, a bedrock concept."

An example from one official about how parallel construction tips work is being told by Special Operations Division that: "Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle." DEA would alert state troopers and they may wait for that certain vehicle and decide to use drug searching dogs to see if there is any illegal drug-related activity. Parallel construction allows the prosecution building the drug case to hide the source of where the information came from to protect confidential informants or undercover agents who may be involved with the illegal drug operation from endangering their lives.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

A number of former federal agents had used parallel construction during their careers, according to Reuters interviews. Most of the former agents had defended the practice of parallel construction because no falsified evidence or illegally obtained material were presented in courts.{{cn|date=October 2017}} A judge can rule evidentiary material inadmissible if it is suspected that the evidence was obtained illegally.

Parallel construction in this case in the US usually is the result of tips from the DEA's Special Operations Division that are derived from sources within foreign governments, intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. According to a senior law enforcement official and a former US military intelligence official tips are not given to the DEA until citizenship is verified to avoid any illegal wiretapping of US citizens who are abroad. US authorities require a warrant to wiretap domestic US-persons (citizens and non-citizens alike) and to wiretap US citizens who are abroad.&lt;ref name = "Reuters__Shiffman_2013"/&gt;

The Reuters piece occurred amid reporting of the 2013 [[NSA leaks]], although it made no "explicit connection" to the Snowden leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/05/the-nsa-is-giving-your-phone-records-to-the-dea-and-the-dea-is-covering-it-up/ | author = Fung, B. | date = 2013-08-05 | title = The NSA is giving your phone records to the DEA.

==In the United Kingdom==
''[[The Register]]'' argues the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]] introduces parallel construction for evidence obtained through surveillance under the act, and prevents it being revealed or questioned in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/06/parallel_construction_lies_in_english_courts/|title=The UK's Investigatory Powers Act allows the State to tell lies in court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polish plait''' (''Plica polonica'' in [[Latin]]), plica, or trichoma is a formation of [[hair]]. This term can refer to a hairstyle or supposes a medical condition. It also relates to the system of beliefs in [[Europe]]an [[folklore]], and [[healing]] practices in [[traditional medicine]] in [[Poland]] that supported neglected, matted hair as an amulet, or as a catchment for illness leaving the body.

==As a medical condition==
Plica Polonica (synonym, ''plica neuropathica''; common name, "Polish plait") is an uncommon condition in which the hair shaft becomes entangled irreversibly, forming a mass which is matted and sometimes can be sticky and moist.

In this condition, the protective layer of the hair (cuticle) is damaged, and the cortex of the hair is exposed. The cortex is a more moist and sticky part of the hair than the outer layer, and the affected hairs adhere to each other and other unaffected hairs. Several factors may contribute to this condition: chemical exposure, hair with natural kinks, hair extensions, quality of water and shampoo, or absence of hair grooming and poor hair care techniques. It may also be caused by or accompanied with [[head lice|lice]] infestation ([[pediculosis]]) leading to [[inflammation]] of the [[scalp]], or the mass can become malodorous.

==As a hairstyle==
Larry Wolff in his book ''Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of Enlightenment'' mentions that in Poland, for about a thousand years, some people wore the hair style of the [[Scythians]].  [[Zygmunt Gloger]] in his ''Encyklopedia staropolska'' mentions that Polish plait was worn as a hair style by some people, regardless of gender, in the [[Pinsk]] region and the [[Masovia]] region at the beginning of the 19th century. He used the term "kołtun zapuszczony" which denotes artificial formation of Polish plait. According to folklore studies today, the style was formed using liquids or [[wax]]. Among liquids, a mixture of wine and sugar was used or washing hair daily with water in which herbs were boiled. The most commonly used herb was [[Vinca]] (''Vinca major''), followed by [[Lycopodium clavatum]] and [[moss]], which caused hair to mat. A similar effect can be had by rubbing hair with [[wax]], or inserting a piece of a candle at the hair ends. Newer Polish dictionaries mention ''plica'' as a disease, but the old ones also mention artificially created plica.

==History==

[[File:Sartori Plica polonica.jpg|thumb|Sartori Plica polonica]]
The Polish plait was quite common in Europe during past centuries when hair grooming was largely neglected. It affected mostly the [[peasantry]], but was not unusual among higher social classes.

Due to [[superstition|superstitious]] beliefs, the Polish plait used to be particularly common in [[Poland]], hence its English and Latin name. Similarly, in German it is called ''Weichselzopf'', or [[Vistula]] plait, after a river in Poland. Initially, the plait was considered an [[amulet]] to keep illness away from the body, as it was believed that when disease resolved it left the body to live in the hair, resulting in lessened suffering. For this reason, people not only allowed it to develop, but even encouraged it. According to M. Marczewska, who researched the subject from the perspective of folklore studies, animistic beliefs and long-held pagan beliefs relating to illness viewed illness as caused by an invading evil spirit, which by convalescence left the body and was less problematic when living in the hair formation, which was then shed naturally or cut and ritualistically disposed of by persons specializing in [[folk medicine]] or practitioners of [[folk magic]]. As people believed that the formation of plica was a sign of resolving of disease, plica, as a hairstyle, was also formed artificially by washing with mixtures of herbs, sweetened wine, waxing, etc.

In the early 17th century, people began to believe plaits were an external symptom of an internal illness. A growing plait was supposed to take the illness "out" of the body, and therefore it was rarely cut off; in addition, the belief that a cut-off plait could avenge itself and bring an even greater illness discouraged some from attacking it. It was also believed that casting a [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] spell on someone could cause that person to develop a Polish plait, hence also the name [[wiktionary:elflock|"elflock"]] was used in [[English language|English]], also ''Hexenzopf'' (witches' plait) in German.

These convictions were so widespread and strong that some people lived their whole lives with a Polish plait. A plait could sometimes grow very long &amp;ndash; even up to 80&amp;nbsp;cm (31.5"). Polish plaits could take various forms, from a ball of hair to a long tail. Plaits were even categorized; plaits were "male" and "female", "inner" and "outer", "noble" and "fake", "proper" and "parasitical".

British diarist and [[Samuel Johnson]]'s friend, [[Hester Thrale]], in her book ''Observations and Reflections Made in the Course of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany'', described a Polish plait she saw in 1786 in the collection of the [[Elector of Saxony]] in [[Dresden]]: "the size and weight of it was enormous, its length four yards and a half [about 4.1 m]; the person who was killed by its growth was a Polish lady of quality well known in King [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus]]'s court."

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when ideas of the racial and ethnic superiority of Western civilization began to circulate, it became common to use the terms ''Plica Polonica'' (Polish plait) and ''Plica Judiaica'' (Jewish plait), as well as the term "Polish ringworm" in English. In addition to [[antisemitism]], there was also prejudice against Eastern Europeans. According to Larry Wolff's book ''The Invention of Eastern Europe'', Poles were considered "semi-Asians", the descendants of [[Tatars]] and barbarians. Maurice Fishberg in his book ''The Jews: A Study of Race and Environment'' mentions both terms. It was a common belief that plica was a contagious disease which originated in Poland after the [[Mongol]] invasion and later spread to other countries. [[Diderot]] wrote in his [[encyclopedia]] entry, due to his misunderstanding of the text in Polish chronicler [[Martin Cromer]], that the Tatar invasion of Poland was the source of plica. An example of the belief in the spread of plica as a contagious disease by foreign hosts was the [[Victorian-era]] British belief that the plica was spread like a disease by Polish traders in artificial hair, not from neglect by the affected British. George Lefevre, in his book ''An Apology for the Nerves'' mentions the terms ''plica Polonica'' and ''plica Judiaca'' and also gives information about the belief that wearing the Polish national costume can cause plica in the wearer. He describes the case of a woman in Berlin who did not wear the Polish national costume, yet was affected with plica. He concluded, "Neither, therefore, are strangers free from it, nor is produced by dress alone."

Zygmunt Gloger in the ''Encyklopedia Staropolska'' argued that according to research done by the [[Grimm Brothers]] and Rosenbaum, ''plica polonica'' and the idea that it spread from Poland was an error, as it was also found among the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] population of [[Bavaria]] and Rhine River area. He said that the word ''weichselzopf'' (Vistula plait) was a later alteration of the name ''wichtelzopf'' (plait of a [[wight]]); ''wichtel'' means [[wight]] in German, a being or sentient thing.

In the second half of the 19th century, some medical professionals waged a war against superstition and lack of hygiene among the peasantry, and traditional folk medicine. Many plaits, often to the horror of their owners, were cut off. In Western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], Professor [[Józef Dietl]] made a particular effort to examine and treat Polish plaits. He was also a politician, and his methods of dealing with persons with plicas are controversial today: he organized an official census of people suffering from the disease, they were not allowed to receive help by charitable organizations, were forbidden entrance to some buildings such as schools and offices, and he also proposed fines, which spawned rumors that plaits would be taxed. Those practices were said to have helped eradicate the Polish plait in the region. A huge, 1.5-meter long, preserved plica can be seen in the Museum of the Faculty of Medicine (Medical College, [[Jagiellonian University]]) in [[Kraków]]. In the areas of Poland which were occupied by the [[Russian Empire]], young men with plica were exempt from service in the tsarist army. It is unknown how many plicas were natural or how many were man-made dreadlocks. The [[Polish language|Polish]] word for the Polish plait, ''kołtun'', is now used figuratively in Poland to denote an uneducated person with an old-fashioned mindset.

==In folklore==
Plica was believed to be caused by supernatural entities. The names often describe the believed cause of tangled hair. In Britain this condition was believed to be caused by [[elves]], hence the name "[[elflock]]" (mentioned in [[Shakespeare]]an poetry and folk tales), although this term could refer to tangles much milder than a Polish plait. Folk belief in Germany associated it with witches or wights (Hexen or  Wichtel) giving plica the names Hexenzopf or Wichtelzopf; in Poland, the cause was an unclean spirit. One of the names of plica in Polish was  wieszczyca, "wieszcz" means [[bard]], specifically, a folk poet with the gift of prophesy or a vampire-like living person. In German folklore, plica appears in one of the Brothers Grimm's [[fairy tales]] - a girl didn't comb her hair for one year and found golden coins in her plica.

Many illnesses were associated with plica and were synonymous with the folk name for this condition. According to Marczewska, about thirty diseases were associated with plica in Polish folklore. In German and [[Bohemian]] spells, there are as many as seventy diseases. Poles were afraid to upset the unclean spirit, and, to pacify it, inserted offerings such as coins into the plica. Kołtun (or ''gościec'', its Polish folk name) did not necessarily describe only the hair formation, it also described the bodily illness without the presence of tangled hair. Pain (especially in joints), rheumatism, etc. were synonymous with it. If plica was present, it was blamed for whims and cravings, which needed to be satisfied promptly; people around a person with plica needed to assist the sufferer to comply with the cravings. Marczewska points out that one old Polish dictionary stated that kołtun created strong cravings, especially for wine (which was imported and expensive).

'''Prostitution in ancient Rome''' was legal and licensed. In [[ancient Rome]], even [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman men of the highest social status]] were free to engage [[prostitute]]s of either sex without incurring moral disapproval,{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} as long as they demonstrated self-control and moderation in the frequency and enjoyment of sex. At the same time, the prostitutes themselves were considered shameful: most were either [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] or former slaves, or if free by birth relegated to the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'', people utterly lacking in social standing and deprived of most protections accorded to [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] under [[Roman law]], a status they shared with [[Theatre of ancient Rome|actors]] and [[gladiator]]s, all of whom, however, exerted sexual allure.{{sfn|Edwards|1997|pp=66-}} Some large [[brothel]]s in the 4th century, when [[Christianization of ancient Rome|Rome was becoming officially Christianized]], seem to have been counted as tourist attractions and were possibly state-owned.{{sfn|McGinn|2004|pp=167–168}}

[[Latin literature]] makes frequent reference to prostitutes. [[Roman historiography|Historians]] such as [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]] mention prostitutes who had acquired some degree of respectability through patriotic, law-biding, or [[Euergetism|euergetic]] behavior. The high-class "[[call girl]]" ''('''meretrix''')'' is a [[stock character]] in [[Plautus]]'s [[Roman comedy|comedies]], which were influenced by [[Ancient Greek comedy|Greek models]]. The poems of [[Catullus]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Martial]], and [[Juvenal]], as well the ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Petronius]], offer fictional or satiric glimpses of prostitutes. Real-world practices are documented by provisions of [[Roman law]] that regulate prostitution, and by [[epigraphy|inscriptions]], especially graffiti from [[Pompeii]]. [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum]] from sites presumed to be [[Lupanar (Pompeii)|brothels]] has also contributed to scholarly views on prostitution.

==The prostitutes==

A ''meretrix'' (plural: ''meretrices'') was a higher class, registered female [[prostitute]]; the more pejorative ''scortum'' could be used for prostitutes of either gender. Unregistered, lower class or casual prostitutes fell under the broad category ''prostibulae''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, J. N., ''Words for "prostitute" in Latin'', University of Koeln, 1983, pp. 325 - 358 [http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/126/Adams.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Although both women and men might engage male or female prostitutes, evidence for female prostitution is the more ample.{{sfn|McGinn|2004|p=2}} A prostitute could be [[self-employed]] and rent a room for work. A girl (''puella'', a term used in poetry as a synonym for "girlfriend" or ''meretrix'' and not necessarily an age designation) might live with a procuress or madame ''(lena)'' or even go into business under the management of her mother,{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} though ''mater'' might sometimes be a mere [[euphemism]] for ''lena''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} These arrangements suggest the recourse to prostitution by free-born women in dire financial need, and such prostitutes may have been regarded as of relatively higher repute or social degree.{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} Prostitutes could also work out of a brothel or tavern for a procurer or [[pimp]] ''(leno)''. Most prostitutes seem to have been [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] or former slaves.{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}}

In Roman law, the status of meretrices was specifically and closely regulated.{{sfn|Sokala|1998|pp=5-35 }} They were obliged to register with the [[aedile]]s,{{sfn|Balsdon|1963|p=227}} and (from Caligula's day onwards) to pay imperial tax.&lt;ref name="Classical Antiquities 1894 p. 293"&gt;H. Nettleship/J. E. Sandys eds., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (1894) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; They were regarded as "[[Infamia|infamous persons]]" and were denied many of the civic rights due to citizens. They could not give evidence in court,&lt;ref name="Classical Antiquities 1894 p. 293"/&gt; and Roman freeborn men were forbidden to marry them.{{sfn|Balsdon|1963|p=192}} There were, however, degrees of ''infamia'' and the consequent loss of privilege attendant on sexual misbehaviour. A convicted adulteress of citizen status who registered herself as a ''meretrix'' could thus as least partly mitigate her loss of rights and status.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, J. N., ''Words for "prostitute" in Latin'', University of Koeln, 1983, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professional prostitutes, perhaps to be compared to [[courtesan]]s, cultivated elite patrons and could become wealthy. The ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' [[Sulla]] is supposed to have built his fortune on the wealth left to him by a prostitute in her will.{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} Romans also assumed that actors and dancers were available to provide paid sexual services, and courtesans whose names survive in the historical record are sometimes indistinguishable from actresses and other performers.{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} In the time of [[Cicero]], the courtesan Cytheris was a welcome guest for dinner parties at the highest level of Roman society. Charming, artistic, and educated, such women contributed to a new romantic standard for male-female relationships that [[Ovid]] and other [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poets]] articulated in their erotic elegies.&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Frank, "Augustan Elegy and [[Catonism]]," ''[[Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt]]''  II.30.1 (1982), p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clothing and appearance ===
From the late Republican or early Imperial era onwards, ''meretices'' may have worn the [[toga]] when in public, through compulsion or choice. The possible reasons for this remain a subject of modern scholarly speculation.  Togas were otherwise the formal attire of citizen men, while respectable adult freeborn women and matrons wore the [[Clothing in ancient Rome|stola]]. This crossing of gender boundaries has been interpreted variously. At the very least, the wearing of a toga would have served to set the ''meretrix'' apart from respectable women, and suggest her sexual availability;{{sfn|Edwards|1997|pp=81-82}} Bright colors{{snd}} "Colores meretricii"{{snd}} and jewelled anklets also marked them out from respectable women.{{sfn|Balsdon|1963|pp=224, 252-4 and p. 327n}}

Expensive courtesans wore gaudy garments of see-through silk.{{sfn|Edwards|1997|p=81}}

Some passages in Roman authors seem to indicate that prostitutes displayed themselves in the nude. Nudity was associated with slavery, as an indication that the person was literally stripped of privacy and the ownership of one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair J. L. Blanshard, ''Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A passage from [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]] describes the condition of the prostitute as a slave for sale:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Naked she stood on the shore, at the pleasure of the purchaser; every part of her body was examined and felt. Would you hear the result of the sale? The pirate sold; the pimp bought, that he might employ her as a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Controv.'' lib. i, 2. [[Horace]] dwells at length on the inspection of female flesh: "The matron has no softer thigh nor has she a more beautiful leg, though the setting be one of pearls and emeralds (with all due respect to thy opinion, Cerinthus), the togaed plebeian's is often the finer, and, in addition, the beauties of figure are not camouflaged; that which is for sale, if honest, is shown openly, whereas deformity seeks concealment. It is the custom among kings that, when buying horses, they inspect them in the open, lest, as is often the case, a beautiful head is sustained by a tender hoof and the eager purchaser may be seduced by shapely hocks, a short head, or an arching neck. Are these experts right in this? Thou canst appraise a figure with the eyes of Lynceus and discover its beauties; though blinder than Hypoesea herself thou canst see what deformities there are. Ah, what a leg! What arms! But how thin her buttocks are, in very truth what a huge nose she has, she's short-waisted, too, and her feet are out of proportion! Of the matron, except for the face, nothing is open to your scrutiny unless she is a Catia who has dispensed with her clothing so that she may be felt all over thoroughly, the rest will be hidden. But as for the other, no difficulty there! Through the Coan silk it is as easy for you to see as if she were naked, whether she has an unshapely leg, whether her foot is ugly; her waist you can examine with your eyes" (''Satire'' I, ii).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Satyricon]]'', [[Petronius]]'s narrator relates how he "saw some men prowling stealthily between the rows of name-boards and naked prostitutes".{{sfn|Petronius|2009|loc=chap. 7}} The satirist [[Juvenal]] describes a prostitute as standing naked "with gilded nipples" at the entrance to her cell.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' vi, 121 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective ''nudus'', however, can also mean "exposed" or stripped of one's outer clothing, and the [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|erotic wall paintings of Pompeii and Herculaneum]] show women presumed to be prostitutes wearing the Roman equivalent of a bra even while actively engaged in sex acts.

==Forced prostitution==
[[File:Pompeii - Casa degli Epigrammi - MAN.jpg|thumb|[[Satyr]] and [[Maenad]]; Roman fresco from the [[Casa degli Epigrammi]] in [[Pompeii]]]]
Most prostitutes were slaves or freedwomen, and it is difficult to determine the balance of voluntary to [[forced prostitution]]. Because slaves were considered property under Roman law, it was legal for an owner to employ them as prostitutes.{{sfn|McGinn|1998|p=56}} The 1st-century historian [[Valerius Maximus]] presents a story of complicated sexual psychology in which a freedman had been forced by his owner to prostitute himself during his time as a slave; the freedman kills his own young daughter when she loses her virginity to her tutor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]] 6.1.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amy |last=Richlin |title=Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''Cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men |journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=1993 |pages=523–73 |jstor=3704392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although rape was a crime in ancient Rome, the law only punished the rape of a slave if it "damaged the goods", since a slave had no legal standing as a person. The penalty was aimed at providing the owner compensation for the "damage" of his property.

There is some evidence that slave prostitutes could benefit from their labor;{{sfn|McGinn|2004|p=52}} in general, slaves could earn their own money by hiring out their skills or taking a profit from conducting their owner's business.

Sometimes the seller of a female slave attached a ''ne serva'' clause to the ownership papers to prevent her from being prostituted. The ''ne serva'' clause meant that if the new owner or any owner afterwards used the slave as a prostitute she would be free.{{sfn|McGinn|1998|p=293}}

A law of Augustus allowed that women guilty of adultery could be sentenced to forced prostitution in brothels. The law was abolished in 389.{{sfn|McGinn|1998|p=171}}

Prostitution was regulated to some extent, not so much for moral reasons as to maximize profit.{{sfn|McGinn|2004|p=4}} Prostitutes had to register with the [[aedile]]s.{{sfn|Edwards|1997|p=81}} She gave her correct name, her age, place of birth, and the pseudonym under which she intended practicing her calling.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Poenulus''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the girl was young and apparently respectable, the official sought to influence her to change her mind;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} failing in this, he issued her a "license for debauchery" (''licentia stupri''), ascertained the price she intended exacting for her favors, and entered her name in his roll. Once entered there, the name could never be removed, but must remain for all time, an insurmountable bar to repentance and respectability.

[[Caligula]] inaugurated a tax upon prostitutes (the ''vectigal ex capturis''), as a state impost: "he levied new and hitherto unheard of taxes; a proportion of the fees of prostitutes;—so much as each earned with one man. A clause was also added to the law directing that women who had practiced prostitutery and men who had practiced procuration should be rated publicly; and furthermore, that marriages should be liable to the rate".&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Calig.'' xi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Severus]] retained this law, but directed that such revenue be used for the upkeep of the public buildings, that it might not contaminate the state treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Lamprid. Alex. Severus, chap. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This infamous tax was not abolished until the time of [[Theodosius I]], but the real credit is due to a wealthy patrician named Florentius, who strongly censured this practice, to the Emperor, and offered his own property to make good the deficit which would appear upon its abrogation.{{sfn|Ovid|2003|p=318, note}}

== Brothels ==
[[File:Pompeya interior del lupanar.jpg|thumb|Purpose-built brothels featured cubicles with a permanent foundation for the bed, as in this example from the Lupanar at Pompeii]]
{{See also|Lupanar (Pompeii)}}
Roman [[brothel]]s are known from literary sources, regionary lists, and archaeological evidence. A brothel is commonly called a lupanar or ''lupanarium'', from ''lupa'', "she-wolf", slang&lt;!--THERE ARE OTHER LATIN WORDS FOR 'PROSTITUTE' THAT ARE AFFECTIONATE OR NEUTRAL; PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THIS WORD UNLESS YOU HAVE A SOURCE MORE AUTHORITATIVE THAN MCGINN (AS CITED) THAT SAYS LUPA IS NOT MISOGYNISTIC--&gt;{{sfn|McGinn|2004|pp=7–8}} for "prostitute," or ''fornix'', a general term for a vaulted space or cellar. According to the regionaries for the city of Rome,&lt;ref&gt;The two extant regionaries for the city of Rome enumerate landmarks, temples, attractions, public facilities, and private buildings in each of the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|city's 14 regions]] in the mid-4th century. See ''Curiosum Urbis'' and ''Notitia Notitia de Regionibus'' at [[LacusCurtius]] by [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/Regionaries/text*.html Bill Thayer]&lt;/ref&gt; ''lupanaria'' were concentrated in [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regio II]];&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Description of the City of Rome, pp. 144 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Suburra]] that bordered the city walls, and the valley between the [[Caelian Hill|Caelian]] and [[Esquiline Hill]]s.

The Great Market (''[[macellum]] magnum'') was in this district, along with many cook-shops, stalls, barber shops, the office of the public executioner, and the barracks for foreign soldiers quartered at Rome. Regio II was one of the busiest and most densely populated quarters in the entire city — an ideal location for the brothel owner or pimp. Rent from a brothel was a legitimate source of income.&lt;ref&gt;Ulpian, Law as to Female Slaves Making Claim to Heirship.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular brothels are described as exceedingly dirty, smelling of characteristic odors lingering in poorly ventilated spaces and of the smoke from burning lamps, as noted accusingly by [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]]: "you reek still of the soot of the brothel".&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], ''Cont.'' i, 2. See also [[Horace]], ''Satire'' i, 2, 30 ("on the other hand, another will have none at all except she be standing in the evil-smelling cell" of the brothel); [[Petronius]], ''Satyricon" xxii ("worn out by all his troubles, Ascyltos commenced to nod, and the maid, whom he had slighted, and, of course, insulted, smeared lamp-black all over his face"); ''Priapeia'' xiii, 9  ("whoever likes may enter here, smeared with the black soot of the brothel").&lt;/ref&gt;

Some brothels aspired to a loftier clientele. Hair dressers were on hand to repair the ravages wrought by frequent amorous conflicts, and water boys ''(aquarioli)'' waited by the door with bowls for washing up.

The licensed houses seem to have been of two kinds: those owned and managed by a pimp ''(leno)'' or madam ''(lena)'', and those in which the latter was merely an agent, renting rooms and acting as a supplier for his renters. In the former, the owner kept a secretary, ''villicus puellarum'', or an overseer for the girls. This manager assigned a girl her name, fixed her prices, received the money and provided clothing and other necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Controv.'' i, 2: "you stood with the prostitutes, you stood decked out to please the public, wearing the costume the pimp had furnished you."&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the duty of the villicus, or cashier, to keep an account of what each girl earned: "give me the brothel-keeper's accounts, the fee will suit".&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Controv.'' lib. i, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural decoration was also in keeping with the object for which the house was maintained; see [[erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum]]. Over the door of each cubicle was a tablet ''(titulus)'' upon which was the name of the occupant and her price; the reverse bore the word ''occupata'' ("occupied, in service, busy") and when the inmate was engaged the tablet was turned so that this word was out. Plautus&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Asin.'' iv, i, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of a less pretentious house when he says: "let her write on the door that she is ''occupata''". The cubicle usually contained a lamp of bronze or, in the lower dens, of clay, a pallet or cot of some sort, over which was spread a blanket or patch-work quilt, this latter being sometimes employed as a curtain.{{sfn|Petronius|2009|loc=chap. 7}} The fees recorded at Pompeii range from 2 to 20 ''[[As (Roman coin)|asses]]'' per client.{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} By comparison, a legionary earned around 10 asses per day (225 denarii per year), and an as could buy 324 g of bread. Some brothels may have had their own token coin system, called [[spintria]].

Because intercourse with a meretrix was almost normative for the adolescent male of the period, and permitted for the married man as long as the prostitute was properly registered,{{sfn|Balsdon|1963|pp=218 and 225-6}} brothels were commonly dispersed around Roman cities, often found between houses of respected families.{{sfn|Duncan|2006|p=13}} These included both large [[brothel]]s and one-room ''cellae meretriciae'', or "prostitute's cots".{{sfn|McGinn|2004|p=11}} Roman authors often made distinctions between "good faith" meretrices who truly loved their clients, and "bad faith" prostitutes, who only lured them in for their money.{{sfn|Duncan|2006|p=259}}{{sfn|Duckworth|1994|p=253}}

== Other locations ==
[[File:Sexual scene on pompeian mural 4.jpg|thumb|An erotic bed scene from a mural of Pompeii]]
The arches under the circus were a favorite location for prostitutes or potential prostitutes. These arcade dens were called "[[wikt:fornix#Noun 2|fornices]]", from which derives the English word ''fornication''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The taverns, inns, lodging houses, cook shops, bakeries, spelt-mills and like institutions all played a prominent part in the underworld of Rome.

The taverns were generally regarded by the magistrates as brothels and the waitresses were so regarded by the law.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Theodos. lx, tit. 7, ed. Ritter; Ulpian liiii, 23, De Ritu Nupt.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem "The Barmaid" ("Copa"), attributed to [[Virgil]], proves that even the proprietress had two strings to her bow, and [[Horace]],&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Sat.'' lib. i, v, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; in describing his excursion to [[Brindisi|Brundisium]], narrates his experience, or lack of it, with a waitress in an inn. This passage, it should be remarked, is the only one in all his works in which he is absolutely sincere in what he says of women. "Here like a triple fool I waited till midnight for a lying jade till sleep overcame me, intent on venery; in that filthy vision the dreams [[Wet dream|spot my night clothes]] and my belly, as I lie upon my back." In the [[Aeserman inscription]]&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, Inscr. Regn. Neap. 5078, which is number 7306 in Orelli-Henzen.&lt;/ref&gt; we have another example of the hospitality of these inns, and a dialogue between the hostess and a transient. The bill for the services of a girl amounted to 8 ''asses''. This inscription is of great interest to the antiquary, and to the archeologist. That bakers were not slow in organizing the grist mills is shown by a passage from [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]]:&lt;ref&gt;Paulus Diaconus, xiii, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; "as time went on, the owners of these turned the public corn mills into pernicious frauds. For, as the mill stones were fixed in places under ground, they set up booths on either side of these chambers and caused prostitutes to stand for hire in them, so that by these means they deceived very many, some that came for bread, others that hastened thither for the base gratification of their wantonness." From a passage in [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], it would seem that this was first put into practice in [[Campania]]: "prostitutes were called 'aelicariae', '[[spelt]]-mill girls, in Campania, being accustomed to ply for gain before the mills of the spelt-millers". "Common strumpets, bakers' mistresses, refuse the spelt-mill girls," says Plautus.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, i, ii, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitution and religion==
[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 090.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Triumph of Flora'' (''ca.'' 1743), an [[Italian Baroque]] interpretation based on Ovid's account of the Floralia, by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 4, as discussed by [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''The Myths of Rome'' (University of Exeter Press, 2004), pp. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Prostitutes had a role in several [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religious observances]], mainly in the month of April. On April 1, women honored [[Fortuna Virilis]], "Masculine Luck", on the day of the [[Veneralia]], a festival of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. According to Ovid,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' 4.133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; prostitutes joined married women ''(matronae)'' in the ritual cleansing and reclothing of the cult statue of Fortuna Virilis.{{sfn|Culham|2004|p=144}} Usually, the line between respectable women and the ''infames'' was carefully drawn: when a priestess traveled through the streets, attendants moved prostitutes along with other "impurities" out of her path.{{sfn|Edwards|1997|p=82}}

On April 23, prostitutes made offerings at the [[Temple of Venus Erycina]] that had been dedicated on that date in 181 BC, as the second temple in Rome to [[Venus (mythology)#Epithets|Venus Erycina]] (Venus of [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]]), a goddess associated with prostitutes. The date coincided with the [[Vinalia]], a wine festival.{{sfn|Culham|2004|p=144}}  "Pimped-out boys" (''pueri lenonii)'' were celebrated on April 25, the same day as the [[Robigalia]], an archaic agricultural festival aimed at protecting the grain crops.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Fasti#Calendaria|Fasti Praenestini]]''; Craig A. Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, the [[Floralia]], held in honor of the [[Flora (goddess)|goddess Flora]] and first introduced about 238 BC, featured [[Exotic dancer|erotic dancing]] and [[striptease|stripping]] by women [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|characterized as prostitutes]]. According to the Christian writer [[Lactantius]], "in addition to the [[freedom of speech]] that pours forth every obscenity, the prostitutes, at the importunities of the rabble, strip off their clothing and act as mimes in full view of the crowd, and this they continue until full satiety comes to the shameless lookers-on, holding their attention with their wriggling buttocks".&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''Instit. Divin.'' 20.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenal also refers to the nude dancing, and perhaps to prostitutes fighting in gladiatorial contests.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' 6.250–251, as cited by Culham, "Women in the Roman Republic," p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval meretrix==
In Medieval Europe, a meretrix was understood as any woman held in common, who “turned no one away”.{{sfn|Biffi|2000|p=15}} It was generally understood that money would be involved in this transaction, but it did not have to be: rather, it was promiscuousness that defined the meretrix.{{sfb|Phillips|Reay|2002|p=93}}

Medieval Christian authors often discouraged prostitution, but did not consider it a serious offence and under some circumstances even considered marrying a harlot to be an act of [[piety]].{{sfn|Brundage|1990|p=308}} Every woman was considered to contain a latent meretrix, so that it was possible to both rise out of and fall into the category, as with tales of prostitutes repenting to become saints.&lt;ref&gt;Carla Freccero, ''Queer/Early/Modern'' (2005) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain modern professors of [[feminism]] have argued that a ''meretrix'' in the medieval mindset is closer to our modern understanding of a sexual identity or orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha C. Nussbaum]]/Juha Sivola, ''The Sleep of Reason'' (2002) p. 247-8&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 11 official public holidays in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;French labor law, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006902611&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072050 L3133-3]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alsace]] region and the [[Moselle]] department observe 2 additional days. .&lt;ref&gt;French labor law, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idSectionTA=LEGISConid=0A721F1B24994815702BA034406FB646.tpdjo17v_3?idConvention=KALICONT000005635164&amp;cidTexte=KALITEXT000023330122 IDCC 1686]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to most countries, these holidays do not shift when they fall during a week-end,&lt;ref&gt;.

In 2005, French prime minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] removed Pentecost Monday's status as a public holiday. This decision was eventually overruled by French courts in 2008{{citation needed|reason=Today, companies are free to consider Whit Monday as a working day; the question then that should be asked here is, what is it that was "overruled?" |date=April 2015}}. Employers are free to decide whether to make Whit Monday a day off or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000018656009&amp;dateTexte= LOI n° 2008-351]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rade''' (also '''Ê Đê''' or '''Rhade''') are an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian ethnic group]] of southern [[Vietnam]] (population 270,348 in 1999).

==Language==

[[Image:Dan toc hoc 19.jpg|thumb|300px|A Rade longhouse.]]

The [[Rade language]] is one of the [[Chamic languages]], a subfamily of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. Other Cham languages are spoken in central Vietnam and in [[Aceh Province|Aceh]], [[Sumatra]]; The Cham are more distantly to related to the [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] languages of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Madagascar]] and to the [[Philippine languages]].

The Cham developed a writing system developed on the basis of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]] in the 1920s.
[[Image: The papoose of people Ede.jpg|thumb|250px|A kind of bamboo bag, created by mythological character Y Rit and has a form of ''pơ lang'' flower's sepal.]]

==Kinship and Social Structure==

The Rade practice [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent. Descent is traced through the female line, and family property is in the hands of and inherited from women. The basic kinship unit is the matrilineage; these are grouped into higher-level matrilineal [[Sib (anthropology)|sibs]] (matrisibs). The Rade are further divided into two [[Phratry|phratries]].&lt;ref&gt;Lebar p.253&lt;/ref&gt;

The women of a matrilineage and their spouses and children live together in a longhouse. The lineage holds corporate property such as paddy land, cattle, gongs, and jars; these are held by the senior female of the matrilineage. The lineage also engages in the farming of common lands and maintenance of the longhouse. The head of the longhouse itself is a man, with the position most commonly inherited by the spouse of the daughter or sister-in-law of the previous longhouse head.&lt;ref&gt;Lebar p.253&lt;/ref&gt;

Matrilineages and matrisibs are [[Exogamy|exogamous]], with both sexual intercourse and marriage prohibited. The phratries also impose some restrictions on marriage. Couples violating these restrictions must sacrifice a buffalo, though violating phratry restrictions are generally not seen as being as serious, and require only the sacrifice of a pig. Residence is [[matrilocal]].&lt;ref&gt;Lebar, p.253&lt;/ref&gt;

Rade villages were traditionally autonomous and governed by an [[oligarchy]] of leading families. Some villages became locally dominant, but none formed any larger political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Lebar, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

===Epic===

[[Epic poem|Epics]] (Rade language: ''klei khan''), such as [[Klei khan Y Dam San]], [[H'Bia Mlin]], [[Dam Kteh Mlan]], [[Mdrong Dam]], etc. are told by epic tellers (Rade language: ''po khan'') next to the fire, through the night.

== Music ==

Ede music is very diverse and playing music is the way that Ede people communicate to both other people, and according to their beliefs, God (Ede language: yang).

=== Musical instruments===
[[Image: Musical instrument Dinhvuot of Ede people.jpg|thumb|25px|right| The ''Đinh vuốt'', a vertical flute used by the Rade people]]
*Gong: There are several sets of gongs used. The knah gong set is made up of six suspended gongs :knah, hlinang or knah hliang, mdu khơk or knah khơk, hluê khơk or mong, hluê hliang, hluê khơk điêt or k'khiêt, knah di, and the largest one is ching sar; as well as two bossed gongs: mđũ and ana (there is also h'gor drum). The others are: chinh k'ram. Rade [[Space of Gong Culture in the Central Highlands of Vietnam|gong culture]] has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].
*Flute (Ede language: đing): đing năm, ky pah, đing tak ta (or đing buốt klé), đing buốt tút, đing buốt trok, đing rinh, đing téc, đinh tút.
*String instrument: brố, goong.
*Others: chinh đing aráp, gông kram, đing pah, đing ktuk, đing pâng, kni.

=== Style of music ===

*Kư- ứt: a kind of telling the epic accompanied with đing buốt trok.
*Ayray: a kind of love songs accompanied with đing năm.

== Architecture ==

A typical house of Rade people is the longhouse made of bamboo and wood. The longhouse's length is measured by the number of collar beams (Rade language: ''de''). Once a girl living in the house gets married, the house is lengthened by one compartment, as the matrilocal aspect of Rade marriage means that the husband will live in his wife's house. The orientation of buildings are North-South.

The longhouse's space is divided into two parts: ''Gah'' part's area makes up 1/3- 2/3 the total area is considered as the living room and the other part includes bedrooms. There are two doors: the front door is for men, the back door is for women and two stairs: male stair and female stair.

Longhouses can be 100 meters long and house from three to nine families. A traditional description of the size of the longhouse is: "The house is as long as the gong's echo".

==Vietnam War==
During the [[Vietnam War]], American and South Vietnamese military advisers feared that the Viet Cong would convert Rhade tribesman in the [[Đắk Lắk Province]] to their support. They instituted a program by which [[American Special Forces]] sought to train the Rhade in "village self-defense programs."&lt;ref name= cmh&gt;Kelly 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  These self-defense programs were highly controversial.

According to [[William Duiker]], United States Foreign Officer and East-Asian professor, the training efforts, called "Civilian Irregular Defense Groups" (CIDG), were plagued with problems of arbitrary authority on the part of Vietnamese authorities and officers.  During the summer of 1964, "...Vietnamese arrogance led immediately to problems, and in September a serious revolt broke out among the Rhadé [sic] tribesmen in Ban Me Thout.  Only with the aid of U.S. advisers was the crisis defused."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rade made up a portion of the United States' [[Degar|Montagnard]] allies, and after the war some fled to the United States, mainly residing in [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cal.org/co/montagnards/vpeop.html |title=MONTAGNARDS - Their History and Culture |publisher=Cultural Orientation Resource Center |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. Sabatier has collected 236 articles. The highest number of articles is of marriage and family matter, followed by property ownership and relationship between the head of villages and villagers. The main principles are that communal nature and equality are under guarantee. Judges are called ''khoa phat kdi''.

{{History of Afghanistan}}
'''Shuja Shah Durrani Sadozai''' (also known as ''Shāh Shujāʻ'', ''Shah Shuja'', ''Shoja Shah'',''Shuja Sadozai'' ''Shuja al-Mulk'') (4 November 1785 – 5 April 1842) was ruler of the [[Durrani Empire]] from 1803 to 1809. He then ruled from 1839 until his death in 1842. Shuja Shah was of the Sadozai clan of the Popalzai Durranis group of [[Ethnic Pashtuns]]. He became the fifth [[list of heads of state of Afghanistan|Emir of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] – [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067071/Shah-Shoja Shah Shoja]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== King of Afghanistan ===
Shuja Shah was the governor of [[Herat]] and Peshawar from 1798 to 1801. He proclaimed himself as [[King of Afghanistan]] in October 1801 (after the deposition of his brother [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]]), but only properly ascended to the throne on July 13, 1803. In Afghanistan, a blind man by tradition cannot be Emir, and so Shuja had his brother Zaman blinded, however not killed.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} After coming to power in 1803, Shuja ended the [[blood feud]] with the powerful [[Barakzai]] family and also forgave them. To create an alliance with them, he married their "sister" Wa'fa Begum.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=23}}

Shuja allied Afghanistan with the [[United Kingdom]] in 1809, as a means of defending against an invasion of Afghanistan and [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]] by [[Russia]].{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=5}} In 1809, a British diplomatic mission was sent to Afghanistan, which at the time was to the British a remote and mysterious part of Asia. According to [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], "The King of Kabul [Shah Shuja] was a handsome man". He also wrote "of an olive complexion with a thick black beard ... his voice clear, his address princely." Shuja wore the [[Koh-i-Noor]] ("Mountain of Light") diamond in one of his bracelets when Elphinstone visited him.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=18}} [[William Fraser (British India civil servant)|William Fraser]], who accompanied Elphinstone to meet Shah Shuja was "struck with the dignity of his appearance and the romantic Oriental awe."{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=20}} Fraser also judged him to be "about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in}} tall" and his skin colour was "very fair, but dead...his beard was thick jet black and shortened a little by the obliquely upwards, but turned again at the corners ... The eyelashes and the edges of his eyelids were blackened with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|antimony]]." He also described Shuja's voice as "loud and sonorous".{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=21}}

[[File:Order of the Durrani Empire Afghanistan received by Sir Thomas Willshire 1789 1862.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Order of the Durrani Empire, founded by Shuja Shah in 1839. It was awarded to a number of officers of the [[Bengal Army]]. [[Musée national de la Légion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie]].]]
In June 1809,{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=27}} he was overthrown by his predecessor [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]] and went into exile in [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]], where he was captured by Jahandad Khan Bamizai and imprisoned at [[Attock]] (1811–1812) and then taken to [[Kashmir]] (1812–1813) by Atta Muhammad Khan. When [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]'s [[vizier]] [[Fateh Khan]] invaded Kashmir alongside [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army, he chose to leave with the [[Sikh]] army. He stayed in [[Lahore]] from 1813 to 1814. During his time in India, Shuja lost the Koh-i-Noor diamond to Maharaja Singh. He stayed with Singh so that later on he could strike a deal for their support to attack [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

From 1818 onward, Shuja who liked to live in a lavish style with his wives and concubines had collected a pension from the East India Company, which thought he might prove useful one day.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} Shuja stayed first in Punjab and later in [[Ludhiana]] with Zaman Shah. The place where he stayed in Ludhiana is presently occupied by the Main Post Office near Mata Rani Chowk and inside it there is a white marble stone commemorating his stay there.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Exile ===
During his time in exile, Shuja indulged his cruelty by removing the noses, ears, tongues, penises, and testicles of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him in the slightest.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When the American adventurer Dr. [[Josiah Harlan]] visited Shuja's court in exile he noted that all of Shuja's courtiers and slaves were missing some part of their bodies as all had in some way displeased their master at some point along the line, to whom they were all slavishly devoted to despite his abuse of them as Harlan noted that there was an "earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king's service".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When Shuja went out for picnic with his four wives and the wind blew down his tent, Shuja flew into a rage and he had the man responsible for putting up his tent, Khwajah Mika-a slave from East Africa who had already had his ears chopped off-to be castrated on the spot as punishment for not erecting his tent more firmly, much to Harlan's horror.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Shuja's grand vizier, Mullah Shakur had grown his hair long to cover up that both his ears had been chopped off while he spoke in the distinctive high-pitched voice of a eunuch; Harlan noted he was lucky as the rest of his body was still intact.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Despite or perhaps because he was mutilated, Shuja's grand vizier took a great deal of pleasure in mutilating others and was always inciting his master to have somebody mutilated.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Harlan noted all of the men around Shuja were missing at least one part of their bodies, if not more, and all seemed extremely afraid of their master, who was apt to fly into a rage whenever he did not get his way with anything, and when he was angry, body parts tended to get severed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan commend on "the grace and dignity of His Highness's demeanor", observing the sense of power he projected, but also that "years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation."{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=30}} Harlan, a man without much military experience and knowledge of [[Pashto]], offered to lead an invasion of Afghanistan to restore Shuja, an offer that led the former monarch to break "into a poetical effusion in praise of Kabul" and its gardens, its trees laden with fruits, and its music culminating with "Kabul is called the Crown of the Air. I pray for the possession of those pleasures which my native country alone can afford".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} When Harlan pressed him on whatever he wanted to accept his offer or not, Shuja agreed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} Harlan had a tailor sew up an American flag, which Harlan hosted up in Ludhiana, and started to recruit mercenaries for the invasion of Afghanistan, suggesting that he was working for the U.S. government (which he was not).{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan ultimately grew disillusioned with Shuja, writing he did not view him as the "legitimate monarch, the victim of treasonable practices", but rather as "a wayward tyrant, inflexible in moods, vindictive in his enmities, faithless in his attachments, unnatural in his affections. He remembered his misfortunes only to avenge them".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|pp=170–171}}

In 1833 he struck a deal with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab: He was allowed to march his troops through Punjab, and in return he would cede [[Peshawar]] to the Sikhs if they could manage to take it. In a concerted campaign the following year, Shuja marched on Kandahar while the Sikhs, commanded by General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] attacked Peshawar. In July, Shuja Shah was narrowly defeated at [[Kandahar]] by the Afghans under Dost Mohammad Khan and fled. The Sikhs on their part reclaimed Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Restoration of power ===
In 1838 he had gained the support of the British and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost Mohammad Khan. [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], believed that most Afghans would welcome the return of Shuja as their rightful ruler, but in fact by 1838, most people in Afghanistan could not remember him, and those that did remembered him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler whom they absolutely hated.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=112}} During the march on Kabul, the main British camp was attacked by a force of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]]s, of whom 50 were captured.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} When the prisoners were brought before Shuja, one of them used a knife he had hidden in his robes to stab to death one of Shuja's ministers, causing Shuja to fly into one of his rages and to order all 50 prisoners to be beheaded on the spot.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} The British historian Sir [[John William Kaye]] wrote the "wanton barbarity" of the mass execution as all 50 prisoners were beheaded strained the campaign, stating the "shrill cry" of the prisoners as they waited to be executed was the "funeral wail" of the "unholy policy" of attempting to restore Shuja.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} Shuja was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839,{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=515}} 30 years after his deposition, but did not remain in power when the British left. Upon being restored, Shuja announced that he considered his own people to be "dogs" who needed to be taught to be obedient to their master, and spent his time exacting bloody vengeance on those Afghans whom he felt had betrayed him, making him extremely unpopular with his people.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=121}} He shut himself away in the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul]], and on leaving it he was assassinated by Shuja ud-Daula, at the insistence of [[Wazir Akbar Khan]] on April 5, 1842.{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=552}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=C.

'''''The Beginning Was the End''''' is a 1971 [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] book written by [[Oscar Kiss Maerth]] that claims that mankind evolved from [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] apes. Its premise:

{{quotation|One ape discovered that eating the fresh brain of one's own kind increases the sexual impulses. He and his descendants became addicted to brains and hunted for them. It was not until later that they noticed that their intelligence increased as a result. The outcome of this process is HOMO SAPIENS.|''The Beginning was the End'', p. 37}}

==Publication==
Maerth wrote {{When|date=September 2015}} the book in a Chinese monastery.

It was first published in West Germany as ''Der Anfang war das Ende – Der Mensch entstand durch Kannibalismus'' (Econ Verlag GmbH, Düsseldorf und Wien, 1971), then translated by Judith Hayward and published in Great Britain by Michael Joseph, Ltd, 1973 and re-issued by Sphere Books, Ltd, London in 1974, {{ISBN|0-7221-5712-6}}. It has been translated into eight languages.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A Cipibo woman with her son wearing a head-press.jpg|thumb|"A Cipibo woman with her son wearing a head-press."]] --&gt;

==Synopsis==
Maerth asserted that the eating of [[brain]] produces an [[aphrodisiac]] effect (presumably due to the vast amount of [[hormones]] in it), and that this initially caused apes to become [[Substance dependence|addicted]] to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped in a frenzy of brain-induced [[sex]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 37&lt;/ref&gt; However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and [[intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 39&lt;/ref&gt; while triggering the loss both of body hair&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 90&lt;/ref&gt; and of our innate psychic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 99&lt;/ref&gt; Thus man gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans, [[Social alienation|alienated]] from their surroundings now that they've no [[telepathic]] contact with nature and each other as animals do,&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; suffering from a distorted [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] resulting from hormonal imbalances,&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing on the inside of their skulls,&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 53:
{{quote|Eating brain made his brain expand at such a fast rate that the skull was unable to keep up with this growth. The over-sized brain was gradually subjected to increasing pressure, which over the course of time became more and more dangerous. There were ever more numerous cases of a brain disease similar to epilepsy and of extreme madness, and with no room for doubt man was able to trace these back to the pressure on his over-large brain [...] Various attempts were first made at that time to ease the pressure of the skull, mostly by altering its shape and if that did not help then by making an opening or a perforation in the skull.}}&lt;/ref&gt; are inevitably destroying themselves with [[pollution]], [[Overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]],&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 230–231&lt;/ref&gt; [[racial integration]]&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 192–200&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately, [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future,&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 199:
{{quote|The period of cannibalism is by no means over and done with; on the contrary [...] before these times come, man will live through alarming and inexplicable happenings. So-called civilized, well-brought up people will eat their own fellow men, often their own friends, without being able to say why. Their subconscious will cause them to do so, and humanity can be certain that this will be the precursor of a new period of cannibalism which will recur for various reasons and to achieve various purposes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that the reader should drop out of society,&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), pages 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; embrace a [[vegetarian]] diet, steep himself in the wisdom of the East&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 84, also 234&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the shape of his skull as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 128, also see the comments on page 148: {{quote|The only permissible intervention in the brain is one which was practised successfully countless thousands of years ago: the formation of a dome on the top of the skull so that the physical defect is reduced to some extent. Men who do this will not only partially regain the lost capacity for supersensory perception, they will also recognize the philosophical truths capable of yielding a truly scientific basis for the prolongation of mankind's existence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Racetheories.jpg|thumb|"The different human races developed from different breeds of ape...the following eight pages show starling resemblances between types of ape and different human races".]] --&gt;

==Criticism==
The book contains no references whatsoever, based alternately on alleged conversations with present-day [[cannibals]],&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 47&lt;/ref&gt; the eating of ape brain by the author&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), pages 52–53:
{{quote|And a milder and permitted form of cannibalism still exists today in Africa, South East Asia, South China, Taiwan and on some neighboring islands: the eating of fresh ape brain. In Asia this still occurs even in public restaurants. When the brain is eaten in this way the same procedures are followed as among cannibals who eat human brain. Here too the brain is only eaten when the moon is increasing [...] The ape may likewise not come near metal objects because the rays emitted by metals have a prejudicial influence on the nervous system and the brain. It is therefore kept in a wooden cage. Shortly before it is killed it is offered a sip of an alcoholic drink and a handful of nuts to chew to stimulate the brain. The skull is broken with a stone or wooden hammer [...] The brain is immediately scooped out with a china or bamboo spoon and eaten as it is. The brain is tough and rubbery and can hardly be chewed. It is devoid of flavour, yet on account of the blood rather sweet, not a delicacy by any standard; those eating it themselves take alcoholic drinks with it. Only men partake of such repasts of ape brain [...] According to my own experience, about twenty hours after such a repast there is a feeling of warmth in the brain, like a gentle pressure. After about twenty-eight hours the body is flooded by vitality, with increased sexual impulses. The milder forms of cannibalism described above are a residue of true cannibalism, as a consequence of which a normal ape turned into an intelligent freak: which today calls itself HOMO SAPIENS.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and direct insight from deep meditation. Many parts have been deemed by some as being outright [[racist]], particularly the photographic plates comparing various ethnic faces (primarily [[Arab]] and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]) to apes.&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), 8-page photo supplement between pages 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; He says that blacks have smaller brains than whites&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 180&lt;/ref&gt; and that contemporary cannibal tribes are seeking to remedy this discrepancy by consuming brains in a frantic attempt to catch up, though he estimates that it would take them roughly 100,000 years to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Maerth (1974), page 68:
{{quote|Man did not educate woman imperfectly: he gave her no brain to eat. To bring female intelligence up to the same level as that of man by education is just as impossible as to bring the intelligence of an aboriginal of New Guinea up to the level of a Chinese by education. If a race become cannibals one hundred thousand years later, then members of that race do not need education to raise their intelligence, but a hundred thousand years of cannibalism. If someone wanted to commit the error of giving woman man's intelligence, then woman would have to begin eating brain and continue doing so for several tens of thousands of years [...] As, however, intelligence gained by cannibalism entails for human beings the burden of delusions, there would be even greater chaos.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
The book's legacy comes largely from the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo]], who incorporated several elements of the book into their concept of "de-evolution" and even adopted the book's title for their short film, ''In the Beginning was the End: The Truth About De-evolution''.  Bassist/synth player/vocalist [[Gerald Casale|Gerald V. Casale]] said of the book, "It's a better story than the [[Bible]] as far as DEVO's concerned."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acidlogic.com/devo_int.htm Acid Logic Interview with Gerald V. Casale] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235929/http://www.acidlogic.com/devo_int.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of the 1989 album ''[[Now It Can Be Told: DEVO at the Palace|Now It Can Be Told]]'' is based on the cover of the US paperback edition.

In the early 2000s, Devo attempted to have the book reprinted with an introduction by them. This met with no success, due to copyright issues. The book is now quite collectable.

The '''Vaqueiros d'alzada'''&lt;ref&gt;Singular:Vaqueiru d'Alzada&lt;/ref&gt; ("nomadic [[Pastoral farming|cowherds]]" in [[Asturian language]], from their word for cow, cognate of Spanish ''[[cowboy|Vaquero]]'') are a northern [[Spain|Spanish]] [[nomad]]ic people in the mountains of [[León, Spain|León]] and [[Asturias]], who practiced [[transhumance]], i.e. moving [[season]]ally with [[cattle]]. 
 
Historically, they had been discriminated against by the valley dwellers (''xaldos'') and by the church in Asturias, because vaqueiros were a free people in the mountains. There are few studies about the origin of vaqueiros and their culture. They distinguish themselves by their costumes and dialect. Their nomadic lifestyle placed them out of the reach of the Church and the Government.

{{Democracy}}
In [[political science]], a '''wave of democracy''' refers to a major surge of [[democracy]] in history. The term "Third Wave of Democracy" was first coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]], a political scientist at [[Harvard University]] in his article published in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' and further expounded in his 1991 book ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century]]''. 

Huntington describes global democratization as coming in three waves, the first beginning in the early 19th century and the third being a current event.&lt;ref name="huntington"&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=U.S. State Department
|accessdate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Seva Gunitsky of University of Toronto, have referred to 13 waves from the 18th century to the Arab Spring (2011-2012).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunitsky|first=Seva|date=2018|title=Democratic Waves in Historical Perspective|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/democratic-waves-in-historical-perspective/9452AFC439DD960F4D219246A7E7F51E|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=634–651|doi=10.1017/S1537592718001044|issn=1537-5927|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huntingon's three waves==
===First wave=== 
The First wave of democracy began in the early 19th century when [[suffrage]] was granted to the majority of white males in the [[United States]] ("[[Jacksonian democracy]]"). At its peak, the first wave saw 29 democracies in the world. This continued until 1922, when [[Benito Mussolini]] rose to power in [[Italy]]. The ebb of the first wave lasted from 1922 until 1942, during which the number of democracies in the world dropped to a mere 12.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

===Second wave===

The Second wave began following the Allied victory in [[World War II]], and crested nearly 20 years later in 1962 with 36 recognised democracies in the world. The Second wave ebbed as well at this point, and the total number dropped to 30 democracies between 1962 and the mid-1970s. But the "flat line" would not last for long, as the third wave was about to surge in a way no one had ever seen.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

Scholars have noted that the appearance of "waves" of democracy largely disappears when women's suffrage is taken into account; moreover, some countries change their positions quite dramatically: [[Switzerland]], which is typically included as part of the first wave, did not grant women the right to vote until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, Pamela. (2000). “Women's Suffrage in the Measurement of Democracy: Problems of Operationalization.” ''Studies in Comparative International Development'' 35(3): 92-111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third wave===

The Third wave began in 1974 ([[Carnation Revolution]], Portugal) and included the historic democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980s, Asia Pacific countries and regions ([[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]]) from 1986 to 1988, Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and sub-Saharan Africa beginning in 1989. The expansion of democracy in some regions was stunning. In Latin America only Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela were democratic by 1978 and only Cuba and Haiti remained authoritarian by 1995, when the wave had swept across twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schenoni, Luis and Scott Mainwaring|title=Hegemonic Effects and Regime Change in Latin America|journal=Democratization|doi=10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754?journalCode=fdem20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures there are well over 100 democracies in the world today{{when|date=November 2016}}, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{cn|date=November 2016}}  Many of these newer democracies are not fully "consolidated," however, meaning that while they have electoral institutions in place, political democracy remains fragile.  Reasons for this fragility include economic instability, continued elite dominance of politics, ongoing military interference in civilian affairs, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Larry. (1996). “Is the Third Wave Over?” ''Journal of Democracy'' 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries undergoing or having undergone a transition to democracy during a wave are subject to [[democratic backsliding]]. Political scientists and theorists believe that the third wave has crested and will soon begin to ebb, just as its predecessors did in the first and second waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagorski|first=Paul W.|title=Democratic Breakdown in Paraguay and Venezuela: The Shape of Things to Come for Latin America?|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–116|doi=10.1177/0095327X0303000104|url=http://afs.sagepub.com/content/30/1/87.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the period immediately following the onset of the "war on terror" after the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks on the United States, some backsliding was evident.  How significant or lasting that erosion is remains a subject of debate.

After the Great Recession of 2008, a number of countries backslided from democracy including Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Honduras and the Maldives. Some other countries have had democratic transitions however, such as Tunisia and the Gambia. There has also been limited democratic reform in some countries, such as Burma and Morocco. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Arab Spring==
Experts have associated the collapse of several dictatorships in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], phenomenon known as Arab Spring, with the events which followed the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. The similarity between the two phenomena inspired hope for a fourth wave of [[democratization]]. However, a few months after the apparent beginning of the transition, most of the Arab political openings closed, causing an inevitable pull-back. One of the most alarming cases was that of Egypt, where the government, controlled by the military, did not facilitate the democratic transition in any way. On the contrary, it strove to silence the protests by arresting peaceful protesters and by “trying them in military tribunals.”{{fact|date=March 2018}} A concrete example is provided by the story of [[Maikel Nabil Sanad|Maikel Nabil]], an Egyptian blogger convicted to be imprisoned for three years for “insulting the [[military]] establishment.” The main causes of the regression and crisis in all the affected countries are attributed to corruption, unemployment, social injustice, and autocratic political systems.

Despite the apparently unsolvable situation, the [[United Nations|UN]], under the administration of [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]], tried to work as a mediator between the governments and the protesters. Moreover, according to [[Larry Diamond]], the engagement of the [[United States|United States of America]] in the democratic transition of the Arab world was fundamental. He attributed to the country the role of mentor and example for the newborn democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-05-22/fourth-wave-or-false-start|title = A Fourth Wave or False Start?|website = Foreign Affairs|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital media]] played a much longer term role in creating favorable conditions for uprisings, helped to publicize key igniting events, and then facilitated those uprisings and their diffusion; but digital media did not do this alone or as suddenly as some observers have claimed. The story of the Arab Spring, according to Howard and Hussain, began over a decade ago as Internet access and mobile phones began to diffuse rapidly through North Africa and the Middle East. The citizens that could afford internet access, the wealthy and powerful mostly, played a huge role in the [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Bahrain]] [[Rebellion|uprisings]]. Over time, online criticisms of regimes became more public and common, setting the stage for the [[Arab Spring]]. Digital media also allowed women and other minorities to enter these political discussions, and, ultimately, the ensuing protests and revolutions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Howard|first = Phillip N. |date= 2013 |title= Democracy’s Fourth Wave?

The discovery involved [[spin (physics)|spin theory]], which is the basis of a theory of the [[Matter#Structure|structure of matter]].

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Pauli was born in [[Vienna]] to a [[chemist]] Wolfgang Joseph Pauli (''[[né]]'' Wolf Pascheles, 1869–1955) and his wife Bertha Camilla Schütz; his sister was [[Hertha Pauli]], the writer and actress. Pauli's middle name was given in honor of his [[Godparent|godfather]], physicist [[Ernst Mach]]. Pauli's paternal grandparents were from prominent [[Jewish]] families of [[Prague]]; his great-grandfather was the Jewish publisher [[Wolf Pascheles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/11/5/001 Ernst Mach and Wolfgang Pauli's ancestors in Prague]&lt;/ref&gt; Pauli's father converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]] shortly before his marriage in 1899. Pauli's mother, Bertha Schütz, was raised in her own mother's Roman Catholic religion; her father was Jewish writer [[Friedrich Schütz]]. Pauli was raised as a Roman Catholic, although eventually he and his parents left the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Physicists.html|title=Jewish Physicists|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to have been a [[Deism|deist]] and a [[Mysticism|mystic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=No Time to Be Brief: A Scientific Biography of Wolfgang Pauli|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198564799|author=Charles Paul Enz|quote=At the same time Pauli writes on 11 October 1957 to the science historian Shmuel Sambursky whom he had met on his trip to Israel (see Ref. [7], p. 964): 'In opposition to the monotheist religions – but in unison with the mysticism of all peoples, including the Jewish mysticism – I believe that the ultimate reality is not personal.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science|year=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061209192|pages=214–215|author=Werner Heisenberg|quote=Wolfgang shared my concern. ... "Einstein's conception is closer to mine. His God is somehow involved in the immutable laws of nature. Einstein has a feeling for the central order of things. He can detect it in the simplicity of natural laws. We may take it that he felt this simplicity very strongly and directly during his discovery of the theory of relativity. Admittedly, this is a far cry from the contents of religion. I don't believe Einstein is tied to any religious tradition, and I rather think the idea of a personal God is entirely foreign to him."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pauli attended the [[Döbling]]er-Gymnasium in Vienna, graduating with distinction in 1918. Only two months after graduation, he published his first [[scientific paper|paper]], on [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]]. He attended the [[Ludwig-Maximilians University]] in [[Munich]], working under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]],&lt;ref name=peierls/&gt; where he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in July 1921 for his thesis on the quantum theory of [[Dihydrogen cation|ionized diatomic hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2|+}}).&lt;ref name=mathgene/&gt;&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Wolfgang Ernst|last=Pauli |title=Über das Modell des Wasserstoff-Molekülions |publisher=Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München |date=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommerfeld asked Pauli to review the [[theory of relativity]] for the [[Klein's encyclopedia|''Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften'']] (''Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences''). Two months after receiving his doctorate, Pauli completed the article, which came to 237 pages. It was praised by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; published as a [[monograph]], it remains a standard reference on the subject to this day.

[[File:Wolfgang Pauli young.jpg|left|thumb|Wolfgang Pauli lecturing]]
Pauli spent a year at the [[University of Göttingen]] as the assistant to [[Max Born]], and the following year at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in [[University of Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], which later became the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in 1965. From 1923 to 1928, he was a lecturer at the [[University of Hamburg]]. During this period, Pauli was instrumental in the development of the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. In particular, he formulated the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] and the theory of nonrelativistic [[spin (physics)|spin]].

In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at [[ETH Zurich]] in [[Switzerland]] where he made significant scientific progress. He held visiting professorships at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1931, and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] in 1935. He was awarded the [[Lorentz Medal]] in 1931.

At the end of 1930, shortly after his postulation of the [[neutrino]] and immediately following his divorce and the suicide of his mother, Pauli experienced a personal crisis. He consulted psychiatrist and psychotherapist [[Carl Jung]] who, like Pauli, lived near [[Zurich]]. Jung immediately began interpreting Pauli's deeply [[archetypal]] dreams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varlaki|first=P.|author2=Nadai L. |author3=Bokor, J. |title=Number Archetypes and Background Control Theory Concerning the Fine Structure Constant|journal=Acta Polytechnica Hungarica|volume=5|issue=2|pages=|doi=|year=2008|url=http://bmf.hu/journal/Varlaki_Nadai_Bokor_14.pdf|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pauli became one of the depth psychologist's best students. He soon began to criticize the [[epistemology]] of Jung's theory scientifically, and this contributed to a certain clarification of the latter's thoughts, especially about the concept of [[synchronicity]]. A great many of these discussions are documented in the Pauli/Jung letters, today published as ''Atom and Archetype''. Jung's elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli's dreams is documented in ''[[Psychology and Alchemy]]''.

The [[Anschluss|German annexation of Austria in 1938]] made him a German citizen, which became a problem for him in 1939 after the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, he tried in vain to obtain Swiss citizenship, which would have allowed him to remain at the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Paul Enz: ''No Time to be Brief: A Scientific Biography of Wolfgang Pauli'', first published 2002, reprinted 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-856479-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c-UJWhBaZBgC&amp;pg=PA338 p. 338]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pauli moved to the United States in 1940, where he was employed as a professor of theoretical physics at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In 1946, after the war, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States and subsequently returned to Zurich, where he mostly remained for the rest of his life. In 1949, he was granted Swiss citizenship.

In 1958, Pauli was awarded the [[Max Planck medal]]. In that same year, he fell ill with [[pancreatic cancer]]. When his last assistant, Charles Enz, visited him at the Rotkreuz hospital in Zurich, Pauli asked him: "Did you see the room number?" It was number 137. Throughout his life, Pauli had been preoccupied with the question of why the [[fine structure constant]], a [[dimensional analysis|dimensionless]] fundamental constant, has a value nearly equal to 1/137. Pauli died in that room on 15 December 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"By a 'cabalistic' coincidence, Wolfgang Pauli died in room 137 of the Red-Cross hospital at Zurich on 15 December 1958." - Of Mind and Spirit, Selected Essays of Charles Enz, Charles Paul Enz, World Scientific, 2009, {{ISBN|978-981-281-900-0}}, pg.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific research ===
[[Image:Bohr heisen pauli.jpg|thumb|[[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and Wolfgang Pauli, ''ca''. 1935]]
Pauli made many important contributions as a physicist, primarily in the field of [[quantum mechanics]]. He seldom published papers, preferring lengthy correspondences with colleagues such as [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], with whom he had close friendships. Many of his ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients.

Pauli proposed in 1924 a new quantum degree of freedom (or [[quantum number]]) with two possible values, in order to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of quantum mechanics. He formulated the Pauli exclusion principle, perhaps his most important work, which stated that no two electrons could exist in the same quantum state, identified by four quantum numbers including his new two-valued degree of freedom. The idea of spin originated with [[Ralph Kronig]]. [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] one year later identified Pauli's new degree of freedom as [[electron]] [[spin (physics)|spin]].

In 1926, shortly after Heisenberg published the [[Matrix mechanics|matrix theory]] of modern [[quantum mechanics]], Pauli used it to derive the observed spectrum of the [[hydrogen atom]]. This result was important in securing credibility for Heisenberg's theory.

Pauli introduced the 2 × 2 [[Pauli matrices]] as a basis of spin operators, thus solving the nonrelativistic theory of spin. This work is sometimes said to have influenced [[Paul Dirac]] in his creation of the [[Dirac equation]] for the [[relativistic particle|relativistic]] electron, though Dirac stated that he invented these same matrices himself independently at the time, without Pauli's influence. Dirac invented similar but larger (4x4) spin matrices for use in his relativistic treatment of fermionic spin.

In 1930, Pauli considered the problem of [[beta decay]]. In a letter of 4 December to [[Lise Meitner]] ''et al.'', beginning, "[[Electron neutrino#Pauli's letter|Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen]]", he proposed the existence of a hitherto unobserved neutral particle with a small mass, no greater than 1% the mass of a proton, in order to explain the continuous spectrum of beta decay. In 1934, [[Enrico Fermi]] incorporated the particle, which he called a [[neutrino]], into his theory of beta decay. The neutrino was first confirmed experimentally in 1956 by [[Frederick Reines]] and [[Clyde Cowan]], two and a half years before Pauli's death. On receiving the news, he replied by telegram: "Thanks for message. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. Pauli."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Enz|first=Charles|author2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Wolfgang Pauli, A Biographical Introduction|journal=Writings on Physics and Philosophy|publisher=Springer-Verlag|volume=|issue=|page=19|doi=|year=1994|url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, he re-derived the [[spin-statistics theorem]], a critical result of quantum field theory which states that particles with half-integer spin are [[fermion]]s, while particles with integer spin are [[boson]]s.

In 1949, he published a paper on [[Pauli–Villars regularization]]: regularization is the term for techniques which modify infinite mathematical integrals to make them finite during calculations, so that one can identify whether the intrinsically infinite quantities in the theory (mass, charge, wavefunction) form a finite and hence calculable set which can be redefined in terms of their experimental values, which criterion is termed [[renormalization]], and which removes infinities from [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], but also importantly allows the calculation of higher order corrections in perturbation theory.

Pauli made repeated criticisms of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pauli|first=W.|title=Naturwissenschaftliche und erkenntnistheoretische Aspekte der Ideen vom Unbewussten|journal=Dialectica|volume=8|issue=4|pages=283–301|doi= 10.1111/j.1746-8361.1954.tb01265.x|year=1954|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atmanspacher|first=H.|author2=Primas, H.|title=Pauli's ideas on mind and matter in the context of contemporary science|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|volume=13|issue=3|pages=5–50|doi=|year=2006|url=http://www.igpp.de/english/tda/pdf/paulijcs8.pdf|accessdate=2009-02-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319155642/http://www.igpp.de/english/tda/pdf/paulijcs8.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his contemporary admirers point to modes of [[epigenetics|epigenetic inheritance]] as supportive of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solid.ethz.ch/pauli-conference/thematic.htm Conference on Wolfgang Pauli's Philosophical Ideas and Contemporary Science] organised by [[ETH]] May 20–25, 2007.

=== Personality and reputation ===
[[File:Wolfgang Pauli.jpg|thumb|250px|Wolfgang Pauli, ca. 1924]]
The [[Pauli effect]] was named after the anecdotal bizarre ability of his to break experimental equipment simply by being in the vicinity. Pauli was aware of his reputation and was delighted whenever the Pauli effect manifested. These strange occurrences were in line with his investigations into the legitimacy of [[parapsychology]], particularly his collaboration with C. G. Jung on the concept of [[synchronicity]].

Regarding physics, Pauli was famously a perfectionist. This extended not just to his own work, but also to the work of his colleagues. As a result, he became known in the physics community as the "conscience of physics," the critic to whom his colleagues were accountable. He could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, often labelling it ''ganz falsch'', utterly wrong.

However, this was not his most severe criticism, which he reserved for theories or theses so unclearly presented as to be untestable or unevaluatable and, thus, [[Pseudoscience|not properly belonging within the realm of science]], even though posing as such. They were worse than wrong because they could not be proven wrong. Famously, he once said of such an unclear paper: "It is [[not even wrong]]!"&lt;ref name=peierls&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peierls | first1 = Rudolf | authorlink1 = Rudolf Peierls | year = 1960 | title = Wolfgang Ernst Pauli 1900-1958 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages =  | publisher = Royal Society | jstor =  | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1960.0014 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His supposed remark when meeting another leading physicist, [[Paul Ehrenfest]], illustrates this notion of an arrogant Pauli. The two met at a conference for the first time. Ehrenfest was familiar with Pauli's papers and was quite impressed with them. After a few minutes of conversation, Ehrenfest remarked, "I think I like your Encyclopedia article [on relativity theory] better than I like you," to which Pauli shot back, "That's strange. With me, regarding you, it is just the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8tUVMSsC9wAC&amp;pg=PA488 ''The Historical Development of Quantum Theory''], By [[Jagdish Mehra]], Helmut Rechenberg, page 488, Springer (December 28, 2000), {{ISBN|978-0-387-95175-1}}, citing [[Oskar Klein]].&lt;/ref&gt; The two became very good friends from then on.

A somewhat warmer picture emerges from this story, which appears in the article on Dirac:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Werner Heisenberg [in ''Physics and Beyond'', 1971] recollects a friendly conversation among young participants at the 1927 [[Solvay Conference]], about Einstein and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s views on religion. Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg, and Dirac took part in it. Dirac's contribution was a poignant and clear criticism of the political manipulation of religion, that was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr, when Heisenberg reported it to him later. Among other things, Dirac said: "I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest – and as scientists honesty is our precise duty – we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation. The very idea of God is a product of human imagination. [ ... ] I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another. [ ... ]" Heisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli had kept silent, after some initial remarks. But when finally he was asked for his opinion, jokingly he said: "Well, I'd say that also our friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is 'God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet'". Everybody burst into laughter, including Dirac.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of Pauli's ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. Pauli may have been unconcerned that much of his work thus went uncredited, but when it came to Heisenberg's world-renowned 1958 lecture at Göttingen on their joint work on a unified field theory, and the press release calling Pauli a mere "assistant to Professor Heisenberg", Pauli became offended, denouncing Heisenberg's physics prowess. The deterioration between them resulted in Heisenberg ignoring Pauli's funeral, and writing in his autobiography that Pauli's criticisms were overwrought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The strange friendship of Pauli and Jung – Part 6|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoX7RnLezx8|work=CERN|publisher=University College London|author=Arthur I.

=== Personal life ===
[[File:Büste Wolfgang Pauli Ki 00034-02.tif|thumb|left|125px|Bust of Wolfgang Pauli (1962)]]
In May 1929, Pauli left the Roman Catholic Church. In December of that year, he married Käthe Margarethe Deppner. The marriage was an unhappy one, ending in divorce in 1930 after less than a year. He married again in 1934 to Franziska Bertram (1901&amp;ndash;1987). They had no children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15044">The status of '''women in the patristic age''', as defined by the [[Church Fathers]], is a contentious issue within [[Christianity]] because the [[patristic]] writers clearly sought to restrict the influence of women in civil society as well as in the life of the Church. 

The patristic era, which extends roughly from 150 AD to 500 AD, was arguably harsher than the [[women in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] themselves in attributing social roles to women, hence the expression ''[[patriarchy]]'' used by modern-day feminists.

==Anthropological perspectives==

===Aristotle's views on women===
{{Main|Aristotle's views on women}}
[[Aristotle]] believed that women are colder than men and thus a lower form of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lovejoy, Arthur|title=The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1964|isbn=978-0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assumption carried forward unexamined to [[Galen]] and others until the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Tuana&gt;{{cite book|author=Tuana, Nancy|title=The Less Noble Sex: Scientific, Religious and Philosophical Conceptions of Women's Nature|year=1993|pages=21, 169|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-36098-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male activity and female passivity===
In the classical age, which shaped patristic views, male sexuality and power were closely associated, and female sexuality was associated with passivity. Church Fathers opposed to practice of independent female ascetism because it threatened to emancipate women from men. To take one's pleasure was to be virile, to accept it servile.&lt;ref&gt;Church Fathers, Independent Virgins, by Joyce E. Salisbury, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical roles==

Throughout the [[Patristic]] age, women held a variety of positions in Church office and performed [[ecclesiastical]] duties. Despite recurrent opposition of women in office by various Councils and Church fathers like [[Tertullian]], women were influential in shaping the hierarchy of Christianity.&lt;ref name=OrdainedWomenintheEarlyChurch &gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Madigan |editor1-first=Kevin |editor2-last=Osiek |editor2-first=Carolyn |date=2005 |title= Ordained Women in the Early Church |location= Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0801879326}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 6th century, the Church officially recognized three orders of women: [[deaconess]]es, widows and virgins.&lt;ref name="Ministers of Grace"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Judith |date=1989 |title=Ministers of Grace |location=Middlegreen, England |publisher=St. Paul Publications |isbn=978-0854392988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving evidence also suggests the existence of female [[presbyters]] and even [[bishops]], the extent of which is unclear because of the scarcity of remaining records.&lt;ref name=WomenOfficeholdersinEarlyChristianity&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisen |first=Ute E. |date=2000 |title=Women Officeholders in Early Christianity |location=Collegeville, Minnesota |publisher=The Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0-8146-5950-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaconesses===
In the Eastern Church, women were being [[ordained]] as deaconesses from the 3rd century to at least the 7th century, from [[Armenia]] to [[Gaul]].&lt;ref name=OrdainedWomenintheEarlyChurch /&gt; By the 3rd century, the office of deaconesses was well attested by the ''[[Didascalia Apostolorum]]''.&lt;ref name="The Didascalia Apostolorum in English"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunlop Gibson |first=Margaret |date=2011 |title= The Didascalia Apostolorum in English |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108018975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office was further classified in the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] as well as the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] of the 4th century in which the ordination ceremony for the deaconess is outlined, confirming its place as an order supported by the Church.&lt;ref name=TheRoleofWomeninEarlyChristianity &gt;{{cite book |last=LaPorte |first=Jean |date=1982 |title=The Role of Women in Early Christianity |location=New York |publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press |isbn=978-0889465497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for female deacons in the West emerges in the 5th century but few inscriptions survive as a result of several [[synods]]’ efforts to eliminate them.&lt;ref name=OrdainedWomenintheEarlyChurch /&gt; The female [[diaconate]] in the West certainly existed, though was not widely accepted. Moreover, it was subject to local interpretations and was often confused with the order of widows.&lt;ref name=WhenWomenWerePriests&gt;{{cite book |last=Torjesen |first=Karen Jo |date=1995 |title=When Women Were Priests |location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0060686611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the role of the deaconess was [[liturgical]] in nature, it remained limited to duties considered improper for a male to perform, such as instructing women, assisting women in disrobing and [[anointing]] their body in the holy rite of [[baptism]].&lt;ref name="Women Churches"&gt;{{cite book |last=Witherington |first=Ben |date=1988 |title=Women in the Earliest Churches |location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521346481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widows and Virgins===
By the early 3rd century, the qualification for the office of widows was well established and its duties were clearly outlined in various [[Ancient Church Orders|Church Orders]]. Some inscriptions, such as The [[Apostolic Tradition]] reveal that widows were to be ecclesiastically enrolled, but not ordained. Others, like the [[Testamentum Domini]] explicitly state that widows were to have an ordained office, with duties surpassing the usual service of prayer.&lt;ref name=TheRoleofWomeninEarlyChristianity /&gt; Regardless of the status they were granted, the Church irrefutably held widows in high esteem. In contrast, virgins were not considered church offices, nor were they appointed by ordination.&lt;ref name=WomenOfficeholdersinEarlyChristianity /&gt; In some areas however, they were considered members of the [[clergy]] and part of the ecclesiastical order, like those of Tertullian’s [[Carthage]] and other African congregations.&lt;ref name=WhenWomenWerePriests /&gt;

===Presbyters===
Repeated attempts were made by councils to eliminate the order of female presbyters. Their existence, albeit small in quantity, is indicated through epigraphical and literary evidence.&lt;ref name=WomenOfficeholdersinEarlyChristianity /&gt; Documented incidences of female presbyters are limited, with records suggesting they were most common in the [[Montanist]] movement in the East and the [[Priscillianism|Priscillianist]] movement in the West. Although both movements were later deemed [[heretical]], evidence also exists to support the presence of female presbyters within the “orthodox” Church. A letter from [[Pope Gelasius I|Pope Gelasius]] from the end of the 5th century acknowledges their [[sacerdotal]] duties in Southern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]], whose communities and bishops evidently accepted these positions. Some argue that perhaps their governing role in communities as presbyters assigned women the authority to teach and exercise [[Sacrament|sacramental]] and liturgical functions.&lt;ref name=WomenOfficeholdersinEarlyChristianity /&gt; Nevertheless, the precise responsibilities of female presbyters remains largely unclear.&lt;ref name=OrdainedWomenintheEarlyChurch/&gt;

===Bishops===
The early Church largely succeeded in excluding women from this office. Despite this, some Christian groups like the Montanists did appoint women as bishops. Latin inscriptions from Italy and [[Dalmatia]] certainly suggest their presence there as bishops in the 5th and 6th centuries.&lt;ref name=WomenOfficeholdersinEarlyChristianity /&gt; As a result of sparse epigraphical evidence, it is arguable whether women exercised the role of bishop in other areas and Christian groups.

==Image of women as seen by theologians==

===Woman as the root of all evil===
Tertullian's views on women went further: "The curse God pronounced on your sex still weighs on the world. …You are the devil's gateway…. You are the first that deserted the divine laws. All too easily you destroyed the image of God, [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]. Because you deserved death, it was the son of God who had to die".&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, "[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Tertullian: Part Fourth/On the Apparel of Women|On Women's Clothing]]", 1:1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerome|St Jerome]], the well known Biblical scholar and translator of the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate) had a simple view of women. To him "woman is the root of all evil."&lt;ref name="Phelips p203"&gt;Phelips, The Churches and Modern Thought: p203&lt;/ref&gt; Like most early Christian theologians, Jerome glorified virginity and looked down on marriage. His reasoning was also rooted in Genesis: "Eve in paradise was a virgin ... understand that virginity is natural and that marriage comes after the Fall."&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Honest to Man: p120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Firmilian]] tells of a woman who went into an ecstasy and came out a prophetess. "That woman who first through marvels or deceptions of the demons did many things to deceive the faithful, among other things... she dared to do this, namely that by an impressive invocation she feigned she was sanctifying bread, and offering a sacrifice to the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;In Epistle 75. 1-5 to Cyprian,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women as the weaker sex===
[[John Chrysostom]], bishop of [[Constantinople]] at the beginning of the 5th century, said of biblical women that they "were great characters, great women and admirable…. Yet did they in no case outstrip the men, but occupied the second rank" ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf113.iii.iv.xiv.html ''Epistle to the Ephesians'', Homily 13]). Commenting on {{Bibleref2|1Timothy|2:11-15||1 Timothy 2:11-15}}, 

Chrysostom said that "the male sex enjoyed the higher honor. Man was first formed; and elsewhere he shows their superiority…. He wishes the man to have the preeminence in every way." Of women he said that "The woman taught once, and ruined all. On this account therefore he saith, let her not teach. But what is it to other women, that she suffered this? It certainly concerns them; for the sex is weak and fickle, and he is speaking of the sex collectively." ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf113.v.iii.x.html ''1 Timothy'', Homily 9]).

[[Augustine]] elevated the contempt of women and sex to a level unsurpassed before. To him, women's inferiority to men was so obvious&lt;ref&gt;Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p55&lt;/ref&gt; that he felt that he had to ask the question: "Why was woman created at all".&lt;ref name="Phelips p203"/&gt; He concluded that woman was created purely for procreation and for nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p77&lt;/ref&gt; The expulsion of Adam and Eve from paradise, according to him, was purely the fault of Eve.&lt;ref&gt;Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women as creatures of lust===
[[Gregory of Nazianzus]], the Bishop of Constantinople had this to say about women, "Fierce is the dragon and cunning the asp; But women have the malice of both."

According to the theologian [[Origen]], women are worse than animals because they are continuously full of lust.&lt;ref&gt;Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p51-52&lt;/ref&gt; Origen does not approve of the sexual act even in marriage and taught that although widowers can remarry, they are by no means crowned for this.&lt;ref name="Phelips p203"/&gt; He also argued in his commentary on {{Bibleref2|1Corinthians|14:34-35||1 Corinthians 14:34-35}} that female prophets never spoke publicly in the assembly.&lt;ref name="Weinrich"&gt;{{Cite book|author=William Weinrich|contribution=Women in the History of the Church|title=Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood|editor=[[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] and [[Wayne Grudem]] (eds.)|publisher=Crossway 1991|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[Clement of Alexandria]] had such a contempt for women that he believed such a feeling must be universal. He wrote, in his book Paedagogus that in women, "the consciousness of their own nature must evoke feelings of shame".  He also suggested that women should also fetch from the pantry things that we need.&lt;ref&gt;Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p127,130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory of Nyssa]] taught that the sexual act was an outcome of the fall and that marriage is the outcome of sin.&lt;ref name="Phelips p203"/&gt;

==Specific prohibitions against female demands==

===Council of Elvira===
The c. 4th century [[council of Elvira]] made some canons (church law) restricting women concerning divorce, adultery and abortion:
* Canon 8: ''Women who have left their husbands for no prior cause and have joined themselves with others, may not even at death receive communion.''
* Canon 9: ''A woman of the faith who has left an adulterous husband of the faith and marries another, her marrying in this manner is prohibited. If she has so married, she may not at any more receive communion—unless he that she has left has since departed from this world.''
* Canon 63: ''If a woman conceives in adultery and then has an abortion, she may not commune again, even as death approaches, because she has sinned twice.''

===Infanticide===
In his First Apology [[Justin Martyr]] cautioned that it was wicked to dispose of children through exposure to the elements, given that almost all those who are exposed were raised to prostitution.&lt;ref name=Infanticide&gt;[http://www.infanticide.org/history.htm A Brief History of Infanticide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martyr"&gt;Martyr, Justin. "First Apology" - Chapter XXVII Guilt of exposing children&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===
Justin also added a warning against consorting with prostitutes because it was possible that one "may possibly be having intercourse with his own child, or relative, or brother" unknowingly, due to the practice of infant exposure.&lt;ref name=Infanticide/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martyr"/&gt;

==Women in heretical movements==
A number of minority movements, deemed [[heresy|heretical]] by the wider church, gave a more prominent place to the ministry of women and in some cases allowed them to participate in the priestly ministry. These include [[Montanism]] in the 2nd and 3rd century, the [[Quintillians]] and [[Collyridians]] in the 4th century, and [[Priscillianism]] in the 4th century. These heretical sects provided occasion for the institutional church to condemn the ecclesiastical ministry of women.&lt;ref name="Weinrich"/&gt;&lt;!-- Indeed, the [[Synod of Mâcon]] (585) found it necessary to spend much of their time fiercely debating the question of whether women have souls, and whether they were even human at all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} THIS IS APPARENTLY A MYTH ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE SOURCES. NONE FOUND TO SUPPORT THIS ALLEGATION--&gt;

The '''World League for Sexual Reform''' was a League for coordinating policy reforms related to greater openness around sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive for Sexology|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/WLSR.HTM |website=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|accessdate=28 May 2018|date= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110115073920/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/WLSR.HTM |archive-date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization advocated a ten-point platform which included:

# Economic, political, and sexual equality of men and women
# Secularization and reform of laws on marriage and divorce
# Birth control to make birth voluntary and responsible
# Eugenic birth selection
# Protection of unmarried mothers and "illegitimate children"
# Rational understanding of intersex people and homosexuals.
# Comprehensive sex education
# Reforms to eliminate the dangers of prostitution
# Treating sexual abnormalities medically, rather than "as crimes, vices or sins"
# Legalization of sexual acts between consenting adults, while criminalizing sexual acts without consent, or acts upon minors and the mentally disabled. Distinguishing crime from vice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GIF/XWLSR_PL.JPG|title=Principal Points of the League's Platform|last=Weltliga für Sexualreform|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122131239/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GIF/XWLSR_PL.JPG|archive-date=November 22, 2011|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] organised the First Congress for Sexual Reform, which led to the formation of the League. Ralf Dose has written an overview of the League.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Dose, "The World League for Sexual Reform: Some Possible Approaches", ''Journal for the History of Sexuality'' 12:1, pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Congresses were held in [[Copenhagen]] (1928), [[London]] (1929), [[Vienna]] (1930), and [[Brno]] (1932).  Congress speakers included: [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Norman Haire]], [[Vera Brittain]], [[Dora Russell]],&lt;ref name="asn"&gt;Jonathan Croall, ''Neill of Summerhill: The Permanent Rebel''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 1983 {{ISBN|0710093004}}, (p. 173).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Vickery Drysdale]] (from the [[Malthusian League]]), [[Stella Browne]], [[Ernst Gräfenberg]], [[Marie Stopes]], M. D. Eder (a pioneer psychiatrist), [[Laurence Housman]], [[George Cecil Ives|George Ives]], [[Eden Paul]], Felix Abraham (who with Dr Levy-Lenz performed the world’s first sex-change operation in 1931 at Hirschfeld’s [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] in Berlin), [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ethel Mannin]],&lt;ref name="asn" /&gt; [[Harry Benjamin]], [[Peter Schmidt (artist)|Peter Schmidt]], William J. Robinson (an American contraception crusader) and [[Jack Flügel]], a Freudian psychologist who assisted [[Norman Haire]] and [[Dora Russell]] organize the Congress and also led the Men's Dress Reform Party.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Burman, "Better and Brighter Clothes; The Men's Dress Reform Party, 1929–1940". ''Journal of Design History'', vol 8, no 4, 1995, pp. 275–290.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a speaker, [[Albert Einstein]] was in contact with the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Calaprice, ''The Ultimate Quotable Einstein''. Princeton University Press, 2011, (p. 413) {{ISBN|0691138176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 [[Francis Turville-Petre]], British archaeologist and friend of [[Christopher Isherwood]], stayed at Hirschfeld's [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft|Institute of Sexual Research]] in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Berlin]]. Whilst based in Berlin, Turville-Petre was an active member of the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee|Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], which campaigned for [[LGBT social movements|gay legal reform and tolerance]], and attended the Second Congress in [[Copenhagen]] in 1928.

In 1929 [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] presided over the third international congress held at [[Wigmore Hall]], London.&lt;ref name=Times1&gt;[[The Times]], ''League For Sexual Reform International Congress Opened'', 9 September 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harley Street]] [[sexologist]], [[Norman Haire]] as secretary and [[Dora Russell]] as treasurer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newscategoryid=1&amp;newsstoryid=10678|title=News - The University of Sydney|website=Sydney.edu.au|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; jointly organized the event.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Crozier, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3704509 "All the World's a Stage": Dora Russell, Norman Haire, and the 1929 London World League for Sexual Reform Congress], ''Journal for the History of Sexuality'' 12:1 (Jan. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s speech praised British scientists as "distinguished pioneers in eugenics".&lt;ref name=Times1/&gt; A number of British feminists attended the 1929 conference, including [[Naomi Mitchison]] (whose paper was "Some Comment on the Use of Contraceptives by Intelligent Persons"), [[Dora Russell]] ("Marriage and Freedom"), Janet Chance, a pioneer of abortion-law reform ("A Marriage Education Centre in London"), [[Vera Brittain]], a writer and pacifist ("The Failure of Monogamy") and [[Stella Browne]] ("The Right to Abortion").&lt;ref&gt;Lesley A.

In 1932, the fourth international conference of the WLSR was organized and hosted by [[Hugo Iltis]] in Brno. Plans for a fifth conference in Moscow were scrubbed because of the political stresses caused by the growing power of [[Hitler]] and [[Stalin]].&lt;ref name="sk"&gt;Britta McEwen, ''Sexual Knowledge: Feeling, Fact, and Social Reform in Vienna, 1900–1934''. Berghahn Books, 2012, {{ISBN|0857453386}}, (pp. 175–177, 193).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the WLSR's books and records were destroyed by the Nazis during a raid in Berlin on the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] in May 1933.&lt;ref name="sk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Blunt, Jane Wills ''Dissident Geographies: An Introduction to Radical Ideas and Practice''.
