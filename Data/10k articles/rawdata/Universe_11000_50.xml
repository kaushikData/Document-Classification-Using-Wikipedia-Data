A '''briquette''' (or '''briquet''') is a compressed block of coal dust&lt;ref&gt;"briquette, n. 2.". ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[combustible]] [[biomass]] material such as charcoal, sawdust, wood chips,&lt;ref&gt;"briquette." ''American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language'', 5th. ed.. 2011. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company 15 Mar. 2015 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/briquette&lt;/ref&gt; peat, or paper used for [[fuel]] and kindling to start a [[Combustion|fire]]. The term comes from the French language and is related to ''brick''.

== Coal briquettes ==
[[File:Braunkohle_als_Hausbrand.jpg|thumb|Coal briquette]]
[[File:Rekord_Brikett.jpg|thumb|Coal briquette]]
[[Coal]] briquettes have long been produced as a means of using up '[[small coal]]', the finely broken coal inevitably produced during the [[coal mining|mining]] process. Otherwise this is difficult to burn as it is both hard to arrange adequate airflow through a fire of these small pieces, also it tended to be drawn up and out of the chimney by the [[chimney draught|draught]], giving visible black smoke.

The first briquettes were known as [[culm (coal)|culm]] and were hand-moulded with a little wet [[clay]] as a binder. These could be difficult to burn efficiently, as the unburned clay produced a large ash content, blocking airflow through a grate.

With Victorian developments in engineering, particularly the [[hydraulic press]], it became possible to produce machine-made briquettes with minimal binder content. A [[tar]] or [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] binder was used, obtained first from [[town gas|gas making]] and later from petrochemical sources. These binders burned away completely, making it a low-ash fuel. A proprietary brand of briquettes from the [[South Wales coalfield]] was Phurnacite, developed by [[Powell Duffryn]].&lt;ref name="Phurnacite, Briquettes" &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=The Phurnacite plant, the briquette
  |website=Aberdare Online
  |url=http://www.aberdareonline.co.uk/history/phurnacite-plant-abercwmboi/phurnacite-plant-briquette
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were intended to emulate a high-quality [[anthracite]] coal, such as that from the [[Cynheidre Colliery|Cynheidre]] measures. This involved blending a mixture of coals from different grades and colliery sources. Phurnacite used the following mix:&lt;ref name="Phurnacite, Briquettes" /&gt;
* [[Bituminous coal]], 25%
* [[Steam coal]], 45%
*  Dry steam coal, 22%
*  Pitch, 8%

Early briquettes were large and brick-shaped. They could be stacked, or even built into walls. The [[Nimrod Expedition|Antarctic expedition]]s of both [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] and [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott]] took large quantities of these briquettes with them and used them to build pony stables. As the ponies were eaten, as planned, for food, the stables could be dismantled and used for fuel.&lt;ref name="Phurnacite, Briquettes" /&gt; Phurnacite briquettes later adopted a squared oval shape. This regular shape packed well as a good firebed, with plentiful airflow. They are also easy to mechanically feed, allowing the development of automatically controlled heating boilers that could run for days without human intervention.

Some briquettes are compressed and dried [[lignite|brown coal]] extruded into hard blocks. This is a common technique for [[coal rank|low rank]] coals. They are typically dried to 12-18% moisture, and are primarily used in household and industry.

== East-Asian briquettes ==

Home made charcoal briquettes (called ''[[:ja:ç­å£|Tadon]]'') were found after charcoal production in Japanese history. In the [[Edo period]], polysaccharide extracted from [[red algae]] was widely used as a binder. After the imports of steam engines in the [[Meiji period]], coal and clay became major ingredients of Japanese briquettes. These briquettes,''[[:ja:ç·´ç­|Rentan]]'' and ''[[:ja:è±ç­|Mametan]]'' , were exported to [[China]] and [[Korea]]. Today, coal briquettes are avoided for their [[sulfur oxide]] emission. Charcoal briquettes are still used for traditional or outdoor cooking. Woody flakes such as [[sawdust]] or coffee dust are major ingredients of modern mass-consumed briquettes (e.g. ''[[:ja:ãªã¬ç­|Ogatan]]'').

==Use in China==
[[File:Fuel cylinders 01.jpg|thumb|150px|Fuel briquettes, called ''mei'' (coal ç¤), sold throughout [[People's Republic of China|China]]]]
Throughout China, cylindrical briquettes, called ''"fÄng wÅ mÃ©i"'' (beehive coal èçª©ç¤ / èçªç¤) or ''"Mei"'' (coal ç¤) or ''"liÃ n tÃ n"'' (kneaded coal ç·´ç­ / ç»ç­), are used in purpose-built cookers.

The origin of ''"Mei"'' is ''"[[:ja:ç·´ç­|Rentan]]"'' (kneaded coal ç·´ç­) of Japan. ''Rentan'' was invented in Japan in the 19th century, and spread to [[Manchukuo]], Korea and China in the first half of the 20th century. There were many ''Rentan'' factories in Manchukuo and [[Pyongyang]]. Although ''Rentan'' went out of use in Japan after the 1970s, it is still popular in China and [[Vietnam]] (''"than"'' coal).

The cookers are simple, ceramic vessels with metal exteriors. Two types are made: the single, or triple briquette type, the latter holding the briquettes together side by side. These cookers can accommodate a double stack of cylinders. A small fire of tinder is started, upon which the cylinder(s) is placed. When a cylinder is spent, another cylinder is placed on top using special tongs, with the one below igniting it. The fire can be maintained by swapping spent cylinders for fresh ones, and retaining a still-glowing spent cylinder.

Each cylinder lasts for over an hour. These cookers are used to cook, or simmer, pots of tea, eggs, soups, stews, etc.
The cylinders are delivered, usually by cart, to businesses, and are very inexpensive.

==Peat briquettes==
[[File:Bsc_puzolana.jpg|thumb|upright|Peat block]]
In [[Ireland]], [[peat]] briquettes are a common type of [[solid fuel]], largely replacing [[peat cutting|sod]]s of raw peat as a domestic fuel. These briquettes consist of shredded peat, compressed to form a virtually smokeless, slow-burning, easily stored and transported fuel. Although often used as the sole fuel for a fire, they are also used to quickly and easily light a coal fire.

==Biomass briquettes==
[[File:Straw-hay-briquettes.jpg|thumb|Straw or hay briquettes]]
[[File:Heubrikett.jpg|thumb|Biomass briquette]]
{{main|Biomass briquettes}}
Biomass briquettes are made from agricultural waste and are a replacement for [[fossil fuel]]s such as oil or coal, and can be used to heat boilers in manufacturing plants, and also have applications in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Biomass briquettes are a renewable source of energy and avoid adding fossil carbon to the atmosphere.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}

A number of companies in India have switched from furnace oil to biomass briquettes to save costs on boiler fuels. The use of biomass briquettes is predominant in the southern parts of India, where coal and furnace oil are being replaced by biomass briquettes. A number of units in [[Maharashtra]] (India) are also using biomass briquettes as boiler fuel. Use of biomass briquettes can earn Carbon Credits for reducing emissions in the atmosphere. Lanxess India and a few other large companies are supposedly using biomass briquettes for earning Carbon Credits by switching their boiler fuel. Biomass briquettes also provide more calorific value/kg and save around 30-40 percent of boiler fuel costs.

A popular biomass briquette emerging in developed countries takes a waste produce such as sawdust, compresses it and then extrudes it to make a reconstituted log that can replace firewood.  It is a similar process to forming a wood pellet but on a larger scale.  There are no binders involved in this process.  The natural [[lignin]] in the wood binds the particles of wood together to form a solid. Burning a wood briquette is far more efficient than burning firewood.  Moisture content of a briquette can be as low as 4%, whereas green firewood may be as high as 65%.

For example, parameters of fuel briquettes made by [[extrusion]] from sawdust in [[Ukraine]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Parameter !! Value
|-
| Briquette density, t/mÂ³ || 1.0-1.2
|-
| [[Heat content]], MJ/kg || 19.3-20.5
|-
| Ash content, % || 0.5-1.5
|}
&lt;small&gt;(MJ = Megajoules.  3.6 MJ equals 1 kWh.)&lt;/small&gt;

The extrusion production technology of briquettes is the process of extrusion screw wastes (straw, sunflower husks, buckwheat, etc.) or finely shredded wood waste (sawdust) under high pressure when heated from {{convert|160|to|350|C}}. As shown in the table above the quality of such briquets, especially heat content, is much higher comparing with other methods like using piston presses.

Sawdust briquettes have developed over time with two distinct types: those with holes through the centre, and those that are solid.  Both types are classified as briquettes but are formed using different techniques.  A solid briquette is manufactured using a piston press that compresses sandwiched layers of sawdust together. Briquettes with a hole are produced with a screw press.  The hole is from the screw thread passing through the centre, but it also increases the surface area of the log and aids efficient [[combustion]].

==Paper briquettes==
Paper briquettes are the byproduct of a briquettor, which compresses shredded paper material into a small cylindrical form. Briquettors are often sold as add-on systems to existing disintegrator or rotary knife mill shredding systems. The NSA has a maximum particle size regulation for shredded paper material that is passed through a disintegrator or rotary knife mill, which typically does not exceed 1/8â square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/Government/MDG/NSA_CSS_EPL_02_02_P.pdf NSA Standards for Disintegrators]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that material exiting a disintegrator is the appropriate size for compression into paper briquettes, as opposed to strip-cut shredders which produce long sheets of paper.

After being processed through the disintegrator, paper particles are typically passed through an air system to remove dust and unwanted magnetic materials before being sent into the briquettor. The air system may also be responsible for regulating moisture content in the waste particles, as briquetting works optimally within a certain range of moisture. Studies have shown that the optimal moisture percentage for shredded particles is 18% for paper and 22% for wheat straw.&lt;ref&gt;Physical properties of briquettes from waste paper and wheat straw mixtures [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890498001113]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental impact ===
Briquetted paper has many notable benefits, many of which minimize the impact of the paper waste generated by a shredding system. Several manufactures claim up to 90% volume reduction of briquetted paper waste versus traditional shredding. Decreasing the volume of shredded waste allows it to be transported and stored more efficiently, reducing the cost and fuel required in the disposal process.

In addition to the cost savings associated with reducing the volume of waste, paper briquettes are more useful in paper mills to create recycled paper than uncompressed shredded material. Compressed briquettes can also be used as a fuel for starting fires or as an insulating material.

==Safety==
Charcoal burners should not be used in enclosed environments to heat homes, as [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-died-from-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-after-using-heat-beads-in-greystanes-home-20150718-gif8d8.html|title=Man died from carbon monoxide poisoning after using 'heat beads' in Greystanes home|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12622">In the [[solid-state physics]] of [[semiconductor]]s, '''carrier generation''' and '''radiative recombination''' are processes by which mobile [[charge carrier]]s ([[electron]]s and [[electron hole]]s) are created and eliminated. Carrier generation and recombination processes are fundamental to the operation of many [[optoelectronics|optoelectronic]] [[semiconductor device]]s, such as [[photodiode]]s, [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s and [[laser diode]]s. They are also critical to a full analysis of [[p-n junction]] devices such as [[BJT]]s and p-n junction [[diode]]s.

The '''electronâhole pair''' is the fundamental unit of generation and recombination, corresponding to an electron transitioning between the valence band and the conduction band where generation of electron is a transition from the valence band to the conduction band and recombination leads to a reverse transition.

==Band structure==
Like other solids, semiconductor materials have an [[electronic band structure]] determined by the crystal properties of the material. The actual energy distribution among the electrons is described by the [[Fermi level]] and the [[temperature]] of the electrons. At [[absolute zero]] temperature, all of the electrons have energy below the Fermi level; but at non-zero temperatures the energy levels are filled following a Boltzmann distribution.

[[Image:Electronic band diagram.svg|thumb|375px|Electronic band structure of a semiconductor material.]]In undoped semiconductors the Fermi level lies in the middle of a ''forbidden band'' or [[band gap]] between two ''allowed bands'' called the ''[[valence band]]'' and the ''[[conduction band]]''. The valence band, immediately below the forbidden band, is normally very nearly completely occupied. The conduction band, above the Fermi level, is normally nearly completely empty. Because the valence band is so nearly full, its electrons are not mobile, and cannot flow as electric current.

However, if an electron in the valence band acquires enough energy to reach the conduction band, it can flow freely among the nearly empty conduction band energy states. Furthermore, it will also leave behind an electron hole that can flow as current exactly like a physical charged particle. Carrier ''generation'' describes processes by which electrons gain energy and move from the valence band to the conduction band, producing two mobile carriers; while ''recombination'' describes processes by which a conduction band electron loses energy and re-occupies the energy state of an electron hole in the valence band.

In a material at [[thermal equilibrium]] generation and recombination are balanced, so that the net [[charge carrier]] density remains constant. The equilibrium carrier density that results from the balance of these interactions is predicted by [[thermodynamics]]. The resulting probability of occupation of energy states in each energy band is given by [[FermiâDirac statistics]].

===Generation and recombination processes===
Carrier generation and recombination occur when an [[electron]] makes transition from the valence band to conduction band in a semiconductor, as a result of interaction with other [[electron]]s, [[Electron hole|holes]], [[photon]]s, or the [[Phonon|vibrating crystal lattice itself]].  These processes must conserve both quantized energy and momentum, and the [[Phonon|vibrating lattice]] plays a large role in conserving momentum as, in collisions, [[photon]]s can transfer very little momentum in relation to their energy.

Recombination and generation are always happening in semiconductors, both optically and thermally, and their rates are in balance at equilibrium.  The product of the electron and hole densities (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) is a constant &lt;math&gt;(n_o p_o=n_i^2)&lt;/math&gt; '''at equilibrium''', maintained by recombination and generation occurring at equal rates.  When there is a surplus of carriers (i.e., &lt;math&gt;n p&gt;n_i^2&lt;/math&gt;), the rate of recombination becomes greater than the rate of generation, driving the system back towards equilibrium.  Likewise, when there is a deficit of carriers (i.e., &lt;math&gt;n p&lt;n_i^2&lt;/math&gt;), the generation rate becomes greater than the recombination rate, again driving the system back towards equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/LED.2014.2345058 | volume=35 | issue=10 | title=Optically Excited MOS-Capacitor for Recombination Lifetime Measurement | year=2014 | journal=IEEE Electron Device Letters | pages=986â988 | last1 = Elhami Khorasani | first1 = Arash | last2 = Schroder | first2 = Dieter K. | last3 = Alford | first3 = T. L.| bibcode=2014IEDL...35..986K }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the electron moves from one energy band to another, the energy and momentum that it has lost or gained must go to or come from the other particles involved in the process (e.g. [[photon]]s, [[electron]], or the [[Phonon|system of vibrating lattice atoms]]).  The following models are used to describe generation and recombination, depending on which particles are involved in the process.

[[File:diffusion center.gif|thumb|350px|right|The following image shows change in excess carriers being generated (green:electrons and purple:holes) with increasing light intensity (Generation rate /cm3) at the center of an intrinsic semiconductor bar. Electrons have higher diffusion constant than holes leading to fewer excess electrons at the center as compared to holes.]]

=== ShockleyâReadâHall (SRH) process ===
In ''Shockley-Read-Hall recombination'', also called ''trap-assisted recombination'', the electron in transition between bands passes through a new energy state (localized state) created within the band gap by an impurity in the lattice; such energy states are called [[deep-level trap]]s. The localized state can absorb differences in [[momentum]] between the carriers, and so this process is the dominant generation and recombination process in [[silicon]] and other [[direct and indirect band gaps|indirect bandgap]] materials. It can also dominate in [[direct and indirect band gaps|direct bandgap]] materials under conditions of very low [[charge carrier density|carrier densities]] (very low level injection). The energy is exchanged in the form of lattice vibration, a [[phonon]] exchanging thermal energy with the material. The process is named after [[William Shockley]], [[William Thornton Read]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shockley|first1=W.|last2=Read|first2=W. T.|title=Statistics of the Recombinations of Holes and Electrons|journal=Physical Review|date=1 September 1952|volume=87|issue=5|pages=835â842|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.87.835|bibcode = 1952PhRv...87..835S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert N. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=R.N.|title=Germanium rectifier characteristics|journal=Physical Review|date=1951|volume=83|issue=1|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radiative recombination ===
During ''radiative recombination'', a form of [[spontaneous emission]], a [[photon]] is emitted with the wavelength corresponding to the energy released. This effect is the basis of [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]]. Because the photon carries relatively little [[momentum]], radiative recombination is significant only in [[direct bandgap]] materials.

When photons are present in the material, they can either be [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]], generating a pair of free carriers, or they can ''stimulate'' a recombination event, resulting in a generated photon with similar properties to the one responsible for the event. Absorption is the active process in [[photodiode]]s, [[solar cell]]s, and other semiconductor [[photodetector]]s, while [[stimulated emission]] is responsible for laser action in [[laser diode]]s.

In thermal equilibrium the radiative recombination &lt;math&gt;R_r&lt;/math&gt; and thermal generation rate &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; equal each other&lt;ref name="sheng-p140"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|date=2006|editor-last=Li|editor-first=Sheng S.|title=Semiconductor Physical Electronics|journal=|language=en-gb|volume=|pages=140|doi=10.1007/0-387-37766-2|isbn=978-0-387-28893-2|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1066014|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
R_r = G_0 = B_r n_0 p_0 = B_r n_i^2 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;B_r&lt;/math&gt; is called the radiative capture probability and &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; the intrinsic carrier density.

Under steady-state conditions the radiative recombination rate &lt;math&gt;r_r&lt;/math&gt; and resulting net recombination rate &lt;math&gt;U_r&lt;/math&gt; are&lt;ref name="sheng-p140"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
r_r = B_r n p 
  \,, \quad
  U_r = r_r-G_0 = B_r \left( np-n_i^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where the carrier densities &lt;math&gt;n,p&lt;/math&gt; are made up of equilibrium &lt;math&gt;n_0, p_0&lt;/math&gt; and excess densities &lt;math&gt;\Delta n, \Delta p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
n = n_0 + \Delta n \,, \quad p = p_0 + \Delta p \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
The radiative lifetime &lt;math&gt;\tau_r&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref name="sheng-p140"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\tau_r = \frac{\Delta n}{U_r} = \frac{1}{B_r \left( n_0 + p_0 + \Delta n \right)} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Auger recombination ===
In ''Auger recombination'' the energy is given to a third carrier, which is excited to a higher energy level without moving to another energy band. 
After the interaction, the third carrier normally loses its excess energy to thermal vibrations. 
Since this process is a three-particle interaction, it is normally only significant in non-equilibrium conditions when the carrier density is very high. 
The [[Auger effect]] process is not easily produced, because the third particle would have to begin the process in the unstable high-energy state.

In thermal equilibrium the Auger recombination &lt;math&gt;R_A&lt;/math&gt; and thermal generation rate &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; equal each other&lt;ref name="sheng-p143"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|date=2006|editor-last=Li|editor-first=Sheng S.|title=Semiconductor Physical Electronics|journal=|language=en-gb|volume=|pages=143|doi=10.1007/0-387-37766-2|isbn=978-0-387-28893-2|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1066014|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_n,C_p&lt;/math&gt; are the Auger capture probabilities.

The non-equilibrium Auger recombination rate &lt;math&gt;r_A&lt;/math&gt; and resulting net recombination rate &lt;math&gt;U_A&lt;/math&gt; under steady-state conditions are&lt;ref name="sheng-p143"/&gt;

  \,, \quad
  U_A = r_A-G_0 = C_n \left( n^2p-n_0^2 p_0 \right) + C_p \left( np^2- n_0 p_0^2 \right) \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

The Auger lifetime &lt;math&gt;\tau_A&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|date=2006|editor-last=Li|editor-first=Sheng S.|title=Semiconductor Physical Electronics|journal=|language=en-gb|volume=|pages=144|doi=10.1007/0-387-37766-2|isbn=978-0-387-28893-2|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1066014|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Auger recombination in LEDs ====
The mechanism causing [[Light-emitting diode#Efficiency droop|LED efficiency droop]] was identified in 2007 as Auger recombination, which met with a mixed reaction.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;Stevenson, Richard (August 2009) [http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/the-leds-dark-secret The LEDâs Dark Secret: Solid-state lighting won't supplant the lightbulb until it can overcome the mysterious malady known as droop]. IEEE Spectrum&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, an experimental study claimed to have identified Auger recombination as the cause of efficiency droop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justin Iveland |author2=Lucio Martinelli |author3=Jacques Peretti |author4=James S. Speck |author5=Claude Weisbuch. |title=Cause of LED Efficiency Droop Finally Revealed|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130423102328.htm|website=Physical Review Letters, 2013|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains disputed whether the amount of Auger loss found in this study is sufficient to explain the droop. Other frequently quoted evidence against Auger as the main droop causing mechanism is the low-temperature dependence of this mechanism which is opposite to that found for the drop.

The '''Christmas 1994 nor'easter''' was an intense [[cyclone]] along the [[East Coast of the United States]] and [[Atlantic Canada]]. It developed from an area of [[low-pressure area|low pressure]] in the southeast [[Gulf of Mexico]] near the [[Florida Keys]], and moved across the state of [[Florida]]. As it entered the warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]] in the Atlantic Ocean, it began to rapidly intensify, exhibiting traits of a [[tropical cyclone|tropical system]], including the formation of an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. It attained a pressure of 970&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|millibars]] on December 23 and 24, and after moving northward, it came ashore near New York City on Christmas Eve. Because of the uncertain nature of the storm, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone.

Heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in [[South Carolina]]. Much of the rest of the East Coast was affected by high winds, coastal flooding, and [[beach erosion]]. [[New York (state)|New York]] State and [[New England]] bore the brunt of the storm; damage was extensive on [[Long Island]], and in [[Connecticut]], 130,000&amp;nbsp;households lost electric power during the storm. Widespread damage and power outages also occurred throughout [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], where the storm generated {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} waves along the coast. Because of the warm weather pattern that contributed to the storm's development, precipitation was limited to rain. Two people were killed, and damage amounted to at least $21&amp;nbsp;million.

==Meteorological history==
[[File:Nor'easter 1994-12-21 weather map.jpg|left|thumb|A map of the developing storm on December 21|alt=A map depicting a storm near Florida]]
The storm originated in an upper-level [[low-pressure area|low pressure system]] that moved southeastward from the central [[Great Plains]] into the [[Deep South]] of the United States. After reaching the southeast Gulf of Mexico, the disturbance underwent [[cyclogenesis]], and the resultant system moved through Florida on December 22 in response to an approaching [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]].&lt;ref name="maps"/&gt; [[National Hurricane Center]] forecaster Jack Beven noted that "as it moved out into the Bahamas, it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm."&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; The uncertain nature of the storm prevented the NHC from issuing advisories on it, and forecasters lacked sufficient data to fully assess the cyclone for potential [[tropical cyclone|tropical characteristics]]. The same trough that pushed the storm across Florida had moved to the north, allowing for [[high-pressure area|high pressure]] to develop in the upper levels of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Henson|title=Weatherwise, December 1995 vol. 48 # 6|year=1995|website=Hurricanes in disguise|publisher=Weatheranswer.com|accessdate=2008-10-18|url=http://www.weatheranswer.com/public/Hybrids_.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deemed a "hybrid storm", the cyclone rapidly intensified in warm waters of up to {{convert|80|F|C}} from the Gulf Stream combined with a cold air mass over the United States.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris Cappella|title=1991's 'perfect storm' a hybrid hurricane|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-10-19|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wdisguis.htm | date=2005-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system continued to rapidly intensify while moving within the Gulf Stream; it developed central [[atmospheric convection|convection]], an unusual trait for an [[extratropical cyclone]], and at one point exhibited an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].&lt;ref name="maps"/&gt; Despite these indications of tropical characteristics, "There was no front associated with it and it had a warm core, but the radius of maximum winds was more than {{convert|150|nmi|mi km|lk=on}}, so under the standard NHC criteria it didn't qualify as a tropical storm."&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; On December 23 and 24, the [[nor'easter]] intensified to attain a barometric pressure of {{convert|970|mb|inHg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; An upper-level low pressure system that developed behind the storm began to intensify and grew to be larger in size than the original disturbance. In an interaction known as the [[Fujiwhara effect]], the broad circulation of the secondary low swung the primary nor'easter northwestward towards southern New York and New England.&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt; The original low passed along the south shore of [[Long Island]], and made landfall near New York City on December 24.&lt;ref name="LI"/&gt; Subsequently, it moved over southeastern [[New York State]].&lt;ref name="Hudson Valley"/&gt; On December 25, the system began to rapidly weaken as it moved towards [[Nova Scotia]], before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea in tandem in the early hours of December 26.&lt;ref name="maps"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Commerce]]|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/dwm/1994/19941219-19941225.djvu |title=Daily Weather Maps: December 19â25, 1994|accessdate=2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic===
As the primary storm entered New England, the secondary low produced minor coastal flooding in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] on December 23. Winds of {{convert|35|to|45|mph|km/h}} and tides to {{convert|1|to|3|ft|m}} above normal were reported. In [[Sandbridge, Virginia Beach, Virginia]], a beachfront home collapsed into the sea. Several roads throughout the region suffered minor flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Coastal Flooding Event Record Details for Virginia|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=2008-10-19|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~244848|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520025743/http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~244848|archivedate=2011-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong winds resulting from the tight pressure gradient between the nor'easter and an area of high pressure located over the United States brought down a few utility poles, which sparked a [[brush fire]] on December 24. The fire, quickly spread by the wind, burned a field. The winds brought down several trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=High Wind Event Record Details for Virginia|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=2008-10-19|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~244849|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520025902/http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~244849|archivedate=2011-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage was light in [[Maryland]].

The high winds caused widespread power outages, affecting up to 130,000&amp;nbsp;electric customers. As a result, electric companies sought help from as far as [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maine]] to restore electricity.&lt;ref name="CT NCDC"/&gt; Bruno Ranniello, a spokesman for [[Northeast Utilities]], reported that "We've had outages in virtually every community."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], the nor'easter ripped three barges from their moorings.

Effects were less severe in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]]. In southern New Hampshire, a line of thunderstorms produced torrential rainfall, causing flooding on parts of [[New Hampshire Route 13]]. [[Flash flood]]ing of several [[tributary|tributaries]] feeding into the [[Piscataquog River]] was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Flash Flood Event Record Details for New Hampshire|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=2008-10-21|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~216839|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520030549/http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~216839|archivedate=2011-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Maine]], the storm brought high winds and heavy rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dave Hanson|title=Rain, Wind to Fade Away by Holiday Southern Maine is Warm but Wet as a Weakening Storm Moves in|year=1994|publisher=''Portland Press Herald''|accessdate=2008-10-22|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ME&amp;p_theme=me&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAE9A02F03FC1F5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the coast of southern Maine and New Hampshire, beach erosion was reported.

As with Massachusetts, downed trees and property damage were widespread. There were many reports of [[roof shingle]]s being blown off roofs and of damage to gutters. In [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]], several small boats were damaged after being knocked into other boats. The highest reported wind gust in the state was {{convert|74|mph|km/h}} at [[Ashaway, Rhode Island]].

Massachusetts, particularly [[Cape Cod]] and [[Nantucket]], bore the brunt of the nor'easter. Reportedly, wind gusts approached {{Convert|100|mph|km/h}} on Cape Cod and, offshore, waves reached {{convert|30|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; At [[Walpole, Massachusetts|Walpole]], wind gusts peaked at {{convert|88|mph|km/h}}, while on Nantucket gusts of {{convert|84|mph|km/h}} were reported. The winds left 30,000&amp;nbsp;electric customers without power during the storm, primarily in the eastern part of the state. Power was out for some as long as 48&amp;nbsp;hours. Property damage was widespread and many trees, signs, and billboards were blown down. A large tent used by the [[New England Patriots]] was ripped and blown off its foundation. The winds also spread a deadly house fire in [[North Attleboro, Massachusetts|North Attleboro]].

The '''dodecaborate(12)''' anion, [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, has the structure of a regular [[icosahedron]] of boron atoms, with each boron atom being attached to a hydrogen atom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3252">{{about|proposed electricity grid|the electricity company|ElectraNet}}

'''Electranet''' is a proposed [[smart power grid|smart electric grid]] which would allow people to sell electricity into the grid without any artificial caps. It was proposed in an op-ed article [[Al Gore]] wrote in a "My Turn" column for ''[[Newsweek]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Al |last=Gore |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=My Turn: The Energy Electranet |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/37580 |work=Newsweek |publisher= |year=2006 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the internet, which widely distributed information, the Electranet would allow homeowners and small businesses to operate [[microgeneration|small generating]] power facilities and contribute to local and regional energy needs by selling power into the grid at a rate that is determined by free market forces. Like the internet, which led to a surge of productivity, the Electranet's [[distributed generation]] model is hoped to lead to innovative power generation through [[alternative energy|alternative]] sources and lowering [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Electranet advocates predict that as more people participate in the Electranet, the cost of electricity will continue to go down until it becomes free.

In a 2006 speech to NYU,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/community/gore.html |title=Al Gore Gives Policy Address at NYU on Solving the Climate Crisis |accessdate= |work= |publisher= |date=September 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Gore advocated deploying an Electranet as one way to reduce global warming, as well as reduce the cost of energy, by dropping the barriers to entry for average citizens to actively participate in the business of harnessing and distributing power. Al Gore frequently notes that "a lot of energy is all around us. Instead of having the sun bake us in the summer, why not gather that energy", he asks. "Why not collect from road surfaces, roofs, any painted surfaces and more?"

Al Gore has also said that "once there is a convenient way to sell energy into the grid, not only will homeowners be compelled to hop onto the grid and supply energy, but there will also be a brand new market to develop and then sell all sorts of energy gathering devices and technologies, such as solar paint, solar fabrics, thin films for windows, micro windmills, and more."

Al Gore mentioned the Electranet idea in his congressional [[Global Warming]] Testimony on March 21, 2007.

Electranet advocates predict that just like data on the internet, energy itself, including what is necessary for electric cars, will continue to be more economical as more people get onto the smart grid and supply power, and as more and more efficient technologies are developed for gathering the abundant energy around us. It is reasonable to imagine a day when there is no actual cost for driving, per mile, for energy, because of the abundance of energy coming from the Electranet.

The '''estate of Takil-ana-ilÄ«Å¡u kudurru''' is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n white limestone ''narÃ»'', or entitlement stela, dating from the latter part of the [[Kassites|Kassite]] era which gives a history of the litigation concerning a contested inheritance over three generations or more than forty years. It describes a patrimonial redemption, or "lineage claim," and provides a great deal of information concerning inheritance during the [[late Bronze Age]]. It is identified by its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], ''asumittu annÄ«tu garbarÃª Å¡alati kanÄ«k dÄ«nim'', âthis stela is a copy of three sealed documents with (royal) edictsâ&lt;ref&gt;''asumittu'', CAD A/2, p 348b.&lt;/ref&gt; and records the legal judgments made in three successive reigns of the kings, [[Adad-shuma-iddina|Adad-Å¡uma-iddina]] (ca. 1222â1217 BC), [[Adad-shuma-usur|Adad-Å¡uma-uá¹£ur]] (ca. 1216â1187 BC) and [[Meli-Shipak II|Meli-Å ipak]] (ca. 1186â1172 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Property and the Family in Biblical Law | author = Raymond Westbrook | publisher = Sheffield Academic Press | year = 1991 | pages = 98â99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a contemporary text which confirms the sequence of these [[Kassites|Kassite]] monarchs given on the [[Babylonian king list]] and provides the best evidence that the first of these was unlikely to have been merely an [[Assyria]]n appointee during their recent hegemony over [[Babylonia]] by [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]], as his judgments were honored by the later kings.

==The stela==

The [[kudurru]] was excavated from the ruins of the [[Marduk]] temple in [[Babylon]] by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and his chief foreman Daud Thoma in 1880 and is now in the [[British Museum]] assigned museum reference BM 90827. The text is inscribed on six columns on a two foot high stone block topped by a triangular apex carved with fifteen divine symbols.

The case begins âWhen the house of Takil-ana-ilÄ«Å¡u lapsed for want of an heir in the time of King Adad-Å¡uma-iddina, King Adad-Å¡uma-iddina gave the house (i.e. the estate) of Takil-ana-ilÄ«Å¡u to Ur-Nintinuga, brother of Takil-ana-ilÄ«Å¡u.â&lt;ref&gt;(1) Ã© Takil-ana-ilÄ«Å¡u &lt;sup&gt;lÃº&lt;/sup&gt;á¸«al, (2) ''i-na'' lugal Adad-Å¡uma-iddina (3) ''mu-un-tuku-ta il-lik-''[''ma''] (4) lugal Adad-Å¡uma-iddina (5) Ã© Takil-ana-ilÄ«Å¡u [&lt;sup&gt;lÃº&lt;/sup&gt;á¸«al] (6) ''a-''[''na''] Ur-Nintinuga (7) Å¡eÅ¡ Takil-ana-ilÄ«Å¡u ''i''[''d-'']''in''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deities invoked in curses===

As was customary on such monuments, various deities were invoked to curse any party who might dispute the legal decision recorded on the kudurru. These included [[Anu]], [[Enlil]], and [[Enki|Ea]] (evil eye), [[Sin (mythology)|SÃ®n]], [[Shamash|Å amaÅ¡]], [[Adad]] and [[Marduk]] (tearing out the foundation); [[Ningursu]] and [[Bau (goddess)|Bau]] (joyless fate), Å amaÅ¡ and Adad (lawlessness); [[Pap-nigin-gara]] (destruction of the landmark), [[Uras (mythology)|UraÅ¡]] and [[Ninegal]] (evil); [[Kassite deities]] Å uqamuna and Å umalia (humiliation before the king and princes), [[Ishtar|IÅ¡tar]] (defeat); all the named gods (destruction of the name).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Deuteronomium 28 und die adÃª zur Thronfolgeregelung Asarhaddons | author = Hans Ulrich Steymans | publisher = Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht | year = 1996 | pages = 56â57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cast of characters===

The roles and readings of the names of the participants have changed since the first publication of the text and the identifications given here follow Paulus (2007), who argues that the outcome of the case hinges on the performance of the "[[River ordeal]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = 'Ein Richter wie Å amaÅ¡' â Zur Rechtsprechung der KassitenkÃ¶nige | author = Susanne Paulus | journal = Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Altorientalische und Biblische Rechtsgeschichte | volume = 13 | year = 2007 | pages = 7â14, 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FaultGouge.JPG|thumb|Salmon-colored fault gouge and associated fault separates two different rock types on the left (dark grey) and right (light grey).  From the [[Gobi]] of [[Mongolia]].]]
'''Fault gouge''' is a [[tectonite]] (a [[rock (geology)|rock]] formed by tectonic forces) with a very small grain size. Fault gouge has no [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]] and it is normally an [[consolidation (soil)|unconsolidated]] rock type, unless [[Cementation (geology)|cementation]] took place at a later stage. A fault gouge forms in the same way as [[fault breccia]], the latter also having larger [[clast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Twiss, R.J. &amp; Moores, E.M., 2000 (6th edition): ''Structural Geology'', W.H. Freeman &amp; co, {{ISBN|0-7167-2252-6}}; p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to fault breccia, which is another incohesive fault rock, fault gouge has less visible fragments (less than 30% visible fragments regarding fault gouges, and more than 30% regarding fault breccia).&lt;ref name="Sibson1977"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/133/3/191 | title=Fault rocks and fault mechanisms | author=Sibson, R. H. | journal=Journal of the Geological Society of London | year=1977 | volume=133 | pages=191â213 | doi=10.1144/gsjgs.133.3.0191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gouge-filled faults can be weak planes in rock masses. If compressive stresses are enough these can cause compressive yielding or eventually rock fracture. &lt;ref&gt;Bertuzzi, R., 2015: ''Tunnel Support Loading Mechanism'', UNSW, Sydney, Australia; p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origin==
Fault gouge forms by tectonic movement along a localized zone of [[brittle deformation]] (a [[fault (geology)|fault zone]]) in a rock. The grinding and milling that results when the two sides of the fault zone move along each other results in a material that is made of loose fragments. First a fault breccia will form, but if the grinding continues the rock becomes fault gouge.

'''Fluoromethane''', also known as '''methyl fluoride''', '''[[Freon]] 41''', '''Halocarbon-41''' and '''HFC-41''', is a non-toxic, liquefiable, and flammable [[gas]] at standard temperature and pressure. It is made of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[fluorine]]. The name stems from the fact that it is [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with a fluorine atom substituted for one of the hydrogen atoms. 

== Composition ==
The compound is the lowest mass member of the '''hydrofluorocarbon''' (HFC) family, compounds which contain only hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. These are related to the [[Chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC)s, but since they do not contain chlorine, were thought not to be destructive to the ozone layer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rkm.com.au/HALOCARBONS/fluoromethane.html Fluoromethane CH3F]&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are still very harmful to the ozone layer, and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol is an attempt to phase them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-hydrofluorocarbons-saved-the-ozone-layer-so-why-are-we-banning-them-86672|title=Explainer: hydrofluorocarbons saved the ozone layer, so why are we banning them?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in the manufacture of semiconductor and electronic products. In the presence of an RF field fluoromethane will dissociate into fluoride ions that selectively etch silicon compound films ([[reactive-ion etching]]). Fluoromethane has an agreeable [[ether]]-like odor and is also [[narcotic]] in high concentrations. Fluoromethane is highly flammable and burns in air with evolution of highly toxic [[hydrogen fluoride]]. The flame is colorless, similar to alcohol.

The C-F [[bond energy]] is 552&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol and its length is 0.139&amp;nbsp;nm (typically 0.14&amp;nbsp;nm). Its molecular geometry is tetrahedral.

Its [[specific heat capacity]] (C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) is 38.171&amp;nbsp;JÂ·mol&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;Â·K&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&amp;nbsp;Â°C. The [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of fluoromethane is at 44.9&amp;nbsp;Â°C (318.1&amp;nbsp;K) and 6.280&amp;nbsp;MPa.

==Economic use of forests==
Wood from the forest has long been used in the southern part of the country and in early agricultural areas as a source of fuel and as a building material. Wood was essential for Sweden's early mining industry, as it was used to produce charcoal for processing ore. Other important forestry products included wood pitch, tar, and potash, which were produced for export beginning in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="AutoV7-5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boreal Forests of the World - SWEDEN - FORESTS AND FORESTRY|url=http://www.borealforest.org/world/world_sweden.htm|website=www.borealforest.org|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forestry work expanded to [[Norrland]] beginning in the early 19th century, and the resulting cleared areas became the site of small farms and pastures. Extensive logging resulted in the development of a sawmill industry, which produced lumber for export. This expansion continued until 1905.&lt;ref name="AutoV7-5"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8647">In [[electric power distribution]], a '''fractalgrid''' is a [[system-of-systems]] architecture of [[distributed energy resource]]s or DERs.
In a fractalgrid [[topology]], multiple [[microgrids]] are strategically arranged to follow a [[fractal]] or [[recursive]] pattern. [[Fractals]], or [[self-similar]] patterns, can be seen in nature. Clouds, river networks, and lightning bolts are a few examples of natural phenomena that display fractal features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-are-fractals/ What are Fractals?]&lt;/ref&gt; In a fractalgrid, a microgrid may be composed of smaller microgrids or âfractal unitsâ. In such a configuration, the network becomes one of simplified power flows and communications through distributed [[Electrical Substation|substation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microgrids.eu/documents/676.pdf Advanced Architectures and Control Concepts for More Microgrids]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
There are two main variations of the fractalgrid concept. Though not mutually exclusive, [http://www.cleanspark.com CleanSpark]'s FractalGrid architecture is a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] implementation while NRECA's flows from the [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] to reach similar architectural [[quality attributes]].

===CleanSpark's FractalGrid===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:FractalGridHealthMonitor.png|thumb|240px| CleanSpark's fractalgrid architecture, represented through an exemplary health monitor. User Interface design by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelseapattee Chelsea Pattee].]] --&gt;

This variation is a [[command-and-control]] platform that integrates energy storage technology with on-site generation, monitored by a distributed data monitoring and controls system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The fundamental goals of the fractalgrid are to ensure [[energy security]] to critical facilities and functions of the local area while reducing overall cost.

Features include &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.cleanspark.com/microgrid-technology CleanSpark Microgrid Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[clean energy]] storage integration, technology-agnostic implementation, [[load management]], [[demand response]], peak shaving, and real-time energy optimization.

Within a fractalgrid, microgrids are placed in parent-child relationships in which a child microgrid can be islanded from its parent microgrid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each fractal microgrid can operate autonomously or federated with others. The federated state allows for sharing of resources but also allows for disconnection in the cases of maintenance and emergencies. In the same way that microgrids are able to island from the utility when needed, fractal microgrids can disconnect from one another in order to maintain power supply to critical loads.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The fractalgrid was conceived in 2012 by Art Villanueva, CleanSpark's founding [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] and [[Chief Science Officer|CSO]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanspark.com/our-team/ CleanSpark Team]&lt;/ref&gt; and designed and implemented by Jennifer Worrall. The implementation uses recursion and bounds complexity to O(N).

====Camp Pendleton FractalGrid Demonstration (CPFD)====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CampPendletonFractalGridDemo.png|thumb|240px|Camp Pendleton 52 Area FractalGrid Demonstration configuration]] --&gt;

Starting July 2014, an active fractalgrid&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianenergy.com/news/65-navajo-nation-energy-tour Indian Energy News: United States Marine Corps to Honor Navajo Code Talkers During Navajo Nationâs Advanced FractalGrid Tour of Camp Pendleton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.masscec.com/uploads/attachments/2014/02/MassCEC%20Microgrid%20Study%20Final%20Report%202-18-14_0.pdf Microgrids â Benefits, Models, Barriers and Suggested Policy Initiatives for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt; has been active in [[San Diego]] County, [[California]] at military base [[Camp Pendleton]], funded by the [[California Energy Commission]] to exhibit the uses of fractalgrid technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjd3bMvxRsw Camp Pendleton Microgrid - Energy Security CW6]&lt;/ref&gt; The Camp Pendleton fractalgrid is connected to a 1.1 MW facility consisting of several buildings at the Barracks, a three-story parking garage and three cell towers. The project implements three self-sufficient fractal microgrids and a larger microgrid that interconnects the site such that resources can be shared between microgrids in various configurations. Each fractal microgrid's operational status is dependent on the state of power supply and the need to keep critical loads powered.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://microgridknowledge.com/a-look-inside-the-fractal-microgrid-at-camp-pendleton A look inside the fractal microgrid at Camp Pendleton]/&lt;/ref&gt; Using real-time data, the system monitors the [[energy consumption]] levels and evaluates the power generation received from [[distributed energy resource]]s (DERs). This analysis is used to determine how many loads can be powered by local generation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUEe8HmKOU Camp Pendleton Energy Security: The Fractal Grid]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPFD illustrates islanding within a fractalgrid. Each fractal microgrid is capable of completely separating from its parent microgrid in order to best support critical loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = American Public Power Association - Microgrids: Self-Sufficient Energy Islands|url = http://www.publicpower.org/Media/magazine/ArticleDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=44478|website = www.publicpower.org|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NRECA's Agile Fractal Grid===

The Agile Fractal Grid is a concept envisioned by Craig Miller, scientist at the [[National Rural Electric Cooperative Association]] ([[NRECA]]), as well as Maurice Martin, David Pinney, and George Walker. According to their report, "Achieving a Resilient and Agile Grid"&lt;ref name=agilefractalgridpaper&gt;''[http://www.nreca.coop/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Achieving_a_Resilient_and_Agile_Grid.pdf Achieving a Resilient and Agile Grid]''&lt;/ref&gt; the ideal principles of Fractal Operation are as follows:
*All segments of the grid operate with the same information and control model - regardless of scale
*Every segment of the grid has a decision-making capability
*The means for exchange of peer-to-peer information are defined clearly in standards
*The rules for when to divide and when to combine are defined clearly

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SegmentedGridDiagram.png|thumb|240px|Segmented Grid: A, B, and C are grids (mini or micro) that can operate autonomously but are connected.]] --&gt;

An integral part of the agile grid is [[network segmentation|segmentation]]. The concept calls for a collection of independently operating systems that function together in a coordinated manner, as opposed to the traditional [[utility grid]] supplying energy for a large geographical area. Units are segmented in such a way that they are able to act as individual units and localize power supply and control. A large benefit to segmentation is the ability for the individual units to act separately from a central control system, which can create more stability in the overall system and decentralizes the source of energy.&lt;ref name=agilefractalgridpaper /&gt;

The basis for the agile grid is segmentability, rather than segmentation. It is crucial for the units to have the ability to operate separately from each other, but only when it is practical to do so. Integration between units must also occur for the system to be efficient.&lt;ref name=agilefractalgridpaper/&gt;

'''Gamma-linolenic acid''' or '''GLA''' ('''Î³-Linolenic acid'''), ([[International nonproprietary name|INN]] and [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]] '''gamolenic acid''') is a fatty acid found primarily in vegetable oils. When acting on GLA, [[Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase]] produces no [[leukotriene]]s and the conversion by the enzyme of [[arachidonic acid]] to leukotrienes is inhibited.

==Chemistry==
GLA is categorized as an [[omega-6 fatty acid|''n''â6]] (also called Ïâ6 or omega-6) fatty acid, meaning that the first double bond on the methyl end (designated with ''n'' or Ï) is the sixth bond. In physiological literature, GLA is designated as 18:3 (''n''â6). GLA is a [[carboxylic acid]] with an 18-carbon chain and three ''[[Cisâtrans isomerism|cis]]'' [[double bond]]s. It is an [[isomer]] of [[alpha-Linolenic acid|Î±-linolenic acid]], which is a polyunsaturated nâ3 (omega-3) fatty acid, found in [[rapeseed]] [[canola]] oil, [[soybean]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[flax]] seed ([[linseed oil]]), [[perilla]], [[Salvia hispanica|chia]], and [[hemp]] seed.

==History==
GLA was first isolated from the seed oil of [[Oenothera|evening primrose]].  This herbal plant was grown by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s to treat swelling in the body.
In the 17th century, it was introduced to Europe and became a popular folk remedy, earning the name ''king's cure-all.''
In 1919, Heiduschka and LÃ¼ft extracted the oil from evening primrose seeds and described an unusual linolenic acid, which they name Î³-.
Later, the exact chemical structure was characterized by Riley.&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{cite book

| accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are Î±- and Î³- forms of linolenic acid, there is no Î²- form.  One was once identified, but it turned out to be an artifact of the original analytical process.&lt;ref name='Eckey1954'&gt;{{cite book | last = Eckey | first = EW | authorlink = | title = Vegetable Fats and Oils (volume 123 of American Chemical Society monograph series) | publisher = Reinhold | year = 1954 | location = | pages = 542 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary sources==
GLA is obtained from vegetable oils such as evening primrose (''[[Oenothera biennis]]'') oil (EPO), [[blackcurrant]] seed oil, [[borage seed oil]], and [[hemp oil|hemp seed oil]]. GLA is also found in varying amounts in edible [[hemp]] seeds, oats, barley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Qureshi A.A. | author2 = Schnoes H. K. | author3 = Din Z.

The human body produces GLA from [[linoleic acid]] (LA). This reaction is catalyzed by Î&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-[[Fatty acid desaturase|desaturase]] (D6D), an enzyme that allows the creation of a double bond on the sixth carbon counting from the carboxyl terminus.  LA is consumed sufficiently in most diets, from such abundant sources as [[cooking oil]]s and [[meat]]s. However, a lack of GLA can occur when there is a reduction of the efficiency of the D6D conversion (for instance, as people grow older or when there are specific dietary deficiencies) or in disease states wherein there is excessive consumption of GLA metabolites.&lt;ref name="pmid8386433"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Horrobin DF (From the Efamol Research Institute.

==Source of eicosanoids==
[[Image:Middelste teunis bloem R0011876.JPG|thumb|left|The seed oil of ''Oenothera biennis'' (evening primrose) is a source of GLA]]
From GLA, the body forms [[dihomo-Î³-linolenic acid]] (DGLA). This is one of the body's three sources of [[eicosanoid]]s (along with [[Arachidonic acid|AA]] and [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]].) DGLA is the precursor of the [[prostaglandin]] PGH&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in turn forms PGE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[thromboxane]] TXA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Both PGE1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and TXA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are anti-inflammatory; [[thromboxane]] TXA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, unlike its series-2 variant, induces vasodilation, and inhibits platelet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Michael W|title=Introduction to the Eicosanoids|url=http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/eicosanoids.php|work=The Medical Biochemistry Page|publisher=1996â2013 themedicalbiochemistrypage.org, LLC|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, TXA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; modulates (reduces) the pro-inflammatory properties of the thromboxane TXA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. PGE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has a role in regulation of [[immune system]] function and is used as the medicine [[Prostaglandin E1|alprostadil]].

Unlike AA and EPA, DGLA cannot yield [[leukotriene]]s.  However, it can inhibit the formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes from AA.&lt;ref name="Belch"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Belch JJ, Hill A |title=Evening primrose oil and borage oil in rheumatologic conditions |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=71 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=352Sâ6S |year=2000 |pmid=10617996 |doi= | url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/71/1/352S
| quote=DGLA itself cannot be converted to LTs but can form a 15-hydroxyl derivative that blocks the transformation of arachidonic acid to LTs. Increasing DGLA intake may allow DGLA to act as a competitive inhibitor of 2-series PGs and 4-series LTs and, thus, suppress inflammation. |accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although GLA is an ''n''â6 fatty acid, a type of acid that is, in general, pro-inflammatory, it has anti-inflammatory properties. ''(See discussion at [[Essential fatty acid interactions#The paradox of dietary GLA|Essential fatty acid interactions: The paradox of dietary GLA]].)''

==Health and medicine==
GLA has been promoted as medication for a variety of ailments including breast pain and eczema, in particular by [[David Horrobin]] (1939&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 2003), whose marketing of evening primrose oil was described by ''[[The BMJ]]'' (British Medical Journal) as ethically dubious&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the substance was likely to be remembered as "a remedy for which there is no disease".&lt;ref name=dh-obit&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7394.885|title=David Horrobin|year=2003|last1=Richmond|first1=C.|journal=BMJ|volume=326|issue=7394|pages=885}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2002 the UK's [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] withdrew marketing authorisations for evening primrose oil as an eczema remedy.&lt;ref name=goodnight&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25457999|doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7428.1358|title=Evening primrose oil for atopic dermatitis: Time To Say Goodnight|year=2003|last1=Williams|first1=H.

The '''Karachi Nuclear Power Complex''' or '''KNPC''' is located in [[Paradise Point, Pakistan|Paradise Point]], [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. It consists of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) and the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]]'s Control &amp; Instrumentation Analysis Lab (CIAL KARACHI). Two new nuclear power plants, KANUPP-2 and KANUPP-3, are also under construction at the site. When complete, the complex of [[civilian]] [[nuclear power plant]]s will produce over 2000 [[Megawatt|MW]] of [[electricity]]. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] safeguards and inspects the complex. The plant is under construction by the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) and is financed by the [[IAEA]], the [[China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group]], the [[China National Nuclear Corporation]], and the [[China Atomic Energy Authority]].

==KESC and NESPAK cooperation==
The [[National Engineering Services Pakistan]] (NESPAK) has been providing consultancy services to the Karachi Nuclear Power Complex for the replacement of the aging circuit breakers and protective relays of the 132&amp;nbsp;kV double circuit transmission line that links the complex with the [[Karachi Electric Supply Corporation]] network at Baldia grid station. The old bulk oil circuit breakers and electromechanical [[protective relay]]s have been replaced with the latest SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; circuit breakers and modern [[digital protective relay|numerical line protection]] devices.

===Electricity connections===
Stand-alone 132&amp;nbsp;kV current transformers have been provided for protection and metering functions as substitute for the bushing current transformers in the bulk oil circuit breakers. KNPC and NESPAK engineers worked closely in devising a discriminative protection scheme and its integration into the complex systems of the [[nuclear power plant]]. Both circuits of KANUPP-Baldia double circuit lines have been re-energised with the new equipment. Performance indicators have since validated the intended objectives of the project vis-a-vis discriminative functioning of the protection system against disturbances in KESC power system for stable operation of [[KANUPP]].

==KANUPP-1==
KANUPP-I is a [[CANDU reactor]] supplied by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Government]] in 1971. It was inaugurated on November 28, 1972, by then-[[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]. KANUPP-I is a single unit pressurized heavy water reactor with a total gross capacity of 137&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]]. It remains in operation as of May 2014, and is currently limited to 85&amp;nbsp;MW. The International Atomic Energy Agency has monitored the reactor since its construction.

===History===
Since [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] from [[United Kingdom]] in 1947, Pakistan had repeatedly suffered [[Energy crisis|energy crises]] that have contributed to the country's [[Economy of Pakistan|economic]] [[Economic slowdown|slowdown]]. In 1960, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Field Marshal Ayub Khan]] appointed [[Abdus Salam]] as his [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)#Science Advisors|Science Advisor]].&lt;ref name="Professor Riazuddin, emeritus scientist at the National Center for Nuclear Physics, and a professor of theoretical physics at the Institute of Physics of the Quaid-i-Azam University."/&gt; Soon after, Abdus Salam became the head of Pakistan's IAEA delegation.&lt;ref name="Professor Riazuddin, emeritus scientist at the National Center for Nuclear Physics, and a professor of theoretical physics at the Institute of Physics of the Quaid-i-Azam University."/&gt; In that capacity, Abdus Salam advocated the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] for the support of nuclear energy in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Professor Riazuddin, emeritus scientist at the National Center for Nuclear Physics, and a professor of theoretical physics at the Institute of Physics of the Quaid-i-Azam University."/&gt; Due to Abdus Salam's influence on President Ayub Khan, Salam had the commercial nuclear plant near Karachi personally approved, in spite of opposition to the project from the military establishment.&lt;ref name="Professor Riazuddin, emeritus scientist at the National Center for Nuclear Physics, and a professor of theoretical physics at the Institute of Physics of the Quaid-i-Azam University."&gt;{{Cite journal | author =Riazuddin | authorlink =Riazuddin (physicist) | coauthors = | title =Contribution of Professor Abdus Salam as Technical Member of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) | journal =The Nucleus | volume =42 | issue =1-2 | pages =31â34 | publisher =Professor Riazuddin, emeritus scientist at the National Center for Nuclear Physics, and a professor of theoretical physics at the Institute of Physics of the Quaid-i-Azam University. | location =Islamabad | year =2005 | language = | url =http://www.thenucleuspak.org.pk/nucleus/pdf%20Special%20Issue%20Nucleus%2042%281-4%29/Contributions%20of%20Professor%20Abdus%20Salam%20%28ms603%29.pdf | jstor = | issn =0029-5698 | doi = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate =28 March 2014 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140627133716/http://www.thenucleuspak.org.pk/nucleus/pdf%20Special%20Issue%20Nucleus%2042%281-4%29/Contributions%20of%20Professor%20Abdus%20Salam%20%28ms603%29.pdf | archivedate =27 June 2014 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Abdus Salam traveled to United States, where in a ceremony, Canada and Pakistan signed a nuclear energy pact with [[Canadian General Electric|GE Canada]] establishing the country's first nuclear plant.&lt;ref name="Professor Riazuddin, emeritus scientist at the National Center for Nuclear Physics, and a professor of theoretical physics at the Institute of Physics of the Quaid-i-Azam University."/&gt; Per agreement, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's engineers and scientists led the construction of the project,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} while GE Canada provided funds and [[enriched uranium]] based nuclear fuel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Parvez Butt]], a nuclear engineer, was the chief designer of the plant at the GE Canada's designing office.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 1966, construction started, and it was completed in 1971. On November 28,1972 then-President [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]], accompanied by Abdus Salam and the PAEC's newly appointed Chairman Munir Ahmad Khan, inaugurated the first unit of the Karachi Nuclear Plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people =Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto with Abdus Salam and Munir Ahmad Khan | title =Pakistan - PAEC Chairman &amp; Z.A Bhutto inauguration of KANUPP nuclear plant   | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VCtXSQuFDg | medium =TV-Medium | publisher =Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and Pakistan Military Consortium (PMC). | location =Karachi, Sindh Province, Pakistan | date =1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology of the nuclear power plant is similar to India's [[CIRUS reactor|CIRUS]] and [[Dhruva reactor|DHRUVA reactor]], with another small reactor producing [[Reactor-grade plutonium|reactor-grade]] plutonium.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Munir Ahmad Khan, now as chairman, indigenously developed and established the nuclear fuel cycle programme.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 1972, Pakistan, under Bhutto, refused to sign the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because the reactor-grade plutonium was extremely dangerous to be open in public, the PAEC transferred it to the [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#PARR-III Reactor (New-Labs)|''New Laboratories'']] (known as The New Labs), and produced the first batch of fresh [[Weapons-grade#Weapons-grade plutonium|weapons-grade]] plutonium.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 1976, Canada stopped the supply of fuel and spare parts for the plant.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The highly radioactive material was also left openly in Karachi{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} as Canadian technicians departed from Pakistan. Pakistan media then speculated that in the absence of Canadian officials, the city would suffer a major power [[Power outage|blackout]]. Canadian officials later stated that the reactor would be shut down in six months.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, the PAEC, using indigenous resources, produced sufficient feed for ''KANUPP''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 1978, the PAEC developed its own nuclear fuel and began loading the feedstock into ''KANUPP-I''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} As of December 31, 2013 ''KANUPP-I''  has generated 14.7 billion [[Kilowatt hour|kWhr]] of electricity and been fueled by thousands of Pakistani-made fuel bundles without any failure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} 

===Features===
The ''KANUPP'' reactor site is on the [[Arabian Sea]] coast, about 11&amp;nbsp;miles (17.7&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Karachi]]. The Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (''KANUPP'') has a [[heavy water]] moderated and cooled [[natural uranium]]-fueled, horizontal pressure tube reactor. Other distinguishing features are once-through, on-power bidirectional fueling, reactor shutdown by moderator dump, and a reactor building designed for total containment of any pressure resulting from an accident.

===Engineering facility and power capacity===
The gross plant rating is 137&amp;nbsp;[[MWe]] and the corresponding net output is 125&amp;nbsp;MWe. The Nuclear Reactor Building contains the entire reactor system and auxiliaries, and consists of a pre-stressed concrete cylindrical wall, a hemispherical segmental dome of pre-stressed concrete, and a concrete base slab. The Turbine Building houses the turbine-generator and auxiliaries, water processing equipment, electrical distribution equipment, and the control room. The building is a reinforced concrete frame and block structure.

===Nuclear reactor operations===
The reactor consists of a tubed [[calandria (nuclear reactor)|calandria]] vessel of austenitic stainless steel, which contains the heavy water moderator/reflector and 208 coolant tube assemblies. The moderator system consists of the calandria, coolers, pumps and purification system in the heavy water circuit, and control valves, dump valves and helium blowers in the [[helium]] circuit. The fuel is natural uranium in the form of sintered [[uranium dioxide]] pellets sheathed in thin [[zirconium]] alloy tubes to form solid fuel elements about 19.1&amp;nbsp;inches (48.53&amp;nbsp;cm) long by 0.6&amp;nbsp;inches (1.4&amp;nbsp;cm) diameter.

===Future===
''KANUPP'' came into commercial operation in 1972 and after completing its 30 years of design life was shut down on December 6, 2002. The plant resumed operations in 2006. At present{{When|date=October 2016}} the plant is undergoing several safety upgrades for operation beyond design life. On the request of ''KANUPP'', the [[Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority]] allowed the plant to operate at 80 MW for the interim period. The PAEC has denied any media reports of shutting down the nuclear power plant, however, on June 30, 2009, a senior official of PAEC stated that the ''KANUPP'' would be decommissioned in 2012. The ''KANUPP-II'', an indigenous nuclear power plant build by PAEC, will be taking the place of the ''KANUPP-I''. In November 2013, Pakistan and China confirmed that two [[ACP1000]] Nuclear reactors, KANUPP-2 and KANUPP-3, will be built at Karachi.&lt;ref name="worldpoliticsreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/13349/with-reactor-deal-china-and-pakistan-seek-to-reshape-global-nuclear-governance|title=With Reactor Deal, China and Pakistan Seek to Reshape Global Nuclear Governance|date=|publisher=|author=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leakage===
On 18 October 2011 the ''KANUPP'' Karachi nuclear power plant imposed a seven-hour emergency after heavy water leaked from a feeder pipe to the reactor.&lt;ref name=reutersLeak /&gt; The leakage started around midnight on Tuesday during a routine maintenance shut down.&lt;ref name=reutersLeak /&gt; After the leakage was detected a state of emergency was imposed at the plant and the affected area was isolated. The emergency was lifted seven hours later, after the leak was reportedly  brought under control.&lt;ref name=reutersLeak&gt;{{cite news|last=Aziz|first=Faisal|title=Leak at Pakistani nuclear plant, but no damage|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/20/us-pakistan-nuclear-idUSTRE79J13720111020|accessdate=22 October 2011|newspaper=reuters.com|date=Oct 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==KANUPP-2 and 3==
KANUPP-2 and 3 will cost $9.5 billion and each unit will produce 1,100 MW and total of 2,200 MW.&lt;ref name="globalpost.com"&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/130613/pakistan-start-work-chinese-aided-nuclear-power-plant Pakistan to start work on Chinese-aided nuclear power plant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/559885/govt-to-kick-off-work-on-1100mw-nuclear-power-plant/|title=Govt to kick off work on 1,100MW nuclear power plant - The Express Tribune|author=|date=7 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsweekpakistan.com/the-nuclear-shadow-over-karachi/|title=The Nuclear Shadow over Karachi|author=|date=17 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2013, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Nawaz Sharif]] ceremonially broke ground on a new governmental power project at the Karachi Nuclear Power Complex for the construction of two [[ACP1000]] ([[Hualong One]]) nuclear reactors,.&lt;ref name="worldpoliticsreview.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/asia/pakistan-breaks-ground-on-nuclear-power-plant-project-with-china.html|title=Pakistan Breaks Ground on Nuclear Plant Project With China|author=|date=27 November 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ansar Pervaiz|Dr. Ansar Pervaiz]], the Chairman of the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]], said that KANUPP-2 would begin commercial operations by 2019&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-131648-China-commits-$6.5-billion-for-nuclear-power-project-in-Karachi China commits $6.5 billion for nuclear power project in Karachi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/local-fallout-from-pakistan-039-s-nuclear-energy-bet/nuclear-power-electricity-security-fishing-fukushima-activism-nuclear-disaster/c3s15373/#.UzMawYWa_3l|title=Local Fallout From Pakistan|first=|last=Worldcrunch.com|date=|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/nuclear-reactors-worry-pakistans-fishers/av-17510168|title=Nuclear reactors worry Pakistan's fishers - All media content - DW.COM - 20.03.2014|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/article-194757-PM-Sharif-in-Karachi-inaugurates-KANUPP-2-power-project|title=PM Sharif in Karachi, inaugurates KANUPP-2 power project|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and KANUPP-3 by 2020.&lt;ref name="worldpoliticsreview.com"/&gt; The reactor design has been upgraded to the [[Hualong One]], a development of the ACP1000, with commercial operation now planned for 2021 and 2022.&lt;ref name=wnn-20171011&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Pressure-vessel-in-place-at-Karachi-2-1110177.html |title=Pressure vessel in place at Karachi 2 |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=11 October 2017 |accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==KANUPP-4==
KANUPP-4 is a planned commercial [[nuclear power plant]], to be located at [[Karachi]].

==Nuclear Engineering Training Center==
The Karachi Nuclear Power Complex also contains a [[nuclear engineering]] college. [[KANUPP]]'s Institute of Nuclear Power Engineering (KINPOE) is controlled by PAEC. KINPOE offers two-year [[M.Sc.|master program]] in [[nuclear engineering]] accredited by [[Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences|Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS)]] and PDTP.

'''Laser-heated pedestal growth''' ('''LHPG''') or '''laser floating zone''' ('''LFZ''') is a [[crystal growth]] technique. A narrow region of a crystal is melted with a powerful [[Carbon dioxide laser|CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;]] or [[Yttrium aluminium garnet|YAG]] laser. The laser and hence the [[zone melting|floating zone]], is moved along the crystal. The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it. This technique for growing [[crystal]]s from the melt (liquid/solid [[phase transition]]) is used in materials research.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last=Feigelson |first=R.S. |year=1985 |chapter=Growth of fiber crystals |editor=Kaldis, E |title=Crystal Growth of Electronic Materials |page=127 |isbn=978-0-444-86919-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last=Andreeta |first=M.R.B. |author2=Hernandes, A.C. |year=2010 |chapter=Laser-Heated Pedestal Growth of Oxide Fibers |editor=Dhanaraj, G. |editor2=Byrappa, K. |editor3=Prasad, V. |editor4=Dudley, M. |title=Springer Handbook of Crystal Growth |page=393 |isbn=978-3-540-74182-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The main advantages of this technique are the high pulling rates (60 times  greater than the conventional [[Czochralski technique]]) and the possibility of growing materials with very high melting points.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Ardila |first=D.R. |author2=Andreeta, M.R.B. |author3=Cuffini, S.L. |year=1997 |title=Laser heated pedestal growth of Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single-crystal fibers from SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Journal of Crystal Growth |volume=177 |issue=1â2 |pages=52â56 |doi=10.1016/S0022-0248(96)00904-9 |bibcode = 1997JCrGr.177...52A |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=De Camargo |first=A.S.S |author2=Nunes, L.A.O. |author3=Andreeta, M.R.B. |year=2002 |title=Near-infrared and upconversion properties of neodymium-doped RE&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (RE = Y, Gd) single-crystal fibres grown by the laser-heated pedestal growth technique |journal=[[Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter]] |volume=14 |issue=50 |pages=13889â13897 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/14/50/314 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=De Vicente |first=F.S. |year=1999 |author2=Hernandes, A.C. |author3=De Castro, A.C. |title=Photoluminescence spectrum of rare earth doped zirconia fibre and power excitation dependence |journal=Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids |volume=149 |issue=1â4 |pages=153â157 |doi=10.1080/10420159908230149 |bibcode = 1999REDS..149..153D |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, LHPG is a [[crucible]]-free technique, which allows [[single crystal]]s to be grown with high purity and low stress.

The geometric shape of the crystals (the technique can produce small diameters), and the low production cost, make the single-crystal fibers (SCF) produced by LHPG suitable substitutes for bulk crystals in many devices, especially those that use high [[melting point]] materials.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=De Camargo |first=A.S.S. |author2=Andreeta, M.R.B |author3=Hernandes, A.C. |year=2006 |title=1.8&amp;nbsp;Âµm emission and excited state absorption in LHPG grown Gd&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Tm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; single crystal fibers for miniature lasers |journal=[[Optical Materials]] |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=551â555 |doi=10.1016/j.optmat.2005.07.002 |bibcode = 2006OptMa..28..551D |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Romero |first=J.J. |author2=Montoya, E. |author3=Bausa, L.E. |year=2004 |title=Multiwavelength laser action of Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:YAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals grown by the laser heated pedestal growth method |journal=[[Optical Materials]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=643â650 |doi=10.1016/S0925-3467(03)00179-4 |bibcode = 2004OptMa..24..643R |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, single-crystal fibers must have equal or superior optical and structural qualities compared to bulk crystals to substitute for them in technological devices.

==Optical elements==
[[File:LFZ.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic of a LFZ system]]
Until 1980, laser-heated crystal growth used only two laser beams focused over the source material.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Burrus |first=C.A. |author2=Stone, J. |year=1975 |title=Singleâcrystal fiber optical devices: A Nd:YAG fiber laser |journal=[[Applied Physics Letters]] |volume=26 |pages=318 |doi=10.1063/1.88172 |bibcode = 1975ApPhL..26..318B |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition generated a high radial thermal gradient in the molten zone,  making the process unstable. Increasing the number of beams to four did not solve the problem, although it improved the growth process.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal |last=Haggerty |first=J.S. |title=Production of fibers by a floating zone fiber drawing technique, Final Report |id=NASA-CR-120948 |year=1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An improvement to the laser-heated crystal growth technique was made by Fejer ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt; {{cite conference |last=Fejer |first=M.M. |author2=Byer, R.L. |author3=Feigelson R. |author4= Kway W. |title=Growth and characterization of single crystal refractory oxide fibers |booktitle=Proceedings of the SPIE, Advances in Infrared Fibers II |volume=320 |year=1982 |page=50 |location=Bellingham, WA |publisher=[[SPIE]] |isbn=978-0-89252-355-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who incorporated a special optical component known as a ''reflaxicon'', consisting of an inner cone surrounded by a larger coaxial cone section, both with reflecting surfaces. This optical element converts the cylindrical laser beam into a larger diameter hollow cylinder surface.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Edmonds |first=W.R. |year=1973 |title=The reflaxicon: a new reflective optical element, and some applications |journal=[[Applied Optics]] |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=1940-5 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ao/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-12-8-1940 |doi=10.1364/AO.12.001940 |pmid=20125635 |bibcode = 1973ApOpt..12.1940E }}&lt;/ref&gt; This optical component allows radial distribution of the laser energy over the molten zone,  reducing radial thermal gradients. The axial [[temperature gradient]] in this technique can go as high as 10000&amp;nbsp;Â°C/cm, which is very high when compared to traditional crystal growth techniques (10â100&amp;nbsp;Â°C/cm).

==Convection speed==
A feature of the LHPG technique is its high [[convection]] speed in the liquid phase due to [[Marangoni effect|Marangoni convection]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Liu  |first=M. |author2=Chen, J.C. |author3=Chiang, C.H. |author4=Hu, L.J. |author5= Lin, S.P. |year=2006 |title=Mg-doped sapphire crystal fibers grown by laser-heated pedestal growth method |journal=[[Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Part I]] |volume=45 |issue=1A |pages=194â199 |doi=10.1143/JJAP.45.194 |bibcode = 2006JaJAP..45..194L }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The video presented in the following reference shows the liquid phase convection during [[lithium niobate]] (LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) fiber pulling using a very small piece of [[platinum]] wire inside the liquid that is allowed to spin. {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-oynmLOYrg |title=Convection in Laser Heated Pedestal Growth technique |website=YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to see that it spins very fast. Even when it appears to be standing still, it is in fact spinning fast on its axis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1665">[[Mountain]]s and [[hill]]s can be characterized in several ways. Some mountains are [[volcano]]es and can be characterized by the type of lava and eruptive history. Other mountains are shaped by [[glacier|glacial]] processes and can be characterized by their shape. Finally, many mountains can be characterized by the type of rock that make up their composition.

The '''Lukoml power station''' ('''Lukoml [[GRES (power station)|GRES]], Lukomlskaya GRES, Lukomlskaya DRES''', {{lang-ru|ÐÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼Ð»ÑÑÐºÐ°Ñ ÐÐ Ð­Ð¡}}) is a [[natural gas]]-fired [[thermal power station]] located in [[Novolukoml]], [[Vitsebsk Voblast]], [[Belarus]].  It is operated by [[Belenergo]].

Construction of the power station started in 1964. It was built in two stages.  At the first stage, four double-boiler single-turbine units, each of 300&amp;nbsp;MW capacity, were commissioned in December 1969âSeptember 1971.  At the second stage, four single-boiler single-turbine units, each of 300&amp;nbsp;MW capacity, were added in December 1972âAugust 1974.&lt;ref name=lukoml&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000s the generation units were upgraded by 10% increasing the installed capacity up to 2,640&amp;nbsp;MW.

The three [[flue gas stack]]s, which serve also as electricity pylons for the outgoing power lines are {{convert|250|m}} tall and were built in 1969-1973.

[[File:JTM 45 MK II Reissue 1997.jpg|thumb|Marshall JTM45 MK II Reissue]]
The '''Marshall JTM45''' is the first [[guitar amplifier]] made by [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]]. First produced in 1963, it has been called a "seminal" amplifier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Dave|title=Guitar Rigs: Classic Guitar &amp; Amp Combinations|year=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-851-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1-kULtG9tgC&amp;pg=PA134|page=Back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is praised as the most desirable of all the company's amplifiers.&lt;ref name="pittman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pittman|first=Aspen|title=The Tube Amp Book|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-767-7|pages=66, 68â69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT1I7Ld76YsC&amp;pg=PA68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The JTM45 was first built in 1963, handmade in an all-aluminum chassis, by Ken Bran; Dudley Craven and Ken Underwood. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dudleycraven.com/ Dudley Craven] &lt;/ref&gt; Its first ever use in a live performance was in September 1963 when the first amp was tested at the [[Ealing Jazz Club | Ealing Club]], not far from the original Marshall shops. Bran &amp; Craven and Underwood were in attendance. Because of its power, Marshall decided early on to build it as a head, with a separate 4Ã12" cabinet with [[Celestion]] speakers. The amplifier itself was based on the [[Fender Bassman]]. It uses [[6V6]] valves, then the EL34 (though early versions had used US 5881, a version of the [[6L6]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Dave|title=Guitar Rigs: Classic Guitar &amp; Amp Combinations|year=2005 |publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-851-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1-kULtG9tgC&amp;pg=PA111|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the output stage, and [[ECC83]] ([[12AX7]]) valves in the pre-amplification stage.&lt;ref name="pittman" /&gt;. Dudley was responsible for the changes from the Fender to what is now known as the JTM45.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Significant differences between the Bassman and the JTM include the all-aluminum chassis, a 12AX7 valve as the first in the chain (the Bassman has a [[12AY7]]), the Celestion speakers with a closed cabinet (compared to open-backed [[Jensen Electronics|Jensen]] speakers), and a modified negative [[Feedback#Electronic engineering|feedback circuit]] which affects the harmonics produced by the amplifier. As Ken Bran later said, "The JTM also had different harmonic content, and this was due to the large amount of feedback that Dudley Craven had given it."&lt;ref name=doyle&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Michael|title=The History of Marshall: The Illustrated Story of "The Sound of Rock"|year=1993|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-7935-2509-6|pages=17â22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E90tMBs9_FEC&amp;pg=PA21|chapter=The JTM Series 1962â1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amp was also available as a bass (which lacked a "bright" capacitor) and a [[Public address|PA]] version (which lacked a "mixer" capacitor).&lt;ref name=doyle /&gt;

By the mid 1960s, the JTM45 had become so popular that it began to supplant the ubiquitous Vox amps, even their AC50, though it was just as powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Dave|title=Guitar Rigs: Classic Guitar &amp; Amp Combinations|year=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-851-3|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1965, Marshall introduced its now standard script lettering, in white, and by early 1966 it began calling the amplifiers "JTM 50".&lt;ref name=doyle /&gt; Some 100 early models had red lettering; these are especially collectible.&lt;ref name=pittman /&gt; Other cosmetic changes included a gradual change to different knobs. The JTM 45 became the basis for many subsequent Marshalls, most notably the [[Marshall Bluesbreaker|Marshall 1962 combo]] (later referred to as  the "Bluesbreaker" due to its use by Eric Clapton with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Batey|first=Rick|title=American Blues Guitar: An Illustrated History|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-634-02759-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10PtO6eF12UC&amp;pg=PA106|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased being produced in 1966, but was reissued in 1989, though with a modern printed circuit board and [[6L6]] output valves.&lt;ref name=doyle /&gt; In 2014 Marshall reissued a "handwired" 30 W amplifier based on the JTM45, the 2245THW, whose circuitry is identical to the 1962 combo circuit; it is a "fine high-end piece" according to ''[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]'', listed at $4,800.&lt;ref name=childs&gt;{{cite news|title=Bluesbreaker Redux: Marshall Handwired Series 2245THW head and 1960AHW Cabinet|last=Childs|first=Zac|date=October 2014|work=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name, numbering==
The first JTM45s did not have the standard Marshall number that later amps had; models that derived from the JTM 45 did not receive numbers until 1965.&lt;ref name=doyle /&gt;

==Sound==
For all of its differences when compared with the Bassman, the sound of the JTM45 is still described as "like a tweed Fender"; it has more sag and less crunch than the later Marshalls, and is favoured for blues and rock rather than for hard rock and metal.&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Dave|title=The Guitar Amp Handbook: Understanding Tube Amplifiers and Getting Great Sounds|year=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-863-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9hAviH6gqEC&amp;pg=PA75|pages=75â76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JTM 45 delivers a smooth Marshall "crunch" with a warm bass response due to the EL34/KT66 valves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2341">'''Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline''' is a {{convert|295|acre|km2|sing=on}} bayside park in the [[Brickyard Cove, Richmond, California|Brickyard Cove neighborhood]] of the [[Point Richmond, Richmond, California|Point Richmond District]] in [[Richmond, California]].

==Review==
The park is centered on the Miller/Knox lagoon which is depicted on a large 200 foot by 50 foot mural at the [[Richmond Municipal Natatorium]] nearby. The park affords panoramic views of the Bay Area especially the Oakland and San Francisco skylines, islands, bridges, and the North Bay mountains. The views are the farthest from the park's high point: Nicholls Knob. The regional shoreline includes [[Keller Beach]] on [[San Pablo Bay]] in addition to large picnic and barbecue areas, parking and a fishing pier. There is also a former train ferry pier and other assorted ruins. The park is also home to the [[Golden State Model Railroad Museum]].

==History==
The park is named for former state senator [[George Miller, Jr.]] and former State Assembly member and Point Richmond resident [[John T. Knox]].&lt;ref name="knox"&gt;[http://www.ebparks.org/parks/miller_knox Miller/Knox], access date 02-12-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plunge.jpeg|thumbnail|Mural of the lagoon at [[The Plunge]].]]

The park features many trails for cyclists, dog-walkers, and hikers, and a salt water lagoon where ducks, seagulls, and Canada Geese frolic.

The beach was closed due to an [[2007 San Francisco Bay oil spill|Cosco-Busan oil spill]] in 2007, but reopened months later.

{{Fats}}
In [[biochemistry]] and nutrition, '''monounsaturated fatty acids '''(abbreviated '''MUFAs''', or more plainly '''monounsaturated fats''') are [[fatty acids]] that have one [[double bond]] in the fatty acid chain with all of the remainder [[carbon]] [[atom]]s being [[single bond|single-bonded]]. By contrast, [[polyunsaturated]] fatty acids (PUFAs) have more than one double bond.

==Molecular description==
[[Fatty acid]]s are long-chained [[molecule]]s having an [[alkyl]] group at one end and a [[carboxylic acid]] group at the other end. Fatty acid [[viscosity]] (thickness) and [[melting point|melting temperature]] increases with decreasing number of double bonds; therefore, monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated fatty acids (more double bonds) and a lower melting point than [[saturated fat|saturated]] fatty acids (no double bonds). Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated resulting in a isotopic lattice structure.

Common monounsaturated fatty acids are [[palmitoleic acid]] (16:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7), cis-vaccenic acid (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7) and [[oleic acid]] (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;9). Palmitoleic acid has 16 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 7 carbon atoms away from the methyl group (and 9 carbons from the carboxyl end). It can be lengthened to the 18-carbon [[cis-vaccenic acid]]. Oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 9 carbon atoms away from the carboxylic acid group. The illustrations below show a molecule of oleic acid in Lewis formula and as a [[space-filling model]].

Monounsaturated fats protect against cardiovascular disease by providing more [[biological membrane|membrane]] fluidity than saturated fats, but they are more vulnerable to [[lipid peroxidation]] ([[rancidification|rancidity]]). The large scale KANWU study found that increasing monounsaturated fat and decreasing saturated fat intake could improve insulin sensitivity, but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low.&lt;ref&gt;

Studies have shown that substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure. More physical activity was associated with a higher-oleic acid diet than one of a [[palmitic acid]] diet. From the study, it is shown that more monounsaturated fats lead to less anger and irritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kien CL, Bunn JY, Tompkins CL, Dumas JA, Crain KI, Ebenstein DB, Koves TR, Muoio DM | title = Substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure and with changes in mood | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 689â97 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23446891 | pmc = 3607650 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.112.051730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels of [[oleic acid]] along with other monounsaturated fatty acids in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with [[breast cancer]] risk. The [[saturation index]] (SI) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Monounsaturated fats and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme [[delta-9 desaturase]] (Î9-d).&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] is one heavily influenced by monounsaturated fats. People in Mediterranean countries consume more total fat than Northern European countries, but most of the fat is in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison.

The '''Netherland Indies Gas Company''' ('''''Nederlandsch Indische Gasmaatschappij''''' ('''NIGM''') was a business in the [[Dutch East Indies]], [[Suriname]] and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. It was founded in 1863 in the Dutch East Indies and expanded to [[Suriname]] (1908)  and [[CuraÃ§ao]] (1927).

As of the World War II era, the company operated 11 gas plants and 33 power plants. The company became '''Overseas Gas and Electric Company''', Dutch: '''''Overzeese Gas- en Electriciteitsmaatschappij''''' ('''OGEM''') as of 1950. Indonesia nationalized the business in 1954. Operations in Suriname were nationalized in the 1970s. CuraÃ§ao operations were nationalized in 1977.

The company diversified into trading and construction with acquisitions. In 1959 the electrical installation company Croon &amp; Co Klaas Fibbe was purchased. In 1963, Wolter &amp; Dros. Klaas Fibbe was acquired. In 1969, Dutch technical wholesaler Technische Unie was taken over. Construction company Eesteren was bought in 1972 and Voormolen in 1975.

In September 1973 Fibbe Berend Jan Udink made became a board member and helped expand international activities of OGEM. From 1977 to 1979 construction project in [[Dammam]], [[Saudi Arabia]] was undertaken. The project includes eight buildings. In July 1977 OGEM bought an equity stake of 44% in Beton und Monierbau (B &amp; M) in DÃ¼sseldorf.

Many acquisitions were funded with debt and in the early 1980s OGEM went bankrupt after a loss of 120 million guilders in 1980. Parts of the company were reorganized under the name '''Engineering Building and Industry''' ('''TBI'''). Bankruptcy proceedings were completed in 1994.

The strong nuclear force is the strongest force in nature; however, its range is small (acting only over distances of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;â15&lt;/sup&gt; m). The strong nuclear force mediates both [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions.

'''On-die termination''' ('''ODT''') is the technology where the [[electrical termination|termination]] resistor for [[impedance matching]] in [[transmission line]]s is located inside a semiconductor chip instead of on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB).

== Overview of electronic signal termination ==
In lower frequency (slow edge rate) applications, interconnection lines can be modelled as "lumped" circuits. In this case there is no need to consider the concept of "termination". Under the low frequency condition, every point in an interconnect wire can be assumed to have the same voltage as every other point for any instance in time.

However, if the propagation delay in a wire, PCB trace, cable, or connector is significant (for example, if the delay is greater than 1/6 of the rise time of the digital signal), the "lumped" circuit model is no longer valid and the interconnect has to be analyzed as a [[transmission line]]. In a transmission line, the signal interconnect path is modeled as a circuit containing distributed inductance, capacitance and resistance throughout its length.

In order for a transmission line to minimize distortion of the signal, the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of every location on the transmission line should be uniform throughout its length. If there is any place in the line where the impedance is not uniform for some reason (open circuit, impedance discontinuity, different material) the signal gets modified by reflection at the impedance change point which results in distortion, ringing and so forth.

When the signal path has impedance discontinuity, in other words an impedance mismatch, then a termination impedance with the equivalent amount of impedance is placed at the point of line discontinuity. This is described as "termination". For example, resistors can be placed on computer motherboards to terminate high speed busses. There are several ways of termination depending on how the resistors are connected to the transmission line. Parallel termination and series termination are examples of termination methodologies.

== On-die termination ==
Instead of having the necessary resistive termination located on the motherboard, the termination is located inside the semiconductor chipsâtechnique called On-Die Termination (abbreviated to ODT).

=== Why is on-die termination needed? ===
Although the termination resistors on the motherboard reduce some reflections on the signal lines, they are unable to prevent reflections resulting from the stub lines that connect to the components on the module card (e.g. DRAM Module). A signal propagating from the controller to the components encounters an impedance discontinuity at the stub leading to the components on the module. The signal that propagates along the stub to the component (e.g. DRAM component) will be reflected back onto the signal line, thereby introducing unwanted [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] into the signal. In addition, on-die termination can reduce the number of resistor elements and complex wiring on the [[motherboard]]. Accordingly, the system design can be simpler and cost effective.

===Example of ODT: DRAM ===
On-die termination is implemented with several combinations of resistors on the DRAM silicon along with other circuit trees. DRAM circuit designers can use a combination of transistors which have different values of turn-on resistance. In the case of DDR2, there are three kinds of internal resistors 150ohm, 75ohm and 50ohm. The resistors can be combined to create a proper equivalent impedance value to the outside of the chip, whereby the signal line (transmission line) of the motherboard is being controlled by the on-die termination operation signal. Where an on-die termination value control circuit exists the DRAM controller manages the on-die termination resistance through a programmable configuration register which resides in the DRAM. The internal on-die termination values in DDR3 are 120ohm, 60ohm, 40ohm and so forth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16504">The '''paradox of a charge in a gravitational field''' is an apparent [[physical paradox]] in the context of [[general relativity]]. A [[charged particle]] at rest in a gravitational field, such as on the surface of the Earth, must be supported by a force to prevent it from falling. According to the [[equivalence principle]], it should be indistinguishable from a particle in [[Minkowski space|flat space]] being accelerated by a force. [[Maxwell's equations]] say that an accelerated charge should radiate [[electromagnetic waves]], yet such radiation is not observed for stationary particles in gravitational fields.

One of the first to study this problem was [[Max Born]] in his 1909 paper about the consequences of a charge in uniformly accelerated frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Born|first=Max|author-link=Max Born|date=1909|title=Die Theorie des starren Elektrons in der Kinematik des RelativitÃ¤tsprinzips|journal=Annalen der Physik|language=de|volume=335|issue=11|pages=1â56|doi=10.1002/andp.19093351102|issn=0003-3804|bibcode=1909AnP...335....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier concerns and possible solutions were raised by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] (1918),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OR4dw7ysQFQC&amp;dq=theory+of+relativity+pauli|title=Theory of Relativity|last=Pauli|first=Wolfgang|date=1958|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486641522|location=|pages=|language=en|author-link=Wolfgang Pauli}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max von Laue]] (1919),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kyUItgEACAAJ&amp;dq=editions:bJZnzEKJxhYC|title=Die RelativitÃ¤tstheorie|last=Laue|first=Max von|date=1919|publisher=F.

== Background ==
[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogv|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] demonstrated the theory of Galileo: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather. The paradox in this article considers the consequences of an experiment where one of the objects to release is electrically charged.]]
It is a standard result from [[Maxwell's equations]] of [[classical electrodynamics]] that an accelerated charge radiates. That is, it produces an electric field that falls off as &lt;math&gt;1/r&lt;/math&gt; in addition to its rest-frame &lt;math&gt;1/r^2&lt;/math&gt; Coulomb field. This radiation electric field has an accompanying magnetic field, and the whole oscillating electromagnetic radiation field propagates independently of the accelerated charge, carrying away momentum and energy. The energy in the radiation is provided by the work that accelerates the charge.

The theory of general relativity is built on the [[equivalence principle]] of gravitation and inertia. This principle states that it is impossible to distinguish through any local measurement whether one is in a gravitational field or being accelerated. An elevator out in deep space, far from any planet, could mimic a gravitational field to its occupants if it could be accelerated continuously "upward". Whether the acceleration is from motion or from gravity makes no difference in the laws of physics. One can also understand it in terms of the equivalence of so-called [[mass#Universal gravitational mass|gravitational mass]] and [[mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]]. The mass in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] (gravitational mass) is the same as the mass in [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]] (inertial mass). They cancel out when equated, with [[mass#Galilean free fall|the result]] discovered by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1638, that all bodies fall at the same rate in a gravitational field, independent of their mass. A famous demonstration of this principle was performed on the [[Moon]] during the [[Apollo 15]] mission, when a hammer and a feather were dropped at the same time and struck the surface at the same time.

Closely tied in with this equivalence is the fact that gravity vanishes in free fall. For objects falling in an elevator whose cable is cut, all gravitational forces vanish, and things begin to look like the free-floating absence of forces one sees in videos from the [[International Space Station]]. It is a linchpin of general relativity that everything must fall together in free fall. Just as with acceleration versus gravity, no experiment should be able to distinguish the effects of free fall in a gravitational field, and being out in deep space far from any forces.

==Statement of the paradox==
Putting together these two basic facts of general relativity and electrodynamics, we seem to encounter a paradox. For if we dropped a neutral particle and a charged particle together in a gravitational field, the charged particle should begin to radiate as it is accelerated under gravity, thereby losing energy and slowing relative to the neutral particle. Then a free-falling observer could distinguish free fall from the true absence of forces, because a charged particle in a free-falling laboratory would begin to be pulled upward relative to the neutral parts of the laboratory, even though no obvious electric fields were present.

Equivalently, we can think about a charged particle at rest in a laboratory on the surface of the Earth. In order to be at rest, it must be supported by something which exerts an upward force on it to balance the Earth's downward gravitational field of 1&amp;nbsp;''g''. This system is equivalent to being in outer space accelerated constantly upward at 1&amp;nbsp;''g'', and we know that a charged particle accelerated upward at 1&amp;nbsp;''g'' would radiate, why don't we see radiation from charged particles at rest in the laboratory? It would seem that we could distinguish between a gravitational field and acceleration, because an electric charge apparently only radiates when it is being accelerated through motion, but not through gravitation.

==Resolution by Rohrlich==
{{See also|Rindler coordinates}}
The resolution of this paradox, like the [[twin paradox]] and [[ladder paradox]], comes through appropriate care in distinguishing [[frames of reference]]. This section follows the analysis of [[Fritz Rohrlich]] (1965),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Rohrlich|1964|loc=sec. 8-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who shows that a charged particle and a neutral particle fall equally fast in a gravitational field. Likewise, a charged particle at rest in a gravitational field does not radiate in its rest frame, but it does so in the frame of a free falling observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rohrlich|first=Fritz|author-link=Fritz Rohrlich|year=1963|title=The principle of equivalence|journal=Annals of Physics|volume=22|issue=2|pages=169â191|citeseerx=10.1.1.205.7583}}|quote=See pages 13 and 14|via=CiteSeer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=GrÃ¼ndler|first=Gerold|date=2015-09-14|title=Electrical charges in gravitational fields, and Einstein's equivalence principle|eprint=1509.08757|page=7|class=physics.gen-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalence principle is preserved for charged particles.

The key is to realize that the laws of electrodynamics, Maxwell's equations, hold only within an [[inertial frame]], that is, in a frame in which all forces act locally, and there is no net acceleration when the net local forces are zero.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Harvnb|Feynman|Morinigo|Wagner|1995}}{{Quote|text=Of course, in a gravitational field the electrodynamic laws of Maxwell need to be modified, just as ordinary mechanics needed to be modified to satisfy the principle of relativity. After all, the Maxwell equations predict that light should travel in a straight line&amp;mdash;and it is found to fall towards a star.|sign=Richard Feynman|source=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frame could be free fall under gravity, or far in space away from any forces. The surface of the Earth is ''not'' an inertial frame, as it is being constantly accelerated. We know that the surface of the Earth is not an inertial frame because an object at rest there may not remain at restâobjects at rest fall to the ground when released. Gravity is a non-local fictitious âforceâ within the Earthâs surface frame, just like centrifugal âforceâ.  So we cannot naively formulate expectations based on Maxwell's equations in this frame. It is remarkable that we now understand the special-relativistic Maxwell equations do not hold, strictly speaking, on the surface of the Earth, even though they were discovered in electrical and magnetic experiments conducted in laboratories on the surface of the Earth. Nevertheless, in this case, we cannot apply Maxwell's equations to the description of a falling charge relative to a "supported", non-inertial observer.

Maxwell's equations can be applied relative to an observer in free fall, because free-fall is an inertial frame. So the starting point of considerations is to work in the free-fall frame in a gravitational fieldâa "falling" observer. In the free-fall frame, Maxwell's equations have their usual, flat-spacetime form for the falling observer. In this frame, the electric and magnetic fields of the charge are simple: the falling electric field is just the Coulomb field of a charge at rest, and the magnetic field is zero. As an aside, note that we are building in the equivalence principle from the start, including the assumption that a charged particle falls equally as fast as a neutral particle.

The fields measured by an observer supported on the surface of the Earth are different. Given the electric and magnetic fields in the falling frame, we have to transform those fields into the frame of the supported observer. This manipulation is ''not'' a Lorentz transformation, because the two frames have a relative acceleration. Instead, the machinery of [[general relativity]] must be used.

In this case the gravitational field is fictitious because it can be "transformed away" by appropriate choice of coordinate system in the falling frame. Unlike the total gravitational field of the Earth, here we are assuming that spacetime is locally flat, so that the [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]] vanishes. Equivalently, the lines of gravitational acceleration are everywhere parallel, with no convergences measurable in the laboratory. Then the most general static, flat-space, cylindrical [[metric tensor|metric]] and line element can be written:
:&lt;math&gt;
c^2 d\tau^2 = u^2(z)c^2dt^2 - \left( \frac{c^2}{g} \frac{du}{dz} \right)^2 dz^2 - dx^2 - dy^2,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is proper time, &lt;math&gt;x, y, z, t&lt;/math&gt; are the usual coordinates of space and time, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the gravitational field, and &lt;math&gt;u(z)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary function of the coordinate but must approach the observed Newtonian value of &lt;math&gt;1 + gz/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is the metric for the gravitational field measured by the supported observer.

Meanwhile, the metric in the frame of the falling observer is simply the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
c^2 d\tau^2 = c^2 dt'^2 - dz'^2 - dx'^2 - dy'^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

From these two metrics Rohrlich constructs the coordinate transformation between them:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x' &amp;= x, \\
y' &amp;= y, \\
\frac{g}{c^2} (z' - z_0') &amp;= u(z) \cosh g(t - t_0) - 1,\\
\frac{g}{c} (t' - t_0') &amp;= u(z) \sinh g(t - t_0).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

When this coordinate transformation is applied to the electric and magnetic fields of the charge in the rest frame, it is found not to be radiating, as expected for a charge in an inertial frame.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soker|first=Noam|last2=Harpaz|first2=Amos|year=2004|title=Radiation from a charge supported in a gravitational field|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FB%3AGERG.0000010478.00884.f8.pdf|journal=General Relativity and Gravitation|volume=36|issue=2|pages=15â330|arxiv=physics/9910019|doi=10.1023/B:GERG.0000010478.00884.f8|quote=See pages 2 and 4|via=Springer|bibcode=2004GReGr..36..315S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohrlich emphasizes that this charge remains at rest in its free-fall frame, just as a neutral particle would. Furthermore, the radiation rate for this situation is Lorentz-invariant, but it is not invariant under the coordinate transformation above because it is not a Lorentz transformation.

So a falling charge will not radiate, as expected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; What about a supported charge, then? Does it not radiate due to the equivalence principle? To answer this question, start again in the falling frame.

As observed from the freefalling frame, the supported charge appears to be accelerated uniformly upward. The case of constant acceleration of a charge is treated by Rohrlich.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rohrlich|1964|loc=sec. 5-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finds a charge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; uniformly accelerated at rate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has a radiation rate given by the Lorentz invariant:

:&lt;math&gt;
R = \frac{2}{3} \frac{e^2}{c^3} g^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding electric and magnetic fields of an accelerated charge are also given in Rohrlich.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To find the fields of the charge in the supporting frame, the fields of the uniformly accelerated charge are transformed according to the coordinate transformation previously given. When that is done, one finds ''no radiation'' in the supporting frame from a supported charge, because the magnetic field is zero in this frame. Rohrlich does note that the gravitational field slightly distorts the Coulomb field of the supported charge, but too small to be observable. So although the Coulomb law was discovered in a supporting frame, general relativity tells us that the field of such a charge is not precisely &lt;math&gt;1/r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Additional concerns ===
The radiation from the supported charge viewed in the freefalling frame (or vice versa) is something of a curiosity: where does it go? Boulware (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boulware |first=David G. |journal=Ann. Phys. |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=169â188 |title=Radiation from a Uniformly Accelerated Charge |doi=10.1016/0003-4916(80)90360-7|bibcode=1980AnPhy.124..169B |year=1980 |citeseerx=10.1.1.205.5420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; finds that the radiation goes into a region of spacetime inaccessible to the co-accelerating, supported observer. In effect, a uniformly accelerated observer has an event horizon, and there are regions of spacetime inaccessible to this observer. C. De Almeida and A. Saa (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Almeida |first=Camila |last2=Saa |first2=Alberto |journal=Am. J. Phys. |year= 2006 |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=154â158 |title=The radiation of a uniformly accelerated charge is beyond the horizon: A simple derivation |doi=10.1119/1.2162548|arxiv=physics/0506049 |bibcode=2006AmJPh..74..154D }}&lt;/ref&gt; have a more accessible treatment of the event horizon of the accelerated observer.

Rohrlich solution contradicts the [[bremsstrahlung]] effect{{how|date=February 2018}}. In any case, this solution could be considered a classic approach to a problem that cannot be handled in classical electrodynamics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6821">[[Image:Path.svg|thumb|The points traced by a path from ''A'' to ''B'' in '''R'''Â². However, different paths can trace the same set of points.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''path''' in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] ''f'' from the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0,1] to ''X''
:''f'' : ''I'' &amp;rarr; ''X''.
The ''initial point'' of the path is ''f''(0) and the ''terminal point'' is ''f''(1). One often speaks of a "path from ''x'' to ''y''" where ''x'' and ''y'' are the initial and terminal points of the path. Note that a path is not just a subset of ''X'' which "looks like" a [[curve]], it also includes a [[parameterization]]. For example, the maps ''f''(''x'') =  ''x'' and ''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; represent two different paths from 0 to 1 on the real line.

A '''[[Loop (topology)|loop]]''' in a space ''X'' based at ''x'' â ''X'' is a path from ''x'' to ''x''. A loop may be equally well regarded as a map ''f'' : ''I'' â ''X'' with ''f''(0) = ''f''(1) or as a continuous map from the [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X''
:''f'' : ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''X''.
This is because ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; may be regarded as a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of ''I'' under the identification 0 â¼ 1. The set of all loops in ''X'' forms a space called the [[loop space]] of ''X''.

A topological space for which there exists a path connecting any two points is said to be [[path-connected space|path-connected]]. Any space may be broken up into a set of [[path-connected component]]s. The set of path-connected components of a space ''X'' is often denoted Ï&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'');.

One can also define paths and loops in [[pointed space]]s, which are important in [[homotopy theory]]. If ''X'' is a topological space with basepoint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then a path in ''X'' is one whose initial point is ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Likewise, a loop in ''X'' is one that is based at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Homotopy of paths==
{{Main|Homotopy}}
[[Image:Homotopy between two paths.svg|thumb|right|A homotopy between two paths.]]
Paths and loops are central subjects of study in the branch of [[algebraic topology]] called [[homotopy theory]]. A [[homotopy]] of paths makes precise the notion of continuously deforming a path while keeping its endpoints fixed.

Specifically, a homotopy of paths, or '''path-homotopy''', in ''X'' is a family of paths ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''I'' â ''X'' indexed by ''I'' such that
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are fixed.
* the map ''F'' : ''I'' &amp;times; ''I'' â ''X'' given by ''F''(''s'', ''t'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') is continuous.
The paths ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; connected by a homotopy are said to be '''homotopic''' (or more precisely '''path-homotopic''', to distinguish between the relation defined on all continuous functions between fixed spaces). One can likewise define a homotopy of loops keeping the base point fixed.

The relation of being homotopic is an [[equivalence relation]] on paths in a topological space. The [[equivalence class]] of a path ''f'' under this relation is called the '''homotopy class''' of ''f'', often denoted [''f''].

==Path composition==
One can compose paths in a topological space in an obvious manner. Suppose ''f'' is a path from ''x'' to ''y'' and ''g'' is a path from ''y'' to ''z''. The path ''fg'' is defined as the path obtained by first traversing ''f'' and then traversing ''g'':
:&lt;math&gt;fg(s) = \begin{cases}f(2s) &amp; 0\leq s \leq \frac{1}{2} \\ g(2s-1) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \leq s \leq 1.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly path composition is only defined when the terminal point of ''f'' coincides with the initial point of ''g''. If one considers all loops based at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then path composition is a [[binary operation]].

Path composition, whenever defined, is not [[associative]] due to the difference in parametrization. However it ''is'' associative up to path-homotopy. That is, [(''fg'')''h''] = [''f''(''gh'')]. Path composition defines a [[group (mathematics)|group structure]] on the set of homotopy classes of loops based at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X''. The resultant group is called the [[fundamental group]] of ''X'' based at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, usually denoted Ï&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

In situations calling for associativity of path composition "on the nose," a path in ''X'' may instead be defined as a continuous map from an interval [0,''a''] to X for any real ''a'' â¥ 0.  A path ''f'' of this kind has a length |''f''| defined as ''a''.  Path composition is then defined as before with the following modification:
:&lt;math&gt;fg(s) = \begin{cases}f(s) &amp; 0\leq s \leq |f| \\ g(s-|f|) &amp; |f| \leq s \leq |f|+|g|\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Whereas with the previous definition, ''f'', ''g'', and ''fg'' all have length 1 (the length of the domain of the map), this definition makes |''fg''| = |''f''| + |''g''|.  What made associativity fail for the previous definition is that although (''fg'')''h'' and ''f''(''gh'') have the same length, namely 1, the midpoint of (''fg'')''h'' occurred between ''g'' and ''h'', whereas the midpoint of ''f''(''gh'') occurred between ''f'' and ''g''.  With this modified definition (''fg'')''h'' and ''f''(''gh'') have the same length, namely |''f''|+|''g''|+|''h''|, and the same midpoint, found at (|''f''|+|''g''|+|''h''|)/2 in both (''fg'')''h'' and ''f''(''gh''); more generally they have the same parametrization throughout.

==Fundamental groupoid==
There is a [[category theory|categorical]] picture of paths which is sometimes useful. Any topological space ''X'' gives rise to a [[category (mathematics)|category]] where the objects are the points of ''X'' and the [[morphism]]s are the homotopy classes of paths. Since any morphism in this category is an [[isomorphism]] this category is a [[groupoid]], called the [[fundamental groupoid]] of ''X''. Loops in this category are the [[endomorphism]]s (all of which are actually [[automorphism]]s). The [[automorphism group]] of a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' is just the fundamental group based at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. More generally, one can define the fundamental groupoid on any subset ''A'' of ''X'', using homotopy classes of paths joining points of ''A''. This is convenient for the [[Van Kampen's Theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2384">The '''People Powered Vehicle''', or PPV, was a two-person pedal-powered car introduced in the United States during the [[1970s energy crisis|oil crisis of the early 1970s]].  Manufactured by EVI of [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]], it sold for less than $400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=People+powered+vehicle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vpsQUaDtL8SIrAHVloGAAw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=People%20powered%20vehicle&amp;f=false|title=Pedal cars: the gasless way to go|last=Galleger|first=Sheldon M.|date=May 1974|work=Popular Mechanics|page=98|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it offered luggage space and was marketed as a fun and practical vehicle, it offered limited weather protection and was not fast enough to substitute for a car.

The PPV may be considered a forerunner of the modern [[velomobile]].  This tricycle was manufactured with a three-speed, floor shift, open type transmission with a single-wheel drive.  Either the driver or the passenger could pedal independently or as a team.  Reverse was accomplished by reaching outside and turning one of the rear wheels by hand.  At one time, a rear-hinged, surrey top was available.  Most were manufactured with a dark blue bottom and a white hood.  Red or yellow bottoms with white tops were also offered.  Sometimes bicycle accessories were added, e.g. squeeze bulb horn and a rear view mirror.

The PPV was designed for two adult riders, and with frame and body the total weight could approach three times that of a conventional single-rider bicycle.  However, the PPV was fitted with just one brake, of a type intended to be just one of two brakes on a conventional single-rider bicycle (an Atom drum brake built in to the front wheel).  Thus, even at relaxed speeds on level ground, the PPV brakes were dangerously inadequate.

An upgraded version of this vehicle is currently (2011) being offered by the International Surrey Company Ltd. under the trade name Impello.

'''Pink algae''' is a growth of pink, slimey bacterial matter which can sometimes occur in pools and sometimes in laboratory tubings.  The title is a misnomer, because, as noted before, pink algae is actually caused by a [[bacterium]], in the genus [[methylobacterium]].  The color of the bacterial growth comes from pigments within its cells.  The slime formed around the bacteria provides it with a relatively high level of protection from external threats.  Like other species in its genus, pink algae is a methane consuming bacterium.  It has an affinity for the matrix of PVC plastics, and will attach itself to both the inside and the outside of PVC materials inside of the pool.  Pink algae infestation in a pool often occurs alongside an infestation of [[white water mold]].

==Prevention==

Prevention of pink algae is the easiest way to deal with the problem.  To ensure that pink algae does not grow in a pool, the owner must manually brush and clean all pool surfaces weekly, and regularly expose all pools surfaces to sunlight (pink algae thrives in a dark environment, particularly in areas with slow moving water).  Regular doses of certain chemicals are also recommended in a preventative plan against pink algae.

==Treatment==

All visible pink algae must be manually removed from a pool.  A dose of algicide, followed by a shock treatment is also necessary to destroy the bacteria.  The pool filter must be run constantly until the water is clear and halogen or peroxide levels are normal, then the filter must be chemically cleaned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="109207">'''Power-to-weight ratio''' (or '''specific power''' or '''power-to-mass ratio''') is a calculation commonly applied to [[engine]]s and mobile power sources to enable the comparison of one unit or design to another. Power-to-weight ratio is a measurement of actual performance of any engine or power source. It is also used as a measurement of performance of a [[vehicle]] as a whole, with the [[Engine power|engine's power output]] being divided by the weight (or [[mass]]) of the vehicle, to give a metric that is independent of the vehicle's size. Power-to-weight is often quoted by manufacturers at the peak value, but the actual value may vary in use and variations will affect performance.

The inverse of power-to-weight, weight-to-power ratio (power loading) is a calculation commonly applied to aircraft, cars, and vehicles in general, to enable the comparison of one vehicle's performance to another. Power-to-weight ratio is equal to thrust per unit mass multiplied by the velocity of any vehicle.

==Power-to-weight (specific power)==

The power-to-weight ratio (Specific Power) formula for an engine (power plant) is the [[power (physics)|power]] generated by the engine divided by the mass. ("Weight" in this context is a colloquial term for "mass". To see this, note that what an engineer means by the "power to weight ratio" of an electric motor is not infinite in a zero gravity environment.)

A typical turbocharged V8 diesel engine might have an engine power of {{convert|250|kW|abbr=on}} and a mass of {{convert|380|kg|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="gmduramax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eogld.ecomm.gm.com/images/mediumduty/techspecs/engine.pdf|title=General Motors 2009 Data Book|date=September 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102194334/http://eogld.ecomm.gm.com/images/mediumduty/techspecs/engine.pdf|archivedate=November 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 0.65&amp;nbsp;kW/kg&amp;nbsp;(0.40&amp;nbsp;hp/lb).

Examples of high power-to-weight ratios can often be found in turbines. This is because of their ability to operate at very high speeds. For example, the [[Space Shuttle]]'s main engines used [[turbopump]]s (machines consisting of a pump driven by a turbine engine) to feed the propellants (liquid oxygen and [[liquid hydrogen]]) into the engine's combustion chamber. The original liquid hydrogen turbopump is similar in size to an automobile engine (weighing approximately {{convert|775|lb|kg|order=flip}}) and produces 72,000 [[horsepower|hp]] (53.6 [[megawatt|MW]])&lt;ref name="ssmetpb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090004620_2008048278.pdf|publisher=[[NASA]]|title=Lessons in Systems Engineering - The SSME Weight Growth History|first=Richard|last=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a power-to-weight ratio of 153&amp;nbsp;kW/kg&amp;nbsp;(93&amp;nbsp;hp/lb).

===Physical interpretation===

In [[classical mechanics]], instantaneous [[Power (physics)|power]] is the limiting value of the average work done per unit time as the time interval Î''t'' approaches zero.
:&lt;math&gt;
P = \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \tfrac{\Delta W(t)}{\Delta t} = \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} P_\mathrm{avg}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The typically used metrical unit of the power-to-weight ratio is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{W}{kg}\;&lt;/math&gt; which equals &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{m^2}{s^3}\;&lt;/math&gt;. This fact allows one to express the power-to-weight ratio purely by [[SI base unit]]s.

====Propulsive power====

If the work to be done is [[wikt:rectilinear|rectilinear]] motion of a body with constant [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt;, whose [[center of mass]] is to be accelerated along a [[Euclidean vector|straight line]] to a speed &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v}(t)|\;&lt;/math&gt; and angle &lt;math&gt;\phi\;&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the centre and [[Spherical coordinate system|radial]] of a [[gravitational field]] by an onboard [[powertrain|powerplant]], then the associated [[kinetic energy]] to be delivered to the body is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; E_K =\tfrac{1}{2} m|\mathbf{v}(t)|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt; is mass of the body
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v}(t)|\;&lt;/math&gt; is speed of the [[center of mass]] of the body, changing with time.

The instantaneous mechanical pushing/pulling power delivered to the body from the powerplant is then

:&lt;math&gt; P_K =\tfrac{1}{2} m 2|\mathbf{v}(t)| \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \tfrac{\Delta |\mathbf{v}(t)|}{\Delta t} =  m \mathbf{a}(t) \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) = \mathbf{F}(t) \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) = \mathbf{\tau}(t) \cdot \mathbf{\omega}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration of the [[center of mass]] of the body, changing with time.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is linear force â or thrust â applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is [[velocity]] of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is [[torque]] applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is [[angular velocity]] of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.

In propulsion, power is only delivered if the powerplant is in motion, and is transmitted to cause the body to be in motion. It is typically assumed here that mechanical transmission allows the powerplant to operate at peak output power. This assumption allows engine tuning to trade [[power band]] width and engine mass for transmission complexity and mass. [[Electric motor]]s do not suffer from this tradeoff, instead trading their high [[torque]] for [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] at low speed. The '''[[Mechanical advantage|power advantage]]''' or '''power-to-weight ratio''' is then

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{P-to-W} = \frac{|\mathbf{a}(t)||\mathbf{v}(t)|}{|\mathbf{g}|}\;&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v}(t)|\;&lt;/math&gt; is linear speed of the [[center of mass]] of the body.

====Engine power====

The actual useful power of any traction engine can be calculated using a [[dynamometer]] to measure [[torque]] and [[rotational speed]], with peak power sustained when the transmission and/or operator keeps the [[dot product|product]] of torque and rotational speed maximised. For jet engines there is e be usefully calculated there, for rockets there is typically no cruise speed, so it is less meaningful.

Peak power of a traction engine occurs at a rotational speed higher than the speed when torque is maximised and at or below the maximum rated rotational speed â Max RPM. A rapidly falling torque curve would correspond with sharp torque and power curve peaks around their maxima at similar rotational speed, for example a small, lightweight engine with a large turbocharger. A slowly falling or near flat torque curve would correspond with a slowly rising power curve up to a maximum at a rotational speed close to Max RPM, for example a large, heavy multi-cylinder engine suitable for cargo/hauling. A falling torque curve could correspond with a near flat power curve across rotational speeds for smooth handling at different vehicle speeds, such as a traction electric motor.

==Examples==

===Engines===

====Heat engines and heat pumps====
Thermal energy is made up from [[Sensible heat|molecular]] [[kinetic energy]] and [[Latent heat|latent]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]] energy. [[Heat engine]]s are able to convert thermal energy in the form of a temperature gradient between a hot source and a cold sink into other desirable [[Work (physics)|mechanical work]]. [[Heat pump]]s take [[Work (physics)|mechanical work]] to regenerate thermal energy in a temperature gradient. Care should be made when interpreting propulsive power, especially for jet engines and rockets, deliverable from heat engines to a vehicle.

===Electrochemical (galvanic) and electrostatic cell systems===

====(Closed cell) batteries====
All electrochemical cell batteries deliver a changing voltage as their chemistry changes from "charged" to "discharged". A nominal output voltage and a cutoff voltage are typically specified for a battery by its manufacturer. The output voltage falls to the cutoff voltage when the battery becomes "discharged". The nominal output voltage is always less than the open-circuit voltage produced when the battery is "charged". The temperature of a battery can affect the power it can deliver, where lower temperatures reduce power. Total energy delivered from a single charge cycle is affected by both the battery temperature and the power it delivers. If the temperature lowers or the power demand increases, the total energy delivered at the point of "discharge" is also reduced.

Battery discharge profiles are often described in terms of a factor of [[Battery (electricity)#Capacity and discharging|battery capacity]]. For example, a battery with a nominal capacity quoted in ampere-hours (Ah) at a C/10 rated discharge current (derived in amperes) may safely provide a higher discharge current â and therefore higher power-to-weight ratio â but only with a lower energy capacity. Power-to-weight ratio for batteries is therefore less meaningful without reference to corresponding energy-to-weight ratio and cell temperature. This relationship is known as [[Peukert's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peukert|first=W.|title=Ãber die AbhÃ¤ngigkeit der KapazitÃ¤t von der EntladestromstÃ¤rke bei Bleiakkumulatoren|journal=Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift|volume=20|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrostatic, electrolytic and electrochemical capacitors====
[[Capacitor]]s store electric charge onto two electrodes separated by an electric field semi-insulating ([[dielectric]]) medium. Electrostatic capacitors feature planar electrodes onto which electric charge accumulates. [[Electrolytic capacitor]]s use a liquid electrolyte as one of the electrodes and the [[Double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer effect]] upon the surface of the dielectric-electrolyte boundary to increase the amount of charge stored per unit volume. [[Electric double-layer capacitor]]s extend both electrodes with a [[Nanopore|nanopourous]] material such as [[activated carbon]] to significantly increase the surface area upon which electric charge can accumulate, reducing the dielectric medium to nanopores and a very thin high [[permittivity]] separator.

While capacitors tend not to be as temperature sensitive as batteries, they are significantly capacity constrained and without the strength of chemical bonds suffer from self-discharge. Power-to-weight ratio of capacitors is usually higher than batteries because charge transport units within the cell are smaller (electrons rather than ions), however energy-to-weight ratio is conversely usually lower.

====Fuel cell stacks and flow cell batteries====
[[Fuel cell]]s and [[Flow battery|flow cells]], although perhaps using similar chemistry to batteries, have the distinction of not containing the energy storage medium or [[fuel]]. With a continuous flow of fuel and oxidant, available fuel cells and flow cells continue to convert the energy storage medium into electric energy and waste products. Fuel cells distinctly contain a fixed electrolyte whereas flow cells also require a continuous flow of electrolyte. Flow cells typically have the fuel dissolved in the electrolyte.

===Vehicles===
Power-to-weight ratios for vehicles are usually calculated using [[curb weight]] (for cars) or wet weight (for motorcycles), that is, excluding weight of the driver and any cargo. This could be slightly misleading, especially with regard to motorcycles, where the driver might weigh 1/3 to 1/2 as much as the vehicle itself. In the sport of competitive cycling athlete's performance is increasingly being expressed in [[VAM (bicycling)|VAM]]s and thus as a power-to-weight ratio in W/kg. This can be measured through the use of a bicycle powermeter or calculated from measuring incline of a road climb and the rider's time to ascend it.&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingfitness.net/what-is-vam-and-how-to-calculate-it/|title=What is VAM and How to Calculate it?|accessdate=2010-06-25|date=2009-07-24|publisher=Cycling Fitness|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012184203/http://www.cyclingfitness.net/what-is-vam-and-how-to-calculate-it/|archivedate=2009-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Utility and practical vehicles====
Most vehicles are designed to meet passenger comfort and cargo carrying requirements. Different designs trade off power-to-weight ratio to increase comfort, cargo space, [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], [[Automobile emissions control|emissions control]], [[energy security]] and endurance. [[Automotive aerodynamics|Reduced drag]] and [[Low-rolling resistance tyres|lower rolling resistance]] in a vehicle design can facilitate increased cargo space without increase in the (zero cargo) power-to-weight ratio. This increases the role flexibility of the vehicle. Energy security considerations can trade off power (typically decreased) and weight (typically increased), and therefore power-to-weight ratio, for [[Flexible fuel vehicle|fuel flexibility]] or [[Hybrid vehicle|drive-train hybridisation]]. Some utility and practical vehicle variants such as [[hot hatch]]es and [[SUV|sports-utility vehicles]] reconfigure power (typically increased) and weight to provide the perception of [[sports car]] like performance or for other [[Criticism of sport utility vehicles|psychological benefit]].

A [[locomotive]] generally must be very heavy in order to develop enough [[adhesion railway|adhesion on the rails]] to start a train.  As the [[coefficient of friction]] between steel wheels and rails seldom exceeds 0.25 in most cases, improving a locomotive's power-to-weight ratio is often counterproductive. However, the choice of power transmission system, such as [[variable-frequency drive]] versus [[dc motor|direct current drive]], may support a higher power-to-weight ratio by better managing propulsion power.

=====Performance luxury, roadsters and mild sports=====
Increased engine performance is a consideration, but also other features associated with [[luxury vehicle]]s. [[Longitudinal engine]]s are common. Bodies vary from [[hot hatch]]es, [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans (saloons)]], [[coupÃ©]]s, [[Convertible (car)|convertibles]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]]. Mid-range [[Dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] and [[Cruiser (motorcycle)|cruiser]] motorcycles tend to have similar power-to-weight ratios.

===Human===
Power to weight ratio is important in cycling, since it determines acceleration and the speed during hill climbs. Since a cyclist's power to weight output decreases with fatigue, it is normally discussed with relation to the length of time that he or she maintains that power. A professional cyclist can produce over 20 W/kg as a 5-second maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/power-profiling|title=Power Profiling - TrainingPeaks|date=10 October 2008|publisher=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A 225-pound touring cyclist coasting down an exhilarating 10-degree mountain slope at 35 miles per hour rates 62 pounds per horsepower. The calculation is demonstrative and does not imply terminal speed. The power figure is 3.6 horsepower. In ISO units, this is 27 W/kg. In 60 seconds of such coasting, therefore, 39 kcal are lost, or 45 watt-hours. Climbing is the major impediment to progress on road when cycling.

[[Image:Rescueplan.jpg|thumbnail|Right|President George W. Bush delivers a statement at the White House regarding the economic rescue plan]]
'''Public Law 110-343''' ({{USStatute|110|343|122|3765|2008|10|3}}) is a US [[Act of Congress]] [[signed into law]] by [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]], which was designed to mitigate the growing [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis of the late-2000s]] by giving relief to so-called "Troubled Assets."&lt;ref name ='White House-Press Release-2008-10-03'&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/10/print/20081003-17.html President Bush Signs H.R. 1424 Into Law], White House Press Release, October 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2008/10/ptc_itc_extension_2008.php|title=Renewable Energy Tax Credits Extended as Far as 2016 (Energy Priorities Archives)|website=energypriorities.com|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its formal title is "An Act To provide authority for the Federal Government to purchase and insure certain types of troubled assets for the purposes of providing stability to and preventing disruption in the economy and financial system and protecting taxpayers, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for energy production and conservation, to extend certain expiring provisions, to provide individual income tax relief, and for other purposes."

The Act created a $700 billion [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] under the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] ([[S:Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|division A]]), and also enacted the ''Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008'' ([[s:Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008|division B]]), ''Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008'' ([[s:Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008|division C]]), which also included the ''Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008'', and the ''Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008''.&lt;ref name= "LOC-THOMAS-HR1424"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "USPL-110-343"&gt;{{USPL|110|343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history==
{{main|Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008}}
The first version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (structured as an amendment to {{USBill|110|H.R.|3997}}) was rejected by the House of Representatives on September 29.

After its defeat, Senate leaders decided to amend an existing bill from the House in order to circumvent the revenue [[origination clause]] of [[U.S. Constitution]], and chose H.R. 1424 as the vehicle for the legislation.&lt;ref name='NYT-Pear-2008-10-01'&gt;

The Constitution says, "All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills." The Senate version of the bailout package is technically an amendment to a House bill that would require group health insurance plans to provide equivalence, or parity, in the coverage of mental and physical illnesses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Senate Calendar-2008-10-01'&gt;

== Three divisions of the Act ==

===Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008===
{{main|Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Troubled Asset Relief Program}}

The ''Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008'' is part of an effort to [[bailout|bail out]] firms holding mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to restore liquidity to the credit markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tbm.thebigmoney.com/articles/juicy-bits/2008/10/01/bailout-baloney?page=full |title=Bailout Baloney: What do wooden children's arrows have to do with the credit crisis? |first=Karim |last=Bardeesy  |publisher=The Big Money |date=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}

The ''Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008'' contains a new tax credit for [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s for less than a year after the first 250,000 are sold. The credit is a base $2,500 plus $417 for each [[kWh]] of battery pack capacity in excess of 4 kWh to a maximum of $15,000 for any vehicle with a [[gross vehicle weight rating]] of more than {{convert|26000|lb}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1008.html|title=$1Billion Plug-In Incentives Will Speed Auto Industry's Transformation|website=www.calcars.org|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to $7,500 for 12 kWh or more in passenger cars (vehicles up to {{convert|8500|lb}} ).

It also extends existing tax credits for [[renewable energy]] initiatives, including [[cellulosic ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] development, and [[wind power in the United States|wind]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]] and [[hydro-electric power]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2008/10/plug-in-tax-credits-hitching-ride-on-wall-street-bail-out-bill.html&lt;/ref&gt; It establishes [[electricity]] as a clean-burning fuel for tax purposes.

Separately, this section also requires the reporting of [[cost basis]] by brokers to the IRS for certain securities acquired after 2011 â see [[covered security]].

===Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008===
The ''Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act'' includes $100 billion in tax breaks for businesses and the [[middle class]], plus a provision to raise the cap on [[federal deposit insurance]] from $100,000 to $250,000.&lt;ref name=Babington&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.11alive.com/news/article/121896/12/Bush-Lobbies-Congress-To-Pass-700B-Bailout-Bill- | title=Bush lobbies Congress to pass $700B bailout bill | first=Charles | last=Babington |author2=Julie Hirsschfeld Davis  |publisher=Associated Press | date=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act keeps the [[alternative minimum tax]] from hitting 20 million middle-income Americans. It provides $8 billion in tax relief for those hit by natural disasters in [[the Midwest]], [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=Babington/&gt;

As a whole, the Senate tax package would cost $150.5 billion over 10 years. Roughly $43.5 billion would be offset by several revenue-raising provisions. [[Hedge fund]] managers would be forbidden from using [[offshore corporation]]s to defer paying taxes.&lt;ref name='NYT-Pear-2008-10-01'/&gt;

The bill freezes a [[tax deduction]] that [[oil companies|oil and gas companies]] get for certain domestic production activities. The deduction, now 6 percent, is scheduled to rise to 9 percent in 2010.&lt;ref name='NYT-Pear-2008-10-01'/&gt;

==== Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 ====
{{main|Mental Health Parity Act#Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act}}
The ''Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008'' (a part of Division C) mandates that if U.S. [[health insurance]] companies provide coverage for mental health and substance abuse, the coverage must be equal for conditions such as [[psychological disorder]]s, [[alcoholism]], and [[drug addiction]].&lt;ref name="USPL-110-343"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/6043529.html|title=Equal treatment: A bailout law bonus â equal coverage for mental and physical illness|date=2008-10-06|work=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Aaron | last=Glantz | title=U.S. Insurers Told to Cover Mental Health Equally | date=2008-10-07 | url =http://us.oneworld.net/places/yemen/-/article/357889-insurers-required-cover-mental-health-equally | work =OneWorld | accessdate = 2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This act continues and expands upon the previous [[Mental Health Parity Act of 1996]]. It states that financial requirements such as deductibles and copayments and lifetime or dollar limits to mental health benefits and substance abuse disorder benefits should be no more restrictive than those on medical and surgical benefits.&lt;ref name="The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA)|url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fsmhpaea.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; MHPAEA applies to employer-sponsored health insurance plans with more than 50 employees, though parity is also extended to small group and individual plans under the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beronio |first1=Kirsten |last2=Po |first2=Rosa |last3=Skopec |first3=Laura |last4=Glied |first4=Sherry|authorlink4=Sherry Glied |title=Affordable Care Act Expands Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Benefits and Federal Parity Protections for 62 Million Americans|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2013/mental/rb_mental.cfm|accessdate=10 December 2013|date=February 20, 2013 |website=ASPE: Office of The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
The Act increased the statutory limit on the public debt by US$700 billion to US$11.3 trillion. However, the legislation is designed to have a net zero long-term cost, and includes language that mandates the President and Congress to develop a plan to recoup any money that is not recouped within 5 years.&lt;ref name='LOC-THOMAS-HR1424'&gt;{{cite news | title= H.R.1424  | date= 2008-10-03  | publisher= Library of Congress | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR1424: | work = THOMAS | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-03 }} (Access to legislative history of H.R. 1424)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/98xx/doc9852/hr1424Dodd.htm|title=Letter from Congressional Budget Office Director|last=Orszag|first=Peter|date=2008-10-01|publisher=[[Congressional Budget Office]]|accessdate=9 May 2010|quote=That net cost is likely to be substantially less than $700 billion but is more likely than not to be greater than zero.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''regulated power supply''' is an embedded circuit; it converts unregulated AC (Alternating Current)into a constant DC. With the help of a rectifier it converts AC supply into DC. Its function is to supply a stable voltage (or less often current), to a circuit or device that must be operated within certain power supply limits. The output from the regulated power supply may be alternating or unidirectional, but is nearly always DC ([[Direct Current]]).&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;{{Google books|Yc1CPgAACAAJ|Regulated Power Supplies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of stabilization used may be restricted to ensuring that the output remains within certain limits under various load conditions, or it may also include compensation for variations in its own supply source. The latter is much more common today.

==Applications==
* D.C. variable bench supply (a '''bench power supply''' usually refers to a [[power supply]] capable of supplying a variety of output voltages useful for BE ([[bench testing]]) electronic circuits, possibly with continuous variation of the output voltage, or just some preset voltages; a laboratory (lab) power supply normally implies an accurate bench power supply, while a balanced or tracking power supply refers to twin supplies for use when a circuit requires both positive and negative supply rails). 
* Mobile Phone power adaptors
* Regulated power supplies in appliances
* Various amplifiers and oscillators

==Topology &amp; Technology==
Many topologies have been used since the regulated supply was invented. Early technologies included [[iron-hydrogen resistor]]s, resonant transformers, nonlinear resistors, loading resistors, neon stabiliser tubes, vibrating contact regulators etc.

Modern regulated supplies mostly use a transformer, silicon diode bridge recitfier, reservoir capacitor and voltage regulator IC. There are variations on this theme, such as supplies with multiple voltage lines, variable regulators, power control lines, discrete circuits and so on. Switched mode regulator supplies also include an inductor.

At times regulated supplies can be much more complex. An example supply from a 1980s TV which used bidirectional interaction between the main supply and the line output stage to operate, generating a range of output voltages with varying amounts of stabilisation. Since neither stage could start without the other running, the supply also included a kickstart system to pulse the system into operation. The supply also monitored voltages in the TV power circuitry, shutting down if these voltages went out of spec. For special applications, supplies can become even more complex.

A '''saturated fat''' is a type of [[fat]] in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly [[single bond]]s.  A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]]. Fats are made of long chains of carbon (C) atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by [[double bond]]s (-C=C-).&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reece, Jane |author2=Campbell, Neil |title=Biology|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|location=San Francisco|year=2002|pages= 69â70|isbn=0-8053-6624-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds. They are called [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]], because the second bond is broken up and each half of the bond is attached to (saturated with) a hydrogen atom. Most animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Saturated fats tend to have higher [[melting point]]s than their corresponding unsaturated fats, leading to the popular understanding that saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperatures, while unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature with varying degrees of viscosity (meaning both saturated and unsaturated fats are found to be liquid at body temperature).

Various fats contain different proportions of saturated and [[unsaturated fat]].

==Fat profiles==
While nutrition labels regularly combine them, the saturated fatty acids appear in different proportions among food groups.  [[Lauric acid|Lauric]] and [[Myristic acid|myristic]] acids are most commonly found in "tropical" oils (e.g., [[Palm kernel oil|palm kernel]], [[Coconut oil|coconut]]) and dairy products.  The saturated fat in meat, [[egg (food)|eggs]], cacao, and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] is primarily the triglycerides of [[Palmitic acid|palmitic]] and [[Stearic acid|stearic]] acids.

==Association with diseases==

Since the 1950s, it has been demonstrated that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fat/NU00262 | title = Dietary fats: Know which types to choose | publisher = [[Mayo Clinic]] | date = 2011-02-15 | accessdate = 2011-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fats and cholesterol|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/|publisher=Harvard University, TH Chan School of Public Health|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small, limited number of [[systematic reviews]] have examined the relationship between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease and have come to different conclusions. However, these rely on observational studies and can therefore not be used to establish cause and effect relationships:

A 2017 systematic review by the American Heart Association of randomized controlled [[clinical trial]]s showed that reducing intake of dietary saturated fat and replacing it with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats could reduce cardiovascular disease by  about 30%, similar to the reduction achieved by [[statin]] treatment for maintaining [[blood cholesterol]] within normal limits.&lt;ref name=aha2017/&gt;

A different 2017 systematic review of randomized, controlled trials concluded that replacing saturated fats with mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fats is unlikely to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) events, CHD mortality or total mortality. The 2017 review showed that inadequately controlled trials (e.g., failing to control for other lifestyle factors) that were included in earlier meta-analyses explain the prior results.&lt;ref name="Hamley2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamley|first1=S|title=The effect of replacing saturated fat with mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fat on coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials|journal=Nutrition Journal|date=May 2017|volume=16|issue=1|page=30|doi=10.1186/s12937-017-0254-5|pmid=28526025|pmc=5437600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 systematic review also found no association between saturated fat consumption and risk of heart disease, stroke, or diabetes. However, this study only looked at observational studies, and can therefore not be used to determine cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intake of saturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids and risk of all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=BMJ|date=Aug 12, 2015|volume=351|issue=h3978|doi=10.1136/bmj.h3978|pmid=26268692|pmc=4532752|author=de Souza RJ, Mente A, Maroleanu A, Cozma AI, Ha V, Kishibe T, Uleryk E, Budylowski P, SchÃ¼nemann H, Beyene J, Anand SS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 systematic review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids, observational studies of measured fatty acid levels in the blood, and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation concluded that the findings â³do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids.â³&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chowdhury R, Warnakula S, Kunutsor S, Crowe F, Ward HA, Johnson L, Franco OH, Butterworth AS, Forouhi NG, Thompson SG, Khaw KT, Mozaffarian D, Danesh J, Di Angelantonio E | title = Association of dietary, circulating, and supplement fatty acids with coronary risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Ann.

The consumption of saturated fat is generally considered a risk factor for [[dyslipidemia]], which in turn is a risk factor for some types of [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url =  http://www.fph.org.uk/uploads/ps_fat.pdf | title = Position Statement on Fat | author = Faculty of Public Health of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom | accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH/docs/who_fao_expert_report.pdf | title = Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases | publisher = World Health Organization | author = Report of a Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cholesterol | url = http://www.irishheart.ie/iopen24/cholesterol-t-7_20_87.html | accessdate = 2011-02-28 | publisher  = Irish Heart Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Abnormal blood lipid levels, that is high total cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL, "bad" cholesterol) or low levels of [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL, "good" cholesterol) cholesterol are all associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;ref name=WorldHeartFederation /&gt;

====Colorectal cancer====
One review found limited evidence for a positive relationship between consuming animal fat and incidence of colorectal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Methods Mol Biol|year=2009|volume=472|pages=361â72|doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_16|title=Acquired risk factors for colorectal cancer|author=Lin OS|pmid=19107442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ovarian cancer====
A meta-analysis of eight observational studies published in 2001 found a statistically significant positive relationship between saturated fat and ovarian cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huncharek M, Kupelnick B | title = Dietary fat intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis of 6,689 subjects from 8 observational studies | journal = Nutrition and Cancer | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 87â91 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11962260 | doi = 10.1207/S15327914NC402_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a 2013 study found that a pooled analysis of 12 cohort studies observed no association between total fat intake and ovarian cancer risk.    Further analysis revealed that omega-3 fatty acids were protective against ovarian cancer and that trans fats were a risk factor.&lt;ref&gt;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/73/8_MeetingAbstracts/148{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study revealed that histological subtypes should be examined in determining the impact of dietary fat on ovarian cancer, rather than an oversimplified focus on total fat intake.

These associations may, however, reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls, rather than being an actual cause.&lt;ref name="saturated"/&gt;

===Bones===
Mounting evidence indicates that the amount and type of fat in the diet can have important effects on bone health. Most of this evidence is derived from animal studies. The data from one study indicated that bone mineral density is negatively associated with saturated fat intake, and that men may be particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corwin RL, Hartman TJ, Maczuga SA, Graubard BI | title = Dietary saturated fat intake is inversely associated with bone density in humans: Analysis of NHANES III | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 1 | pages = 159â165 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16365076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expert consultation report concluded that "intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related to cardiovascular risk.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42665/1/WHO_TRS_916.pdf |title= Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases (WHO technical report series 916) |publisher= World Health Organization |author = Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation |year= 2003 |pages=81â94 |isbn= 92-4-120916-X |accessdate = 2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10% of daily energy intake and less than 7% for high-risk groups. If populations are consuming less than 10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits, intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low (BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements.  Specific sources of saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, provide low-cost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor."&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

A 2004 statement released by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) determined that "Americans need to continue working to reduce saturated fat intakeâ¦"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/mmwrnews/n040206.htm#mmwr2 | title = Trends in Intake of Energy, Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat, and Saturated Fat â United States, 1971â2000 | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control]] | year = 2004 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081201152506/http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/mmwrnews/n040206.htm#mmwr2 | archivedate = 2008-12-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, reviews by the [[American Heart Association]] led the Association to recommend reducing saturated fat intake to less than 7% of total calories according to its 2006 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alice H. Lichtenstein|Lichtenstein AH]], Appel LJ, Brands M, Carnethon M, Daniels S, Franch HA, Franklin B, Kris-Etherton P, Harris WS, Howard B, Karanja N, Lefevre M, Rudel L, Sacks F, Van Horn L, Winston M, Wylie-Rosett J | title = Diet and lifestyle recommendations revision 2006: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee | journal = Circulation | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 82â96 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16785338 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.176158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith SC, Jackson R, Pearson TA, Fuster V, Yusuf S, Faergeman O, Wood DA, Alderman M, Horgan J, Home P, Hunn M, Grundy SM | title = Principles for national and regional guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention: a scientific statement from the World Heart and Stroke Forum | journal = Circulation | volume = 109 | issue = 25 | pages = 3112â21 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15226228 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000133427.35111.67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concurs with similar conclusions made by the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]], which determined that reduction in saturated fat consumption would positively affect health and reduce the prevalence of heart disease.&lt;ref name=DGfA&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/06q0458/06q-0458-sup0001-02.pdf | format = pdf | title = Dietary Guidelines for Americans | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]], [[National Health Service]] claims the majority of British people eat too much saturated fat. The [[British Heart Foundation]] also advises people to cut down on saturated fat. People are advised to cut down on saturated fat and read labels on food they buy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx Eat less saturated fat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/preventing-heart-disease/healthy-eating/fats-explained Fats explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 review stated that "no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified" and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.&lt;ref name=German&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=German JB, Dillard CJ | title = Saturated fats: what dietary intake? | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 550â559 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15321792 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/80/3/550.full | accessdate = 2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanket recommendations to lower saturated fat were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the [[American Dietetic Association]] for focusing too narrowly on reducing saturated fats rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates.  Concern was expressed over the health risks of replacing saturated fats in the diet with refined carbohydrates, which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease, particularly at the expense of [[polyunsaturated fat]]s which may have health benefits.  None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption of saturated fats, emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zelman K | title = The Great Fat Debate: A Closer Look at the ControversyâQuestioning the Validity of Age-Old Dietary Guidance | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 111 | issue = 5 | pages = 655â658 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21515106 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2011.03.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 comprehensive review of the literature and clinical trials, the American Heart Association published a recommendation that saturated fat intake be reduced or replaced by products containing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, a dietary adjustment that could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 30%.&lt;ref name=aha2017/&gt;

==Molecular description==
[[File:Myristic acid.svg|thumb|left|500px|Two-dimensional representation of the saturated fatty acid [[myristic acid]]]]
[[File:Myristic-acid-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|500px|A [[space-filling model]] of the saturated fatty acid [[myristic acid]]]]  It should be noted, as this is the defining factor of '''saturated''' fats, that the two-dimensional illustration has implicit hydrogen atoms bonded to each of the carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the [[myristic acid]] molecule (there are 13 carbon atoms in the tail; 14 carbon atoms in the entire molecule).

Carbon atoms are also implicitly drawn, as they are  portrayed as [[Line-line intersection|intersections]] between two straight lines.  "Saturated," in general, refers to a maximum number of hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon of the polycarbon tail as allowed by the [[Octet Rule]].  This also means that only [[single bond]]s ([[sigma bonds]]) will be present between adjacent carbon atoms of the tail.

The '''scarlet badis''' (''Dario dario'') is a [[tropical]] [[freshwater fish]] and one of the smallest known [[Percoidea|percoid]] fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase | genus = Dario | species = dario | month = November | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seriouslyfish.com/profile.php?genus=Dario&amp;species=dario&amp;id=41&lt;/ref&gt; It is a micropredator, feeding on small aquatic crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and other [[zooplankton]]. It is sold under a variety of names (''Badis badis bengalensis'', ''B. bengalensis'') in the aquarium trade.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

==Description==
[[Image:Scarlet badis female.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Scarlet badis female|Scarlet badis female]]
Scarlet badis are among the smallest percoid fish species. Males usually do not exceed {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}, with the females being even smaller around {{convert|1.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}{{Citation needed|date = September 2014}}. Apart from the size difference, the sexes are easy to distinguish by the vibrant colors and prominent fins of the male.

==Distribution and habitat==
The distribution of this species appears to be restricted to tributary systems draining into the [[Brahmaputra River]] in parts of [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]] states of [[India]],{{citation needed|date = September 2014}} although it might also range into [[Bhutan]].{{citation needed|date = September 2014}} It typically inhabits shallow, clear water streams with sand or gravel substrates and dense growths of marginal and/or aquatic vegetation.

==Care in the Aquarium==
The scarlet badis is becoming increasingly popular as an aquarium fish, particularly in [[Nano aquarium|nano aquaria]]. Their territorial nature does however mean that their environment must contain sufficient boundaries to prevent aggressive behaviour, especially between males of the species. The careful aquarist would ensure that the tank is sufficiently filled with items of decoration capable of breaking up lines of sight and establishing territories. natural driftwood or coconut shells used as caves are all ideal.&lt;ref&gt;http://aquariumsandfishes.com/429/keeping-scarlet-badis-dario-dario/&lt;/ref&gt;

This species should only be considered for inclusion in an established and well-cycled aquarium with suitable water parameters.

== History ==

===1989-2004: Early History===

Targray was legally incorporated in 1989 under the name '''Targray Technology International Inc.''' The company's first recorded sales were clean-room gloves sold to Americ Disc in [[Drummondville]], Quebec. By 1995, Targray's selection of optical media products had grown to include a complete line of sputtering targets for all optical disc formats. Beginning in 1998, Targray underwent a series of expansions to accommodate its growing optical media business and workforce, and by 2004 the company had opened 5 international sales offices, located in [[Dordrecht]], [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]], [[Taipei]], [[PanenskÃ© BÅeÅ¾any]], and [[New Dehli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.targray.com/company/history|title=Our History|publisher=Targray Technology International Inc.|date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005-present: Expansion and Diversification===
[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]
In 2005, Targray adopted a diversification strategy focused on high-growth industries, beginning with solar photovoltaics. The strategy led to an increase in sales for the company, and in 2006 it was ranked the ninth fastest-growing company in the province of Quebec for the previous fiveâyear period by Canadian French-language magazine [[L'actualitÃ©]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lactualite.com/lactualite-affaires/les-leaders-de-la-croissance-que-sont-elles-devenues/#2006|title=Les leaders de la croissance: Que sont-elles devenues?|publisher=L'actualitÃ©|date=May 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Targray's solar products had surpassed its optical media line in total sales, and the company was included in [[Profit (magazine)|Profit Magazine]]'s list of fastest growing companies in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profitguide.com/manage-grow/strategy-operations/problem-solvers-to-boldly-grow-carefully-that-is-29573|title=Problem Solvers to Boldly Grow, Carefully That Is|publisher=Profit Guide |date=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Targray's annual revenues exceeded 250 million USD per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://affaires.lapresse.ca/pme/region-de-montreal/200908/30/01-897257-targray-quincaillerie-de-la-haute-technologie.php|title=Targray: Quincaillerie de la Haute Technologie|publisher=La Presse|date=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 and 2012, Targray established two new business divisions, created to supply lithium-ion battery materials and bio-based fuels, respectively. Shortly thereafter, the company began marketing biodiesel blends from its terminal location in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downstreambusiness.com/targray-begins-marketing-biodiesel-california-terminal-545616|title=Targray Begins Marketing Biodiesel from California Terminal|publisher=Downstream Business|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, professional services firm [[Ernst &amp; Young]] named Targray President Andrew Richardson the winner of the 2016 Quebec [[Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/gilbert-rozon-of-just-for-laughs-named-ey-entrepreneur-of-the-year-quebec-2016-597905471.html|title=Gilbert Rozon of Just for Laughs named EY Entrepreneur Of The Yearâ¢ QuÃ©bec 2016|publisher=CNW|date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tracers''' are used in the [[oil industry]] in order to qualitatively or quantitatively gauge how fluid flows through the reservoir, as well as being a useful tool for estimating [[Reservoir engineers|residual oil saturation]].  Tracers can be used in either interwell tests or single well tests.  In interwell tests, the tracer is injected at one [[Oil well|well]] along with the carrier fluid (water in a waterflood or gas in a gasflood) and detected at a producing well after some period of time, which can be anything from days to years.  In single well [[Amott test|tests]], tracer is injected into the formation from a well and then produced out the same well. The delay between a tracer that does not react with the formation (a conservative tracer) and one that does (a partitioning tracer) will give an indication of residual oil saturation, a piece of information that is difficult to acquire by other means.

Tracers can be radioactive or chemical, gas or liquid and have been used extensively in the oil industry and hydrology for decades.

==History ==
Vestas traces its roots to 1898 when Hand Smith Hansen bought a blacksmith shop in {{ill|Lem, Denmark|lt=Lem|da|Lem (by)}}, West [[Jutland]]  which operated as a family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Profile|url = https://www.vestas.com/en/about/profile#!grid_0_content_3_Container|website = www.vestas.com|access-date = 21 January 2016|first = Vestas -|last = www.vestas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the second world war Vestas was founded in 1945 by his son Peder Hansen as "Vestjysk StÃ¥lteknik [[aktieselskab|A/S]]" (West-Jutlandish steel technology). The company initially manufactured household appliances, moving its focus to agricultural equipment in 1950, [[intercooler]]s in 1956, and hydraulic [[crane (machine)|cranes]] in 1968. It entered the wind turbine industry in 1979,&lt;ref name=hist-1971-86&gt;{{cite web |title=From 1971-1986: Energy experiments and the brink of disaster |url=http://www.vestas.com/en/about/profile#!from-1971-1986 |publisher=Vestas |accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced wind turbines exclusively from 1989.&lt;ref name="rewPlay"/&gt; In 1997, the company placed in production the NTK 1500/60. The product was designed by [[Timothy Jacob Jensen]] and received the German IF Award and the Red Dot Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Jacob Jensen Design studio |title = Product Design |url = http://jacobjensendesign.com/product-design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the company merged with the Danish wind turbine manufacturer [[NEG Micon]] to create the largest wind turbine manufacturer in the world, under the banner of Vestas Wind Systems. After a sales slump and an operational loss in 2005,&lt;ref name=vest/&gt; Vestas recovered in 2006 with a 28% market share&lt;ref name=vest/&gt; and increased production although market share slid to between 12.5.&lt;ref name="reuBTM"&gt;Reddall, Braden.

Vestas began a [[whistleblower]] program in 2007, among the first in Denmark.&lt;ref name=whistleblower&gt;{{cite web|url= https://karriere.jobfinder.dk/artikel/26-medarbejdere-i-vestas-afsloeret-i-svindel-4420 |title=26 medarbejdere i Vestas afslÃ¸ret i svindel|work=[[IngeniÃ¸ren]] |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2008 Vestas announced plans to expand its North American headquarters in Portland through construction of a {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} new building, but this plan was mothballed in 2009 due to the economic [[Late-2000s recession|recession]], and in August 2010 the company announced a revised plan, scaled back in size, to expand its Portland headquarters by renovating an existing-but-vacant {{convert|172000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} building.&lt;ref name="portland-expand"&gt;{{cite web|last=Siemers|first=Erik |title=Vestas keeps HQ in Portland, moving to the Pearl| date = 18 August 2010|work=[[Portland Business Journal]]| url = http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2010/08/16/daily22.html| accessdate = 31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Vestas employed about 400 in Portland and committed to add at least 100 more employees there within five years; the new building will have space for up to 600 workers.&lt;ref name="portland-expand"/&gt; The company moved its Portland offices to the new headquarters building, a renovated [[Meier &amp; Frank Delivery Depot|historic building]], in May 2012.&lt;ref name=pbj-may2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Christina|title=Gallery: Inside Vestas' new digs|url= http://www.sustainablebusinessoregon.com/articles/2012/05/gallery-inside-vestas-new-digs.html |accessdate=8 August 2012|publisher=Sustainable Business Oregon|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the company announced the production of two new turbine types, the 3-megawatt V112 and 1.8-megawatt V100.

In July 2009, Vestas announced its manufacturing operations on the [[Isle of Wight]] in England would close due to a lack of UK demand, affecting 525 jobs there and 100 in Southampton. Approximately 25 workers at the wind turbine factory on the island occupied the administration offices in protest on 20 July 2009, demanding nationalisation to save their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In August 2009 Vestas hired more than 5,000 extra workers for its new factories in [[Wind power in China|China]], the [[Wind power in the United States|United States]], and [[Wind power in Spain|Spain]]. The company said it was "expanding heavily in China and the US because these markets were growing the fastest, in contrast to the sluggish pace of wind farm development in the UK".&lt;ref name=guard-expands&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/18/vestas-manufacturing-china-us/print |title=Vestas expands wind turbine manufacturing in China and US as British demand collapses |work=Guardian |date=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this gradual shift in production away from Europe and towards China and the US, in October 2010, the company announced it was closing five factories in Denmark and Sweden, with the loss of 3,000 jobs.&lt;ref name="reuCut"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69P0Q520101026 Reuters].

In [[electrical engineering]], particularly [[power engineering]], '''voltage regulation''' is a measure of change in the [[voltage]] magnitude between the sending and receiving end of a component, such as a [[transmission line|transmission]] or distribution line. Voltage regulation describes the ability of a system to provide near constant voltage over a wide range of [[Electrical load|load]] conditions. The term may refer to a passive property that results in more or less voltage drop under various load conditions, or to the active intervention with devices for the specific purpose of adjusting voltage.

==Electrical power systems==
In electrical power systems it is a [[dimensionless quantity]] defined at the receiving end of a transmission line as:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Percent } VR = \frac{|V_{nl}| - |V_{fl}|}{|V_{fl}|} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=GÃ¶nen|first=Turan|title=Electrical machines with MATLAB(R)|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-43-987799-9|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where
''V&lt;sub&gt;nl&lt;/sub&gt;'' is voltage at no load and ''V&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt;'' is voltage at full load. The percent voltage regulation of an ideal transmission line, as defined by a transmission line with zero [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] and [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], would equal zero due to ''V&lt;sub&gt;nl&lt;/sub&gt;'' equaling ''V&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a result of there being no voltage drop along the line. This is why a smaller value of ''Voltage Regulation'' is usually beneficial, indicating that the line is closer to ideal.

The Voltage Regulation formula could be visualized with the following: "Consider power being delivered to a load such that the voltage at the load is the load's rated voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;Rated&lt;/sub&gt;'', if then the load disappears, the voltage at the point of the load will rise to ''V&lt;sub&gt;nl&lt;/sub&gt;''."

Voltage regulation in transmission lines occurs due to the impedance of the line between its sending and receiving ends. Transmission lines intrinsically have some amount of resistance, inductance, and capacitance that all change the voltage continuously along the line. Both the magnitude and phase angle of voltage change along a real transmission line. The effects of line impedance can be modeled with simplified circuits such as the short line approximation (least accurate), the medium line approximation (more accurate), and the long line approximation (most accurate).[[File:Short Line Approximation.png|thumb|326x326px|Short line approximation. Here the line impedance Z = R + jL.]]

The short line approximation ignores capacitance of the transmission line and models the resistance and reactance of the transmission line as a simple series resistor and inductor. This combination has impedance R + jL or R + jX. There is a single line current I = I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; in the short line approximation, different from the medium and long line. The medium length line approximation takes into account the [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] admittance, usually pure capacitance, by distributing half the admittance at the sending and receiving end of the line. This configuration is often referred to as a nominal - Ï. The long line approximation takes these lumped impedance and admittance values and distributes them uniformly along the length of the line. The long line approximation therefore requires the solving of differential equations and results in the highest degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the voltage regulation formula, V&lt;sub&gt;no load&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage measured at the receiving end terminals when the receiving end is an open circuit. The entire short line model is an open circuit in this condition, and no current flows in an open circuit, so I = 0 A and the voltage drop across the line given by Ohmâs law V&lt;sub&gt;line drop&lt;/sub&gt; = IZ&lt;sub&gt;line&lt;/sub&gt; is 0 V. The sending and receiving end voltages are thus the same. This value is what the voltage at the receiving end would be if the transmission line had no impedance. The voltage would not be changed at all by the line, which is an ideal scenario in power transmission.

V&lt;sub&gt;full load&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage across the load at the receiving end when the load is connected and current flows in the transmission line. Now V&lt;sub&gt;line drop&lt;/sub&gt; = IZ&lt;sub&gt;line&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero, so the voltages and the sending and receiving ends of the transmission line are not equal. The current I can be found by solving Ohmâs law using a combined line and load impedance: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I = \frac{V_{S}}{Z_{line} + Z_{load}}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the V&lt;sub&gt;R, full load&lt;/sub&gt; is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V_{S} - \frac{V_{S}Z_{line}}{Z_{line} + Z_{load}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The effects of this modulation on voltage magnitude and phase angle is illustrated using phasor diagrams that map V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, and the resistive and inductive components of V&lt;sub&gt;line drop&lt;/sub&gt;. Three power factor scenarios are shown, where (a) the line serves an inductive load so the current lags receiving end voltage, (b) the line serves a completely real load so the current and receiving end voltage are in phase, and (c) the line serves a capacitive load so the current leads receiving end voltage. In all cases the line resistance R causes a voltage drop that is in phase with current, and the reactance of the line X causes a voltage drop that leads current by 90 degrees. These successive voltage drops are summed to the receiving end voltage, tracing backward from V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; to V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; in the short line approximation circuit. The vector sum of V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and the voltage drops equals V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, and it is apparent in the diagrams that V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; does not equal V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; in magnitude or phase angle.
[[File:Short line voltage phasor diagrams.png|thumb|415x415px|Voltage phasor diagrams for a short transmission line serving lagging, in-phase, and leading loads.]]
The diagrams show that the phase angle of current in the line affects voltage regulation significantly. Lagging current in (a) makes the required magnitude of sending end voltage quite large relative to the receiving end. The phase angle difference between sending and receiving end is minimized, however. Leading current in (c) actually allows the sending end voltage magnitude be smaller than the receiving end magnitude, so the voltage counterintuitively increases along the line. In-phase current in (b) does little to affect the magnitude of voltage between sending and receiving ends, but the phase angle shifts considerably.

Real transmission lines typically serve inductive loads, which are the motors that exist everywhere in modern electronics and machines. Transferring a large amount of reactive power Q to inductive loads makes the line current lag voltage, and the voltage regulation is characterized by decrease in voltage magnitude. In transferring a large amount of real power P to real loads, current is mostly in phase with voltage. The voltage regulation in this scenario is characterized by a decrease in phase angle rather than magnitude.

Sometimes, the term voltage regulation is used to describe processes by which the quantity ''VR'' is reduced, especially concerning special circuits and devices for this purpose (see below).

==Electronic power supply parameters==
The quality of a system's voltage regulation is described by three main parameters:

|}

== Distribution feeder regulation ==
[[electric utility|Electric utilities]] aim to provide service to customers at a specific voltage level, for example, 220 V or 240 V. However, due to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Laws]], the voltage magnitude and thus the service voltage to customers will in fact vary along the length of a conductor such as a distribution feeder (see [[Electric power distribution]]). Depending on law and local practice, actual service voltage within a tolerance band such as Â±5% or Â±10% may be considered acceptable. In order to maintain voltage within tolerance under changing load conditions, various types of devices are traditionally employed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Meier|first=Alexandra|title=Electric Power Systems: A Conceptual Introduction|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0471178594|pages=184â188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

â¢ a [[tap changer|load tap changer]] (LTC) at the substation [[transformer]], which changes the turns ratio in response to load current and thereby adjusts the voltage supplied at the sending end of the feeder;

â¢ [[voltage regulator]]s, which are essentially transformers with [[tap changer]]s to adjust the voltage along the feeder, so as to compensate for the voltage drop over distance; and

â¢ [[capacitor]]s, which reduce the voltage drop along the feeder by reducing current flow to loads consuming [[reactive power]].

A new generation of devices for voltage regulation based on [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state technology]] are in the early commercialization stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greentechmedia article on voltage-correcting grid sensor|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/varentec-launches-the-distributed-voltage-correcting-grid-sensor|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution regulation involves a "regulation point": the point at which the equipment tries to maintain constant voltage. Customers further than this point observe an expected effect: higher voltage at light load, and lower voltage at high load. Customers closer than this point experience the opposite effect: higher voltage at high load, and lower voltage at light load.

== Complications due to distributed generation ==

[[Distributed generation]], in particular [[photovoltaics]] connected at the distribution level, presents a number of significant challenges for voltage regulation.

[[File:feeder voltage profile.png|thumb|Typical voltage profile expected on a distribution feeder with no DG. This voltage profile results from current through feeders with no DG decreases with distance from the substation.]]

Conventional voltage regulation equipment works under the assumption that line voltage changes predictably with distance along the [[Electric power distribution|feeder]]. Specifically, feeder voltage drops with increasing distance from the substation due to line impedance and the rate of voltage drop decreases farther away from the [[Electrical substation|substation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Meier|first=Alexandra|title=Electric Power Systems: A Conceptual Introduction|year=2006|publisher= Wiley-IEEE Press|isbn= 0471178594|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this assumption may not hold when DG is present. For example, a long feeder with a high concentration of DG at the end will experience significant current injection at points where the voltage is normally lowest. If the [[Electrical load|load]] is sufficiently low, current will flow in the reverse direction (i.e. towards the substation), resulting in a voltage profile that increases with distance from the substation. This inverted voltage profile may confuse conventional controls. In one such scenario, load tap changers expecting voltage to decrease with distance from the substation may choose an operating point that in fact causes voltage down the line to exceed operating limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Power Quality Impact of Distributed Generation: Effect on Steady State Voltage Regulation|citeseerx = 10.1.1.202.5283 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Feeder Voltage Response with Advanced VAR Control.png|thumb|left|Comparison of 24-hour voltage swings on a feeder with no PV, 20% PV and 20% PV with volt-VAR control.]]

The voltage regulation issues caused by DG at the distribution level are complicated by lack of [[Electric utility|utility]] monitoring equipment along distribution feeders. The relative scarcity of information on distribution voltages and loads makes it difficult for utilities to make adjustments necessary to keep voltage levels within operating limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title= Statistics of voltage drop in radial distribution circuits: a dynamic programming approach|eprint= 1006.0158 |last1=  Turitsyn|first1= Konstantin S.|class= math.OC|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although DG poses a number of significant challenges for distribution level voltage regulation, if combined with intelligent [[power electronics]] DG can actually serve to enhance voltage regulation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Impact of Distributed Generation on Voltage Profile in Deregulated Distribution System|url= http://www.clemson.edu/ces/powsys/2002/Papers/Paper/TB1/MMS_WEK.pdf|page=6|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example is PV connected to the grid through inverters with [[Distribution management system|volt-VAR control]]. In a study conducted jointly by the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]] and [[Electric Power Research Institute| Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)]], when volt-VAR control was added to a distribution feeder with 20% PV penetration, the diurnal voltage swings on the feeder were significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Updating Interconnection Screens for PV System Integration|url= http://energy.sandia.gov/wp/wp-content/gallery/uploads/Updating_Interconnection_PV_Systems_Integration.pdf|page=20|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transformers ==
[[File:Transformer equivalent circuit-2.svg|thumb|363x363px|Real transformer equivalent circuit]]
One case of voltage regulation is in a [[transformer]]. The unideal components of the transformer cause a change in voltage when current flows. Under no load, when no current flows through the secondary coils, ''V&lt;sub&gt;nl&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by the ideal model, where ''V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;*N&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''. Looking at the [[equivalent circuit]] and neglecting the shunt components, as is a reasonable approximation, one can refer all resistance and reactance to the secondary side and clearly see that the secondary voltage at no load will indeed be given by the ideal model. In contrast, when the transformer delivers full load, a voltage drop occurs over the winding resistance, causing the terminal voltage across the load to be lower than anticipated. By the definition above, this leads to a nonzero voltage regulation which must be considered in use of the transformer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power System Analysis and Design|last=Grainger|first=John J and William D Stephenson|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1994|isbn=978-0070612938|location=New York|pages=196 â 214|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water crystal  gel''' or '''water beads''' is any [[gel]] which contains a large amount of [[water]]. Water gel is usually composed of a water-absorbing polymer such as a [[polyacrylamide]] (frequently [[Poly(methyl acrylate)]] or [[Sodium polyacrylate]]). Sometimes referred to as [[superabsorbent polymer]] (SAP) or, in dry form, as slush powder.

==Uses==
Water gels are used for:

* Watering or potting [[plants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seedman.com/plantge.htm Potting plants with water gel (commercial site)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use in gardens to save water.
* Supplying water to small [[animal]]s as an alternative to supplying water in a dish. Some small animals tend to fall into dishes of water and drown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watergelcrystals.com/crickets.htm How to feed water to crickets safely (commercial site; includes photo of crystals)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cetyl palmitate.png|thumb|right|[[Cetyl palmitate]], a typical wax ester.]]
[[Image:Beeswax foundation.jpg|thumb|Commercial [[honeycomb]] foundation, made by pressing beeswax between patterned metal rollers.]]

'''Waxes''' are a diverse class of [[organic compound]]s that are [[lipophilic]], [[malleability|malleable]] solids near ambient temperatures.  They include [[higher alkanes]] and [[lipid]]s, typically with [[melting point]]s above about 40&amp;nbsp;Â°C (104&amp;nbsp;Â°F), melting to give low [[viscosity]] liquids. Waxes are [[Solubility|insoluble]] in water but soluble in organic, nonpolar solvents.  Natural waxes of different types are produced by plants and animals and occur in [[petroleum]].

== Chemistry ==
[[File:MODOCeroline.jpg|thumb|Ceroline brand wax for floors and furniture, first half of 20th century. From the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]] collection]]
Waxes are organic compounds that characteristically consist of long [[alkyl]] chains.  They may also include various [[functional group]]s such as [[carboxylic acid|fatty acids]], primary and secondary [[fatty alcohol|long chain alcohols]], unsaturated bonds, aromatics, amides, ketones, and aldehydes. They frequently contain fatty acid [[ester]]s as well.  Synthetic waxes are often long-chain hydrocarbons (alkanes or paraffins) that lack [[functional group]]s.&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

=== Plant and animal waxes ===
Waxes are [[biosynthesis|synthesized]] by many plants and animals.  Those of animal origin typically consist of wax esters derived from a variety of carboxylic acids and fatty alcohols.  In waxes of plant origin, characteristic mixtures of unesterified hydrocarbons may predominate over esters.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; The composition depends not only on species, but also on geographic location of the organism.

==== Animal waxes ====
The most commonly known animal wax is [[beeswax]], but other insects secrete (release) waxes.  A major component of the beeswax used in constructing [[honeycomb]]s is the [[ester]] myricyl palmitate which is an ester of [[triacontanol]] and [[palmitic acid]].  Its melting point is 62-65&amp;nbsp;Â°C. [[Spermaceti]] occurs in large amounts in the head oil of the [[sperm whale]]. One of its main constituents is [[cetyl palmitate]], another ester of a [[fatty acid]] and a [[fatty alcohol]]. [[Lanolin]] is a wax obtained from wool, consisting of esters of [[sterol]]s.&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;Wilhelm Riemenschneider1 and Hermann M. Bolt "Esters, Organic" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a09_565.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plant waxes ====

Plants secrete waxes into and on the surface of their [[plant cuticle|cuticles]] as a way to control evaporation, wettability and hydration.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The [[epicuticular wax]]es of plants are mixtures of substituted long-chain [[aliphatic]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, containing [[alkane]]s, alkyl esters, fatty acids, primary and [[secondary alcohol]]s, [[diol]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[aldehyde]]s.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;EA Baker (1982) Chemistry and morphology of plant epicuticular waxes. In The Plant Cuticle. Ed. DF Cutler, KL Alvin, CE Price. Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-199920-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the commercial perspective, the most important plant wax is [[carnauba wax]], a hard wax obtained from the Brazilian palm ''[[Copernicia prunifera]]''.  Containing the ester myricyl cerotate, it has many applications, such as confectionery and other food coatings, car and furniture polish, floss coating, and [[surfboard wax]]. Other more specialized vegetable waxes include [[candelilla wax]] and [[ouricury wax]].

==== Modified plant and animal waxes ====
Plant and animal based waxes or oils can undergo selective chemical modifications to produce waxes with more desirable properties than are available in the unmodified starting material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Floros|first=Michael C.|last2=Raghunanan|first2=Latchmi|last3=Narine|first3=Suresh S.|date=2016-11-01|title=A toolbox for the characterization of biobased waxes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejlt.201600360/abstract|journal=European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology|language=en|pages=n/aân/a|doi=10.1002/ejlt.201600360|issn=1438-9312}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has relied on green chemistry approaches including olefin metathesis and enzymatic reactions and can be used to produce waxes from inexpensive starting materials like vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schrodi|first=Yann|last2=Ung|first2=Thay|last3=Vargas|first3=Angel|last4=Mkrtumyan|first4=Garik|last5=Lee|first5=Choon Woo|last6=Champagne|first6=Timothy M.|last7=Pederson|first7=Richard L.|last8=Hong|first8=Soon Hyeok|date=2008-08-01|title=Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts for the Ethenolysis of Renewable Feedstocks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clen.200800088/abstract|journal=CLEAN â Soil, Air, Water|language=en|volume=36|issue=8|pages=669â673|doi=10.1002/clen.200800088|issn=1863-0669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petersson|first=Anna E.

=== Petroleum derived waxes ===

{{see also|Paraffin wax}}

Although many natural waxes contain esters, paraffin waxes are [[hydrocarbon]]s, mixtures of [[alkane]]s usually in a [[homologous series]] of chain lengths.  These materials represent a significant fraction of petroleum.  They are refined by [[vacuum distillation]].  Paraffin waxes are mixtures of saturated n- and iso- alkanes, naphthenes, and alkyl- and naphthene-substituted aromatic compounds. A typical [[alkane]] paraffin wax chemical composition comprises hydrocarbons with the general formula C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as [[Hentriacontane]], C&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;. The degree of branching has an important influence on the properties. [[Microcrystalline wax]] is a lesser produced petroleum based wax that contains higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons.

Millions of tons of paraffin waxes are produced annually. They are used in foods (such as chewing gum and cheese wrapping), in candles and cosmetics, as non-stick and waterproofing coatings and in polishes.

==== Montan wax ====

[[Montan wax]] is a fossilized wax extracted from coal and [[lignite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urFTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Montan+wax+is+a+fossilized+wax+extracted+from+coal+and+lignite&amp;dq=Montan+wax+is+a+fossilized+wax+extracted+from+coal+and+lignite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2_pmHyMPUAhUT4mMKHXaOA7sQ6AEIRDAG|title=Wax chemistry and technology|last=Ivanovsky|first=Leo|date=1952|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is very hard, reflecting the high concentration of saturated [[fatty acid]]s and alcohols.  Although dark brown and odorous, they can be purified and bleached to give commercially useful products.

==== Polyethylene and related derivatives ====

As of 1995, about 200 million kilograms/y were consumed.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

[[File:Montana 10 bg 061905.jpg|thumb|Wax candle.]]Polyethylene waxes are manufactured by one of three methods: 1- direct polymerization of ethylene (may include co -monomers also);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2504400.pdf|title=Production of polyethylene waxes|website=www.freepatentsonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2- thermal degradation of high molecular weight polyethylene resin;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Method for obtaining wax from recycled polyethylene|date=12/01/2015|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/9200130.html|inventor-last=D'amato|country-code=US|inventor2-last=Faucher|inventor3-last=Lincoln|inventor-first=Michael J.|inventor2-first=Santiago|inventor3-first=Timothy L.|patent-number=9200130|accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3- recovery of low molecular weight fractions from high molecular weight resin production.

Each production technique generates products with slightly different properties. Key properties of low molecular weight polyethylene waxes are viscosity, density and melt point.

Polyethylene waxes produced by means of degradation or recovery from polyethylene resin streams contain very low molecular weight materials that must be removed to prevent volatilization and potential fire hazards during use. Polyethylene waxes manufactured by this method are usually stripped of low molecular weight fractions to yield a flash point &gt; 500Â°F(&gt; 260Â°C). Many polyethylene resin plants produce a low molecular weight stream often referred to as Low Polymer Wax (LPW). LPW is unrefined and contains volatile oligomers, corrosive catalyst and may contain other foreign material and water. Refining of LPW to produce a polyethylene wax involves removal of oligomers and hazardous catalyst. Proper refining of LPW to produce polyethylene wax is especially important when being used in applications requiring FDA or other regulatory certification.[[File:Lavalampe.jpg|thumb|A [[lava lamp]] is a novelty item that contains wax melted from below by a bulb. The wax rises and falls in decorative, molten blobs.]]

== Uses ==

Waxes are mainly consumed industrially as components of complex formulations, often for coatings.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Uwe Wolfmeier, Hans Schmidt, Franz-Leo Heinrichs, Georg Michalczyk, Wolfgang Payer, Wolfram Dietsche, Klaus Boehlke, Gerd Hohner, Josef Wildgruber "Waxes" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main use of polyethylene and polypropylene waxes is in the formulation of colourants for plastics.  Waxes confer matting effects and wear resistance to paints. Polyethylene waxes are incorporated into inks in the form of dispersions to decrease friction.  They are employed as [[release agent]]s, find use as slip agents in furniture, and confer corrosion resistance.

=== Candles ===

Waxes such as [[paraffin wax]] or [[beeswax]], and hard fats such as [[tallow]] are used to make [[candle]]s, used for lighting and decoration.

=== Wax products ===
Waxes are used as finishes and coatings for wood products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minwax.com/wood-products/specialty-products/minwax-paste-finishing-wax |title=MinwaxÂ® Paste Finishing Wax &amp;#124; Specialty Products |publisher=Minwax.com |date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beeswax is frequently used as a lubricant on drawer slides where wood to wood contact occurs.

=== Other uses ===

[[Sealing wax]] was used to close important documents in the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Wax tablet]]s were used as writing surfaces. There were different types of wax in the Middle Ages, namely four kinds of wax ([[Dubrovnik|Ragusan]], [[Montenegro]], [[Byzantine]], and [[Bulgaria]]n), "ordinary" waxes from [[Spain]], [[Poland]], and [[Riga]], unrefined waxes and colored waxes (red, white, and green).&lt;ref&gt;The rational arts of living: Ruth and Clarence Kennedy Conference in the Renaissance, 1982, page 187, Studies in History, No 50, Alistair Cameron Crombie, Nancy G. Siraisi, Dept. of History of Smith College, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handbook To Life In The Medieval World, Volume 2, page 202, Handbook to Life, Facts on File Library of World History, Madeline Pelner Cosman, Linda Gale Jones, Infobase Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|9780816048878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waxes are used to make [[wax paper]], impregnating and [[coated paper|coating paper]] and card to waterproof it or make it resistant to staining, or to modify its surface properties. Waxes are also used in [[shoe polish]]es, [[wood polish]]es, and automotive polishes, as [[mold release agent]]s in [[mold making]], as a coating for many [[cheese]]s, and to [[waterproof]] leather and fabric. Wax has been used since antiquity as a temporary, removable model in [[lost-wax casting]] of [[gold]], [[silver]] and other materials.

Wax with colorful pigments added has been used as a medium in [[encaustic painting]], and is used today in the manufacture of [[crayon]]s, [[Grease pencil|china markers]] and colored [[pencil]]s. [[Carbon paper]], used for making duplicate [[typewriter|typewritten]] documents was coated with [[carbon black]] suspended in wax, typically [[montan wax]], but has largely been superseded by [[photocopier]]s and [[computer printer]]s.  In another context, [[lipstick]] and [[mascara]] are blends of various fats and waxes colored with pigments, and both [[beeswax]] and [[lanolin]] are used in other [[cosmetics]]. [[Ski wax]] is used in [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]].  Also, the sports of surfing and [[skateboarding]] often use wax to enhance the performance.

Some waxes are considered food-safe and are used to coat wooden cutting boards and other items that come into contact with food. Beeswax or coloured synthetic wax is used to decorate [[Easter egg]]s in [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. [[Paraffin wax]] is used in making chocolate covered sweets.

Wax is also used in [[wax bullet]]s, which are used as simulation aids.

'''Wizard Power Pty Ltd''' was an Australian company focused on solar technology research, development and commercialisation.  The company was headquartered in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]. The company was wound up in September 2013, owing 8 million dollars to creditors and employees.

==Technology==
Wizard Power's technology portfolio use to include:

* The [[The Big Dish (solar thermal)|Big Dish]] solar thermal concentrator.  The Big Dish is the world's largest and highest performance paraboloidal dish solar concentrator capable of generating temperatures over 1,200oC for superheating steam or powering thermochemical processes. The energy generated through these processes is used for electricity production, energy storage, thermochemistry or process heat;
* World leading, patent pending, focally accurate, solar mirror panel technology for Big Dishes and other solar concentrators; and
* A suite of unique thermal and thermochemical solar energy storage systems, also patent pending.

These technologies enable the delivery of utility-scale, zero emission thermal and electrical energy for dispatchable power applications.  The Australian National University developed the first versions of these technologies over a period of more than 30 years.  The current Wizard Power Big Dish âcommercialâ design, represented by the prototype located at the ANU, is based on novel space-frame and mirror panel systems that are optimised for the cost-effective deployment of large (tens to hundreds of megawatt capacity) solar fields.

Wizard Power claimed they provided the research, development, technology support and systems integration services necessary to facilitate the development of solutions and projects using these technologies.

In addition to these technologies, Wizard Power was supposedly  developing high-temperature solar gasification solutions for the conversion of coal, biomass and other carbonaceous materials to liquid fuels, plastics and fertilisers.

Wizard Power is tried to establish a demonstration site in [[Whyalla]], [[South Australia]] which will showcase the company's energy storage technologies.  The Whyalla Solar Storage plant will be a pre-commercial demonstration of energy storage, with full integration, demonstration of start up and shut down procedures, ability to handle intermittent solar input, and deliver energy on demand.  This project has been supported by the Commonwealth Government of Australia's Advance Electricity Storage Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warren.usyd.edu.au/bulletin/NO51/ed51art6.htm World's leading baseload solar power station for Australia] ''University of Sydney'' accessed 14 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s2220232.htm Govt urged to boost solar incentives] ''ABC'' accessed 14 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whyalla SolarOasis &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solaroasis.net.au/ www.solaroasis.net.au] ''SolarOasis Project''&lt;/ref&gt; will use 300 Wizard Power Big Dish solar thermal concentrators to deliver a 40MWe solar thermal power plant.  It was to be built 4&amp;nbsp;km north of Whyalla adjacent to the solar storage research facility.  The plant is designed as a peaking power plant operating in the day and early evening to deliver electricity when it is most in demand.

==230 million dollar project failure==

A $230 million &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/201005/s2899418.htm Budget funding helps huge solar project get underway] ''ABC Rural Online''&lt;/ref&gt; project was to use Wizard Power Technology to generate 66GWh of solar electricity each year. for a variety of commonwealth and corporate mismanagement reasons the project did not proceed past the proposal stage.

[[Image:Timber Mortising Machine.jpg|thumb|A worker uses a mortising machine to shape [[timber framing]] joints]]
'''Joinery''' is a part of [[woodworking]] that involves joining together pieces of [[timber]] or lumber, to produce more complex items. Some wood joints employ fasteners, bindings, or adhesives, while others use only wood elements. The characteristics of wooden joints - strength, flexibility, toughness, appearance, etc. - derive from the properties of the materials involved and the purpose of the joint. Therefore, different joinery techniques are used to meet differing requirements. For example, the joinery used to construct a [[house]] can be different from that used to make [[puzzle]] toys, although some concepts overlap.

== Types of wood joints ==

|-
|[[Butt joint]]
|[[File:Butt joint.png|thumb|135x135px]]
|The end of a piece of wood is butted against another piece of wood. This is the simplest and weakest joint. Of those, there is the a) T-butt, b) end-to-end butt, c) T-lap d) Miter butt and e) edge-to-edge butt.
|-
|[[Lap joint]]
|[[File:Woodworking lap joints.svg|thumb|115x115px]]
|The end of a piece of wood is laid over and connected to another piece of wood. This is the next simplest and weakest joint.  
|-
|[[Bridle joint]] 
|[[File:Joinery-CornerBriddleJoint.svg|thumb|115x115px]]
|Also known as open tenon, open mortise and tenon, or tongue and fork joints, this joint is where the through mortise is open on one side and forms a fork shape. The mate has a through tenon or necked joint. Bridle joints are commonly used to join rafter tops, also used in [[scarf joint]]s and sometimes sill corner joints in timber framing.
|-
|[[Dowel joint]]
|[[File:Woodworking-joint-butt-dowel.gif|thumb|115x115px]]
||The end of a piece of wood is butted against another piece of wood. This is reinforced with [[dowel]] pins. This joint is quick to make with production line machinery and so is a very common joint in factory-made furniture.
|-
|[[Mitre joint]]
|[[File:Mitre-joint.png|thumb|120x120px]]
|Similar to a butt joint, but both pieces have been bevelled (usually at a 45 degree angle).
|-
|[[Finger joint]]
|[[File:Boxjoint.png|thumb|115x115px]]
|Also known as a box joint, is a corner joint with interlocking fingers. Receives pressure from two directions. 
|-
|[[Dovetail joint]]
|[[File:Joinery-throughdovetail.svg|thumb|115x115px]]
|A form of box joint where the fingers are locked together by diagonal cuts. More secure than a finger joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://woodgears.ca/dovetail/strength.html|title=Dovetail vs. box joint strength|author=|date=|website=woodgears.ca|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115042928/https://woodgears.ca/dovetail/strength.html|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Dado (joinery)|Dado joint]]
|[[File:Dado joint.png|thumb|115x115px]]
|Also called a ''housing joint'' or ''trench joint'', a slot is cut across the grain in one piece for another piece to set into; shelves on a bookshelf having slots cut into the sides of the shelf, for example.
|-
|[[Groove (joinery)|Groove joint]]
|[[File:Woodworking-joint-groove.gif|thumb|115x115px]]
|Like the dado joint, except that the slot is cut with the grain.
|-
|[[Tongue and groove]]
|[[File:Dusheme.jpg|thumb|115x115px]]
|Each piece has a groove cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the tongue) on the opposite edge. If the tongue is unattached, it is considered a [[spline joint]].
|-
|[[Mortise and tenon]]
|[[File:Mortise tenon.png|thumb|115x115px]]
|A stub (the tenon) will fit tightly into a hole cut for it (the mortise). This is a hallmark of [[Mission Style Furniture|Mission Style furniture]], and also the traditional method of jointing [[frame and panel]] members in doors, windows, and cabinets. This joint is a good strong joint to use.
|-
|[[Birdsmouth joint]]
|[[File:BirdsMouthJoint.svg|thumb|115x115px]]
|Also called a ''bird's beak cut'', this joint used in [[roof construction]]. A V-shaped cut in the [[rafter]] connects the rafter to the wall-plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sawdustmaking.com/woodjoints/misc.htm|title=Miscellaneous Joints|author=|date=|website=sawdustmaking.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028175738/http://sawdustmaking.com/woodjoints/misc.htm|archivedate=28 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional ways of improving joints ===
[[File:Polaczenie kolkowe.svg|thumb|A doweled joint]]
* [[Dowel joint#Dowel reinforced butt joint|Dowel]]: A small rod is used internal to a joint both to help align and to strengthen the joint. Traditional joints are used with natural timbers as they do not need any other materials other than the timber itself. for example: Butt joints. Dowel joints are also useful for pegging together weaker, cheaper composite materials such as laminate-faced chipboard, and where limited woodworking tools are available (since only simple drilled holes are needed to take the dowels).
[[File:Biscuit-joint.jpg|thumb|115x115px]]

=== Nontraditional ways of improving joints ===
* [[Biscuit joiner|Biscuit joints]]: A small 'biscuit' is used to help align an edge or butt joint when gluing.
* [[Domino joiner]]: A trademarked tool similar to a biscuit joiner, where a piece larger than a biscuit has some of the advantages of dowels, and some of the advantages of biscuits.

==Properties of wood==
Many wood joinery techniques either depend upon or compensate for the fact that wood is [[anisotropic]]: its material properties are different along different dimensions.

This must be taken into account when joining wood parts together, otherwise the joint is destined to fail. Gluing boards with the grain running perpendicular to each other is often the reason for split boards, or broken joints. Furniture from the 18th century, while made by master craftsmen, did not take this into account. The result is this masterful work suffers from broken bracket feet, which was often attached with a glue block which ran perpendicular to the base pieces. The glue blocks were fastened with both glue and nails, resulting in unequal expansion and contraction between the pieces. This was also the cause of splitting of wide boards, which were commonly used during that period.

In modern woodworking it is even more critical, as heating and air conditioning cause major changes in the moisture content of the wood. All woodworking joints must take these changes into account, and allow for the resulting movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pro Woodworking Tips.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strength===

Wood is stronger when stressed along the [[Wood grain|grain]] (longitudinally) than it is when stressed across the grain (radially and tangentially). Wood is a natural composite material; parallel strands of [[cellulose]] fibers are held together by a [[lignin]] binder. These long chains of fibers make the wood exceptionally strong by resisting stress and spreading the load over the length of the board. Furthermore, cellulose is tougher than lignin, a fact demonstrated by the relative ease with which wood can be split along the grain compared to across it.

Different species of wood have different strength levels, and the exact strength may vary from sample to sample.

===Dimensional stability===

Timber expands and contracts in response to [[moisture content|humidity]], usually much less so longitudinally than in the radial and tangential directions. As [[vascular plant|tracheophytes]], trees have [[Lignin|lignified]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] which transport resources such as water, minerals and photosynthetic products up and down the plant. While lumber from a harvested tree is no longer alive, these tissues still absorb and expel water causing swelling and shrinkage of the wood in kind with change in humidity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood Movement, [http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/wood/movement WoodworkDetails.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215185042/http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/wood/movement |date=2012-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the dimensional stability of the wood is paramount, [[quarter sawing|quarter-sawn]] or [[Rift sawing|rift-sawn]] lumber is preferred because its grain pattern is consistent and thus reacts less to humidity.

==Materials used for joining==
[[Image:Timber Joint with Metal Plates.JPG|thumb|Metal plates are often incorporated into the design where the timber alone would not be strong enough for a given load.]]
[[File:Pin-conect.jpg|thumb|Pin-connected post and beam house framing]]
* Joints can be designed to hold without the use of glue or fasteners; a pinned mortise and tenon is an example of this.
* [[Glue]] is highly effective for joining timber when both surfaces of the joint are edge grain. A properly glued joint may be as strong or stronger than a single piece of wood. However, glue is notably less effective on [[Wood grain|end-grain]] surfaces. [[Animal glue]] is soluble in water, producing joints that can be disassembled using [[steam]] to soften the glue.
* Various mechanical [[fastener]]s may be used, the simplest being [[nail (fastener)|nail]]s and [[screw]]s. Glue and fasteners can be used together.

==Traditional joinery==

Many traditional wood joinery techniques use the distinctive material properties of [[wood]], often without resorting to mechanical fasteners or adhesives. While every culture in which pieces of wood are joined together to make furniture or structures has a joinery tradition, wood joinery techniques have been especially well documented and  is celebrated in the Indian, [[Ancient Chinese wooden architecture|Chinese]], European, and Japanese traditions. Because of the physical existence of Indian and Egyptian examples, we know that furniture from the first several dynasties show the use of complex joints, like the Dovetail, over 5,000 years ago. This tradition continued to other later Western styles. The 18th century writer [[Diderot]] included over 90 detailed illustrations of wood joints in his comprehensive encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=l'Encyclopeghdie|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0001.571/--joinerywork-in-building?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=carpentry|website=The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Western techniques focused on concealment of joinery, the Eastern societies, though later, did not attempt to "hide" their joints. The Japanese and Chinese traditions in particular required the use of hundreds of types of joints. The reason was that nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Michael Huntley demystifies the furniture making techniques of Chinese craftsmen prior to 1900 |first=Michael |last=Huntley |date=20 January 2009 |publisher=GMC Publications |journal=Wood Worker's Institute |url=https://www.woodworkersinstitute.com/page.asp?p=809 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122055525/http://woodworkersinstitute.com/page.asp?p=809 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the highly resinous woods used in traditional [[Chinese furniture]] do not glue well, even if they are cleaned with solvents and attached using modern glues.

==Nontraditional joinery==
Methods that are not considered traditional joinery have come about in modern times, largely to attempt to simplify the job of the woodworker for various reasons.  These include [[Biscuit joiner|biscuit joints]] and [[Pocket-hole joinery|pocket hole]] joinery.
