'''1957 Angara''', provisional designation {{mp|1970 GF}}, is a stony Eoan [[asteroid]] from the outer regions of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 18 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 1 April 1970, by Soviet astronomer [[Lyudmila Chernykh]] at the [[Crimean Astrophysical Observatory]] in Nauchnyj, and named after the Siberian [[Angara River]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Angara" /&gt;

== Classification and orbit ==

''Angara'' is a member of the [[Eos family]], well known for mostly being of a [[S-type asteroid|silicaceous]] composition. It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|outer]] main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.2&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 5 years and 3 months (1,906 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.06 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 11[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; A first [[precovery]] was taken at [[Goethe Link Observatory]] in 1956, extending the body's [[observation arc]] by 14 years prior to its official discovery observation at Nauchnyj.&lt;ref name="MPC-Angara" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

In December 1983, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Angara'' was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer [[Richard Binzel]] . Lightcurve analysis gave a well-define [[rotation period]] of 3.67 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.52 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]], indicative of a non-spheroidal shape ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3]]}}).&lt;ref name="Binzel-1987b" /&gt; Binzel also classified the body as a stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="Binzel-1987b" /&gt;

According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] satellite and NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission, ''Angara'' measures between 17.907 and 30.41 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.055 and 0.1438.&lt;ref name="Masiero-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AKARI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2012" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for stony Eoan asteroids of 0.14 – taken from the family's largest member and namesake, [[221&amp;nbsp;Eos]] – and derives a diameter of 18.38 kilometers with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 11.43.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named for the over 1000-mile long Siberian [[Angara River]] that drains [[Lake Baikal]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] before November 1977 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 4190}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

The '''3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA''' is a [[Canadian Army]] Reserve [[artillery]] regiment based in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. It is part of the [[5th Canadian Division]]'s [[37 Canadian Brigade Group]].

The Loyal Company of Artillery of the City of Saint John was formed on May 4, 1793 after  passed its first ''Militia Act'' in 1792 in response to the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Since that historic founding The Loyal Company of Artillery formed the core of a body of militia artillery that has existed in the province right up to the present day in the form of 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery. For much of the 20th century the Regiment proudly carried "The Loyal Company" designation as part of its title, perpetuating the connection to Canada's oldest artillery unit.The Loyal Company was the first of several militia artillery companies, renamed batteriesin the later nineteenth century, formed in  for the defence of the colony's mainport and border towns from outside threat.

'''War of 1812'''

The threat of war with the United States proved real enough in 1812 that New Brunswick militia artillery detachments were activated as part of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the to man newly built shore batteries in overlooking the Passamaquoddy Bay and the coast of disputed territory in what is now the State of. Throughout the War of 1812 other detachments of militia artillerymen built and manned defences alongside British regular gunners around .

'''The New Brunswick Regiment of Artillery'''

Saint John's importance as the key all-season port of entry into British North America and then  meant that the city garrison was always armed and provisioned for defense from the sea. Artillery was central to that defense, making the garrison a logical focal point for the training and equipping of 's militia artillery from across the province. In 1838 militia artillery companies throughout the province were unified as the New Brunswick Regiment of Artillery. The core and headquarters of this force was the original Loyal Company and the gun batteries defending the harbour. Indeed, the NB Regiment of Artillery was formed to man those vital defenses when the British regular artillery garrison marched west in response to the '''Rebellions of 1837 and 1838''' in Upper and . That same year, the Regiment was called on to dispatch a troop of artillery to during the border dispute known as the  '''War of 1838-39'''. Despite funding shortages, the Regiment continued to maintain a high standard of readiness and artillery skill-at-arms largely due to a continuation of the same volunteer spirit that inspired the Loyal Company of Artillery. That readiness was apparent in 1866 during '''the Fenian Raids''' when the Regiment manned the gun batteries around  and along the border at . A decade later, they once again stood guard at the nation's coastal defenses during the '''1878 war scare with .''' They also came to the aid of the civil powers during the Saint John Great Fire of 1877 using their specialist skills in handling high explosives to blow down walls for a fire break. These dramatic highlights as well as more routine mustering for summer training camps and ceremonial occasions established the Regiment of Artillery as a proud and well-known element of 's defence forces. The province of New Brunswick and the City of Saint John recognized the many contributions of this regiment when it celebrated the founding of the Loyal Company with a grand centennial ball in May 1893.

'''20th Century Defending at Home and Abroad'''

In 1895, as part of a wave of Canadian defense modernization and national organization, the unit was first identified with its modern numerical designation and named the 3rd (New Brunswick) Regiment of Canadian Garrison Artillery. It counted among its members Lieutenant-Colonel C.W. Drury, considered to be the father of 's modern artillery. Drury commanded The Canadian Brigade of Artillery during the '''South African War,''' which included a troop of gunners from the Regiment's 89th Battery in Woodstock . LCol Drury was himself the son of LCol Richard Hayne, the Regiment's first commanding officer at the time of formation in 1838. So began the new 20th century reputation for excellence not only for manning defenses at home but also for raising well-trained artillerymen for overseas service.

'''The Great War, 1914-1918'''

The day after war broke out in August 1914 the Regiment barged its 4.7inch heavy guns to protect the mouth of the Saint John harbour . For the duration of the war, the Regiment stood on guard against the very real threat of German cruisers and submarines on Canada's east coast. The unit's heavy guns and experienced artillerymen also served to train thousands of volunteers from New Brunswick and eastern Canada for service in the Canadian Corps Heavy Artillery formed in 1916 in . The Regiment also contributed personnel to the 2nd Divisional Ammunition Column and the 1st Canadian Heavy Battery, among them future commanding officers LCol "Harry" Harrison and Major Cyrus Inches.

'''The Guns of Vimy, Passchendaele and the 100 Days'''

In 1916 volunteers from the Regiment travelled overseas as 4th and 6th Canadian Siege Batteries, firing their first shots in anger during the Battle of the Somme of the . There they perfected new techniques of long range counter-battery bombardment. The Canadian Corps Heavy Artillery, including 4th and 6th Siege Batteries gathered together for the first time with the whole of the Canadian Corps in the spring of 1917. That April they fired what has gone down in history as one of the most successful counter-battery bombardments in history, neutralizing over 80 percent of the German artillery and paving the way for Canadian infantrymen to take Vimy Ridge. From Vimy, 4th and 6th Canadian Siege Batteries were joined in 1918 by 3rd Brigade, Canadian Garrison Artillery, made up mostly of New Brunswick and Maritime gunners trained in Saint John. The Regiment became the core of the Canadian Corps Heavy Artillery during the Great War. New Brunswick heavy gunners supported the Corps in the difficult fighting for the final 100 Days Campaign. Our batteries played an especially important role in the dramatic Canadian victory at the Canal du Nord and Cambrai in September 1918. At the end of the Great War, surviving veterans came home to what became known as 3rd (New Brunswick) Coast Brigade, Royal Canadian Artillery, (The Loyal Company of Artillery). Many veterans stayed active in the interwar militia, keeping alive the specialized skill set of long range artillery.

'''The Second World War, 1939-1945'''

In 1939 3rd (New Brunswick) Coast Brigade, RCA, (The Loyal Company of Artillery) mobilized to prepare and man new heavy coastal gun batteries constructed around Saint John. The threat of German surface raiders and submarines was even greater in the Second World War than in the first, requiring much of the Regiment's attention. However, the requirements for trained artillerymen for overseas service led to the despatch of four batteries from the regiment. 89th Battery from Woodstock mustered as field artillery while 90th and 104th Batteries from Fredericton assembled as anti-tank units. All three were despatched to Italy, taking part in the Canadian victory at the '''Hitler Line''' that opened the '''liberation of Rome .''' 105th  from Saint John  also went overseas as an anti-tank unit, landing in '''Normandy'''  and taking part in the climactic '''Battle of the Falaise Gap''' and '''The  Battle of the Scheldt .'''

'''1945-2012'''

The close of the Second World War ended direct threats to Canada's east coast by sea. The new threat to Canadian security in the early Cold War era came from Soviet bombers carrying nuclear weapons. In response the Regiment was re-organized as a medium anti-aircraft unit. The threat of aircraft gave way to ballistic missiles, and the Canadian Army once again organized for forward conventional defence in Europe as a leading member of the Treaty Organization. In that context, in 1962 the Regiment evolved into its present role as the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment (The Loyal Company), Royal Canadian Artillery. Since then the Regiment has continued in its same function since the Loyal Company was formed in 1793; to maintain a reserve force of trained artillerymen to defend  at home and abroad. In recent decades, the most visible form of that mission has been to provide gunners and officers to augment regular force Royal Canadian Artillery batteries deployed for overseas service on peace-keeping, peace-enforcement and stability operations. In the last four decades hundreds of 3rd Field Artillery Regiment gunners have served in, '''Cyprus''' the '''Golan Heights''', the Former '''Yugoslavia''', '''Somolia''', and most recently'''. the South Sudan''' A mission of particular pride was in support of the Canadian Forces's efforts in '''Afghanistan''', where the requirement for Canadian soldiers with artillery and observer skills once again became paramount.The Loyal Company title was officially shorn as the Regiment's post-nominal title on 20 November 1975, apparently as part of the wider policy of separating the unified Canadian Forces from traditions and customs associated with . Nevertheless, the unit continues to perpetuate the link its 1793 foundation. After a loud appeal the Canadian Government restored the Loyal Company to the regiment's official name in 2012. Members of this regiment stand ready by their guns at your service.

The '''A70 road''' is a major road in [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]] . It runs a total of {{Convert|74.3|mi|km}} from [[Edinburgh]] to [[Ayr]]. It begins as Dalry Road at the [[Haymarket, Edinburgh]] junction with the [[A8 road (Scotland)|A8]], passing near but not through [[Lanark]] and ending as Miller Road in [[Ayr]]. Between Edinburgh city centre and Lanark it passes through the Edinburgh suburbs of [[Slateford]], [[Juniper Green]], [[Currie]] and [[Balerno]]; then [[Carnwath]] (where the A70 joins the A721 for three miles), [[Carstairs]] (where the two roads separate again),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A70&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ravenstruther]], while between Lanark and Ayr it passes through Hyndford Bridge, [[Rigside]], [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]], [[Muirkirk]], Smallburn, [[Cumnock]], [[Ochiltree]], and [[Coylton]].

The Scots name of the road is the "Lang Whang",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/ScotlandWestLothianNoForestCamiltyForest&lt;/ref&gt; a whang in the [[Scots language|Scots]] tongue being a narrow strip of leather, usually a long leather bootlace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/whang&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the road is over elevated, desolate moorland; it ascends several times on its course to heights over 1000 feet above sea level. Because the wind enjoys an easy and uninterrupted passage over its length, in winter the road is frequently closed by snow, even by modest snowfalls. The road passes elevated farmland and grouse moor and presents extensive views over central Scotland to the north.

According to tradition, [[Robert Burns]] stopped at the formerly thatched Wee Bush Inn in Carnwath on his way to Edinburgh: quite a likely event since the road is the most direct link between the Scottish capital and Burn's native Ayrshire. As the story has it, all Burns could think of to engrave on the inn window (a habit for which he had a reputation) was, "Lang Whang, Lang Whang, Lang bloody Whang", which neatly sums up the prospect for anybody facing the walk, ride or cycle along it, especially in winter. It was one of the roads along which the murderers [[Burke and Hare murders|Burke and Hare]] brought the cadavers of their victims for the Edinburgh Medical College to dissect.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/historyofburkha00macg/historyofburkeha00macg_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collins 2012 Big Road Atlas shows the A70 as one of the five most dangerous roads in Scotland, based on the number of serious and fatal accidents between 2007 and 2009 in proportion to traffic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC news [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-14590493 "Collins atlas rates five Scottish A roads 'high risk'"] 19 August 2011, accessed 19 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There are many extremely dangerous sections: particular blackspots are the crown of Auchinoon Brae on the approach to Harperigg Reservoir and the right angled bends at the east end of the reservoir. Any of the undulating and winding terrain between Balerno and Carnwath where oncoming cars can be concealed by dips in the road can be considered dangerous and there is barely a half-mile stretch of the Lang Whang between Balerno and Carnwath which has not witnessed a fatal accident over the past twenty years.
[[File:Beech Trees - geograph.org.uk - 157269.jpg|thumb|left|A70 near Crosswood Hill Farm]]
The A70 is purportedly the scene of one of Scotland's best-known [[UFO]] incidents, now known as 'the A70 incident'. Two men, Garry Wood and Colin Wright, were travelling one evening in 1992 from the outskirts of Edinburgh to the village of [[Tarbrax]]. Something evidently caused them to be delayed, for they arrived at their destination much later than expected. Several months later the pair underwent [[hypnotic regression]] and claimed to recall that they had been abducted, examined and communicated with by alien creatures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2009/12/19/scotland-s-biggest-ufo-mystery-comes-to-light-in-startling-new-book-86908-21908554/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://programmes.stv.tv/the-hour/news/128129-scotlands-biggest-ufo-incident-to-hit-the-big-screen/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316034107/http://programmes.stv.tv/the-hour/news/128129-scotlands-biggest-ufo-incident-to-hit-the-big-screen/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Little Vantage on the A70 near Harperrig Reservoir, a footpath (called Thieves Road) heads south across the upper reaches of the [[Water of Leith]] and continues across moorland to a pass over the [[Pentland Hills]] called Cauldstane Slap and on to [[West Linton]]. This was part of a much longer [[drove road]] used in past centuries for transporting cattle south from the central belt and northern Scotland to [[Peebles]] and ultimately to the English markets, and for moving sheep north from West Linton market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagepaths.co.uk/pathdetails.php?path=19&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early Islamic states of the eighth and ninth centuries, Islamic law (known in [[Arabic]] as [[sharia]]) always existed alongside other [[normative]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Otto|first=Jan Michiel|title=Sharia Incorporated: A Comparative Overview of the Legal Systems of Twelve Muslim Countries in Past and Present|year=2009|publisher=Leiden University Press|location=Leiden|isbn=978-9087280574|pages=615–16|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/221087|access-date=13 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105224404/http://dare.uva.nl/document/221087#|archive-date=5 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within sharia, some crimes are known as ''[[hudud]]'', for which there are specific penalties specified by Islam.

==Definition and scope==
[[Sharia]] law in this article means the [[moral code]] and [[religious law]] of Islam. It includes criminal, civil, personal, economic and all aspects of law as revealed in Quran and Hadiths; in its strictest and most historically coherent definition, sharia is considered the infallible law of [[Allah]].&lt;ref name="Coulson, N. J. 2011"&gt;Coulson, N. J. (2011), ''A history of Islamic law'', Aldine, {{ISBN|978-1412818551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary sources of sharia are the precepts set forth in the [[Quranic]] verses ([[ayah]]s), and the example set by the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] in the [[Sunnah]].&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;Esposito, John (2001), ''Women in Muslim family law'', Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0815629085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of sharia includes Islamic law as interpreted by Islamic judges ([[qadis]]) with varying responsibilities for the religious leaders. For questions not directly addressed in the [[primary sources]], sharia includes consensus of the religious scholars (''[[ulama]]'') thought to embody the consensus of the Muslim Community (''[[ijma]]'').&lt;ref name="Coulson, N. J. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"/&gt;

==Classification==
The legal systems of Muslim countries may be grouped as: mixed systems, classical sharia systems, and secular systems.&lt;ref name="Otto2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Otto|first=Jan Michiel|title=Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9XaP-ufhPQC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=11 March 2013|date=30 August 2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-9087280482|pages=635–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical sharia systems===
Classical sharia systems are those where sharia plays a dominant role and is present in most areas of a nation's legal system. Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan are examples of classical sharia systems.&lt;ref name="Otto2008"/&gt;

===Secular systems===
Secular systems are those where sharia plays no role in the nation's legal system. Turkey is an example of a Muslim-majority nation with a secular system.&lt;ref name="Otto2008"/&gt;

===Mixed systems===
Mixed systems are those where sharia is not dominant, but plays a significant role in one or more areas of the nation's legal system. This is observed in majority of Muslim nations.&lt;ref name="Otto2008"/&gt;

However virtually all courts, including the [[Afghan Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Afghanistan]], rely on Islamic law directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lau|first=Martin|title=Afghanistan’s Legal System and its Compatibility with International Human Rights Standards|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/48a3f02c0.pdf|publisher=UNHCR|page=21|access-date=2018-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608225917/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/48a3f02c0.pdf#|archive-date=2017-06-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They eliminated all distinctions between men and women, between Muslims and non-Muslims, in accepting witnesses in court and awarding monetary compensations for damages. They increased the marriageable age for girls to fifteen (from thirteen). They reopened the judiciary to women. They gave them equal rights in divorce courts and permitted them to have custody rights over children under the age of seven. Never before in the Middle East had a freely elected parliament so blatantly challenged basic tenets of the sharia. What is more, they ratified the UN Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women – the USA has still refused to ratify this highly egalitarian convention.

'''Charles Vélain''' (16 May 1845 &amp;ndash; 6 June 1925) was a [[France|French]] [[geologist]] and [[geography|geographer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Vélain, Charles|magazine=International Who's Who|year=1912|page=1047|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89097340061;view=1up;seq=1065}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Château-Thierry]].

Charles Vélain's route to the field of geology was an unusual one. He was a student of pharmacy. He studied geology later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He was part of several explorations, during which he studied various geological factors that would later bring him fame. Vélain's major contributions in the field of geology were in [[petrography]] and physical geography. He was an authority on [[volcanism]]. His works in this particular field earned him numerous accolades such as the price-Delalande Guérineau of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1877.&lt;ref name="Charles Vélain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Vélain|url=http://www.encyclopedie.picardie.fr/index.php/V%C3%A9lain,_Charles|publisher=Picardia|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Vélain also enjoyed a successful career as a scholar. He worked as a lecturer for several years. He also authored several scientific papers and articles. He wrote mostly on geology, petrology and physical geography, with volcanoes remaining his subject of interest and expertise. Some of his works include 'Volcanoes' (Paris, 1884), 'The Earthquakes' (Paris, 1887), and 'Petrology conferences' (Paris, 1889).&lt;ref name="Charles Vélain"/&gt;

The contributions of Charles Vélain were commemorated in 1963 by naming a peak in the [[Péninsule Rallier du Baty|Rally du Baty Peninsula]] as [[Mount Velain]].&lt;ref name="Charles Vélain"/&gt;

The '''Costa Chica of Guerrero''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for “small coast of Guerrero") is an area along the south coast of the state of [[Guerrero]], [[Mexico]], extending from just south of [[Acapulco]] to the [[Oaxaca]] border. Geographically, it consists of part of the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], a strip of rolling hills that lowers to coastal plains to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Various rivers here form large estuaries and [[lagoon]]s that host various species of commercial fish. 

This area is paired with the [[Costa Chica of Oaxaca]] as both have significant populations of [[Afro-Mexican]]s, who settled in the area as escaped slaves. The Afro-Mexican presence in Guerrero is strongest in this region, especially in the coastal municipalities from [[Marquelia]] to [[Cuajinicuilapa]]. Another important ethnic group is the [[Amuzgo people|Amuzgo]], who are by far the largest indigenous ethnicity in the region, in the municipalities of [[Xochistlahuaca]], [[Tlacoachistlahuaca]] and [[Ometepec]]. The Amuzgo, especially in Xochistlahuca, still wear traditional clothing and speak the [[Amuzgo language]]. Many women still weave cloth on [[Loom#Back_strap_loom |backstrap looms]]. The region is one of the poorest in Mexico, with an economy based on subsistence agriculture and fishing, with some commerce, especially along Highway 200, which parallels the coast.

The Costa Chica of Guerrero is a coastal region beginning just southeast of Acapulco, and ending at the Oaxaca state border to the south. It is culturally paired with the Costa Chica of Oaxaca as both have significant populations of Afro-Mexicans, who often also have indigenous ancestry.&lt;ref name="vaughn"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1937-mexico-s-black-heritage-the-costa-chica-of-guerrero-and-oaxaca |title= Mexico's Black heritage: the Costa Chica of Guerrero and Oaxaca |first=Bobby |last=Vaugh |date=September 1, 1998 |publisher=Mexconnect |accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="villerias"&gt; {{cite journal |last= Villerías Salinas |first= Salvador |author2= Álvaro Sánchez Crispín  |date=December 17, 2008 |title= Perspectiva territorial de la pesca en la Costa Chica de Guerrero |trans-title=Territorial perspective on fishing on the Costa Chica of Guerrero |journal= Investigaciones Geográficas |issue=71 |pages=43–56 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Instituto de Geografía, UNAM |language=Spanish |issn=0188-4611 |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url= http://www.ejournal.unam.mx/rig/RIG071/RIG000007105.pdf }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The Costa Chica is one of the seven regions of the state along with Zona Norte, Tierra Caliente, Centro, La Montaña, Acapulco and [[Costa Grande de Guerrero|Costa Grande]]. The largest metropolitan area of the region is [[San Marcos, Guerrero|San Marcos]] .&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.cdi.gob.mx/dmdocuments/amuzgos_guerrero.pdf |title= Amuzgos de Guerrero |first= Irma Guadalupe |last= Aguirre Pérez |year=2007 |publisher= Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Amuzgos of Guerrero |isbn=978-970-753-084-3 |accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt; There are fifteen municipalities in the region:[[Ayutla de los Libres|Ayutla]], [[Azoyú]], [[Copala, Guerrero|Copala]], [[Cuautepec]], [[Cruz Grande|Florencio Villarreal]], [[Igualapa]], [[Ometepec]], [[San Luis Acatlán]], [[San Marcos, Guerrero|San Marcos]], [[Tecoanapa]], [[Tlacoachistlahuaca]], [[Xochistlahuaca]], [[Cuajinicuilapa]], [[Marquelia]] and [[Juchitán, Guerrero|Juchitán]].&lt;ref name="regionalizacion"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |title=Regionalización |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México Estado de Guerrero |publisher= INAFED Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal SEGOB Secretaría de Gobernación |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Regions |accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the terrain is dominated by the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] as it parallels the coast. Between the mountains and the ocean is a narrow strip of hilly land called the Lomérios de la Vertiente del Pacífico and coastal plains called the Planicies Costeras. The region is filled with winding rivers which empty into the Pacific. The vegetation is [[deciduous]] low height tropical forest that loses most of its leaves during the dry season from November to May.&lt;ref name="consejo"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.arqueologia.inah.gob.mx/consejo/?p=1473 |title=Entre Ruinas Arqueológicas… Recorriendo La Costa Chica de Guerrero |author= Israel Román Ramos |publisher=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Among the archeological ruina… Traversing the Costa Chica de Guerrero |accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Oceanside municipalities include San Marcos, Florencio Villarreal, Copala, Marquelia and Cuajinicuilapa. The three main lagoons are [[Tecomate Lagoon|Tecomate]], [[Chautengo Lagoon|Chautengo]]  and [[Tres Palos Lagoon|Tres Palos]].&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt; The largest bay is the Bay of [[Puerto Marques]] next to Acapulco.&lt;ref name="consejo"/&gt;

The area has a hot climate that reaches an average high temperature of 32C.&lt;ref name="recorrela"&gt; {{cite news |title= Costa Chica: Recorrela |first=Nicolas |last=Triedo |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=July 24, 2005 |page=6 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Costa Chica: Explore it }} &lt;/ref&gt; The dry season extends from November to May and a rainy season from June to October. The area is prone to [[cyclone]]s from June to October.&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt; In 1997, [[Hurricane Pauline]] devastated the Costa Chica in both Guerrero and Oaxaca with winds reaching between 166 and 200km /hr. The toll was 120 dead, and 8,700 other victims. The region was left with partially destroyed roads with left a number of communities physically isolated for days.&lt;ref name="devasta"&gt; {{cite news |title= Devasta 'Paulina'  |author=Hugo Martinez |author2=Sergio Flores |author3=Ivan Rendon |author4=Jesus Guerrero  |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=October 10, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pauline devastates }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Costa Chica (of both Guerrero and Oaxaca) is one of two zones in Mexico with significant Afro-Mexican populations, with the other being in the state of [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="vaughn"/&gt; While Afro-Mexicans are found in most parts of the Costa Chica, the highest concentrations in Guerrero are found between Marquelia and Cuajicuilapa.&lt;ref name="recorrela"/&gt; Members of this group in the region are often identified by skin color. Some consider the classification to be racism, while others identify as primarily Afro-Mexican. Many also have indigenous or mestizo ancestry.&lt;ref name="lamusica"&gt; {{cite news |title= Es la música de la Costa Chica, importante legado cultural de México. |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=September 9, 2008 |page= |language=Spanish |trans-title=It’s the music of the Costa Chica, important cultural legacy of Mexico }} &lt;/ref&gt; While Africans are described as the “third root,” along with indigenous and Spanish people as part of Mexico heritage, this has often been "forgotten” in the description of the “mestizaje” identity of Mexico, which stresses the mixture of European and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="lamusica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], disease, war and overwork all but wiped out the native population. In a number of areas, the Spanish brought in African slaves to replace the lost labor.&lt;ref name="lamusica"/&gt; The first African slave brought to Mexico accompanied [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1519. During the colonial period, there was a significant African slave population. Large quantities of slaves were imported starting in the mid-1500s and by 16th and 17th centuries; about half of Mexico City’s population has at least some African heritage, as Mexico was the second-largest slave importer in the Americas, after Brazil.&lt;ref name="kwhite"&gt; {{cite journal |last=White |first=Kelvin L |date=October 17, 2009 |title= Meztizaje and remembering in Afro-Mexican communities of the Costa Chica: implications for archival education in Mexico |journal=Archival Science |volume=9 |pages=43–55 |publisher= Springer Science+Business Media |doi=10.1007/s10502-009-9102-5}} &lt;/ref&gt; The first Africans brought to the Pacific coast arrived to Acapulco brought by Spanish galleons.&lt;ref name="recorrela"/&gt; Many later arrivals included escaped black slaves, called “''[[cimarrones]]''” who found refuge in the area.&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;  However, most local stories about how Africans arrived to the area have to do with local shipwrecks, whether it was a slave ship or not. All end with the idea that they found freedom and refuge in the communities along the coast. Due to the isolation of the area and their desire to keep their freedom, little was written about their history.&lt;ref name="kwhite"/&gt;
 
The historic Afro-Mexican communities were known for building round mud huts with thatched roofs, the design of which can be traced back to what are now [[Ghana]] and the [[Ivory Coast]]. Few of these traditional structures remain; over time, the people adopted local customs.&lt;ref name="vaughn"/&gt;  Today, Afro-Mexican culture does not have its own language or dress. It is sometimes distinguished by body language and vocabulary, as well as a shared heritage.&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/cuajinicuilapa-en-la-costa-chica-de-guerrero.html |title= Cuajinicuilapa, en la Costa Chica de Guerrero |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 18, 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The culture was featured in a documentary called ''Santa Negritud'' by La Maga Films sponsored by [[Susana Harp]] .&lt;ref name="negritud"&gt; {{cite news |title= Revaloran la negritud de la Costa Chica |first=Julieta |last=Riveroll |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 2, 2008 |page=8 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Revalue the blackness of the Costa Chica }} &lt;/ref&gt; The history and culture of these people is also the focus of a museum in [[Cuajinicuilapa]], called the [[Museo de las Culturas Afromestizas]] .&lt;ref name="sicgobafro"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://sic.conaculta.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=museo&amp;table_id=835 |title= Museo de las Culturas Afromestizas |publisher=CONACULTA |work= Sistema de Información Cultural |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Amuzgos and other indigenous==
[[File:XochisWeavers29.JPG|thumb|Amugzo woman piecing cloth together to make a [[huipil]].]]
[[File:XochistlahuacaCommMuseum02.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Ireneo Santanna, director of the Amuzgo Community Museum in Xochistlahuaca]]
Indigenous peoples of the area include the [[Amuzgo people|Amuzgo]], [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]], [[Tlapanec people|Tlapanec]] and [[Chatino people|Chatino]]. The Amuzgo are the most numerous by far, followed by the Mixtec, who are mostly found in Tlacoachistlahuaca.&lt;ref name="vaughn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; Historically the indigenous peoples associated the African slaves with the Spanish. The colonists sometimes used the slaves to execute indigenous people. Most indigenous and Afro Mexicans live in separate communities or separate neighborhoods of the same community. However, the separation is not absolute, as there have been marriages between indigenous and Afro Mexicans.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;

The Amuzgo live in the border region of Guerrero and Oaxaca, near the Pacific Coast. Municipalities with the largest Amuzgo population in order are Xochistlahuaca, Tlacoachistlahuaca, Ometepec in Guerrero and [[San Pedro Amuzgos]] in Oaxaca. Census figures put the [[Amuzgo language|Amuzgo]] speaking population at about 35,000, but ethnic studies put the number at about 50,000, with about eighty percent living in the state of Guerrero.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; The Amuzgo language belongs to the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto manguean family]], in the [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtec sub family]]. 

The origin of the Amuzgo is unknown. One theory states that the group migrated to its current location from the north from the area of the [[Pánuco River]]. Another states that they migrated from [[South America]]. Amuzgo folklore states that they came from islands in the sea. The Amuzgo also populated the coast but Mixtec expansion, the Spanish conquest, and later African migration pushed them into the mountains.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; One interpretation of the name “Amuzgo” is from [[Nahuatl]], meaning “place of books,” probably indicating that the region had administrative functions. The name of the language in Amuzgo is ''ñomnda'' (word of water). The name of the people is ''nnánncue'' (people in the middle).&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;

There is important [[Amuzgo textiles|traditional textile production among the Amuzgos]], along with ceramics, leather, cheese and [[piloncillo]]. Most surplus products are sold in Ometepec. Traditional weaving is done on a backstrap loom, and girls learn the process starting from when they are about six or seven years old. The most traditional garments are made from a local cotton called coyuche, which is grown, cleaned, spun, dyed then woven. The most notable and time consuming garment is the women’s [[huipil]], which has at time, very complicated designs woven into it. A number of Amuzgo weavers have been recognized for their work including [[Florentina López de Jesús]]. Many Amuzgos in Guerrero still wear traditional garments, with men wearing loose white cotton pants and shirt and the women wearing a huipil and dress. However, those made with commercial cloth is becoming more common.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:XochistlahuacaCommMuseum03.JPG|thumb|left|Archeological pieces at the Xochistlahuaca Community Museum]]
Archeological excavation in the region has been spotty with only preliminary evaluation starting from the 1930s, so information on the pre Hispanic history of this area is limited. Sites have been identified in the municipalities of Azoyú, Juchitán, Marquelia, Ometepec, San Luis Acatlán and Tecoanapa. Highland sites include Piedra Labrada, Los Zapotales, La Mira, Arcelia del Progreso and Yoloxóchitl all above 650 meters above sea level. Hill sites include Capulín Chocolate, El Pericón, Tecuantepec, El Limón, Horcasitas, Chinantla, San Luis Acatlán and Zoyatlán. Those  by the ocean are generally near the mouths of rivers and include Las Arenillas and El Alto. Horcasitas and San Luis Acatlán are notable because they are built on natural elevations to avoid seasonal flooding from the San Luis River. 

Arcelia del Progreso, Marquelia and Yoloxóchitl show [[Olmec]] influence.&lt;ref name="consejo"/&gt; Much of the region was part of a Mixtec province called Ayacatla, which had its capital in Igualapa.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; In addition to the four found today, there were other indigenous groups, such as the Yopenahuatlec in what is now Marquelia, but they disappeared over the colonial period as the indigenous population markedly declined.&lt;ref name="marquelgob"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://marquelia.guerrero.gob.mx/?page_id=23 |title= Historia  |publisher=State of Guerrero |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=History |accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;

During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, [[Pedro de Alvarado]] conquered the area in 1522, founding the town of Acatlán the same year.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt; In 1531, a Tlapanec uprising forced most of the Spanish residents to flee. During the rest of the 16th century, much of the indigenous population was decimated, primarily due to new [[infectious diseases]] carried by colonists; they also suffered from war and overwork.&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt; In Xochistlahuaca there were about 20,000 indigenous in 1522 but by 1582, only 200 survived.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;
[[File:MuseoAfromestizas01.JPG|thumb|Map depicting the slave trade at the Museo de las Culturas Afromeztizas]]

The area was developed by colonists in the 16th century for ranching, and they imported slaves to help with the labor. They exported meat, hides and wool. Soon after, the area became inhabited by Africans and Afro-Mexicans. During the colonial period, the Spanish imported a total of about 200,000 African slaves from West Africa to Mexico over three centuries.&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/migrations/legacy/almleg.html Colin A. Palmer, ''Africa's Legacy in Mexico: A Legacy of Slavery"], Smithsonian Institution: Migrations in History, n.d., accessed 24 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isteve.com/2002_Where_Did_Mexicos_Blacks_Go.htm Steve Sailer, ''Race Now,'' Part 3: "Where Did Mexico's Blacks Go?"], UPI, 9 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Most were landed at [[Veracruz]]. Working on sugar plantations, in mines and in ranching, slaves who escaped migrated to the isolated Costa Chica region, where they found refuge. 

Spanish landholders gave them protection in return for cheap labor, mostly tending cattle and curing leather. Over time, there was significant interracial mixing among Europeans, indigenous and Africans.&lt;ref name="palmer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt; Colonial authorities required slaves to convert to Catholicism. But, in smaller communities such as San Nicolas and Colorado, many Afro-Mexicans continued to use traditional magical practices to cure illness and resolve problems, often combining them with Catholic practice.&lt;ref name="recorrela"/&gt;  Xochistlahuaca became an administrative and religious center in 1563, which it was during the height of the Mixtec people. It has remained an important religious center to this day.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; 

In 1813, [[José María Morelos y Pavón]] came through the region, entering from Oaxaca to take the area during the [[Mexican War of Independence]] on his way to Acapulco.&lt;ref name="sanmarcosob"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://sanmarcos.guerrero.gob.mx/?page_id=23 |title= Reseña Historica de San Marcos |publisher=State of Guerrero |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Summary of the history of San Marcos|accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="omeencmuc"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://guerrero.gob.mx/municipios/costa-chica/ometepec/ |title= Ometepec |publisher=State of Guerrero |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, the region became part of the Capitanía General del Sur, with [[Vicente Guerrero]], an Afro-Mexican, as its head. In 1824, the Ometepec area was part of the state of [[Puebla]] .&lt;ref name="omeencmuc"/&gt;

In 1878, the Casa Miller was founded in Cuajinicuilapa, which transformed the economy of the area. The enterprise consisted of a soap factory, the raising of cattle and the growing of cotton, on a total of about 125,000 hectares. Products were shipped from Tecoanapa to market.&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt; 

During the colonial period, the Amuzgo and other indigenous had their land taken from them and were forced to pay rent where they lived. They began to fight to take the land back in 1920, which resulted in the establishment of an Amuzgo [[ejido]] in 1933. Land redistribution in [[ejido]]s occurred in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="marquelgob"/&gt; This ejido was recognized as the municipality of Xochistlahuaca in 1934.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;
[[File:XochistlahuacaParish10.JPG|thumb|Cracks at the parish church in Xochistlahuaca from the 2012 quake]]
Highway 200, built through the region in the early 1960s, stimulated commercial development in the area, as it opened up transportation connections with other areas. With ease of travel, new residents were attracted to the region.&lt;ref name="marquelgob"/&gt; Population growth precipitated the need to subdivide areas into new municipalities. Marquelia was made a municipality in 2002 and Juchitán became one in 2004.&lt;ref name="marquelgob"/&gt;

The [[2012 Guerrero–Oaxaca earthquake|last major earthquake in the region]] occurred on 20 March 2012, and was 7.4 on the Richter scale. It was centered near Ometepec and was the strongest since the 1985 quake. It was preceded by at least 16 quakes of over 5.0 in the same spring. Municipalities in the region that suffered damage include Ometepec, Xochistlahuaca, Copala, Cruz Grande and Marquelia.&lt;ref name="44replicas"&gt; {{cite news |title= Luego de 44 replicas, habitantes de Costa Chica de Guerrero temen nuevo sismo |url= http://mexico.diariocritico.com/noticia/sismo-79-grados-richter/guerrero-/4001613 |newspaper=Diario Crítico |location=Mexico City |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=After 44 aftershocks, residents of the Costa Chica de Guerrero fear another earthquake }} &lt;/ref&gt; Most of the serious damage from this quake occurred in the Costa Chica region, with over 900 homes made inhabitable.&lt;ref name="proceso"&gt; {{cite news |title= Guerrero: Circo, abusos y limosnas |author= Marcela Turati |author2= Ezequiel Flores |url= http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=302963 |newspaper=Proceso |location=Mexico City |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Guerrero:Circus, abuses and alms }} &lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 20th century to the present, crime has been a problem for the region. There has been a growing problem with drug trafficking, despite the increased presence of military and federal police.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crean"&gt; {{cite news |title= Crean policía comunitaria   |author=Jesus Guerrero  |newspaper=Mural |location=Guajalajara, Mexico |date=April 7, 2008 |page=8 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Create community police}} &lt;/ref&gt; Most municipalities do not have the resources to police the very rural, mostly indigenous areas. Communities have developed various citizen patrols and justice systems, which mostly mete out community service as punishment. Most of these have been legally recognized by local authorities.&lt;ref name="forman"&gt; {{cite news |title= Forman en Guerrero seguridad autonoma  |author=Jesus Guerrero |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=October 27, 2003 |page=16 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Autonomous security is formed in Guerrero }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dengue]] and [[rotovirus]] are relatively common health problems in the region, as in the rest of the state.&lt;ref name="pegan"&gt; {{cite news |title= Pegan dengue y rotavirus a Guerrero |author=Sergio Flores |author2=Jesus Guerrero  |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=March 15, 2007 |page=18 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Dengue and Rotavirus hit in Guerrero}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and education==
[[File:MuseoAfromestizas09.JPG|thumb|Display at the Museo de las Culturas Afromestizas with a "torito"]]
The Costa Chica has one of Mexico's unique music and dance traditions. Many of the songs and dances reflect the interethnic conflicts of the region over the centuries. One notable music and dance style is called “[[chilena (dance)|chilena]],” characterized by a stomping dance with erotic movements with participants carrying handkerchiefs, part of Afro-Mexican culture. The songs have themes such as love, the environment, animals, politicians and religion.&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lamusica"/&gt; Another genre is called “artesa,” a type of [[fandango]], which is performed in front of a type of an elongated wooden box fitted with a bull’s head. It is also called ''El Torito,'' which involves the use of a bull-shaped frame on the center dancer with others around him. While the music plays, various couple step up onto the box to dance on it with vigor. The dance has been interpreted as a way to gain a kind of vengeance as the bull-box represents the Spanish. 

Another important folk dance is called ''Los Diablos'' (The Devils), which is performed by a group of men in masks with long beards. The dancers are “encouraged” by assistants wielding leather whips. This is performed on 31 October in preparation for the national holiday of the [[Day of the Dead]]. These devils represent the underworld.&lt;ref name="lamusica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt; Other traditional dances of the region include 'La Tortuga,' 'Los Doce Pares de Francia' and 'La Conquista.' These dances feature characters such as Hernán Cortés, [[Cuauhtémoc]], Moctezuma and even [[Charlemagne]] and Turkish horsemen.&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt;

The region has an active [[corrido]] or ballad tradition. One type of corrido simultaneously glorifies and chastises “hombres bragado” (“ballsy men”) who risk their lives, often with violence, to defend local notions of honor and glory.&lt;ref name="poetryviolence"&gt; {{cite journal |last=Pena |first=Manual |date=Winter 2004 |title= Poetry and Violence: The Ballad Tradition of Mexico's Costa Chica |journal=Journal of American Folklore |volume=117 |issue=463 |pages=107–108 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Magical practices, such as the use of amulets and more to cure sickness and other problems, are still found.&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt; These practices can be found particularly in very rural Afro-Mexican communities, such as San Nicolas and Colorado.&lt;ref name="recorrela"/&gt; Afro-mestiza culture does not have its own language and dress but it is distinguished by body language and vocabulary as well as a shared heritage. There have been efforts to strengthen and promote the African-descended culture of the Costa Chica. One of these is the establishment of the [[Museo de las Culturas Afromestizas]] .&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt;

As of 2000, about a quarter of the population of the Costa Chica region was illiterate. The municipality of Cuajinicuilapa having the highest rate at 30%. The government has worked for twenty years to try to improve education in the region.&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:PuntaMaldonado60.JPG|thumb|Residents of Punta Maldonada with freshly caught fish]]

The Costa Chica is characterized by high indices of socio-economic marginalization; it is one of the poorest regions in the state of Guerrero.&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vaughn"/&gt;  Xochistlahuaca is the 4th-poorest municipality in Guerrero and the 16th-poorest in Mexico.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; Only 16% of homes have running water and drainage, and only 15% use gas for cooking. Only three percent of the population has access to government health care.&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt; Since the late 20th century, more men have migrated out of the region to find work, mostly in tourism centers in Guerrero, such as Acapulco, and some other states in Mexico. There is also some migration to the US, such as California, Chicago and North Carolina.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;

The main economic activities are agriculture, livestock and fishing, with corn being the most important crop, grown by households for their own consumption. One cash crop is [[hibiscus]], which is sold locally and nationally, and another is sesame seed.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; Other common crops are coconut, [[mango]],  and some watermelon.&lt;ref name="vaughn"/&gt;  In Xochistlahuaca and Tlacoachistlahuaca, the economy is based on agriculture. There is a small but growing commercialization of dairy products such as cheese to outside municipalities. Commerce in this area has been helped by the 1995 construction of highway linking Xochistlahuaca and Tlacoachistlahuaca with the regional commercial center of [[Ometepec]].&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; Marquelia has large expanses of coconut groves, whose fruit is mostly used to produce soap and oil.&lt;ref name="recorrela"/&gt;

There are fifteen main fishing communities, which capture various ocean and lagoon/estuary species. Thirteen of these are completely dependent on fishing, with San Marcos and Marquelia having other economic activities, such as commerce and services. Fishing communities are divided among those that principally fish in open ocean and those that fish in lagoons. Each community has at least one fishing cooperative. The fishing communities include San José Guatemala, Boca del Río, Colonia Juan Nepmuceno Álvarez, Barra de Copala, Marquilia, Playa La Bocana, Barra de Teconapa, Punta Maldonado, Nuevo Tecomulapa, Las Ramaditas, San Marcos, Pico del Monte and Las Peñas. The two locations with the most fishing activity area Barra de Tecoanapa and Punta Maldonado.&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;

Traditional fishermen on the Guerrero coast earn little and are marginalized socially and economically. But they also are exposed to global pressures on the fishing industry in both marketing their catch and fishing rights offshore. The growing tourism industry threatens commercial fishermen. Fishermen supplement what they make by fishing with agriculture (mostly corn) and some livestock. Despite this, it is still a valuable economic activity for the communities that depend on it. Between 2000 and 2003, 1,229 tons of fish and other ocean specimens were captured off the Costa Chica, with a value of just under 2 million dollars. Given the length of the coastline, this is considered low. Major species include huachinango ([[Lutjanus peru]]), rock oysters ([[Crossostrea virginensis]]), lisa (Mugel sp), bandera ([[Ariidae]]), jurel ([[Caranx caninus]]), pargo ([[lutjanus argentiventris]]) and others.&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;

Seventy percent of the fishermen belong to cooperatives. Fishermen work for themselves, selling to intermediaries. Fishing is limited to the ocean close to shore due to the small fiberglass motorboats used. Most fish is shipped to Acapulco, with lesser amounts to [[Chilpancingo]], [[Tecpán de Galeana|Tecpan]], [[Chilapa de Álvarez|Chilapa]] and [[Tlapa de Comonfort|Tlapa]].&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;

Most municipalities of the region are joined by Federal Highway 200, stretching from Acapulco to [[Pinotepa Nacional]] in Oaxaca. Most economic development, especially commerce, has taken place along this highway as well, mostly among [[mestizo]] inhabitants.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt; Most other roads in the area are in poor condition, either because they are deteriorated or unpaved. During the rainy season, they can be impassable.&lt;ref name="villerias"/&gt;

San Marcos, which is along Highway 200, is the region’s most important commercial center. It is followed by Ometepec.&lt;ref name="gueramuzgo"/&gt;

==Tourism==
[[File:Chautengo06.JPG|thumb|left|View at Chautengo Lagoon]]
[[File:Bocana04.JPG|thumb|Palapa restaurants at Playa Bocana]]
While the Costa Chica is generally unknown to tourists, the state government has worked to promote it. It has sunk cement blocks designed to allow the growth of coral to form artificial reefs and accompanying fish and shellfish. The reefs are intended to attract recreational divers. They also serve as breeding areas for the huauchinango fish, which is important for the Costa Chica. The artificial reefs have been placed off various points of the state: in the Costa Chica, about 300 have been placed in Marquelia and Copala. At Playa Ventura, the blocks also serve to break waves making the surf here gentler for swimmers.&lt;ref name="apuesta"&gt; {{cite news |title= Apuesta Guerrero a arrecife artificial  |author=Alfonso Juárez  |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=March 21, 2010 |page=16 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Guerrero bets on artificial reefs}} &lt;/ref&gt; In the past the beaches of this area were considered dangerous for tourists but this is no longer the case. 

Generally tourist facilities are very basic and rustic. Food service, generally under [[palapa (Mexico)|palapa]]s, open-air restaurants with thatched roofs, is common, but accommodations are sparse. One change to encourage tourism was to replace many speed bumps on Highway 200 and other major roads with devices that make the car vibrate instead to control speed. These roads are now also regularly patrolled by the Mexican federal police, which has been trying to control an increased incidence of highway robbery.&lt;ref name="costagob"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://guerrero.gob.mx/articulos/playas-de-costa-chica/ |title= Playas de Costa Chica |publisher=State of Guerrero |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Beaches of Costa Chica |accessdate=April 18, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;
Chautengo is a large lagoon in the Cruz Grande municipality. Most economic activity is based on fishing, but there are some palapas and food service at the Pico del Monte beach, which is next to where the lagoon opens to the sea.&lt;ref name="costagob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="recorrela"/&gt; La Bocana is a long beach facing open ocean with a small navigable estuary where the [[Marquelia River]] empties into the Pacific Ocean. The area is filled with palapa restaurants as the beach is popular with locals. La Peñitas has two small bays facing the ocean, and one mostly closed off and protected by a strip of land. Accommodations in small [[bungalows]] is available along with restaurants. Barra de Tecoanapa is next to the mouth of the [[Quetzala River]]. It has beaches facing the ocean. Playa Ventura is in the municipality of Marquelia.  This is a small bay facing open ocean with a long beach and medium waves. Unlike other beaches in the area, this is relatively developed with houses, restaurants and hotels made of cinderblock and concrete, painted in bright colors. Hotel services are basic and camping is permitted.&lt;ref name="costagob"/&gt;

[[Punta Maldonado]] is in the Cuajinicuilapa municipality. This is a small bay home to a fishing village. There is a couple of restaurants and two very modest hotels. The waves are gentle to moderate depending on the beach. This beach borders the state of Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="costagob"/&gt; In Punta Maldonado, men go out to sea at night to fish, with women taking the catch to market in the morning. The area also produces rock lobsters just a few meters off shore. The small lighthouse is close to the Guerrero/Oaxaca border.&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt;

Near Punta Maldonado is [[Tierra Colorada]], which is dedicated to the growing of sesame seed and hibiscus. It lies on the Santo Domingo lagoon, which has a wide variety of fish and birds among its mangroves. Near this is the Barro del Pío, which attracts fishermen in certain seasons. The structures in this area are inhabited only during these seasons.&lt;ref name="cuajimexdes"/&gt;

&lt;!--This article is in Commonwealth English--&gt;
The '''Duchy of Schleswig''' ({{lang-da|Hertugdømmet Slesvig}}; {{lang-de|Herzogtum Schleswig}}; [[Low German]]: ''Sleswig''; [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]]: ''Slaswik'') was a [[duchy]] in [[Southern Jutland]] (''Sønderjylland'') covering the area between about 60&amp;nbsp;km north and 70&amp;nbsp;km south of the current border between [[Germany]] and [[Denmark]]. The territory has been divided between the two countries since 1920, with [[South Jutland County|Northern Schleswig]] in Denmark and [[Southern Schleswig]] in Germany. The region is also called '''Sleswick''' in English.

The area's traditional significance lies in the transfer of goods between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], connecting the trade route through [[Russia]] with the trade routes along the [[Rhine]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast (see also [[Kiel Canal]]).

[[File:Folkesprogene i Hertugdømmet Slesvig.png|thumb|right|240px|[[Language shift]] in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig]]

===Early history===
Roman sources place the homeland of the tribe of [[Jutes]] north of the river [[Eider River|Eider]] and that of the [[Angles]] south of it. The Angles in turn bordered the neighbouring [[Saxons]]. By the early Middle Ages, the region was inhabited by three groups:
*[[Danes]] (including assimilated [[Jutes]]), who lived north of the [[Danevirke]] and the [[Eckernförde Bay]],
*[[North Frisians]], who lived in most of [[North Frisia]], including on the [[North Frisian Islands]], and
*[[Saxons]] (including [[Germanized]] [[Wagrians]] and [[Wends]]), who lived in the area south of the Danes and the Frisians. 

During the 14th century, the population on Schwansen began to speak Low German alongside Danish,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Treschow Hanson: ''Reise durch einen Theil von Sachsen und Dänemark'', Altona 1813, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise the ethno-linguistic borders remained remarkably stable until around 1800, with the exception of the population in the towns that became increasingly German from the 14th century onwards.

During the early [[Viking Age]], [[Haithabu]] – Scandinavia's biggest trading centre – was located in this region, which is also the location of the interlocking fortifications known as the [[Danevirke|''Danewerk'' or ''Danevirke'']]. Its construction, and  in particular its great expansion around 737, has been interpreted as an indication of the emergence of a unified Danish state.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelsen, Karsten Kjer, "Politikens bog om Danmarks oldtid", Politikens Forlag (1. bogklubudgave), 2002, {{ISBN|87-00-69328-6}}, pp. 122-123 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1931, scientists of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] announced that they had unearthed eighteen Viking graves with the remains of eighteen men in them. The discovery came during excavations in Schleswig. The skeletons indicated that the men were bigger proportioned than twentieth-century Danish men. Each of the graves was laid out from east to west. Researchers surmised that the bodies were entombed in wooden coffins originally, but only the iron nails remained.&lt;ref&gt;"Viking Find Reported", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 17, 1931, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the [[Early Middle Ages]], Schleswig formed part of the historical [[Lands of Denmark]] as Denmark unified out of a number of petty chiefdoms in the 8th to 10th centuries in the wake of Viking expansion.

The southern boundary of Denmark in the region of the [[Eider River]] and the Danevirke was a source of continuous dispute. The [[Treaty of Heiligen]] was signed in 811 between the Danish [[King Hemming]] and [[Charlemagne]], by which the border was established at the Eider. During the 10th century, there were several wars between [[East Francia]] and Denmark. In 1027, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] and [[Canute the Great]] again fixed their mutual border at the Eider.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers Konversationslexikon, 4th edition (1885-90), entry: "Eider"  [http://susi.e-technik.uni-ulm.de:8080/Meyers2/seite/werk/meyers/band/5/seite/0369/meyers_b5_s0369.html] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1115, King [[Niels of Denmark|Niels]] created his nephew [[Canute Lavard]] – a son of his predecessor [[Eric I of Denmark|Eric I]] – [[Earl]] of Schleswig, a title used for only a short time before the recipient began to style himself [[Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;Danmarkshistoriens hvornår skete det, Copenhagen: Politiken, 1966, p. 65 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1230s, Southern Jutland (the Duchy of Slesvig) was allotted as an [[appanage]] to [[Abel of Denmark|Abel Valdemarsen]], Canute's great-grandson, a younger son of [[Valdemar II of Denmark]]. Abel, having wrested the Danish throne to himself for a brief period, left his duchy to his sons and their successors, who pressed claims to the throne of Denmark for much of the next century, so that the Danish kings were at odds with their cousins, the dukes of Slesvig. Feuds and marital alliances brought the Abel dynasty into a close connection with the German [[Holstein-Glückstadt|Duchy of Holstein]] by the 15th century. The latter was a [[fief]] subordinate to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], while Schleswig remained a Danish fief.  &lt;!-- more material is needed to properly describe the dispute between the Danish kings and the Schauenburger dynasty --&gt; These dual loyalties were to become a main root of the dispute between the German states and Denmark in the 19th century, when the ideas of [[romantic nationalism]] and the [[nation-state]] gained popular support.

===Early modern times===&lt;!-- this section title is linked from other articles ---&gt;
The title of [[Duke]] of Schleswig was inherited in 1460 by the hereditary [[List of Danish monarchs|kings]] of Norway, who were also regularly elected kings of Denmark simultaneously, and their sons (unlike Denmark, which was not hereditary). This was an anomaly{{dubious|date=October 2018}} – a king holding a ducal title of which he as king was the fount and [[liege lord]]. The title and anomaly survived presumably because it was already co-regally held by the king's sons. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Between 1544 and 1713/20, the ducal reign had become a condominium, with the royal [[House of Oldenburg]] and its cadet branch [[House of Holstein-Gottorp]] jointly holding the stake. A third branch in the condominium, the short-lived House of [[Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev|Haderslev]], was already extinct in 1580 by the time of [[John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev|John the Elder]].

Following the [[Protestant Reformation]], when Latin was replaced as the medium of church service by the vernacular languages, the [[diocese of Schleswig]] was divided and an autonomous [[archdeaconry]] of Haderslev created. On the west coast, the Danish [[diocese of Ribe]] ended about 5&amp;nbsp;km north of the present border. This created a new cultural dividing line in the duchy because German was used for church services and teaching in the diocese of Schleswig and Danish was used in the diocese of Ribe and the archdeaconry of Haderslev. This line corresponds remarkably closely with the present border.

In the 17th century a series of wars between Denmark and Sweden—which Denmark lost—devastated the region economically. However, the nobility responded with a new agricultural system that restored prosperity. In the period 1600 to 1800 the region experienced the growth of manorialism of the sort common in the rye-growing regions of eastern Germany. The manors were large holdings with the work done by feudal peasant farmers. They specialized in high quality dairy products. Feudal lordship was combined with technical modernization, and the distinction between [[unfree labour]] and paid work was often vague.  The feudal system was gradually abolished in the late 18th century, starting with the crown lands in 1765 and later the estates of the nobility. In 1805 all serfdom was abolished and land tenure reforms allowed former peasants to own their own farms.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen, "Innovative Feudalism. The development of dairy farming and Koppelwirtschaft on manors in Schleswig-Holstein in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries," ''Agricultural History Review'' (2010) 58#2 pp 172-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and the rise of nationalism===
From around 1800 to 1840, the Danish-speaking population on the [[Angeln]] peninsula between Schleswig and Flensburg began to switch to Low German and in the same period many North Frisians also switched to Low German. This linguistic change created a new de facto dividing line between German and Danish speakers north of [[Tønder]] and south of Flensburg.
From around 1830, large segments of the population began to identify with either German or Danish nationality and mobilized politically. In Denmark, the National Liberal Party used the Schleswig Question as part of their agitation and demanded that the Duchy be incorporated into the Danish kingdom under the slogan "Denmark to the Eider". This caused a conflict between Denmark and the German states over Schleswig and [[Holstein]], which led to the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] of the 19th century. When the National Liberals came to power in Denmark in 1848, it provoked an uprising of ethnic Germans who supported Schleswig's ties with Holstein. This led to the [[First War of Schleswig]]. Denmark was victorious and the Prussian troops were ordered to pull out of Schleswig and Holstein following the [[London Protocol (1852)|London Protocol]] of 1852.

Denmark again attempted to integrate Schleswig by creating a new common constitution (the so-called [[History of Schleswig-Holstein#The November Constitution|November Constitution]]) for Denmark and Schleswig in 1863, but the [[German Confederation]], led by Prussia and Austria, defeated the Danes in the [[Second War of Schleswig]] the following year. Prussia and Austria then assumed administration of Schleswig and Holstein respectively under the [[Gastein Convention]] of 14 August 1865. However, tensions between the two powers culminated in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866. In the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]], the victorious Prussians annexed both Schleswig and Holstein, creating the [[province of Schleswig-Holstein]]. Provision for the cession of northern Schleswig to Denmark was made pending a popular vote in favour of this. In 1878, however, Austria went back on this provision, and Denmark recognized in a Treaty of 1907 with Germany that, by the agreement between Austria and Prussia, the frontier between Prussia and Denmark had finally been settled.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Schleswig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1900===
[[File:SchleswigSlesvig18642016.png|thumb|right|240px|Schleswig/Slesvig with present-day administrative borders]]
The [[Treaty of Versailles]] provided for [[Schleswig plebiscites, 1920|plebiscites]] to determine the ownership of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Schleswig (duchy)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, two [[referendum|referenda]] were held in 1920, resulting in the partition of the region. [[South Jutland County|Northern Schleswig]] voted by a majority of 75% to join Denmark, whereas Central Schleswig voted by a majority of 80% to remain part of Germany. In Southern Schleswig, no referendum was held, as the likely outcome was apparent. The name [[Southern Schleswig]] is now used for all of German Schleswig. This decision left substantial minorities on both sides of the new border.

Following the Second World War, a substantial part of the German population in Southern Schleswig changed their nationality and declared themselves as Danish. This change was caused by a number of factors, most importantly the German defeat and an influx of a large number of refugees [[Republikflucht|from eastern Germany]], whose culture and appearance differed from the local Germans, who were mostly descendants of Danish families who had changed their nationality in the 19th century. The change created a temporary Danish majority in the region and a demand for a new referendum from the Danish population in South Schleswig and some Danish politicians, including prime minister [[Knud Kristensen]]. However, the majority in the Danish parliament refused to support a referendum in South Schleswig, fearing that the "new Danes" were not genuine in their change of nationality. This proved to be the case and, from 1948 the Danish population began to shrink again. By the early 1950s, it had nevertheless stabilised at a level four times higher than the pre-war number.

In the [[Copenhagen-Bonn declaration]] of 1955, West Germany (later Germany as a whole) and Denmark promised to uphold the rights of each other's minority population. Today, both parts co-operate as a [[Euroregion]], despite a national border dividing the former duchy. As Denmark and Germany are both part of the [[Schengen Area]], there are no controls at the border.

==Name and naming dispute==
[[File:ForbudSønderjylland1895.jpg|thumb|The term "Sønderjylland" was forbidden by the Prussians in 1895. The picture shows two girls in costumes of the islands Föhr and Als before the Dannevirke]]
[[File:Sonderjylland1918.jpg|thumb|240px|upright=1.6|Danish Map of Southern Jutland (1918)]]
In the 19th century, there was a naming dispute concerning the use of ''Schleswig'' or ''Slesvig'' and ''Sønderjylland'' ([[Southern Jutland]]). Originally the duchy was called ''Sønderjylland'' (Southern Jutland) but in the late 14th century the name of the city Slesvig (now [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]]) started to be used for the whole territory. The term "Sønderjylland" was hardly used between the 16th and 19th centuries, and in this period the name "Schleswig" had no special political connotations. But around 1830, some Danes started to re-introduce the archaic term Sønderjylland to emphasize the area's history before its association with Holstein and its connection with the rest of [[Jutland]]. Its revival and widespread use in the 19th century therefore had a clear Danish nationalist connotation of laying a claim to the territory and objecting to the German claims. "Olsen's Map", published by the Danish cartographer Olsen{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} in the 1830s, used this term, arousing a storm of protests by the duchy's German inhabitants. Even though many Danish nationalists, such as the National Liberal ideologue and [[agitator]] [[Orla Lehmann]], used the name "Schleswig", it began to assume a clear German nationalist character in the mid 19th century – especially when included in the combined term "Schleswig-Holstein". A central element of the German nationalistic claim was the insistence on Schleswig and Holstein being a single, indivisible entity. Since Holstein was legally part of the German Confederation, and ethnically entirely German with no Danish population, use of that name implied that both provinces should belong to Germany and that their connection with Denmark should be weakened or altogether severed. 

After the German conquest in 1864, the term Sønderjylland became increasingly dominant among the Danish population, even though most Danes still had no objection to the use of "Schleswig" as such (it is etymologically of Danish origin) and many of them still used it themselves in its Danish version "Slesvig". An example is the founding of [[De Nordslesvigske Landboforeninger]] (The North Schleswig Farmers Association). In 1866 Schleswig and Holstein were legally merged into the Prussian [[province of Schleswig-Holstein]]. 
The naming dispute was resolved with the [[Schleswig plebiscites, 1920|1920 plebiscites and partition]], each side applying its preferred name to the part of the territory remaining in its possession – though both terms can, in principle, still refer to the entire region. Northern Schleswig was, after the 1920 plebiscites, officially named the Southern Jutland districts (''de sønderjyske landsdele''), while Southern Schleswig then remained a part of the Prussian province, which became the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in 1946.

The '''East Australian Current''' (EAC) is the southward western boundary current that is formed from the [[South Equatorial Current]] (SEC) crossing the [[Coral Sea]] and reaching the eastern coast of [[Australia]]. At around 15° S near the Australian coast the SEC divides forming the southward flow of the EAC. It is the largest ocean current close to the shores of Australia. The EAC reaches a maximum velocity at 30° S where its flow can reach 90&amp;nbsp;cm/s. As it flows southward it splits from the coast at around 31° to 32° S. By the time it reaches 33° S it begins to undergo a southward meander while another portion of the transport turns back northward in a tight recirculation. At this location the EAC reaches its maximum transport of nearly 35&amp;nbsp;[[Sverdrup|Sv]] (35 billion liters per second).&lt;ref name="Elsevier Inc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Talley|first1=Lynne|title=Descriptive physical oceanography: an introduction|publisher=Elsevier Inc|location=San Diego, CA|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the EAC flow that does not recirculate will move eastward into the Tasman Front crossing the [[Tasman Sea]] just north of the cape of [[New Zealand]]. The remaining will flow south on the EAC Extension until it reaches the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]]. The Tasman Front transport is estimated at 13&amp;nbsp;Sv. The eastward movement of the EAC through the Tasman Front and reattaching to the coastline of New Zealand forms the East Auckland Current.&lt;ref name="Elsevier Inc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roemmich|first1=D.|last2=Sutton|first2=P.|title=The mean and variability of ocean circulation past northern New Zealand: Determining the representativeness of hydrographic climatologies.|journal=J. Geophys. Res.|date=1998|volume=103|pages=13041–13054|doi=10.1029/98jc00583}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EAC also acts to transport tropical marine fauna to habitats in sub-tropical regions along the south east Australian coast.

== Physical Oceanography ==
[[File:EAC.gif|thumb|Heat flux in the East Australian Current from the equator toward the South Pole.]]
The EAC is a surface current driven by winds over the South Pacific. During different parts of the year these winds control how the current behaves. The EAC starts on the west edge of the [[South Pacific Gyre|South Pacific gyre]] where it collects warm, nutrient poor water. As it skirts along the East Coast of Australia it carries a large amount of warm tropical water from the equator southward. This process is part of what allows the [[Great Barrier Reef]] to thrive, it keeps the east coast of Australia around 18&amp;nbsp;°C year round instead of dropping to 12&amp;nbsp;°C in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/09/08/2043133.htm|title=Ocean currents|date=2005-09-08|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current is very low in nutrients, however, it remains important for the marine ecosystem. The EAC removes heat from the tropics and releases it to the mid-latitude water and atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roemmich|first=D.|last2=Gilson|first2=J.|last3=Davis|first3=R.|last4=Sutton|first4=P.|last5=Wijffels|first5=S.|last6=Riser|first6=S.|date=2007-02-01|title=Decadal Spinup of the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre|journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume=37|issue=2|pages=162–173|doi=10.1175/JPO3004.1|issn=0022-3670}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does this by producing warm core eddies, which allow the Tasman Seas to have a large biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/.../East-Australian-Current.pdf|title=The East Australian Current|last=Gold Coast City Council|date=2017-04-18|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most southern tip of the EAC can produce these [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|Eddies]] by wind currents. As instabilities in the current develop due to a westward Tasman Front, the meander pinches off to form eddies at a rate of once or twice per year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ridgway|first=K. R.|last2=Godfrey|first2=J. S.|date=1997-10-15|title=Seasonal cycle of the East Australian Current|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=102|issue=C10|pages=22921–22936|doi=10.1029/97JC00227|issn=2156-2202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EAC has nutrient poor water, however it does cause upwelling in places along the coast line.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oceanclimatechange.org/|title=Marine Climate Change in Australia. The East Australian Current|last=Ridgway|first=Ken|date=|website=oceanclimatechange.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eddies produced cause an increase in vertical mixing within the Tasman Sea. The process of producing, moving, and destroying eddies causes the thermocline layer to mix with the surface layer, bringing some nutrients up to the surface. The EAC and its eddies frequently flow onto the continental shelf and inshore, influencing circulation patterns and increasing mixing. Eddies aren’t the only way the EAC brings nutrients to the surface. Features along the coast push the current further off shore and if there is a strong northerly wind, it will push the current even further off shore, allowing deep water to rise up the coast, bringing nutrients up to the surface.

The EAC experiences seasonally variations. It tends to be strongest in the summer, with an amplitude flow around 36.3 Sv. It is its weakest during the winter months flowing at a rate around 27.4 Sv.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Over the past 50–60 years the EAC has shifted. The south [[Tasman Sea]] has become warmer and saltier from 1944-2002. This has resulted in the current strengthening and extending southward. This shift in the EAC flow past [[Tasmania]] is controlled the Southern Hemisphere subtropical ocean circulation.  This trend is thought to be caused by changes in wind patterns due to ozone depletion over Australia. There is a strong consensus with climate models that this trend will continue to intensify and accelerate over the next 100 years. The current is predicted to increase greater than 20%, thanks to the increase in South Pacific winds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 2003 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', the EAC is portrayed as a superhighway that [[fish]] and [[sea turtle]]s use to travel down the east coast of Australia. The characters Marlin and Dory join a group of sea turtles in using the EAC to help them travel to [[Sydney Harbour]]. The basic premise of this storyline is correct. Every summer, thousands of fish are swept from the [[Great Barrier Reef]] to Sydney Harbour and further south &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s1123880.htm Looking For Nemo], 2004-06-03, ''Catalyst'', [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]&lt;/ref&gt;, however, the Current is not nearly as rapid as depicted in the film.

'''Evidence-based conservation''' is the application of evidence in conservation management actions and policy making. It is defined as systematically assessing scientific information from published, [[peer-review]]ed publications and texts, practitioners' experiences, independent expert assessment, and local and [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] knowledge on a specific conservation topic.  This includes assessing the current effectiveness of different management interventions, threats and emerging problems and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence-based [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] was organized based on the observations that decision making in conservation was based on [[:wikt:intuition|intuition]] and/ or practitioner experience often disregarding other forms of evidence of successes and failures (e.g. scientific information). This has led to costly and poor outcomes.&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=William J|last2=Pullin|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Dolman|first3=Paul M.|last4=Knigh|first4=Teri M.|title=The need for evidence-based conservation|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=June 2004|volume=19|issue=6|pages=305–308|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.03.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence-based conservation provides access to information that will support decision making through an evidence-based framework of “what works” in conservation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=William J.|title= Evidence-based Conservation|journal= Conservation in Practice|date=July 2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages=39–42|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4629.2003.tb00068.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence based approach to conservation is based on evidence-based practice which started in [[Evidence-based medicine|medicine]] and later spread to [[Evidence Based Nursing|nursing]], [[Evidence based education|education]], [[psychology]] and other fields. Evidence for evidence based conservation is broadly produced and published in three forms: systematic reviews, synopsis and summaries.

==Systematic review==
A systematic review consists of a non-subjective assessment of available data and evidence related to a management.&lt;ref name="Collaboration"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Collaboration for Environmental Evidence |date=March 2013 |title=Guidelines for Systematic Review and Evidence Synthesis in Environmental Management, Version4.2 |url=http://www.environmentalevidence.org/Documents/Guidelines/Guidelines4.2.pdf |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthesizing results from different studies over different time periods, locations or sample sizes can reduce the bias present in individual studies. Systematic reviews differ from traditional reviews by being easily understood, peer reviewed and repeatable. Detailed protocols remain available for conducting a thorough, unbiased systematic review.&lt;ref name="Collaboration" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
Part of implementing an evidence-based conservation analysis requires generating a synopsis.  This refers to the brief description of a single study or a systematic review. Synopses form the building blocks of summaries when collated across specific themes.&lt;ref name="Dicks"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dicks | first1 = L. V. | year = 2014 | title = Organising evidence for environmental management decisions: a '4S' hierarchy | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 607–613 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2014.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
A summary is broader than a synopsis and refers to the standardized description of results extracted from several studies or systematic reviews on a particular topic. Summaries are regularly updated as more information becomes available and are ideally generated through a rigorous review process.&lt;ref name="Dicks" /&gt;

==History&lt;!--of the theory? of the website? of the program?  --&gt;==
Evidence-based conservation is inspired by [[evidence-based medicine]]. Evidence-based conservation was first noted in the literature in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, W.J. 2000. The conservation handbook: research, management and policy. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pullin, A. S. and Knight, T. M. 2001. Effectiveness in Conservation Practice: Pointers from Medicine and Public Health. Conservation Biology, 15: 50–54&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last decade, the methodology for generating systematic reviews (e.g. protocols, systematic maps) have been improved and standardized. In addition, several collaborative networks have been formed and two journals have been launched. The [[Collaboration for Environmental Evidence]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environmentalevidence.org/|title=Environmental Evidence|website=www.environmentalevidence.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a journal titled [http://www.environmentalevidence.org/journal Environmental Evidence] dedicated to the publication of systematic reviews, review protocols and systematic maps on impacts of human activity and the effectiveness of management interventions. It currently has centres located in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|the UK]]. The [http://www.conservationevidence.com/ Conservation Evidence] group has a journal titled [http://www.conservationevidence.com/collection/view Conservation Evidence] that was launched in 2004 to document the effectiveness of conservation interventions. Conservation Evidence is a web-based database repository that systematizes and provides access to conservation efforts, programs, and research on the biodiversity and the environment based on high quality, reviewed publications. &lt;!--Conservation Evidence also produces broad summaries of management interventions for different taxa (e.g. birds and amphibians) and habitats (e.g. farmland).--&gt;

==Critique==
&lt;!-- Evidence-based conservation methodologies have not yet gained complete acceptance in environmental decision making.--&gt;
Since evidence-based conservation is based on the primary data on interventions, it is as good as the available data. Even when data are available, some authors have noted that evidence-based conservation may not be routinely used in decision making for management and conservation policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = K | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = Science and elephant management decisions in South Africa | url = http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/2263/15750/1/Young_Science%282010%29.pdf| journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 144 | issue = | pages = 876–885 | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pullin, A. S., and T. M. Knight. 2005. Assessing conservation management’s evidence base: a survey of management-plan compilers in the United Kingdom and Australia. Conservation Biology 19:1989–1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cook, C. N., et al., 2010. Conservation in the dark? The information used to support management decisions. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 8:181–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Often there may be a disconnect between the science that is produced and the management interventions taken. Three reasons have been suggested for this in the literature: 
# the scope of the scientific questions may not cover adequately the management requirements (this translates to lack of “actionable evidence” for management), 
# the scientific research produced covers the management needs, yet the recommendations from the evidence may not be feasible for implementation due to practical constraints (time, financial budgets etc.) or 
# the conservation practitioners do not have access to the evidence. Often peer reviewed journal articles produced by scientists are not freely available (open access) or use complicated jargon that managers may not always comprehend. In a survey in eastern England, it was found that park managers get only 2.4% of their information from primary scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt; These areas need further attention in the future.

Evidence-based conservation has also been criticised in the past for ignoring traditional forms of knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. M. &amp; Sandbrook, C. (2013) Conservation, Evidence and Policy. Oryx, 47(3), 329-335&lt;/ref&gt; However, the steps of evidence-based conservation can be designed to take traditional forms of knowledge also into consideration.

{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}
{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}

In [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

In [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "'''observational frame of reference'''" (or "'''observational reference frame'''"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

== Different aspects of "frame of reference" ==
The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.&lt;ref name=macroscopic&gt;The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.&lt;ref name =Pontriagin&gt;

In very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri͡agin |title=L.S. Pontryagin: Selected Works Vol. 2: Topological Groups |page= 429 |year=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JU0DT_wXu2oC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=2-88124-133-6 |publisher=Gordon and Breach|edition=3rd }}. Less abstractly, a coordinate system in a space of n-dimensions is defined in terms of a basis set of vectors {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}; see {{cite book |title=Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach |author1=Edoardo Sernesi |author2=J. Montaldi |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dZOuFo1QYMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=0-412-40680-2 |year=1993 |publisher=CRC Press   }} As such, the coordinate system is a mathematical construct, a language, that may be related to motion, but has no necessary connection to motion.

&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, …) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Unification of Classical, Quantum and Relativistic Mechanics and of the Four Forces |author1=J X Zheng-Johansson |author2=Per-Ivar Johansson |page=13 
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1FU37uru6QC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=frame+coordinate+johansson|isbn=1-59454-260-0 
|publisher=Nova Publishers 
|year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others.

*Choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system.

Here is a quotation applicable to moving observational frames &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; and various associated Euclidean three-space coordinate systems [''R'', ''R′'', ''etc.'']:&lt;ref name=Lyle &gt;{{cite book  |title=Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity |page= 9 |author1=Jean Salençon |author2=Stephen Lyle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3xIED8ctfUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=physical+%22frame+of+reference%22|isbn=3-540-41443-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|We first introduce the notion of ''reference frame'', itself related to the idea of ''observer'': the reference frame is, in some sense, the "Euclidean space carried by the observer". Let us give a more mathematical definition:… the reference frame is... the set of all points in the Euclidean space with the rigid body motion of the observer.

Although the term "coordinate system" is often used (particularly by physicists) in a nontechnical sense, the term "coordinate system" does have a precise meaning in mathematics, and sometimes that is what the physicist means as well.

where ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''etc.'' are the ''n'' Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions,  '''coordinate surfaces''' are defined by the relations:

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [[Model theory|mathematical construct]], part of an [[axiomatic system]]. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Galilean transformation]]s may be viewed as [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]]s.

General and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the [[#See also|See also]] links below.

===Observational frames of reference===
{{main|Inertial frame of reference}}

An '''observational frame of reference''', often referred to as a ''physical frame of reference'', a ''frame of reference'', or simply a ''frame'', is a physical concept related to an [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized ''only by its state of motion''.&lt;ref name=Kubar&gt;See {{cite book |author1=Arvind Kumar |author2=Shrish Barve |page=115 |title=How and Why in Basic Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czlUPz38MOQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22characterized+only+by+its+state+of+motion%22+inauthor:Kumar|isbn=81-7371-420-7 |year= 2003 |publisher =Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''. According to this view, a ''frame'' is an ''observer'' plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.&lt;ref name=Doran&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |page= §5.2.2, p. 133 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;For example, Møller states: "Instead of Cartesian coordinates we can obviously just as well employ general curvilinear coordinates for the fixation of points in physical space.…we shall now introduce general "curvilinear" coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; in four-space…." {{cite book |author=C.

|page=211 |isbn=0-8247-1749-X |year=1983 |publisher=CRC Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]]. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

===Measurement apparatus===
A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].&lt;ref name= Wolfson&gt;{{cite book |author=  Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co. |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.&lt;ref name=Rizzi&gt;See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

=== Simple example ===
[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S′'' attached to the first car.]]
Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious "frames of reference" that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our "frame of reference" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance ''d'' =  200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of car two after time ''t''.

:&lt;math&gt; x_1(t)= d + v_1 t = 200\ + \ 22t\ ; \quad x_2(t)=  v_2 t = 30t &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we set &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;200 + 22 t = 30t \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8t = 200 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 25 \quad \mathrm{seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S′'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 m / s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

===Additional example===
[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]
For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south.  For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right.  However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left.  This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right.  In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis.  To him, the car moves along the ''x'' axis with some [[velocity]] ''v'' in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive ''y''-axis.  In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity ''v'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  If she is driving north, then north is the positive ''y''-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive ''y''-direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car.  As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be ''a'' in the negative x-direction.  Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure?  If Betsy's velocity ''v'' is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, ''a'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  However, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be ''a′'' = ''a'' − ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured.  Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as ''a′'' = ''a'' + ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.

Frames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.

===Remarks===
{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}
It is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a "universal" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).

It is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a "free" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both "free" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that  no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe&lt;ref name="caveatondescription"&gt;That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed.  This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].&lt;/ref&gt; that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

==Non-inertial frames==
{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}
Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the "primed" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x′'', ''y′'', ''a′''.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as  '''R'''.  Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r′'''.
From the geometry of the situation, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \mathbf V + \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf A + \mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;
where '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system  and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = m\mathbf a = m\mathbf A + m\mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf a' + \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' + 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' + \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') + \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a' = \mathbf a - \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' - 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' - \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') - \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F' = \mathbf F_\mathrm{physical} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{centripetal} - m\mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} = -m\dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Coriolis force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r')=m(\omega^2 \mathbf r'- (\boldsymbol\omega \cdot \mathbf r')\boldsymbol\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  ([[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]])

'''ISO 3166-2:GR''' is the entry for [[Greece]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Greece, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[modern regions of Greece|13 administrative regions]]
* [[prefectures of Greece|1 self-governed part]]

The departments (also called prefectures) were abolished in 2011, and were replaced approximately by [[regional units of Greece|regional units]]. The regional units were deleted from the entry in 2016.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GR}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Greece. The second part is either of the following:
* one letter (A&amp;ndash;M): administrative regions
* two digits: self-governed part

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[File:Inkerin lippu.svg|thumb|right|[[Flag of Ingria]]]]
Historical '''Ingria''' ({{lang-fi|Inkeri}} or ''{{lang|fi|Inkerinmaa}}''; {{lang-ru|link=no|Ингрия}}, ''Ingriya'', {{lang|ru|Ижора}}, ''Izhora'', or {{lang|ru|Ингерманландия}}, ''Ingermanlandiya''; {{lang-sv|Ingermanland}}; {{lang-et|Ingeri}} or ''{{lang|et|Ingerimaa}}'') is the geographical area located along the southern shore of the [[Gulf of Finland]], bordered by [[Lake Ladoga]] on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] in the north and by the [[River Narva]] on the border with [[Estonia]] in the west.

The [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Izhorians]], along with the [[Votes]], are the [[indigenous people]] of historical Ingria. With the consolidation of the [[Kievan Rus]] and the expansion of the [[Republic of Novgorod]] north, the indigenous Ingrians became [[Greek Orthodox]]. Ingria became a province of Sweden in the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] in 1617 that ended the [[Ingrian War]], fought between [[Sweden]] and [[Russia]]. After the Swedish conquest of the area in 1617 the [[Ingrian Finns]], descendants of 17th-century [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] emigrants from present-day [[Finland]], became the majority in Ingria. In 1710, following a Russian conquest, Ingria was designated as the Province of St. Petersburg. In the [[Treaty of Nystad]] (1721), Sweden formally ceded Ingria to Russia. In 1927 the Soviet authorities designated the area as Leningrad Province. [[Deportations of the Ingrian Finns]] started in late 1920s, and [[Russification]] was nearly complete by the 1940s. {{As of | 2015}}, Ingria forms the northwestern anchor of Russia—its "window" on the [[Baltic Sea]]—with [[Saint Petersburg]] as its centre.

Ingria as a whole never formed a separate [[Sovereign state|state]] (compare however [[North Ingria]]); the Ingrians, understood as the inhabitants of Ingria regardless of ethnicity, can hardly be said{{by whom|date=June 2015}} to have been a nation, although the [[Soviet Union]] recognized their "nationality"; as an [[ethnic group]], the Ingrians proper, [[Izhorians]], are close to extinction together with their [[Ingrian language|language]]. This notwithstanding, many people still recognize their Ingrian [[Cultural heritage|heritage]].&lt;ref name="kurs"&gt;
Kurs, Ott (1994). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r5302p2n2802g742/fulltext.pdf Ingria: The broken landbridge between Estonia and Finland]. ''[[GeoJournal]]'' 33.1, 107–113.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic Ingria covers approximately the same area as the [[Gatchinsky District|Gatchinsky]], [[Kingiseppsky District|Kingiseppsky]], [[Kirovsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Kirovsky]], [[Lomonosovsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Lomonosovsky]], [[Tosnensky District|Tosnensky]], [[Volosovsky District|Volosovsky]] and [[Vsevolozhsky District|Vsevolozhsky]] districts of modern [[Leningrad Oblast]] as well as the city of Saint Petersburg.

==History==
[[File:Carta Marina.jpeg|thumb|350px|Ingria may be seen represented in the easternmost part of the [[Carta Marina]] (1539)]]
In the [[Viking age|Viking era]] (late [[Iron Age]]), from the 750s onwards, [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] served as a bridgehead on the [[Varangian]] trade route to Eastern Europe. A Varangian [[aristocracy]] developed that would ultimately rule over [[Novgorod]] and [[Kievan Rus']]. In the 860s, the warring [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes rebelled under [[Vadim the Bold]], but later asked the Varangians under [[Rurik]] to return and to put an end to the recurring conflicts between them.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Swedes referred to the ancient [[Novgorod]]ian land of Vod as "Ingermanland", Latinized to "Ingria". [[Folk etymology]] traces its name to [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]], the daughter of the Swedish king [[Olof Skötkonung]] (995–1022). Upon her marriage to [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev, in 1019, she received the lands around Ladoga as a marriage gift. They were administered by Swedish [[Jarl (title)|jarls]], such as [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]], under the sovereignty of the [[Novgorod Republic]].

In the 12th century, Western Ingria was absorbed by the Republic.&lt;!-- Which? --&gt; There followed centuries of [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars|frequent wars]], chiefly between [[Novgorod]] and [[Sweden]], and occasionally involving [[Denmark]] and [[Teutonic Knights]] as well. The Teutonic Knights established a stronghold in the town of [[Narva]], followed by the Russian castle [[Ivangorod]] on the opposite side of the Narva River in 1492.

==Swedish Ingria==
{{Main|Swedish Ingria}}

Although Sweden and Novgorod had fought for the Ingrian lands more or less since [[the Great Schism]] of 1054, the first actual attempt to establish Swedish dominion in Ingria appears to date from the early 14th century, when Sweden first founded the settlement of [[Vyborg|Viborg]] in [[Karelia]]{{cn|date=February 2017}} and then the fortress [[Nyenschantz | Landskrona]] (built in 1299 or 1300) at the confluence of the [[Okhta River (Neva basin)|Ohta]] and [[Neva]] rivers. However, Novgorod re-conquered Landskrona in 1301 and destroyed it. Ingria eventually became a [[Dominions of Sweden|Swedish dominion]] in the 1580s, but the [[Treaty of Teusina]] (1595) returned it to [[Tsardom of Russia | Russia]] in 1595. Russia in its turn ceded Ingria to Sweden in the [[Treaty of Stolbova]] (1617) after the [[Ingrian War]] of 1610-1617. Sweden's interest in the territory was mainly strategic: the area served as a [[buffer zone]] against Russian attacks on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and on present-day Finland, then the eastern half of the Swedish realm; and Russian Baltic trade had to pass through Swedish territory. The townships of [[Ivangorod]], Jama (now [[Kingisepp]]), Caporie (now [[Koporye]]) and Nöteborg (now [[Shlisselburg]]) became the centres of the four Ingrian counties ([[län|slottslän]]), and consisted of citadels, in the vicinity of which were small boroughs called ''hakelverk'' - before the wars of the 1650s mainly inhabited by Russian townspeople. The degree to which Ingria became the destination for Swedish deportees has often been exaggerated.{{by whom?|date=February 2017}}

Ingria remained sparsely populated. In 1664 the total population amounted to 15,000. Swedish attempts to introduce [[Lutheranism]], which accelerated after an initial period of relative religious tolerance,&lt;ref&gt;A. Pereswetoff-Morath, "'Otiosorum hominum receptacula': Orthodox Religious Houses in Ingria, 1615–52", ''Scando-Slavica'', vol. 49, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
met with repugnance on the part of the majority of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] peasantry, who were obliged to attend Lutheran services; converts were promised grants and tax reductions, but Lutheran gains were mostly due to voluntary resettlements by [[Finns]] from [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] and [[Finnish Karelia]] (mostly from [[Äyräpää]]).&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="matley"&gt;

The proportion of Lutheran Finns in Ingria ([[Ingrian Finns]]) comprised 41.1% in 1656, 53.2% in 1661, 55.2% in 1666, 56.9% in 1671 and 73.8% in 1695, the remainder being Russians,&lt;ref name="matley"/&gt; [[Izhorians]] and [[Votes]].&lt;ref&gt;''Inkeri. Historia, kansa, kulttuuri''. Edited by Pekka Nevalainen and Hannes Sihvo. Helsinki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingermanland was to a considerable extent enfiefed to [[Swedish nobility|noble]] military and state officials, who brought their own Lutheran servants and workmen. However, a small number of Russian Orthodox churches remained in use until the very end of the Swedish dominion, and the forceful conversion of ethnic Russian Orthodox forbidden{{when?|date=February 2017}} by law.

[[Nyenschantz|Nyen]] became the main trading centre of Ingria, especially after Ivangorod dwindled, and in 1642 it was made the administrative centre of the province. In 1656 a Russian attack badly damaged the town, and the administrative centre moved to [[Narva]].&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt;

==Russian Ingria==
[[Image:Stpetegub.jpg|thumb|350px|Map of [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]] in 1900]]

In the early 18th century the area was reconquered by Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] after having been in Swedish possession for about 100 years. Near the location of the Swedish town [[Nyen]], close to the Neva river's estuary at the Gulf of Finland, the new Russian capital [[Saint Petersburg]] was founded in 1703.

[[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] raised Ingria to the status of a duchy with [[Prince Menshikov]] as its first (and last) duke. In 1708, Ingria was designated a governorate ('''Ingermanland Governorate''' in 1708–1710, '''[[Saint Petersburg Governorate]]''' in 1710–1914, '''Petrograd Governorate''' in 1914–1924, '''Leningrad Governorate''' in 1924–1927).

In 1870, printing started of the first Finnish-language newspaper in Ingria, ''Pietarin Sanomat''. Before that Ingria received newspapers mostly from Viborg. The first public library was opened in 1850 in Tyrö. The largest of the libraries, situated in Skuoritsa, had more than 2,000 volumes in the second half of the 19th century. In 1899 the first song festival in Ingria was held in Puutosti (Skuoritsa).&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt;

By 1897 (year of the [[Russian Empire Census]]) the number of [[Ingrian Finns]] had grown to 130,413, and by 1917 it had exceeded 140,000 (45,000 in Northern Ingria, 52,000 in Central (Eastern) Ingria and 30,000 in Western Ingria, the rest in [[Petrograd]]).

From 1868 [[Estonian people|Estonians]] began to migrate to Ingria as well. In 1897 the number of
Estonians inhabiting the [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]] reached 64,116 (12,238 of them in [[Saint Petersburg]] itself); by 1926 it had increased to 66,333 (15,847 of them in Leningrad).

As to [[Izhorians]], in 1834 there were 17,800 of them, in 1897—21,000, in 1926—26,137. About 1000 Ingrians lived in the area ceded to Estonia under the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Peace Treaty of Tartu]] (1920).&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt;

==Estonian Ingria==
Under the Russian-Estonian [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Peace Treaty of Tartu]] of 1920, a small part of West Ingria became part of the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Republic of Estonia]]. In contrast to other parts of Ingria, Finnish culture blossomed in this area. This was to a large extent due to the work of '''Leander Reijo''' (also Reijonen or Reiju) from [[Kullankylä]] on the new border between Estonia and the Soviet Union, who was called "The King of Ingria" by the Finnish press. Finnish schools and a Finnish newspaper were started. A church was built in Kallivieri in 1920 and by 1928 the parish had 1,300 people.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Angere, Kullankylä (1994) Swedish magazine Ingria. (4), pages 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Angere, Min hemtrakt (2001) Swedish magazine Ingria (2), pages 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, after the [[Second World War]], Estonian Ingria, then in the [[Soviet Union]], became part of the [[Russian SFSR]]. Since Estonia reclaimed its independence in 1991, this territory has been disputed. As Russia does not recognize the Peace Treaty of Tartu, the area currently remains under Russian control.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Soviet Ingria==
[[Image:Votic language map.png|thumb|right|350px|Finnic settlements in Western Ingria throughout the 20th century]]
After the 1917 [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]] in Russia, the '''Republic of [[North Ingria]]''' (''Pohjois Inkeri'') declared its independence from Russia with the support of Finland and with the aim of incorporation into Finland. It ruled parts of Ingria from 1919 until 1920. With the Russian-Finnish [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Peace Treaty of Tartu]] it was re-integrated into Russia, but enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy.

At its height in the 1920s, there were about 300 Finnish language schools and 10 Finnish language newspapers in Ingria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkeri.fi/Historia.htm "Inkerinsuomalaisten kronikka"], Tietoa Inkerinsuomalaisista (Information about Ingrian Finns), [https://web.archive.org/web/20080213111809/http://www.inkeri.fi/Historia.htm archived] at the [[Wayback Machine]], 13 February 2008 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]] in 1926 recorded 114,831 Leningrad Finns, as Ingrian Finns were called.&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt; The 1926 census also showed that the Russian population of central Ingria outnumbered the [[Finnic peoples]] living there, but Ingrian Finns formed the majority in the districts along the Finnish border.&lt;ref name="matley"/&gt;

In the early 1930s the [[Izhorian language]] was taught in the schools of the [[Soikinsky Peninsula]] and the area around the mouth of the [[Luga River]].&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt;

In 1928 [[collectivization in the USSR|collectivization of agriculture]] started in Ingria. To facilitate it, in 1929–1931, 18,000 people (4320 families), [[kulaks]] (independent peasants) from North Ingria, were deported to [[East Karelia]], the [[Kola Peninsula]] as well as [[Kazakhstan]] and Central Asia.

The situation for the Ingrian Finns deteriorated further when in the fall of 1934 the [[Border Security Zone of Russia|Forbidden Border Zone]] along the western border of the Soviet Union was established, where entrance was forbidden without special permission issued by the [[NKVD]]. It was officially only 7.5&amp;nbsp;km deep initially, but along the Estonian border it extended to as much as 90&amp;nbsp;km. The zone was to be free of Finnic and some other peoples, who were considered politically unreliable.&lt;ref name="matley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 1935, [[Genrikh Yagoda]] authorized a large-scale deportation targeting Estonian, [[Latvian people|Latvian]] and Finnish [[kulak]]s and [[lishentsy]] residing in the border regions near Leningrad. About 7,000 people (2,000 families) were deported from Ingria to Kazakhstan, Central Asia and the [[Ural (region)|Ural region]]. In May and June 1936 the entire Finnish population of the parishes of [[Valkeasaari]], [[Lempäälä|Lempaala]], [[Vuole]] and [[Miikkulainen]] near the Finnish border, 20,000 people, were resettled to the areas around [[Cherepovets]] and Siberia in the next wave of deportations. In Ingria they were replaced with people from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]], mostly [[Russian people|Russians]] but also [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] and [[Tatar people|Tatars]].&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="matley"/&gt;

In 1937 Lutheran churches and Finnish and Izhorian schools in Ingria were closed down and publications and radio broadcasting in Finnish and Izhorian were suspended.

Both Ingrian Finnish and Izhorian populations all but disappeared from Ingria during the Soviet period. 63,000 fled to Finland during World War II, and were required back by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] after the war. Most became victims of [[Soviet population transfer]]s and many were executed as "[[enemies of the people]]".&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="matley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; The remainder, including some post-Stalin returnees (it was not until 1956 that some of the deported were allowed to return to their villages), were outnumbered by Russian immigration.

The 1959 census recorded 1,062 Izhorians; in 1979 that number had fallen to 748, only 315 of them around the mouth of the [[Luga River]] and on the [[Soikinsky Peninsula]]. According to the [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet census of 1989]], there were 829 Izhorians, 449 of them in Russia (including other parts of the country) and 228 in Estonia.&lt;ref name="kurs"/&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, surviving Ingrian Finns and their Russified descendants have been [[right of return#Finland|allowed to emigrate to Finland]]. This has led to the birth of a sizable [[Russophone]] minority in Finland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2220">This is a '''list of [[Croatia]]n mottos'''. Croatia does not have an official motto.

==Mottos==
*''Dok je srca, bit će i Kroacije'' (As long as there is heart, there will be Croatia) – This motto was originally a line of [[Antun Gustav Matoš]]'s ''Pri svetom kralju'', about ban [[Toma Erdödy]]. Erdödy won many battles against the [[Ottomans]] in the 16th century, while at the time Matoš wrote the poem Croatia was struggling to win greater rights within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}{{or|date=January 2012}}
{{wikisourcelang|hr|Govor Ante Starčevića u Hrvatskom saboru 26. lipnja 1861|Speech text}} 
*''Bog i Hrvati'' (God and the Croats) – This motto originates from [[Ante Starčević]]'s speech to the [[Croatian Parliament]] (''Sabor'') on June 26, 1861, in which he stated that the future of Croatia should not be decided in Austria, but by God and the Croats.&lt;ref&gt;Conserva, Henry. ''National Slogans from Around the World''. Authorhouse; Indiana, USA: 2006. p9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Govor Ante Starčevića u Hrvatskom saboru 26. lipnja 1861.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{wikisourcelang|hr|Pri svetom kralju}}
*''[[Za dom spremni]]'' (For the homeland, ready)  – This motto was used by the [[Ustashe]] puppet regime from the period of 1941-1945 during [[World War II]]. It is still commonly used today by Croatian nationalists and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Ivica Kristović, [http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/ustaski-za-dom-spremni-je-ekvivalent-nacistickom-sieg-heil-904408 Pozdrav 'Za dom spremni' ekvivalent je nacističkom 'Sieg Heil!'], [[Večernji list]], 22.11.2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://danas.net.hr/crna-kronika/za-dom-spremni-je-isto-sto-i-sieg-heil 'Za dom spremni' je isto što i 'Sieg Heil'!], Danas.hr 09.01.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==See also==
*''[[U boj, u boj]] - za narod svoj!'' (To battle, to battle, for one's people!) – This is a popular [[football chant]] that originates from the song ''U boj, u boj'' in [[Ivan Zajc]]'s opera ''[[Nikola Šubić Zrinski (opera)|Nikola Šubić Zrinski]]''.

Where available, it uses official definitions of [[metropolitan area]]s based on the concept of a single urban core and its immediate surroundings, as opposed to polycentric [[conurbation]]s. Figures refer to mid-2015 populations except in the case of Mexican metropolitan areas, whose figures derive from the 2015 Intercensal Survey conducted by [[INEGI]] with a reference date of 15 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf |title=Encuesta Intercensal 2015: Presentación de resultados |page=5 |publisher=[[INEGI]] |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Havana]] has no official definition of its metropolitan area; the population [[city proper|within its city limits]] is given instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5293">This is a list of flags used in '''[[Southern Rhodesia]]''' between 1890 and 1964 and '''[[Rhodesia]]''' between 1964 and 1979.  The evolution of Southern Rhodesia from a British South African Company concern, to a British Colony, then to a member of a Federal Government, then to a self-declared state is evident by the different flags used.

For flags after these dates see [[Flags of Zimbabwe]].

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref name="convention"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Heritage Convention|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/|website=UNESCO|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401145714/http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/|archivedate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[breakup of Soviet Union]], [[Armenia]] succeeded the convention on 5 September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/am&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018}}, Armenia has three sites on the list, with additional four on the tentative list (the official list of sites that may be considered for future submission). All three sites on the list are listed as cultural sites, as determined by the organization's [[World Heritage site#Selection criteria|selection criteria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/am&lt;/ref&gt;

| These two monasteries in the Tumanian region from the period of prosperity during the Kiurikian dynasty (10th to 13th century) were important centres of learning. Sanahin was renowned for its school of illuminators and calligraphers. The two monastic complexes represent the highest flowering of Armenian religious architecture, whose unique style developed from a blending of elements of Byzantine ecclesiastical architecture and the traditional vernacular architecture of the Caucasian region.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/777&lt;/ref&gt;

The following '''list of intentional death rates by country''' has been obtained by adding the [[suicide]] rate from the [[World Health Organization]] to [[homicide rate]] from the UNODC [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] ([[UNODC]]) [[Observational study|Study]], in both cases as they appear at Wikipedia. Intentional deaths include [[homicide]] (intentional injury death of another) and [[suicide]] (intentional injury death of self).

&lt;!-- remove opinion per wikipedia [[WP:OR]] policy, need a source for inferences and hypotheses --&gt;

The '''M'zab''' or '''Mzab''', ([[Mozabite language|Mozabite]] ''Aghlan'', {{lang-ar|مزاب}}), is a [[natural region]] of the northern [[Sahara Desert]] in [[Ghardaïa Province]], [[Algeria]].  It is located {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Algiers]] and there are approximately 360,000 inhabitants (2005 estimate).&lt;ref&gt;http://lexicorient.com/e.o/mzab.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globosapiens.net/travel-information/Ghardaia-2369.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
[[File:M’zab Valley, Algeria.jpg|thumb|False colour satellite image of M’zab Valley.]]
The Mzab is a [[limestone]] [[plateau]],  centred on the [[Wadi|Wad]] Mzab (''Oued Mzab'') valley.

== History ==
The [[Mozabite people|Mozabites]] ("At Mzab") are a branch of a large [[Berber people|Berber]] tribe, the [[Zenata|Iznaten]], which lived in large areas of middle southern Algeria. Many [[Tifinagh]] letters and symbols are engraved around the Mzab Valley.

After the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]], the Mozabites became Muslims of the [[Mu'tazili]] school. After the fall of the [[Rostemid]] state, the Rostemid royal family with some of their citizens chose the Mzab Valley as their refuge. However, the Rostemids were [[Ibadi]] and sent a [[dawah|preacher]] (Abu Bakr an-Nafusi) who successfully converted the indigenous Mozabites.

[[July Monarchy|France]] occupied [[Ottoman Algeria|Algeria]] in 1830 and removed it from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman domination]]. The M'zab was annexed to France only in 1882 and reverted to Algerian indigenous rule in summer 1962 upon its national independence. Ghardaia (Taghardait) is the main town and capital of the M'zab, while el-Ateuf (Tajnint) is the oldest settlement in the region. Beni Isguene (AT'isgen) is the most sacred Berber Islamic town. It prohibits all non-M'zabites from various sections of this town and all foreigners from spending the night within its walls. Melika (AT'mlichet) is populated by a kabily town named Mlikch which is untell now located near Bouira city, and it contains spacious cemeteries and a historical Mosque in the center of the K'sar, while Bounoura (AT'bounour) is a historical K'sar which contain Azwil palm grove, while El-Guerrara (Igraren) and Berriane (Iberguen) have been part of the M'zab since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_14425.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Mzab Ghardaïa.jpg|thumb|Mzab Ghardaïa]]
There are five ''[[ksar|qsur]]'' "walled villages" (''ksour'') located on rocky outcrops along the Wəd Mzab collectively known as ''the Pentapolis''. They are  [[Ghardaïa]] ''Tagherdayt'', the principal settlement today; [[Beni Isguen]] ''At Isjen'' (Arabic: بني يزقن); [[Melika]] ''At Mlishet''; [[Bounoura]] ''At Bunur''; and [[El Atteuf]] ''Tajnint''. Adding the more recent settlements of [[Bérianne]] and [[El Guerrara]], the ''Mzab Heptapolis'' is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/mzabvalley.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224103436/http://worldheritagesite.org/sites/mzabvalley.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the functional purism of the Ibāḍī faith with the oasian way of life has led to a strict organization of land and space. Each citadel has a fortress-like [[mosque]], whose [[minaret]] served as a watchtower. Houses of standard size and type were constructed in concentric circles around the mosque. The architecture of the M'zab settlements was designed for egalitarian communal living, with respect for family privacy. The Mzab building style is of Libyan-Phoenician type, more specifically of Berber style and has been replicated in other parts of the Sahara.&lt;ref name="Houtsma"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Houtsma|first=Martijn Theodoor|title=Mzab|encyclopedia=E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936|publisher=BRILL|year=1987|volume=2|pages=167|isbn=90-04-08265-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer, the Mzabites migrated to 'summer citadels'  centred on palm grove oases. This is one of the major oasis groups of the Sahara Desert, and is bounded by arid country known as [[chebka]], crossed by dry river beds.

The Mzab Valley was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1982, as an intact example of  traditional human habitat perfectly adapted to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/188/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society ==
The insular nature of the Ibāḍiyya has preserved the area, and Ibāḍī  Σezzaba continue to dominate the social life of the area. A federal council, ''Majlis Ammi Said'', unites representatives of the seven settlements as well as [[Ouargla]], an ancient town located 200&amp;nbsp;km South-East of the Mzab valley. This council forms a federative body for religious, social and, increasingly, cultural matters. This religious federal council represents an “Islamic type of government” unique today.

Numerous details of Ibāḍiyya social life are ruled by this Islamic government, such as the weight of gold given as a dowry to a woman (maximum 60 grams) to the length of wedding celebrations (three days). The council makes decisions on details such as [[dowry|dowries]], celebrations, dress. It used to impose punishments including [[exile]], and a form of ''tabriyya'' "[[quarantine]]", where the offender may not interact with his fellow citizens. However, with economic, social and political integration to Algeria, these sanctions are less effective, and tend to have more impact on women.{{Dubious|date=March 2008}}

The local language of the Mzab is [[Mozabite language|Mozabite]] (Tumẓabt), a branch of the [[Zenati languages|Zenati group]] of [[Berber languages]].

Ghardaya is also one of the four large military and administrative territories into which southern Algeria is divided.

== Demographics ==

== Geography ==
[[Image:Mollehøj millstone.JPG|thumb|left|The millstone marking the top of Møllehøj]]
Møllehøj is in the Ejerbjerge hills in [[Skanderborg municipality]], very close to [[Ejer Bavnehøj]]. The summit is marked with a [[millstone]],  a remnant of Ejer [[windmill|mill]] which was situated on the hill from 1838 to 1917. The mill had eight sides and had an onion-shaped roof.

New measurements made in February 2005 showed that Møllehøj was higher than both [[Yding Skovhøj]] (172.66&amp;nbsp;m including a [[Bronze Age]] [[burial mound]] on its summit, 170.77&amp;nbsp;m without) in [[Horsens municipality]] or Ejer Bavnehøj which had both been thought higher. These two high points' natural heights are however respectively 9 and 51&amp;nbsp;cm lower than Møllehøj. It was officially recognised as Denmark's highest point in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gst.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2005/feb/hoejste-punkt/ |title = Nyt højeste punkt i Danmark | website= gst.dk | publisher=Geodatastyrelsen (Danish Geodata Agency - Danish Ministry of Energy, Utilities and Climate) |access-date= 30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nairobi–Malaba Road''', also '''Nairobi–Uganda Road''' or '''A104 Road  (Kenya)''' is a major [[roads in Kenya|highway]] in [[Kenya]], the largest economy in the [[East African Community]]. The road connects [[Nairobi]], the capital and largest city in Kenya, with the border town of [[Malaba, Kenya| Malaba]] at the international border with [[Uganda]].

==Location==
The road starts in the city of Nairobi and takes a general north-westerly direction through [[Naivasha]], [[Nakuru]], [[Eldoret]] and [[Bungoma]], to end at [[Malaba, Kenya|Malaba]], a distance of approximately {{convert|447|km|0}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=24 September 2016 |

==Overview==
This road, together with the [[Nairobi–Mombasa Road]], are part of ''The Great North Road'', which connects the landlocked countries of [[Burundi]], [[DR Congo|Eastern DR Congo]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]] and [[South Sudan]] to the [[Kenya]]n coast at [[Mombasa]], on the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

Due to the volume of traffic, and the concentration of heavy-duty transport vehicles, the route is accident-prone, accounting for a large number of injuries and fatalities in the region. In 2013 alone, 3,179 people lost their lives in traffic accidents on the combined Mombasa–Malaba Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sde.co.ke/thenairobian/article/2000185095/highway-of-death-the-mombasa-malaba-highway-taking-more-lives-than-al-shabaab?pageNo=1|

'''Nampula''' is the capital city of [[Nampula Province]] in northeastern [[Mozambique]]. Also known as "The Capital of the North", Nampula is the centre of business in northern Mozambique. It has a few western-style hotels, restaurants and shopping centres. It also has a small international airport connecting to [[Nairobi]] in [[Kenya]] and [[Johannesburg]] in [[South Africa]], and is a transport hub for local transport in northern Mozambique.

With a population of 743,125 (2017 census),&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200911240886.html&lt;/ref&gt; it is the third largest city in [[Mozambique]] after [[Maputo]] and [[Matola]]. Nampula is also home to the Mozambique National Ethnographic Museum, several [[markets]], [[cathedrals]], [[mosques]], [[universities]] and schools: both government and private. The [[city]] is also fairly diverse, with the native eMakhuwa population being the largest group but with a visible Indian, European, Chinese, and Lebanese population. 

== Etymology ==
The name "Nampula" is said to be derived to the eMakhuwa word "Whampula", which according to legend refers to a tribal leader of the area in the past. 

== Administration ==
Nampula is divided into seven administrative zones, which are also subdivided into localities, as follows:
* Urbano Central
* Anchilo
* Muatala
* Muhala
* Namikopo
* Napipine
* Natikiri

Ever since the establishment of the city, Nampula has had numerous mayors:
* Aurélio das Neves
* Germano José Joaquim
* Francisco Joaquim de Lima
* Narciso João Iondela
* Ishaca Abdul Ali Baraca
* Dionísio Cherewa
* Castro Namuaca
* Mahamudo Amurane (Murdered on the 4th of October 2017)
* Paulo Vahanle

The '''National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying''' ('''NCEES''') is an American non-profit organization dedicated to advancing professional licensure for [[engineers]] and [[surveyors]]. The Council’s members are the engineering and surveying licensure boards from all 50  U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These boards are divided into four geographic zones: Central, Northeast, Southern, Western. It is headquartered in [[Seneca, South Carolina]], across [[Lake Hartwell]] from [[Clemson University]].&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

== Engineering ==

NCEES develops and scores the FE, PE, and SE exams for engineering licensure. The FE exam is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed engineer (P.E.). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree from an EAC/ABET- accredited program. The PE exam is designed to test for a minimum level of competency in a particular engineering discipline. It is designed for engineers who have gained a minimum of four years of work experience in their chosen engineering discipline. The SE exam is designed for engineers who practice in jurisdictions that license structural engineers separately from other professional engineers.

* The [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam|Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam]] is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed engineer (P.E.). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree from an EAC/ABET-accredited program. The FE exam is a computer-based exam administered year-round at NCEES-approved [[Pearson Education|Pearson]] VUE test centers. &lt;ref name="CBT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbt.ncees.org/ |title=The CBT experience |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |accessdate=2012-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116105839/http://cbt.ncees.org/ |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam|Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam]] tests for a minimum level of competency in a particular engineering discipline. It is designed for engineers who have gained a minimum of four years’ post-college work experience in their chosen engineering discipline. 
* The [[Structural Engineering exam|Structural Engineering (S.E.) exam]] tests for a minimum level of competency in structural engineering. It is designed for engineers who practice in jurisdictions that license structural engineers separately from other professional engineers. This 16-hour exam uses separate vertical and lateral components to test one's ability to safely design buildings or bridges, especially in areas of high seismicity and high wind.

== Land Surveying ==

NCEES also prepares examinations for [[land surveyor]] licensing in the United States. These exams consist of:
* The Fundamentals of Surveying (FS) exam is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed surveyor (P.S.). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate surveying degree from an ABET accredited program. The FS exam is a computer-based exam administered year-round in testing windows at NCEES-approved Pearson VUE test centers. &lt;ref name="CBT" /&gt;
* The Principles and Practice of Surveying (PS) exam tests one's ability to practice the surveying profession competently. It is designed for surveyors who have gained at least four years of professional experience.

== Records ==

The NCEES Records program is designed for currently licensed engineers and surveyors who are looking for an easier and faster way to complete the licensure process in multiple jurisdictions, including all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An established NCEES Record will include most—if not all—of the materials one needs to apply for comity licensure in additional states and territories.

== Credentials evaluations ==

NCEES Credentials Evaluations is a service for state licensing boards and applicants. It is designed primarily for candidates who have earned their degrees outside the United States and are pursuing licensure through one of the member licensing boards of NCEES. &lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncees.org/Credentials_evaluations.php |title=Credentials Evaluations |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exam preparation materials ==
NCEES exam preparation materials include questions that have been used on past exams and questions written to give examinees extra practice.

Mrs Patrick Ness was born Elizabeth Wilhelmina Miller in Brighton in 1881 and married Patrick Powell Ness in 1903. She accompanied her husband to Kenya before the First World War and then returned alone in 1920, when she made several epic journeys across the African and Asian continents. In 1923 she crossed the Syrian Desert, in 1927 she travelled from Khartoum to Nairobi and on via the Congo to the Cape, the first European woman to travel on Lake Kivu. She later wrote a book of her adventures entitled ''Two Thousand Miles in Two Continents'' &lt;ref&gt;http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/244/234.extract&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11934403&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oka-Don Lowlands''' ({{lang-ru|Окско-Донская равнина}}) (also: '''Oka-Don Plain'''), is a flat plain in European [[Russia]] bounded on the north by the [[Oka River]] (and the [[Meshchera Lowlands]]), on the south by the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], on the west by the [[Central Russian Upland]], and on the east by the [[Volga Upland]].&lt;ref name="geo-1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oka-Don Lowland, Russia|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4165691&amp;fid=5061&amp;c=russia|website=Geographical Names|publisher=Geographic.org|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area is part of the larger [[East European Plain]].  The terrain is flat, with altitude averaging 160 meters above sea level, and the rivers meander on broad floodplains.  Agricultural use of the plain is high, mostly for grain growing - wheat, barley and rye.  The plain provides a flat route south-north route of transportation, situated between uplands.   Until a line of forts was built across the territory by the Russian government in the 1640s (the [[Expansion of Russia 1500–1800#1618.E2.80.931686: The Belgorod Line|Belgorod Line]]), the plain was a route for [[Tatar]] invasion from the south.&lt;ref name="ledonne-1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ledonne|first1=John|title=Building an Infrastructure of Empire in Russia's Eastern Theater, 1650s-1840s.|journal=Cahiers Du Monde Russe|date=2006|volume=47.3|page=588|jstor=20175015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topography==
The plain is about 250&amp;nbsp;km west-east, and 500&amp;nbsp;km north-south.   The central and southern parts are sometimes called the "Tambov plain", and are mostly contained in [[Tambov Oblast]].  The lowlands also includes portions of [[Lipetsk Oblast]] on the west, [[Ryazan Oblast]] to the north, [[Penza Oblast]] to the east, and [[Voronezh Oblast]] to the south.  The soil includes widespread chernozym ("black earth"), with more [[podzol]]ic ("under-ash") soils towards the north and some sandy regions in the south.&lt;ref name="geo-2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karandeeva|first1=MV|title=Geomorphology of the European part of the USSR|date=1957|url=http://stepnoy-sledopyt.narod.ru/geologia/karandeeva/1/1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrography==
Because it is flat, the major rivers meander on broad floodplains.  The main river in the north is the [[Tsna River (Moksha basin)|Tsna]], which runs north through the city of Tambov and into the [[Moksha River]], a right tributary of the Oka in the Volga basin.  In the south, the plain narrows along the [[Khopyor River]], flowing south into the Don River, and the [[Medveditsa River (Don basin)|Medevista]], which is also in the Don Basin.  The floodplains can be up to 20&amp;nbsp;km in width, with up to three terraces.

==Vegetation==
In modern times, the plain is heavily developed for agriculture.  The primary grains are wheat, barley and rye, with 'industrial' crops such as sunflower seeds, sugar beets, and potatoes.  Before modern development, the plain was [[Forb|forb]] meadow-steppe, with forest groves of pine, oak, and black alder along the river banks.&lt;ref name="opencountry-1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facets of Grassland Restoration (p. 4)|url=http://theopencountry.org/files/facets2005.pdf|website=Selected Papers from the International Field Seminar held at the Galichya Gora Nature Reserve (Russia), 16–22 June 2003|publisher=The Open Country.org|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Oka-Don lowlands include two federal-level nature reserves: the [[Voronina Nature Reserve]] in the southeast, and the [[Voronina Nature Reserve]], both featuring forest-steppe habitat along rivers.

The establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of Christianity by its ruler [[Mieszko I]] in 966 (see [[Baptism of Poland]]), when the state covered territory similar to that of present-day Poland. Poland became [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1138)|a kingdom]] in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented a long [[Polish-Lithuanian Union|association]] with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] by [[Union of Lublin|uniting]] to form the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Commonwealth collapsed in 1795, and [[partitions of Poland|its territory was partitioned]] among [[Prussia]], Russia, and Austria. Poland [[Second Polish Republic|regained its independence]] in 1918 after World War I but lost it again in World War II, occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. Poland lost over six million citizens in World War II, and emerged several years later as a [[People's Republic of Poland|socialist republic]] within the [[Eastern bloc|Eastern Bloc]] under strong Soviet influence. In 1989 [[Communism|communist]] rule [[fall of communism|was overthrown]] and Poland became what is constitutionally known as the "Third Polish Republic". Poland is a unitary state made up of sixteen [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] ({{lang-pl|województwo}}). Poland is also a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]] and [[OECD]].

The country borders [[Guyana]] to the east, [[Brazil]] to the south, and [[Colombia]] to the west. [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]], [[St. Lucia]], [[Barbados]], [[Curaçao]], [[Bonaire]], [[Aruba]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and the [[Leeward Antilles]] lie just north, off the Venezuelan coast. Falling within the [[tropics]], Venezuela sits close to the [[equator]], in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. A former [[Spanish colony]], which has been an independent republic since 1821, Venezuela holds territorial disputes with [[Guyana]], largely concerning the [[Guayana Esequiba|Essequibo]] area, and with [[Colombia]] concerning the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]. In 1895, after [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895|the dispute over the Guyana border flared up]], it was submitted to a neutral commission, which in 1899 decided it mostly in Guyana's favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/venezuela1895.htm |title=Venezuela Boundary Dispute, 1895–1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is known widely for its [[petroleum]] industry, the [[biodiversity|environmental diversity]] of its territory, and its natural features. Venezuela is considered to be among the world's [[megadiverse countries|17 most biodiverse countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=South America Banks on Regional Strategy to Safeguard Quarter of Earth's Biodiversity |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.conservation.org/xp/news/press_releases/2003/091603_andean_eng.xml |work=Conservation International |pages= |accessdate=29 June 2007 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031004032107/http://www.conservation.org/xp/news/press_releases/2003/091603_andean_eng.xml |archivedate=4 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|a region of Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan|other uses|Shōnan (disambiguation)}}

{{Nihongo|'''Shōnan'''|湘南}} is the name of a region along the coast of [[Sagami Bay]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], central [[Japan]]. Centered on [[Enoshima]], an island about 50 kilometers southwest of [[Tokyo]], the Shōnan region stretches from [[Ōiso, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in the west to [[Hayama, Kanagawa|Hayama]] in the east, including [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa|Hiratsuka]], [[Chigasaki, Kanagawa|Chigasaki]], [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]], and [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. Because of the bay, the region benefits from a mild climate and long beaches covered with dark volcanic sand.

==Overview==
The name "Shonan" of this Japanese region already existed in the 17th century, relative to [[Shigitatsu-an]], according to [[Ōiso, Kanagawa|Ōiso Town]]. 

During the 1880s, when the custom of swimming in the ocean was introduced into Japan, the "Shonan" region became a resort area for the politicians and rich people from Tokyo.

In postwar times, the Shōnan region gained prominence in [[Shintaro Ishihara|Ishihara Shintaro]]'s [[Akutagawa Prize|prize-winning]] 1955 novel, ''[[Taiyō no Kisetsu]]'' (''Season of the Sun''). The novel, which was also made into a popular movie, portrayed the hedonistic lifestyle of young sun-worshippers from elite families (''taiyo-zoku'', the "sun-tribe"), who hung out on Shōnan beaches. Lying as it does on the edge of the Tokyo-[[Yokohama]] [[Greater Tokyo Area|metropolitan area]], the Shōnan region is nowadays a leading [[resort]] area, oriented to [[surfing]], [[sail boat|sailboating]], and other [[Water sport (recreation)|water sports]].

==Etymology==
There are two theories in the etymology of Shōnan ({{Lang-ja|湘南}}). One is that [[Kanagawa, Japan|Kanagawa Prefecture]] where the Shōnan region is located was until the first half of the19th century called Sagami-no-kuni ([[:ja:相模国|相模国]]) or Sōshū (相州) (as that phrase remaining in the [[Sagami River]] and [[Sagami Bay]]), and that Shōnan was in the [[south]] ([[:ja:南|南]]) of Sōshū (the [[Radical 85|water sign]] "[[氵]]" of the [[Kangxi radical|Kanji radicals]] having been added to "相" to make it more [[poetic]]). The other is that Shōnan comes from Xiangnan Prefecture (湘南県) of the old Province/Country of [[Changsha]] ([[:zh:長沙国|長沙国]] in southern [[China]].

In the latter theory, the region's name, Shōnan, derives from a supposedly scenic region in [[Hunan]], [[China]], encapsulated in the phrase 瀟湘湖南 (Chinese [[pinyin]]: "xiāo xiāng hú nán"; Japanese: "''shōshō konan''"). This phrase refers to a beautiful area centered on the [[Xiao River]] (瀟江) and the [[Xiang River]] (湘江) south of the [[Yangtze River]] in Hunan. Often praised in [[Chinese poetry]] of the [[Xiaoxiang]] genre, the scenery of this area became a stylized popular subject of paintings in both [[History of China|medieval China]] and [[History of Japan|Japan]], particularly as to the graphic and poetic series known as the "[[Eight Views of Xiaoxiang]]". In Japan, the scenery of the Shōnan area was thought to be similar to the scenery around the Xiao and Xiang rivers in Hunan, China; hence the term "Shōnan" (Chinese [[pinyin]]: "xiāng nán", another name for the southern Hunan region) came to be applied to the area around Enoshima in Japan.

Besides the similarity in scenery, the two areas both had flood-basin lakes. The lake in China, which still exists, is [[Lake Dongting]]. Among others, the lake is fed by the Xiang and Xiao rivers (the Xiao is a tributary of the Xiang). In Japan, the corresponding flood-basin lake (which no longer exists but was mentioned in the ''[[Enoshima Engi]]'') was probably located along the course of the [[Kashio River]], which flows into Sagami Bay (via the [[Katase River]]) at Enoshima.

[[File:Steig Bergpfad.JPG|thumb|140 px|A ''steig'' near [[Großarl]]]]
A '''''steig''''' (Low German: ''Stieg'') is a German term that originally meant a narrow [[footpath]] over [[hill]]s or [[mountain]]s that could not be negotiated by [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s. Today the term occurs in German-speaking countries as a [[synonym]] for all kinds of footpaths, e.g., ''Bürgersteig'', a term for "pavement" in [[Austria]] or [[Switzerland]]. The term ''steig'' and its dialectical variations is commonly found in many [[placename]]s.

== Mountain paths and hiking trails ==

''Steige'' in hill or mountain areas, often run over [[exposure (height)|exposed]], rocky [[terrain]] and are therefore more uneven than normal footpaths. They should only be attempted with [[mountaineering boot]]s or high [[sports shoes]], which extend above the [[ankle]]s (to reduce the risk of [[going over on one's ankle]]).

On [[hiking map]]s and large-[[Scale (map)|scale]] [[topographical map]]s (typically 1:50,000 scale) in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, ''steige'' and ''[[klettersteig]]e'' are usually portrayed by short dashes or dotted lines, while wider tracks are often indicated by longer dashes (cart tracks may also be portrayed by dots and dashes).

Popular climbing mountains often have several ''steige'' on each side (see e.g. the [[Rax]], [[Hochkönig]] or [[Zugspitze]]). Regional books, websites, climbing and hiking guides give more detailed information on the routes and elevations, the opening times of [[mountain hut]]s and the duration of walks. They may also identify and describe potential emergency exit routes. 

Narrow or steep paths through a [[gorge]] or leading to other tourist attractions such as old  [[mining|mines]], [[nature trails]], [[waterfall]]s etc. are called ''steige''. Those that are especially popular are almost always secured with ropes, steps, ladders or small footbridges.

== Examples ==
The suffix ''-steig'' or ''-stieg'' is often used nowadays in the names of major [[long distance path]]s of tourist significance. German examples include:

* [[Eifelsteig]], long distance trail in the [[Eifel]] mountains
* [[Harzer Hexenstieg]], 100-km-long footpath through the [[Harz Mountains]]
* [[Nibelungensteig]], 124-km-long trail in the [[Odenwald]]
* [[Rennsteig]], 170-km-long ridgeway in Central Germany
* [[Rheinsteig]], 320-km-long trail along the Rhine
* [[Rothaarsteig]], 154-km-long ridgeway along the [[Rothaar Mountains]]

''[[Pitcher Plants of the Old World]]''. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=award /&gt;

==Background==
McPherson graduated in geography at the [[University of Durham]] in England, and studied briefly at the [[University of Tübingen]] in [[Germany]], and [[Yale University]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=McPherson /&gt; On graduation in 2006 he founded Redfern Natural History Productions in [[Poole]], [[Dorset]] to conduct natural history research, publishing, filming and eco-tours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redfernnaturalhistory.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in natural history==
McPherson is the author of around 20 volumes published by his own company and concerned with natural history, largely focusing on [[carnivorous plant]]s. He has co-discovered a number of species (including the much publicised ''[[Nepenthes attenboroughii|Nepenthes&amp;nbsp; attenboroughii]]'') and has [[species description|formally described]] around 35 carnivorous plant [[taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. 2012. [http://gulfnews.com/life-style/environment/discovering-a-lost-world-of-rat-eating-plants-in-the-philippines-1.1087040 Discovering a lost world of rat-eating plants in the Philippines]. ''Friday'', October 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is a member of the [[IUCN SSC]] Carnivorous Plant Specialist Group.&lt;ref name=award /&gt; He documented each species in full detail in its natural habitat, taking seven years with many expeditions in the tropics of Southeast Asia, Africa and South America. Over time he has transitioned into TV presenter and natural history writer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redfernnaturalhistory.com/about/meet-stewart-mcpherson/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nhbs.com/title-information/pitcher-plants-of-the-old-world-an-interview-with-stewart-mcpherson/&lt;/ref&gt;

He set up "Ark of Life" to conserve species on the brink of extinction, initially carnivorous plant groups.

==Television presenting==
McPherson has appeared in several documentaries, including a conservation documentary on the lost world ''[[tepui]]'' sandstone plateaux of southern [[Venezuela]] and the borderlands of northern [[Brazil]] and western [[Guyana]]. A 2011 documentary ''Mountain with No Name'' was set on [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where he discovered new species of flesh eating plants on a previously unexplored mountain. An earlier 2010 film documented the discovery of ''[[Nepenthes leonardoi]]''.

His most recent series for the BBC was "Britain's Treasure Islands", a series of three episodes in which he visits all of Britain's 14 overseas territories, travelling 70,000&amp;nbsp;km in the process. Working with cameraman Simon Vacher, he discussed the natural history of each location and history of British settlement. The series was focused on the natural history of the UK Overseas Territories, particular the most impressive wildlife populations and migrations. In [[British Antarctica]] and [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] he retraced the expedition of [[Ernest Shackleton]], and made a rare visit to the [[Chagos Archipelago]] and [[Pitcairn Island]]. The series was filmed in 2012, 2013 and 2014, broadcast on [[BBC Four]] in 2016 and repeated in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077sxwf/broadcasts/2016/04 BBC - Britain's Treasure Islands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
*In 2012 McPherson was the first recipient of the David Given Award for Excellence in Plant Conservation.&lt;ref name=award&gt;[http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/news___press/?11066/Stewart-McPherson-receives-new-Plant-Conservation-Award Stewart McPherson receives new Plant Conservation Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004133010/http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/news___press/?11066%2FStewart-McPherson-receives-new-Plant-Conservation-Award |date=2012-10-04 }}.

The shape of the so-called '''“thrown stones”''' has caught the curiosity of many travelers going to [[Rome]]. About a kilometer from the town of [[Bolsena]], which leads to [[Montefiascone]] along the [[Via Cassia|Cassia]], you can observe a [[columnar basalt]] rock formation: naturally-formed [[prism]]s of volcanic rock.
[[Image:pietre lanciate 001.jpg|thumb| The thrown stones]]

== Etymology ==
[[Image:pietre lanciate 004.jpg|thumb| The thrown stones]]
The “thrown stones” the popular term, which is commonly referred to these particular rocks, was coined by the locals in an attempt to understand what seemed like an inexplicable phenomenon. People imagined that the volcano, that is now replaced by [[Lake Bolsena]], had thrown stones during an eruption and that they had driven into the ground.

== Morphology ==
The morphology of this [[basaltic]] wall is due to the intense volcanic activity that affected the area one million years ago and in particular to the magma that came in contact with water, which has taken the form of a pentagonal or hexagonal rock column. In some cases the so-called "heads" of the basalts are not smooth, but have a rough surface due to melt conformations called "volcanic".

== Legend ==
A legend tells that the ancient gods had built the temple in a sacred place near the lake, which had prevented the priests from celebrating the rites and sacrifices in the unlucky days. But some priests didn't adhere to the divine. Thus the temple was violated. The fury of the gods was very violent and a series of lightning was thrown on the temple and the village nearby. But a brave girl, in order to save innocent people, reached the lake because she wanted to sink and die. The Almighty moved by the sacrifice of the girl, saved her from a lightning turning himself into a stone this way she didn’t drown. The God, overcome by compassion, calmed its fury and turned every bolt launched on the temple into a series of stones stuck into the ground. The quiet came back then but the rites were celebrated following rigorous rules. The temple was destroyed and never rebuilt. The girl was recognized by all as the only Vestal of God and retired in a sacred cave located near the lake waters.

'''Urbanisation in China''' increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2017, 59.4% of the total population lived in urban areas, a dramatic increase from 26% in 1990.&lt;ref name="urbanizationrate"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sun|first1=Wenyu|title=China’s permanent urbanization rate hits 57.4 per cent|url=http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0713/c90000-9241304.html|work=People's Daily|date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, the [[OECD]], based on [[Functional Urban Area]] (FUA), estimates there are currently 17 [[megacities]] in China.&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/urban-rural-and-regional-development/oecd-urban-policy-reviews-china-2015_9789264230040-en#page39|title=OECD Urban Policy Reviews: China 2015|date=18 Apr 2015|publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]|isbn=9789264230033|page=37|doi=10.1787/9789264230040-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Ancient Chinese urban planning}}
China's increase in [[urbanization]] was one of the several functions of the surpluses produced from the agricultural sectors in Chinese (farming and pastoral dependency). This judgment is based on (1) the fact that not until the end of the [[Qing Period]] did Chinese begin importing moderate quantities of [[foodstuff]]s from the outside world to help feed its population; and (2) the fact that the handicraft sector never challenged agricultural dominance in the economy despite a symbiotic relationship between them.

By the same token, urbanization rarely exceeded ten percent of the total population although large urban centers were established. For example, during the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], the northern capital [[Kaifeng]] (of the [[Northern Song]]) and southern capital [[Hangzhou]] (of the [[Southern Song]]) had 1.4 million and one million inhabitants, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, E. L., Lionel Frost and Colin White. Coming Full Circle: An Economic History of the Pacific Rim. Melbourne and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993. (ch. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was common that urban residents also had one foot in the rural sector due to private [[landholding]] [[property rights]].

==Modern history==
[[File:Shenzhen Skyline from Nanshan.jpg|thumb|344x344px|Originally a collection of fishing villages, [[Shenzhen]] rapidly grew to be one of the largest cities in China.]]
[[File:Dwelling houses in Guangzhou-2.JPG|thumb|344x344px|Apartment buildings in [[Shenzhen|Guangzhou]].]]
Urban population grew steadily at around 3%-20% from 1950 to 1965. Urban population experienced a 'great jump' in 1958-1961 during the "[[Great Leap Forward]]" in conjunction with the massive [[industrialization]] effort. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] years of 1965-1975, urban population growth dropped as a result of '[[Down to the Countryside Movement|rustication]]'. From 1962 to 1978, it is estimated that almost 18 million urban youth moved to the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after reforms were launched at the end of 1978, urban population growth began to accelerate. The inflow of [[foreign direct investment]] created massive [[employment]] opportunities, which fostered urban population growth. In the 1990s, urban population growth started to slow. This reflected a slower increase in employment growth following the restructuring of the [[state-owned enterprises]] (SOE).

The majority of China's people live in the eastern segment of the country, the traditional [[China proper]]. Most are peasants living, as did their forebears, in the low-lying hills and central plains that stretch from the highlands eastward and southward to the sea. [[Agriculture]] predominates in this vast area, generally favored by a temperate or subtropical climate. The meticulously tilled fields are evidence in part of the government's continuing concern over farm output and the food supply.

Although migration to urban areas has been restricted since the late 1950s, as of the end of 1985 about 33 percent of the population was urban.  An urban and industrial corridor formed a broad arc stretching from [[Harbin]] in the northeast through the [[Beijing]] area and south to China's largest city, the industrial metropolitan complex of [[Shanghai]].

The uneven pattern of internal development and settlement, so strongly weighted toward the eastern part of the country, doubtless will change relatively little even with developing interest in exploiting the mineral-rich and agriculturally productive portions of the vast northwest and southwest regions. The adverse terrain and climate of most of those regions have historically discouraged dense population.

In 1987 China had a total of twenty-nine provincial-level administrative units directly under the central government in Beijing. In addition to the twenty-one provinces (''sheng''), there were five autonomous regions (''zizhiqu'') for minority nationalities, and three special municipalities (''shi'')--the three largest cities, [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]], and [[Tianjin]]. (The establishment of [[Hainan Island]] as a provincial-level unit separate from Guangdong Province was scheduled in 1988.) A 1979 change in provincial-level administrative boundaries in the northeast region restored [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region to its original size (it had been reduced by a third in 1969) at the expense of [[Heilongjiang]], [[Jilin]], and [[Liaoning]] provinces. Urban areas were further subdivided into lower-level administrative units beginning with municipalities and extending down to the neighborhood level.

The pace of urbanization in China from 1949 to 1982 was relatively slow because of both rapid growth of the rural population and tight restrictions on rural-urban migration for most of that period. According to the 1953 and 1982 censuses, the urban population as a percentage of total population increased from 13.3 to 20.6 percent during that period. From 1982 to 1986, however, the urban population increased dramatically to 37 percent of the total population. This large jump resulted from a combination of factors. One was the migration of large numbers of surplus agricultural workers, displaced by the agricultural [[responsibility system]], from rural to urban areas. Another was a 1984 decision to broaden the criteria for classifying an area as a city or town. During 1984, the number of towns meeting the new urban criteria increased more than twofold, and the urban town population doubled. In the mid-1980s, demographers expected the proportion of the population living in cities and towns to be around 50 percent by the start of the 21st century. This urban growth was expected to result primarily from the increase in the number of small- and medium-sized cities and towns rather than from an expansion of existing large cities.

China's statistics regarding urban population sometimes can be misleading because of the various criteria used to calculate urban population. In the 1953 census, urban essentially referred to settlements with populations of more than 2,500, in which more than 50 percent of the labor force were involved in nonagricultural pursuits. The 1964 census raised the cut-off to 3,000 and the requirement for nonagricultural labor to 70 percent. The 1982 census used the 3,000/70 percent minimum but introduced criteria of 2,500 to 3,000 and 85 percent as well. Also, in calculating urban population, the 1982 census made a radical change by including the agricultural population residing within the city boundaries. This explains the dramatic jump in urban population from the 138.7 million reported for year-end 1981 to the 206.6 million counted by the 1982 census. In 1984 the urban guidelines were further loosened, allowing for lower minimum population totals and nonagricultural percentages. The criteria varied among provincial-level units.

Although country urban population—382 million, or 37 percent of the total population in the mid-1980s—was relatively low by comparison with developed nations, the number of people living in urban areas in China was greater than the total population of any country in the world except [[India]]. The four Chinese cities with the largest populations in 1985 were [[Shanghai]], with 7 million; [[Beijing]], with 5.9 million; [[Tianjin]], with 5.4 million; and [[Shenyang]], with 4.2 million. The disproportionate distribution of population in large cities occurred as a result of the government's emphasis after 1949 on the development of large cities over smaller urban areas. In 1985 the 22 most populous cities in China had a total population of 47.5 million, or about 12 percent of China's total urban population. The number of cities with populations of at least 100,000 increased from 200 in 1976 to 342 in 1986.

In 1987, China was committed to a three-part strategy to control urban growth: strictly limiting the size of big cities (those of 500,000 or more people); developing medium-sized cities (200,000 to 500,000); and encouraging the growth of small cities (100,000 to 200,000). The government also encouraged the development of small market and commune centers that were not then officially designated as urban places, hoping that they eventually would be transformed into towns and small cities. For more on this understudied dimension of China's urbanisation see the special issue of China Perspectives (September 2013) edited by Ben Hillman and Jon Unger of the Australian National University. The big and medium-sized cities were viewed as centers of [[heavy industry|heavy]] and [[light industry]], and small cities and towns were looked on as possible locations for [[handicraft]] and [[workshop]] activities, using labor provided mainly from rural overflow. The urbanization of small and medium-sized towns has created different challenges for ethnically diverse areas, leading in some cases to an ethnic stratification of labor and greater potential for ethnic conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2005, China had [[Chinese cities|286 cities]]. Most of China's cities have a population of one million and below. [[Shanghai]] is the largest city in China, with a population of 19 million, followed by [[Beijing]] with a population of 17.4 million. These are the two [[Megacity|mega-cities]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaobing Li and Xiansheng Tian (eds.), ''Urbanization and Party Survival: People vs. Party'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield and Lexington Books, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2025, it is estimated by the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development]] that 300 million Chinese now living in rural areas will move into cities. The fast pace of urbanization will create at least one trillion yuan in annual investment opportunities in building water supply, waste treatment, heating and other [[public utilities]] in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Post a Classifieds |url=http://www.echinacities.com/main/news/ShowNews.aspx?n=3723 |title=Articles about News in China – |publisher=Echinacities.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government is also demolishing rural villages and building new cities and towns to relocate villagers to. It ultimately aims to integrate about 70% of China's population, about 900 million people, into cities by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Johnson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/world/asia/chinas-great-uprooting-moving-250-million-into-cities.html?pagewanted=all |title=China’s Great Uprooting: Moving 250 Million Into Cities |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Lu Dadao, president of the Geographical Society of China (GSC), China's urbanization took 22 years to increase to 39.1% from 17.9%. It took [[United Kingdom|Britain]] 120 years, the [[United States|US]] 80 years, and [[Japan]] more than 30 years to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10635/43752/XuXYQ.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Human Capital Accumulation by Low-Skilled Workers with Borrowing Constraints - A Welfare Analysis Based on the Lucas Urban-Rural Migration Model |last=Xu | first=Yiqin |page=14 |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As shown in the table (right), China's urban population growth is higher than that of [[Asia]] as well as the world.

China's urbanization rate in 2005 was higher than that of Asia and roughly on par with the levels in East and South-East Asia. However, the country still has a long way to go in catching up with the [[Western world|western]] [[Developed country|developed countries]].

In 1492, a Spanish-based [[transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] maritime expedition led by Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] encountered the Americas, continents which were largely unknown in Europe and were outside the [[Old World]] political and economic system. The four voyages of Columbus began the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].

For a long time it was generally believed that Columbus and his crew had been the first Europeans to make landfall in the Americas. In fact they were not the first explorers from Europe to reach the Americas, having been preceded by the [[Vikings|Viking]] expedition led by [[Leif Erikson]] in the 11th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/erikson_leif.shtml |title=History – Leif Erikson (11th century) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151011-columbus-day-leif-erikson-italian-americans-holiday-history/ |title=Why Do We Celebrate Columbus Day and Not Leif Erikson Day? |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine) |National Geographic]]'' |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Columbus's voyages were the ones that led to ongoing European contact with the Americas, inaugurating a period of [[Age of Discovery|exploration]], [[Conquest (military)|conquest]], and [[History of colonialism|colonization]] whose effects and consequences persist to the present.

Columbus was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[navigator]] sailing for the [[Crown of Castile]] in search of a westward route to Asia, to access the sources of [[Spice trade|spices]] and other oriental goods. This led instead to a discovery of the [[New World]] between Europe and Asia. Columbus made a total of four voyages to the Americas between 1492 and 1502, setting the stage for the European exploration and colonization of the Americas, ultimately leading to the [[Columbian Exchange]].

At the time of the Columbus voyages, the Americas were inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]], the [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|descendants]] of [[Paleo-Indians]] who [[Settlement of the Americas|crossed]] [[Beringia]] from [[Asia]] to [[North America]] beginning around 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dillehay|first=Tom D.|last2=Ocampo|first2=Carlos|last3=Saavedra|first3=José|last4=Sawakuchi|first4=Andre Oliveira|last5=Vega|first5=Rodrigo M.|last6=Pino|first6=Mario|last7=Collins|first7=Michael B.|last8=Cummings|first8=Linda Scott|last9=Arregui|first9=Iván|author-link1=Tom Dillehay|author-link6=Mario Pino Quivira|date=2015-11-18|title=New Archaeological Evidence for an Early Human Presence at Monte Verde, Chile|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651426|pmid=26580202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus's voyages led to the widespread knowledge that a new continent existed west of Europe and east of [[Asia]]. This breakthrough in geographical science led to the exploration and colonization of the New World by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and other European sea powers, and is sometimes cited as the start of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Keneth and Taylor, William B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww-J9Kjb2KgC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=discovery+of+america+marks+modern+era&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cdiXQBXk3_&amp;sig=7h4YTsP70BUalD1D37ck_bMBTfM&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=evwRU5qGHqLm7AaZ24CgCg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=discovery%20of%20america%20marks%20modern%20era&amp;f=false], p. 36, SR Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8420-2573-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], and other European kingdoms sent expeditions and [[European colonization of the Americas|established colonies]] throughout the New World, converted the native inhabitants to [[Christianity]], and built large [[Columbian exchange|trade networks]] across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], which introduced new plants, animals, and food crops to both continents. The search for a westward route to Asia continued in 1513 when [[Vasco Nuñez de Balboa]] crossed the narrow [[Isthmus of Panama]] to become the first European to sight the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The search was completed in 1521, when the Castilian (''Spanish'') [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] sailed across the Pacific and reached [[Southeast Asia]].

==Background to the voyages==
[[File:Fernandez-Virgin of the Navigators (proper inversion).jpg|thumb|''[[The Virgin of the Navigators]]'' by [[Alejo Fernández]], the earliest known painting&lt;ref&gt;John Noble, Susan Forsyth, Vesna Maric, Paula Hardy. ''Andalucía''. Lonely Planet, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; about the discovery of the [[Americas]], 1531–36.]]

[[Portugal]] had been the main European power interested in pursuing trade routes overseas. Their next-door neighbors, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (predecessor of [[Spain]]) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because of the bigger land area it had to re-conquer (the ''[[Reconquista]]'') from the [[Moors]]. It was not until the late 15th century, following the [[dynastic union]] of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the completion of the ''Reconquista'', that the unified crowns of what would become Spain (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the [[Granada#Nasrid Kingdom of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through [[tribute]]. Columbus had previously failed to convince King [[John II of Portugal]] to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered Spain decided to fund Columbus's expedition in hopes of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, reaching Asia by traveling west.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, De Ladickmar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe 2nd ed.'' p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding campaign===
He proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out west into the Atlantic, search for a western route to [[India]], and return. Columbus also requested he be made "Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea" (Atlantic Ocean), appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and be given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it after several years. It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km}} was, in fact, far too short.&lt;ref name = "Morison-Admiral"/&gt;

In 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal, receiving a new invitation for an audience with King John II. This also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal following a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. With an eastern sea route now under its control, Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western trade route to Asia crossing unknown seas. Columbus traveled from Portugal to Castile to convince the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Castile and Aragon to finance the expedition.

====Spanish procurement====
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] married Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469, uniting the two largest kingdoms into what would later be the Spanish Crown. They were known jointly as the [[Catholic Monarchs]], and ruled their kingdoms independently, but had common internal and foreign policies.

Columbus was granted an audience with them; on May 1, 1489, he presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who referred them to a committee. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised the monarchs not to support the proposed venture.

However, to expand the Spanish empire and Catholicism in the name of Spanish Kings, and to assure a better market position in trading, the Queen gave Columbus an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and part of the newly conquered lands.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will ''"The Story of Civilization"'' Vol. VI, "The Reformation". New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1957. {{ISBN|0-671-61050-3}}. p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monumento a Colón (Madrid) 02b.jpg|thumb|Columbus and Queen Isabella. Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).]]

After continually lobbying at the royal court and enduring two years of negotiations, Columbus finally succeeded in January 1492. Queen Isabella's forces had just conquered the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold of [[Al-Andalus]] on the [[Iberian peninsula]], for Castile. Isabella and Ferdinand received Columbus in the ''[[Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alcázar]]'' (castle) in [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]] to support his plans.

The monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made "Admiral of the Seas" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous but, as his son later wrote, the monarchs were not confident of his return.

According to Columbus's contract made for the expedition commission by Queen Isabella for Castile, if Columbus claimed any new islands or mainland for the Crown, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor#Other colonial empires|Governor]] of the newly colonised lands. He had the right to nominate three people, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to ten per cent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, ''Isabella of Castile: the first Renaissance queen'', 2004, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navigation plans===
Europe had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India—sources of valued goods such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]—under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the [[Bartholomew Columbus|Columbus brothers]] had, by the 1480s, developed a plan to travel to the [[East Indies|Indies]], then construed roughly as all of southern and eastern Asia, by sailing directly west across what was believed to be the singular "[[World Ocean|Ocean Sea]]," the Atlantic Ocean.

[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].&lt;ref name=book3&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul F|last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-19-509186-1 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]]. The knowledge that the Earth was spherical was widespread, and the means of calculating its diameter using an [[astrolabe]] was known to both scholars and navigators.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeffrey Burton 1991. ''Inventing the Flat Earth. Columbus and modern historians'', Praeger, New York, Westport, London 1991;&lt;br /&gt;Zinn, Howard 1980. ''A People's History of the United States'', HarperCollins 2001. p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diameter of Earth and travel distance estimates====
[[File:Conceptions Colomb map-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Columbus's geographical conceptions]]

A spherical Earth had been the general opinion of Ancient Greek science, and this view continued through the [[Middle Ages]] (for example, [[Bede]] mentions it in ''The Reckoning of Time''). In fact [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name=Sagan /&gt; Where Columbus did differ from the generally accepted view of his time was in his incorrect arguments that assumed a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe. Columbus's error was attributed to his insufficient experience in navigation at sea.&lt;ref name = "Morison-Admiral"&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'' Boston, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

Accepting the length of a degree to be 56⅔ miles&lt;!--need km and statute/U.S. mile--&gt;, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as {{convert|25,255|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}&lt;!--need Arabic and statute/U.S. mile--&gt; at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles ({{convert|3,700|km|nmi mi|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}). Columbus did not realize Alfraganus used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m&lt;!--need km and statute/U.S. mile--&gt;).&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

The true circumference of the Earth is about {{convert|40,000|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}, a figure first established approximately by [[Eratosthenes]] in the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name=Sagan&gt;Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.&lt;/ref&gt; and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan {{convert|19,600|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}. No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, probably correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst, [[scurvy]] or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having just completed the expensive [[Reconquista]], was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the [[East Indies]]. Columbus promised such an advantage.

Europeans generally assumed that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted. While hints of North America, [[Vinland]], were already surfacing in Europe, historians agree that Columbus calculated too short a distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan by the standards of his peers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

=====Trade winds=====
There was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the [[Trade Winds]]. A brisk westward wind from the east, commonly called an "[[Easterlies|easterly]]", propelled ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', ''[[Niña|La Niña]]'', and ''[[Pinta (ship)|La Pinta]]'' for five weeks from the Canary Islands off Africa. To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique upwind, called [[Sailing#Close Hauled or "Beating"|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of [[Western Europe]], where the winds curve southward towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. So he used the North Atlantic's great circular wind pattern, clockwise in direction, in both legs of his voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|accessdate=2008-04-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014015153/http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|archivedate=2009-10-14|df=}}

==Voyages and events==

===First voyage===

At 8:00 on the morning of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Castilian [[Palos de la Frontera]] (on the [[Rio Saltes|river Saltes]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] and [[Rio Odiel]]).&lt;ref name="tharoor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tharoor|first1=Shashi|title=Trying to discover India|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/trying-to-discover-india/292728|accessdate=25 October 2016|publisher=Outlook India|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus and his crew embarked on a voyage to find a shorter route to [[India]] and the [[Orient]] with three medium-sized ships, the ''[[Niña]]'' (real name ''Santa Clara''), the [[Pinta (ship)|''Pinta'']], and the [[Santa María (ship)|''Santa Maria'']]. The ships were the property of [[Juan de la Cosa]] and the [[The Pinzón Brothers|Pinzón brothers]] ([[Martín Alonso Pinzón]] and [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]]), but the monarchs forced the [[Palos de la Frontera]] inhabitants to contribute to the expedition as well.

One large [[carrack]], the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', was always referred to by Columbus as ''La Capitana'' ("The Captain"). The two smaller caravels, ''La [[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' ("The Painted") and ''La [[Niña]]'' (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "The Girl", but actually named after her owners, the [[Niño brothers]] of [[Moguer]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Columbus Foundation |url=http://www.thenina.com/the_original_nina.htm |title=The original Niña |accessdate=8 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330073312/http://www.thenina.com/the_original_nina.htm |archivedate=30 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are today better known by their nicknames: the real name of the ''Pinta'' has been lost; the ''Niña'' was actually named ''Santa Clara'', after the [[patron saint]] of Moguer.

Three days into the journey, on 6 August 1492, the rudder of the ''Pinta'' broke.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The owners of the ship, Gomez Rascon and Christoval Quintero, were suspected of sabotage, as they and their ship had been pressed into service against their will.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; The crew was able to secure the rudder with ropes until they could reach the [[Canary Islands]], where they arrived on 9 August 1492.&lt;ref name="m20"&gt;Markham, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Here the ''Pinta'' was repaired and the ''Niña''{{'}}s [[lateen]] sails were re-rigged to standard square sails. While securing provisions from the island of [[La Gomera]], Columbus received word that three Portuguese caravels had been seen hovering near the island of [[El Hierro]] with the supposed intention of capturing him.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; However, on September 6, 1492 the westward voyage began without incident.&lt;ref name="m22"&gt;Markham, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The ships departed [[San Sebastián de la Gomera]] for what turned out to be a six-week long voyage across the Atlantic.

As described in the abstract of his log made by [[Bartolome de Las Casas]], on the outward bound voyage Columbus recorded two sets of distances. Las Casas originally interpreted that he reported the shorter distances to his crew so they would not worry about sailing too far from Spain. However, according to Oliver Dunn and James Kelley,&lt;ref&gt;Review by Carla Rahn Phillips, ''Renaissance Quarterly'', Vol. 44, No. 3. (Autumn, 1991), pp. 572–574.The Diario of Christopher Columbus's First Voyage to America 1492–93, Abstracted by Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas. by Oliver Dunn; James E. Kelley, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbusnavigation.com/shd973.shtml The Navigational Mysteries and Fraudulent Longitudes of Christopher Columbus A Lecture given to the Society for the History of Discoveries and the Haklyut Society, August 1997 by Keith A. Pickering]&lt;/ref&gt; this was a misunderstanding by Las Casas. Columbus did report two distances each day but one was in measurements he normally used, the other in the Portuguese maritime leagues used by his crew.

====Magnetic declination====
On 13 September 1492, Columbus observed that [[Magnetic declination|the needle of his compass no longer pointed to the North Star]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Shen Kuo]] discovered 400 years earlier, in Asia, the concept of [[true north]] in terms of [[magnetic declination]] towards the [[north pole]], with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and "the improved meridian determined by Shen's [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the polestar and true north". For more see Sivin, Nathan (1984). "Why the Scientific Revolution Did Not Take Place in China – Or Didn't It?" in ''Transformation and Tradition in the Sciences: Essays in Honor of I. Bernard Cohen'', 531–555, ed. Everett Mendelsohn. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-52485-7}}. Vol. III, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The needle instead had varied a half point to the northwest, and continued to vary further as the journey progressed. Columbus at first made no mention of this, knowing his crew to be prone to panic with their destination unknown, but after several days his pilots took notice with much anxiety. Allegedly the crew grew so homesick and fearful that they threatened to sail back to Spain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Columbus reasoned that the needle did not point to the North Star, but to [[North Magnetic Pole|some invisible point on the Earth]]. His reputation as an astronomer held weight with the crew, and his theory alleviated their alarm.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} It was once believed that Columbus had discovered [[magnetic declination]], but it was later shown that the phenomenon was already known, both in Europe and in China.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Smith &amp; Joseph Needham, "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v214/n5094/abs/2141213b0.html Magnetic Declination in Mediaeval China]", ''Nature'' 214, 1213–1214 (17 June 1967); {{doi|10.1038/2141213b0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====European discovery and exploration====
[[File:Columbus first voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|First voyage. Modern place names in black, Columbus's place names in blue]]

After twenty-nine days out of sight of land, on 7 October 1492, the crew spotted "[i]mmense flocks of birds", some of which his sailors trapped and determined to be "field" birds (probably [[Eskimo curlew]]s and [[American golden plover]]s). Columbus changed course to follow their flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nicholls|first=Steve|title=Paradise Found: Nature in America at the Time of Discovery|pages=103–104|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=2009|isbn=0-226-58340-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land was first sighted at 2 [[12-hour clock|a.m.]] on October 12, 1492, by a sailor named [[Rodrigo de Triana]] (also known as Juan Rodriguez Bermejo) aboard ''La Pinta''.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus would later assert that he had first seen the land and, thus, earned the reward of 10,000 [[Spanish maravedí|maravedís]].&lt;ref&gt;Markham, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clements R.

Exactly which island in the Bahamas or Turks and Caicos this corresponds to is an unresolved topic; prime candidates are [[Samana Cay]], [[Plana Cays]], [[Grand Turk Island|Grand Turk]], [[Cat Island, Bahamas|Cat Island]] or [[San Salvador Island]] (''Watlings Island'' named San Salvador in 1925 in the belief that it was Columbus's San Salvador).

Those details are left out here as they are irrelevant to the topic of the voyage. --&gt;]]
The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] he encountered in their homelands were peaceful and friendly. At the time of the European discovery of most of the islands of the Caribbean, three major indigenous peoples lived on the islands: the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] in the [[Greater Antilles]], the Bahamas, and the [[Leeward Islands]]; the [[Island Caribs]] (Kalina) and [[Galibi]] in the [[Windward Islands]] and [[Guadeloupe]]; and the [[Ciboney]] (a Taíno people) and [[Guanahatabey]] of central and western Cuba, respectively. The Taínos are subdivided into Classic Taínos, who occupied Hispaniola and [[Puerto Rico]]; Western Taínos, who occupied Cuba, [[Jamaica]], and the [[Bahamian archipelago]]; and the Eastern Taínos, who occupied the Leeward Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rouse |first=Irving |title=The Taínos : Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus |isbn=0-300-05696-6 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgjsDvFiNuUC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinidad]] was inhabited by both [[Carib language|Carib-speaking]] and [[Arawak language|Arawak-speaking]] groups. Most of modern [[Central America]] was part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central [[Mexico]] in the north to [[Costa Rica]] in the south. The cultures of [[Panama]] traded with both Mesoamerica and [[South America]] and can be considered transitional between those two cultural areas.

Columbus proceeded to observe the people and their cultural lifestyle. He also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, landing on 28 October 1492, and the north-western coast of Hispaniola, present day [[Haiti]], by 5 December 1492. Here, the ''Santa Maria'' ran aground on [[Christmas Day]], December 25, 1492, and had to be abandoned. Columbus was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus founded the settlement, ''[[La Navidad]]'', leaving behind 39 men.

On 15 January 1493, he set sail for home aboard the ''Niña''.

====First return====
While returning to Spain, the ''Niña'' and ''Pinta'' encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, on the night of 13 February, lost contact with each other. All hands on the ''Niña'' vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the [[Azore Islands]], but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the ''Niña'' laid anchor at [[Santa Maria Island]], but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Niña moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he and the rest of the crew stayed on the Niña, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, João de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the ''Niña'', in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|journal = Portuguese Studies|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 17–23|volume = 6|first = Rebecca|last = Catz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving the island of Santa Maria in the Azores on 23 February, Columbus headed for Castilian Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493, where he was told a fleet of 100 [[caravels]] had been lost in the storm. Astoundingly, both the ''Niña'' and the ''Pinta'' had been spared. Not finding [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] of Portugal in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for the king's reply. After receiving the letter, the king agreed to meet with Columbus in ''Vale do Paraíso'' despite poor relations between Portugal and Castile at the time. Upon learning of Columbus's discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]]. After spending more than a week in Portugal, Columbus set sail for Spain. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe. After the voyage, Columbus met with Spanish monarchs [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in [[Barcelona]] on 15 March 1493 to report his findings. The [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|''Monument a Colom'']] in that city commemorates the event.

Columbus and his remaining crew came home to a hero's welcome when they returned to Spain. He showed off what he had brought back from his voyage to the monarchs, including a few small samples of gold, [[pearls]], gold jewelry stolen from natives, a few natives he had kidnapped, flowers, and a hammock. He gave the monarchs a few of the gold nuggets, gold jewelry, and pearls, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and the hammock. The monarchs invited Columbus to dine with them. A taster even tasted the food from each of his dishes before he ate to "make sure it was not poisoned." He was given his own footmen to open doors for him and to serve him at the table. Columbus was even rewarded with his own coat of arms. He did not bring any of the coveted [[East Indies]] spices, such as the exceedingly expensive black pepper, ginger or cloves. In his log, he wrote "there is also plenty of 'ají', which is their pepper, which is more valuable than black pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome".&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 2004, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The word "ají" is still used in South American Spanish for chili peppers.

[[Columbus's letter on the first voyage]] to the royal court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction: "Hispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold. ... There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other metals..."&lt;ref name="Zinn 2009 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780061989834|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Papal decree====
{{further information|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
After Columbus's return, [[Pope Alexander VI]] [[Inter caetera|issued a bull]] which divided the "newly discovered" lands outside Europe between [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portugal]] along a north–south meridian 958 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the coast of Africa in the mid-Atlantic), thus granting Spain all land discovered by Columbus. This division was never accepted by the rulers of [[Kingdom of England|England]] or [[Kingdom of France|France]]. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that followed the papal decree.)

===Second voyage===
[[File:Columbus second voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Columbus's second voyage]]
Before he left Spain on his second voyage, Columbus had been directed by Ferdinand and Isabella to maintain friendly, even loving, relations with the natives.{{cn|date= June 2018}} He set sail from [[Cádiz]], Spain, on September 24, 1493.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christopher-columbus.eu/voyage-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The fleet for the second voyage was much larger: two [[Carrack|naos]] and 15 [[Caravel|caravels]]. The two naos were the flagship ''Marigalante''&lt;ref&gt;lit. "Gallant Mary", officially known as the ''Santa María'' after the ship lost on the first voyage and also known as ''Capitana'' ("Flagship") for its role in the expedition. It was owned by Antonio Torres, brother of the nurse to [[John, Prince of Asturias|Don Juan]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Gallega''; the caravels were the ''Fraila'',&lt;ref&gt;lit. "The Nun".&lt;/ref&gt; ''San Juan'', ''Colina'',&lt;ref&gt;lit. "The Hill", but named for its owner Bartolomé Colin and also called ''la carabela de Bartolomé Colin''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gallarda'',&lt;ref&gt;lit. "The Gallant", but named for its owner Juan Gallardo and also called ''la carabela de Juan Gallardo''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gutierre'',&lt;ref&gt;Named for its owner Alfonso Gutiérrez and also called ''la carabela de Alfonso Gutiérrez''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bonial'',&lt;ref&gt;Or the ''Bonuela''. Named for its owner Antón Boniel and also called ''la carabela de Antón Boniel''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rodriga'',&lt;ref&gt;Named for its owner Rodrigo Muñoz or Rodrigo Martínez.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Triana'',&lt;ref&gt;Named for its owner Juan de Triana and also called ''la carabela de Juan de Triana''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vieja'',&lt;ref&gt;lit. "The Old"&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prieta'',&lt;ref&gt;lit."The Brown", but named for its owner Juan Fernández Prieto and also called ''la carabela de Juan Fernández Prieto''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gorda'',&lt;ref&gt;lit. "The Fat".&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cardera'',&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes given as ''Caldera'' ("The Cauldron"), but named for its captain Juan Rodriguez Cardero.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Quintera''.&lt;ref&gt;M.ª Montserrat León Guerrero. "[http://www.americanistas.es/biblo/textos/cu03/cu03-03.pdf ''Pasajeros del Segundo Viaje de Cristóbal Colón''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513015327/http://www.americanistas.es/biblo/textos/cu03/cu03-03.pdf |date=2013-05-13 }}" ["Passengers of the Second Voyage of Christopher Columbus"]. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Niña'' returned for this expedition, which also included a ship named ''Pinta'' probably identical to that from the first expedition. In addition, the expedition saw the construction of the first ship in the Americas, the ''Santa Cruz'' or ''India''.&lt;ref name="ships"&gt;Pickering, Keith A. "[http://www.columbusnavigation.com/ships.shtml Columbus's Ships]". 1997. Accessed 21 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caribbean exploration====
On November 3, 1493, Christopher Columbus landed on a rugged shore on an island that he named [[Dominica]]. On the same day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa María la Galante. After sailing past Les Saintes (Todos los Santos), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] (Santa María de Guadalupe), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493. The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming many islands including Santa María de Montserrat ([[Montserrat]]), Santa María la Antigua ([[Antigua]]), Santa María la Redonda ([[Saint Martin]]), and Santa Cruz ([[Saint Croix]]). He also sighted and named the island chain of the Santa Úrsula y las Once Mil Vírgenes (the [[Virgin Islands]]), and named the islands of Virgen Gorda. He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed on the island of San Juan Bautista, present day [[Puerto Rico]], on November 19, 1493. His men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.&lt;ref&gt;Philips and Philips, The Worlds of Christopher Columbus&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hispaniola and Jamaica====
On November 22, he returned to Hispaniola, where he found his men at [[La Navidad]] had fallen into dispute with natives in the interior and had been killed, but he did not accuse Chief [[Guacanagari]], his ally, of any wrongdoing. Another Chief, named Caonabo in [[Jaragua, Hispaniola|Jaragua]], was charged. Columbus established a new settlement at [[La Isabela]], on the north coast of Hispaniola, where gold had first been found, but it was a poor location and the settlement was short-lived. He spent some time exploring the interior of the island for gold. Finding some, he established a small fort in the interior.

He left Hispaniola on April 24, 1494, and arrived at the island of Juana ([[Cuba]]) (which he had discovered and named during his first voyage) on April 30 and [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica]] on May 5. He explored the south coast of Juana, which he believed to be a peninsula of [[China]] rather than an island, and several nearby islands including La Evangelista (the [[Isle of Youth]]), before returning to Hispaniola on August 20. After staying for a time on the western end of present-day [[Haiti]] he finally returned to Spain.

====Slavery, settlers, and tribute====
During the second voyage,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Columbus sent a letter to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas' people, specifically from the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] tribe, on the grounds of their independence-minded aggressiveness and their status as enemies of the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] tribe. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and took 1,600 people from the [[Arawak]] tribe who were then taken by the Carib as captives and slaves. No room was available for about 400 of the kidnapped Arawak leading to their release. The long-term consequence for the Arawaks of contact with Europeans was that thousands of people{{dubious|date=October 2016}}  were almost entirely exterminated by disease, infighting and economic despair.&lt;ref&gt;Montague, Peter. "Celebrating Columbus Day". ''Ecologist''. Dec. 1999: 468–470. ''SIRS Issues Researcher''. Web. 22 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The many voyages of discovery did not pay for themselves, and there was no funding for pure science in the [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Columbus had planned for Queen Isabella to set up trading posts with the cities of the Far East made famous by [[Marco Polo]], but whose Silk Road and eastern maritime routes had been blockaded to her crown's trade. Of course, Columbus would never find [[Cathay]] ([[China]]) or [[Zipangu]] ([[Japan]]), and there was no longer any Great [[Khan (title)|Khan]] for trade treaties.

[[Slavery]] was practiced widely at that time amongst many peoples of the world, including some Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} For the Portuguese—from whom Columbus received most of his maritime training—the profits from enslaving people had resulted in the first "financial return" on a 75-year [[investment]] in [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Columbus enslaved five hundred and sixty people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boundless.com/world-history/textbooks/boundless-world-history-i-ancient-1600-textbook/early-modern-europe-12/the-age-of-discovery-57/spanish-exploration-and-the-voyages-of-christopher-columbus-217-13333/&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves were shipped to Spain; 200 died during the route back to Spain, and half of the remainder were ill when they arrived. After legal proceedings in the ''Cortes'', some survivors were ordered released and to be returned to their ''las Americas'' homeland, whereas others were used by Queen Isabella as galley slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Columbus, desperate to repay his investors, failed to realize that Isabella and Ferdinand did not plan to follow or allow Portuguese slavery policy{{which|date=May 2013}} in this respect. Rounding up the slaves led to the first major battle between the Spanish and the native peoples in their homeland, called by Europeans "the [[New World]]".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Columbus was eager to pay back dividends to those who had invested in his promise to fill his ships with gold. And since so many of the slaves died in captivity, he developed a plan while in the Province of Cicao on Hispaniola. Columbus imposed a tribute system, similar to that of the still-unknown [[Aztec#Tribute and trade|Aztec Empire tribute]] on the mainland.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}} All Cicaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months. Upon their doing so, they would receive copper tokens that they wore around their necks. Any Indian found without a copper token had their hands cut off and subsequently bled to death.&lt;ref name="Zinn 2009 3"/&gt; Since there were no gold mines on the island, the Indians had no chance of meeting Columbus' quota and thousands are reported to have committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Koning, Hans. Columbus, His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976: 83-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite or because of such extreme enforcement, Columbus did not obtain much gold, and many new foreign "settlers" were unhappy with the climate and disillusioned about their chances of getting rich quickly. A classic [[gold rush]] had been set off that would have tragic consequences for the [[Caribbean]]'s indigenous people and cultures. Anthropologists have shown there was more intermarriage and assimilation than previously believed (see the [[Black Legend]]).{{Citation needed|reason=9 May 2010|date=May 2010}} Columbus allowed settlers to return to their homeland with any Indian women with whom they had started families, or to Queen Isabella's fury, had kidnapped and owned as slaves.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}}

===Third voyage===
[[File:Columbus third voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Third voyage]]

====Exploration====
[[File:AndalusAndMorocco.png|275|thumb|Location of [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], the starting point for Columbus's third journey.]]
According to the abstract of Columbus's journal made by [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that King John II of Portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. King John reportedly knew of the existence of such a mainland because "canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morison|first=Samuel Eliot|title=Journals &amp; Other Documents on the Life &amp; Voyages of Christopher Columbus|year=1963|publisher=The Heritage Press|location=New York|pages=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thacher|first=John Boyd|title=Christopher Columbus: his life, his work, his remains, as revealed by original printed and manuscript records, together with an essay on Peter Martyr of Anghera and Bartolomé De Las Casas, the first Historians of America.|year=1903|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|location=New York|pages=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 1498, Columbus left the port of [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar]], Spain with a fleet of six ships,&lt;ref name="ships"/&gt; sending three directly to the [[West Indies]] while leading the other three: the ''Santa María de Guía'', the ''Vaqueños'', and the ''Correo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[El Rincón del Vago]] |url=http://html.rincondelvago.com/cristobal-colon_5.html |title=Columbus's Third Voyage|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{ndash}} to the Portuguese [[Porto Santo Island]], his wife's native homeland. He then sailed to the island of [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain João Gonçalves da Câmara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]]. The ships found King John's hypothesized continent, which is [[South America]], when they sighted the land of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July approaching from the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph 1838, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered [[Columbus Channel|Dragon's Mouth]], anchoring near [[Soldado Rock]] where they made contact with a group of native [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] in canoes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph 1838, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus then landed on Trinidad at [[Icacos Point]] (which he named ''Punta de Arenal'') on 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph 1838, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 4 through August 12, 1498, he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates Trinidad from mainland [[Venezuela]]. He then explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco]] River. He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named islands Bella Forma ([[Tobago]]) and Concepcion ([[Grenada]]). He described the new lands as belonging to a previously unknown new continent, but he pictured it hanging from China, bulging out to make the earth pear-shaped.{{dubious|reason=He never thought to have discovered a new continent AFAIK; the ludicrous "pear-shaped" claim would contradict his belief in a spherical Earth on which he based his travel distance calculations|date=August 2012}}

===Governorship issues===

====Governor Bobadilla====
During Columbus's term as Viceroy and [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]], he had been accused of governing tyrannically, called "the tyrant of the Caribbean".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the [[Cortes Generales]] of Castile to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.

The Cortes appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given complete control as governor from 1500 until he was killed in a hurricane in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla immediately received many serious complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomé, and Diego. The testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers—had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]]. It contained an account of Columbus's seven-year reign as the first [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]] Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian, states: "Even those who loved him [Columbus] had to admit the atrocities that had taken place."&lt;ref name=newspaper1&gt;{{cite news |author=Giles Tremlett |title=Lost document reveals Columbus as tyrant of the Caribbean |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/07/books.spain | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=2006-08-07 | accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobadilla's 48-page report—derived from the testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers—had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]]. It contained an account of Columbus's seven-year reign as the first [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these testimonies and without being allowed a word in his own defense, Columbus upon his return, had manacles placed on his wrists and chains placed on his ankles and was cast into prison to await return to Spain. He was 49 years old.

====Arrest of Governor Columbus====
Columbus was arrested in 1500 and supplanted from his posts. A number of returned settlers and friars lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him of mismanagement. [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] arrived on August 23, 1500 and detained Columbus and his brothers and had them shipped home. On October 1, 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spanish Aragon. Once in [[Cádiz]], a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...

I beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus Before the Queen''&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843 ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art]])]]
Columbus and his brothers were jailed for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered them released. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]] was to be the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].

Although he regained his freedom, he did not regain his prestige and lost all his titles including the governorship. As an added insult, the Portuguese had won the race to the [[East Indies]]: [[Vasco da Gama]] returned in September 1499 from a trip to India, having sailed east around Africa.

===Fourth voyage===
[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Columbus's fourth voyage]]

On March 14, 1502 Columbus made a fourth voyage with strict orders from the king and queen which instructed him not to stop at Hispaniola, but only to search for a westward passage to the [[Indian Ocean]] mainland. Accompanied by his stepbrother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]], Diego Mendez, and his son [[Fernando Colón|Fernando]], he left [[Cádiz]], Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, ''Capitana'', as well as the ''Gallega'', ''Vizcaína,'' and ''Santiago de Palos''. He sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue the Portuguese soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (Martinica). A [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Jaina River]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including Francisco de Bobadilla, who had sent Columbus back to Spain in chains two years earlier.

After a brief stop at Jamaica, he sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at Guanaja (Isla de Pinos) in the [[Islas de la Bahía department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on July 30, 1502. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as "long as a galley" and was filled with cargo. On August 14, 1502, he landed on the mainland of the Americas at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]], before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on October 16, 1502.

In Panamá, he learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean. After some exploration, he established a garrison at the mouth of [[Belén River]] in January 1503.

By April 6, the garrison he had established captured the local leader [[El Quibían]], who had demanded they not go down{{dubious|date=January 2016}} the Belén River. El Quibían escaped, and returned with an army to attack and repel the Spanish, damaging some of the ships so that one vessel had to be abandoned. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, but sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel any farther, the ships were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on June 25, 1503.

For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The island's governor, [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus mesmerized the natives by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for February 29, 1504, using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653–654. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Help finally arrived, from the governor, on June 29, 1504, and Columbus and his men arrived in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Castile, on November 7, 1504. Columbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, at around the age of 54, probably of the effects of chronic [[reactive arthritis]] perhaps acquired secondarily to food poisoning.

===Aftermath===
After his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the allegations against Columbus and his tyrannical governorship were initiated by the [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] during these lengthy court cases, known as the ''[[Pleitos Colombinos]]''. The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512 lasting until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Mark McDonald (2005). ''Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488–1539)''.

==Legacy==
The success of Columbus's first voyage touched off a series of westward explorations by European seafaring states. These states sought to exploit the New World's riches; build trade networks and colonies; and built the [[Indian reductions]] (settlements) to relocate, use the labor of, and attempt Christian conversions of the native people.

With the [[Age of Discovery]] starting in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the [[Americas]]. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]], thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, but none of the New World.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast majority of the continents of the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands|Islands of the Pacific Ocean]]. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} when the Portuguese navigator [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.

Columbus and other Iberian explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries&amp;mdash;unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castillo ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought in the form of abundant gold. In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of Spanish conquistadors, with large armies of indigenous groups, managed to conquer these states. The most notable amongst the conquered states were the [[Aztec Empire]] in modern [[Mexico]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered in 1521]]) and the [[Inca Empire]] in modern [[Peru]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered in 1532]]). During this time, pandemics of European disease such as smallpox devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

A '''wildlife garden''' (or '''wild garden''')  is an environment created by a gardener that serves as a sustainable haven for surrounding wildlife. Wildlife gardens contain a variety of habitats that cater to native and local [[plants]], [[birds]], [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], [[insects]], [[mammals]] and so on. Establishing a garden that emulates the environment before the residence was built, and/or renders the garden similar to intact wild areas nearby, will allow natural systems to interact and establish an [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], ultimately minimizing the need for gardener maintenance and intervention. Wildlife gardens can also play an essential role in [[biological pest control]], and also promote [[biodiversity]], native plantings, and generally benefit the wider environment.

==Habitats==
Building a successful garden suitable for local wildlife is best accomplished through the use of multiple three-dimensional habitats with diverse structures that provide places for animals to nest and hide. Wildlife gardens may contain a range of habitats, including: 
 
'''Log piles''' – Preferably located in a shady area, a pile of logs is a sanctuary for insects and other invertebrates, as well as reptiles and amphibians. The organic structure is a shelter for both protection and breeding. In addition to logs, garden debris may also be added around the garden to be used as a natural [[mulch]], [[fertilizer]], [[weed control]], [[soil amendment]], and habitat for arthropod predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallamy|first= Douglas|date= 2007|title= Bringing Nature Home|url= |location= Portland, Oregon|publisher= Timber Press|page= 131|isbn= 978-0-88192-992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Bird feeding stations and bird houses''' – A place for birds to eat and take shelter will increase the number of birds in the garden, which play a key role in biological pest control. Not only will food and shelter increase the survival rate of birds, but it will also ensure that they are healthy enough for a successful breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbowt.org.uk/wildlife/gardening-wildlife|title= Gardening for Wildlife|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2016|website= www.bbowt.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
'''Bug boxes and bee hotels''' – Bundles of hollow stems (elderberry, Joe-Pye weed, bamboo) can be hung up as an alternate place of shelter and breeding for beneficial insects, such as the [[Mason bee]], which are valuable pollinators.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://xerces.org/2017/03/17/bring-back-the-pollinators-5-ways-to-increase-nesting-habitat-for-native-bees|title= Bring Back the Pollinators|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.xerces.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sources of water''' – A water feature, such as a pond, has the potential to support a large biodiversity of wildlife. To maximize the amount of wildlife attracted to the water feature, it should consist of ranging depths. Shallow areas are used by birds to drink and by insects and amphibians to lay eggs. Deeper areas provide habitat for aquatic insects and a place for amphibians, or even fish to swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbowt.org.uk/wildlife/wildlife-advice/wild-info-ponds/how-build-pond-wildlife|title= How to build a pond for wildlife|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.bbowt.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
'''Pollinators''' – Flowers rich in nectar will attract bees and butterflies into the garden, which is of particular importance given the dramatic reduction in pollinator populations in the US, Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://xerces.org/bringbackthepollinators|title= Bring Back the Pollinators Campaign|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.xerces.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildflower meadows are an alternative option for lawns in the garden and will serve as a sanctuary for pollinators. However, pollinating plants should not be confused with plants suitable for butterfly breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallamy|first= Douglas|date= 2007|title= Bringing Nature Home|url= |location= Portland, Oregon|publisher= Timber Press|page= 111|isbn= 978-0-88192-992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Plant diversity''' – The garden should include a range of plant types to act as different habitats. A balance between ground cover, shrub, understory, and canopy species will allow different sized wildlife shelters that fit their individual needs. It is particularly important to use species that are native to the area or state, as native plants will reliably attract more insects and other invertebrates than foreign (non-native) plants; the increased number and variety of insects are valuable for their own sake and as an attraction for birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.audubon.org/plantsforbirds|title= Plants for Birds|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.audubon.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice of plants==
Although some exotics may also be included, as discussed in the previous section, wild gardens usually mostly feature a variety of native species. Generally, these will be a part of the pre-existing natural ecology of an area, making them easier to grow than most exotic species. Choosing [[native plants]] comes with an array of benefits for both plant and animal diversity, especially the ability to support native insect and fungal populations.
 
[[Ornamental plants]] on the market tend to lean toward “pest-free” plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallamy|first= Douglas|date= 2007|title= Bringing Nature Home|url= |location= Portland, Oregon|publisher= Timber Press|page= 50|isbn= 978-0-88192-992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it hard for native insects to adapt, and ultimately reducing their food supply. Decreases in insect populations due to excessive ornamental planting will discourage bird populations from inhabiting the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.audubon.org/plantsforbirds|title= Plants for Birds|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.audubon.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Invasive species]] can always prove problematic in the garden due to the absence of natural predators and their ability to reproduce rapidly. Without any measures of control, invasive species can easily overtake native species in the garden. Addressing invasive plants can be done a variety of ways; however, to ensure the least amount of damage to the surrounding ecosystem, this is best done by cutting down the plant, followed by painting its stem with an herbicide, such as [[Glyphosate|Roundup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallamy|first= Douglas|date= 2007|title= Bringing Nature Home|url= |location= Portland, Oregon|publisher= Timber Press|page= 140|isbn= 978-0-88192-992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris from the invasive species can be piled and used as a home for smaller critters. In Australia, it has been found that invasive species such as Lantana (''[[Lantana camara]]'') can also provide refuge for bird species such as the [[superb fairywren]] (''Malurus cyaneus'') and [[silvereye]] (''Zosterops lateralis''), in the absence of native plant equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archibald|first=Carla L.|last2=McKinney|first2=Matthew|last3=Mustin|first3=Karen|last4=Shanahan|first4=Danielle F.|last5=Possingham|first5=Hugh P.|date=2017-06-01|title=Assessing the impact of revegetation and weed control on urban sensitive bird species|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2960/abstract|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=7|issue=12|pages=4200–4208|doi=10.1002/ece3.2960|issn=2045-7758}}&lt;/ref&gt; Careful thought about how to balance invasive species management with what is best for urban biodiversity is needed for the best outcome in your garden.

== In the Netherlands ==
Wildlife gardens in the Netherlands are called "heemtuinen". The first was created in 1925: [[Thijsse's Hof]] (Garden of Thijsse) in [[Bloemendaal]], near [[Haarlem]]. It was gifted to [[Jac. P. Thijsse]] on the occasion of his 60th anniversary, and still exists today. The garden gives a display of about 800 plants native to the dune region of South [[Kennemerland]], in which the garden is situated. It is said to be one of the oldest wildlife gardens of its sort in the world.

Nowadays some 25 wildlife gardens exist in the Netherlands.
