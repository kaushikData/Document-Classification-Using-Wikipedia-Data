{{main article|Easterners (Korean political faction)}}
The '''rebellion of [[Jeong Yeo-rip]] in 1589''', known in Korean as the '''''Gichuk oksa''''' (기축옥사, 己丑獄事), was one of the bloodiest political purges in Korea's [[Joseon Dynasty]].  Its scale was greater than [[Korean Literati Purges|all four of the notorious literati purges]] combined.  At that time Joseon politics was dominated by conflict between Eastern and Western factions.  [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar and Easterner Jeong Yeo-rip was accused of high treason, after which as many as 1,000 Easterners were killed or exiled.  (''Oksa'' means a major case involving high treason in Korean, and there were several events named oksa during the Joseon period.)

There is still much dispute about the Treason Case of 1589 because there is a wealth of conflicting historical accounts written by both factions.  In the [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], the official royal record of the Joseon Dynasty, the Seonjo Annals were written by the Easterners (who held power in [[Gwanghaegun]]'s reign during which it was written) while the Revised Seonjo Annals were written by the Westerners who later seized power with a coup d'état that placed [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] on throne.  In "Yeonryeoshil Records", unofficial history compiled by Yi Geung-don much later, Yi included accounts of the both sides and marked them in different colors to identify them as such.

==Sarim's division==
During [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]]'s reign, the [[Sarim]] scholars following the [[Kim Jong-jik]]'s school of Neo-Confucianism seized power after [[Korean Literati Purges|long period of perseuction and purges]].  However, generational difference soon emerged within the Sarim faction - older generation who entered politics during predecessor [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]]'s reign and younger generation who became officials during Seonjo's time.  Their difference was reflected in their attitude toward Shim Eui-gyeom, Myeongjong's brother-in-law.  The Sarim tended to regard the king's maternal relatives as corrupting influence on the court and best to be excluded from politics.  But  older generation, which came to be called the Westerners because Shim's house was on the west of the palace, supported Shim for being [[Yi Hwang]]'s disciple and protecting them from yet another purge of Sarim that had been planned by his uncle. However, younger generation, called Esterners because its leader Kim Hyo-won's house was on the east of the palace, regarded Shim and older Sarim officials partly responsible for excesses of Myeongjong's reign, which was notorious for corruption and abuse of Yoon Won-hyeong, Myeong's maternal uncle. Philosophically, Easterners tended to be followers of Yi Hwang and Jo Shik while the Westerners followed [[Yi I]] and Seong Hun.

This division was soon brought to conflict, however, mainly because of personal grudge between Shim and Kim.  When a key position in Ministry of Personnel became vacant and Kim was recommended by the predecessor, Shim opposed Kim's appointment claiming that Kim was Yoon Wong-hyeong's hanger-on.  There could be no greater insult to a Sarim scholar.  Kim, who was nevertheless appointed to the position, later opposed Shim's younger brother being appointed to the same position as his successor.  
Yi I attempted to prevent the factional split by appointing Shim Eui-gyeom and Kim Hyo-won to provincial posts away from the court and tried to arrange truce between Easterner Yi Bal and Westerner [[Jeong Cheol]]. After Yi I's death, however, the conflict between two factions became more intense as the Easterners impeached Shim Eui-gyeom, leading to his dismissal, and gained upper hand.

==Jeong Yeo-rip's "revolt"==
As the Easterners began to take key positions, Jeong Yeo-rip changed his affiliation from the Western to Eastern faction and criticized his teacher Yi I after his death, earning hatred and contempt of the Westerners as well as Seonjo, who greatly respected Yi I.  Jeong left the court and went back to his hometown where he formed a private society with his supporters.  Called Great Common Society (대동계), anyone could join the society regardless of one's social status or gender, and they met each month to socialize together as well as study and also undergo military training.  It was not a secret society as it helped defeat the Japanese marauders at the local government's request in one occasion.  The society spread throughout [[Honam]] region (today's [[Jeolla]]) and even beyond.  One day a government official in [[Hwanghae]] province reported to King Seonjo that there was conspiracy for rebellion in his areas and that their leader was Jeong Yeo-rip.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]], October 2, 1589&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still a great deal of dispute whether Jeong was conspiring to rebel or whether it was a  frame up concocted by the Westerners.  There is also a dispute about the nature and purpose of Great Common Society.  Jeong supposedly said, "the world is something to be shared and therefore there cannot be one master."  He argued that the world belonged to the people, and whoever chosen by them was the king.  Jeong's philosophy reflected a desire for classless society, opposition to hereditary monarchy, and possibly even republicanism.  Such revolutionary ideas and presence of armed supporters could not help but attract attention of his enemies.  For a long time in Korean history, Jeong Yeo-rip's rebellion has been accepted as a fact even by the Easterners, but some historians note that there was no evidence except confessions from tortured followers and letters and writings discovered in his house, which could have been forged.

What is undisputed is that Jeong Yeo-rip's supposed rebellion led to a widespread purge of countless Easterners who had nothing to do with Jeong and died terrible deaths as a result.   [[Jeong Cheol]], head of the Western faction and a famous poet whose poems are still studied in Korean schools, was in charge of investigating the case and used the case to purge Easterners who had slightest connection with Jeong Yeo-rip.  It was said that even a man who shed tears because dust entered his eyes (when Jeong Yeo-rip's body was mutilated after his suicide) was killed for suspected sympahty for Jeong Yeo-rip.

==Song Yik-pil and Ahn Family==
According to some accounts, the origin of Treason Case of 1589 goes back to the [[Korean Literati Purges#Third Literati Purge of 1519|Third Literati Purge of 1519]] during [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]]'s reign and the resulting grudge between two families.  After Sarim's head [[Jo Gwang-jo]] was executed on framed charges in 1519, Right State Councillor Ahn Dang was dismissed for supporting Jo and his followers, among whom were his sons.  In 1521, Song Saryeon, Ahn’s family slave who rose to become a government official of senior fifth rank under Ahn Dang’s patronage, reported to [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] that Ahn Dang’s son was conspiring to kill Chief State Councillor Nam Gon and Shim Jeong, instigators of the Third Literati Purge of 1519.  He presented a guest list for funeral of Ahn’s wife as the evidence of conspirators’ meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, October 11, 1521&lt;/ref&gt;  At least a dozen Sarim scholars including Ahn Dang and his family were killed in this event, called False Treason Case of 1521 (''Shinsa muok''·신사무옥), and Song Saryeon was rewarded with promotion to high rank and Ahn family’s entire possession.

One of his sons was Song Yik-pil, who became a scholar of such renown that he formed friendship with Yi I and leading Westerners who praised that his achievement was enough to cover his father’s crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, October 1, 1586&lt;/ref&gt;  It is remarkable indeed that Song Yik-pil overcame the fact that his father not only betrayed his master and benefactor, which would be considered one of the worst sins in Confucian world, but caused one of purges against the Sarim scholars, especially Jo Gwang-jo’s supporters.  By Seonjo’s reign, the Sarim faction took control of the government and Jo Gwang-jo and Ahn family were fully rehabilitated as their martyrs.

However, some hardline Easterners saw Song Yik-pil as the mastermind behind the Westerners and instigated the descendants of Ahn Dang to seek justice and punishment for Song Saryeon, who was then deceased after enjoying thirty years of power and wealth.  After an reinvestigation in 1586, it was determined that Ahn Dang and others were falsely accused by Song Saryoen and  over 70 family members of Song Saryeon including Song Yik-pil were enslaved and given to Ahn family as compensation.  Facing certain revenge from aggrieved Ahn family, the Song family scattered and became fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, October 1, 1586&lt;/ref&gt;  Song Yik-pil, who turned from a respected scholar to fugitive slave overnight, hid himself by secretly staying with leaders of the Westerners such as [[Jeong Cheol]], his disciple and famous scholar Kim Jang-saeng, and even an Easterner like Yi San-hae. According to some accounts, it was while Song Yik-pil was in [[Hwanghae]] area that the accusation of treason was made against Jeong Yeo-rip, who lived in [[Honam]].  During the whole period when Jeong Cheol was in charge of investigating the treason case and interrogated the Easterners, Song Yik-pil was said to be staying with Jeong Cheol.

==Purge of Easterners==
When the accusation against Jeong Yeo-rip was first made, the Easterners held key positions and were in charge of investigating the case.  The Easterners told Seonjo that Jeong Yeo-rip could not possibly be plotting a rebellion when Jeong unexpectedly committed suicide, which was considered the admission of guilt.  The Westerners accused the Easterners of being half-hearted in pursuing the case, and Seonjo promoted hardline Westerner Jeong Cheol as Right State Councillor and put him in charge of investigation despite Jeong Cheol's initial refusal.  Soon afterward, Jeong Yeo-rip's nephew began to mention names of the Easterners including Left State Councillor Jeong Eon Shin, hardliner Yi Bal, and many others (It was customary to use to torture when interrogating prisoners).  Their denial of being close to Jeong Yeo-rip angered Seonjo since many of their letters were found in Jeong's house, some of which were critical of the king and his rule. (It was said that Jeong Eon Shin was told by his men that his letters with Jeong were destroyed, but they only destroyed ones that directly mentioned his name and not nicknames.  When Jeong Eon Shin denied exchanging letters with Jeong Yeo-rip, Seonjo angrily asked, "Does he think I have no eyes?" pointing to 19 letters in which they discussed state affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 1, 1589 (Revised Seonjo version)&lt;/ref&gt;)  Jeong Cheol asked for leniency with Jeong Eun Shin, Yi Bal, and others claiming that they could not know Jeong Yeo-rip's evil side, but the Easterners claim that Jeong Cheol sought to destroy them while appearing to try to save them on the outside.  Indeed, Yi Bal and his brother, Choe Young-gyeong (greatly respected scholar of Yeongnam School), and many others died in prison of torture or illness. (Jeong Cheol's animosity with Yi Bal was such that he even spat on him in one occasion.) Even Yi Bal's 80-year-old mother and 8-year-old son were killed (although Jeong Cheol supposedly opposed it).  The treason case went on for three years, and 1,000 people were killed or exiled. (According to some accounts, the death toll was 1,000.)

However, it was Seonjo who probably played a greater role than anyone else in turning Jeong Yeo-rip's treason case to widespread purge that it became.  Sarim's division strengthened the king's power, and the purge was focused on hardline Easterners (Jeong Yeo-rip, Yi Bal) as opposed to moderate Easterners (Yi San-hae, [[Yu Seong-ryong]]) who came out unscathed.  Hardline Easterners were the most radical of the Sarim factions.  In contrast, Yi San-hae and Yu Seong-ryong were protected by Seonjo when their names came up in the treason case.  Later Seonjo would blame Jeong Cheol for excesses of Treason Case of 1589.

==Aftermath==
The Treason Case of 1589 is significant as the moment when the conflict within Sarim faction was irrevocably marred with bad blood, becoming struggle of life and death that characterized much periods of Joseon politics.  The Eastern faction was further split between hardline Northerners and moderate Southerners over the question of punishing Jeong Cheol and other Westerners.  The Northern faction came on top and continued the cycle of revenge for earlier wrongs.  The Treason Case of 1589 is also blamed for Joseon's unpreparedness and poor showing in the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese Invasion of 1592]] three years later.  Some historians blame Treason Case of 1589 for the subsequent discrimination against [[Honam]] region as land of rebellion, whose effect is still felt today.  It is also remembered today for Jeong Yeo-rip's revolutionary ideas ahead of its time.

The '''1893 Women's Suffrage Petition''' was the second of two mass petitions to the [[New Zealand Government]] in support of [[women's suffrage]]. The 1893 petition was substantially larger than the 1891 petition and resulted in the Electoral Act of 1893 which gave women the right to vote in the [[New Zealand general election, 1893|1893 general election]]. Politicians [[John Hall (New Zealand politician)|John Hall]], [[Alfred Saunders]], and Premier [[John Ballance]] were all in favour of women's suffrage, but the effort was largely led by the [[New Zealand]] branch of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] led by [[Kate Sheppard]] from 1887.

The '''''Altes Museum''''' ([[German language|German]] for '''Old Museum''') is a museum building on [[Museum Island]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. Since restoration work in 2010–11, it houses the ''[[Antikensammlung Berlin|Antikensammlung]]'' (antiquities collection) of the [[Berlin State Museums]].&lt;ref name="museumsinsel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsinsel-berlin.de/index.php?lang=de&amp;page=2_1 |title=Masterplan Museumsinsel Berlin 2015 - Übersicht Häuser |publisher=Museumsinsel-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum building was built between 1823 and 1830 by the architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] in the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style to house the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] royal family's art collection. The historic, protected building counts among the most distinguished in neoclassicism and is a high point of Schinkel's career.&lt;ref name="smb standorte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.museum/smb/standorte/index.php?lang=en&amp;p=2&amp;objID=24&amp;n=2 |title=Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Museums |publisher=Smb.museum |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1845, it was called the ''Königliches Museum'' (Royal Museum). Along with the other museums and historic buildings on Museum Island, the Altes Museum was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/896 |title=Museumsinsel (Museum Island), Berlin - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=1999-12-02 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning and location ==
In the early nineteenth century, Germany's bourgeoisie had become increasingly self-aware and self-confident. This growing class began to embrace new ideas regarding the relationship between itself and art, and the concepts that art should be open to the public and that citizens should be able to have access to a comprehensive cultural education began to pervade society. King [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]] of Prussia was a strong proponent of this [[Alexander von Humboldt|humboldtian]] ideal for education and charged Karl Friedrich Schinkel with planning a public museum for the royal art collection.

Schinkel's plans for the ''Königliches Museum'', as it was then known, were also influenced by drafts of the crown prince, later King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]], who desired a building that was heavily influenced by antiquity. The crown prince even sent Schinkel a pencil sketch of a large hall adorned with a classical portico.

Schinkel's plans incorporated the ''Königliches Museum'' into an ensemble of buildings, which surround the ''[[Berliner Lustgarten]]'' (pleasure garden). The ''[[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]]'' in the south was a symbol of worldly power, the ''[[Zeughaus]]'' in the west represented military might, and the ''[[Berliner Dom]]'' in the east was the embodiment of divine authority. The museum to the north of the garden, which was to provide for the education of the people, stood as a symbol for science and art—and not least for their torchbearer: the self-aware bourgeoisie.

[[Image:Berlin Altes Museum Friedrich Thiele 1830.jpg|thumb|Altes Museum, ca. 1830]]

Schinkel had developed plans for the ''Königliches Museum'' as early as 1822/23, but construction did not begin until 1825. Construction was completed in 1828 and the museum was inaugurated on 3 August 1830.&lt;ref name="smb standorte"/&gt; Schinkel was also responsible for the renovation of the ''Berliner Dom'' in the neo-classical style (which was originally a ''[[baroque]]'' cathedral), and he exercised considerable influence on [[Peter Joseph Lenné]]'s renovation of the ''Lustgarten'', which coincided with the construction of the museum, resulting in a harmonized and integrated ensemble.

In 1841, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV announced in a royal decree, that the entire northern part of the Spree Island (now known as Museum Island) "be transformed into a sanctuary for art and science." In 1845, with the completion of the ''[[Neues Museum]]'', the "New Museum", the ''Königliches Museum'' was renamed the ''Altes Museum'', the name it holds to this day.

== History ==
[[Image:Altes Museum, vor 1854.jpg|thumb|Historical photograph of the Altes Museum, before 1854]]
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-M1204-0307, Berlin, Altes Museum, Gestürztes Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Altes Museum, 1950]]
[[File:Griechische Helme1.JPG|thumb|Types of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] helmets, [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].]]

The royally appointed commission, which was responsible for the conception of the museum, decided to display only "High Art" in the proposed building which included [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Old Master paintings]] and [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|prints and drawings]] on the upper floor, as well as [[Antikensammlung Berlin|Classical sculpture]] from ancient Greece and Rome on the ground floor. This precluded the incorporation of ethnography, prehistory and the excavated treasures of the ancient Near East from Assyria and Persia (and elsewhere); instead, these artifacts were primarily housed in [[Schloss Monbijou]].

With the completion of the ''[[Neues Museum]]'' (New Museum) by [[Friedrich August Stüler]] in 1855, Museum Island began to take form. This was followed by the ''Nationalgalerie'' (now the ''[[Alte Nationalgalerie]]'') by [[Johann Heinrich Strack]] (1876), the ''Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum'' (now the [[Bodemuseum]]) by [[Ernst von Ihne]] after plans by Stüler (1904), and the [[Pergamonmuseum]] by [[Alfred Messel]] and [[Ludwig Hoffmann (architect)|Ludwig Hoffmann]] (1930). Thus Museum Island evolved into the institution it is today.&lt;ref name="museumsinsel"/&gt;

[[Julius Carl Raschdorff]]'s 1894–1905 reconstruction of the ''Berliner Dom'' into a [[neo-Renaissance]] cathedral (replacing the classical cathedral designed by Schinkel) severely disrupted the classical ensemble, especially since the new cathedral has significantly larger dimensions than its predecessor.

During National Socialism, the Altes Museum was used as the backdrop for propaganda, both in the museum itself and upon the parade grounds of the redesigned ''Lustgarten''. Just before the end of [[Second World War]], the museum was badly damaged when a tank truck exploded in front of the museum, and the frescoes designed by Schinkel and Peter Cornelius, which adorned the vestibule and the back wall of the portico, were largely lost.&lt;ref name="smb standorte"/&gt;

Under General Director Ludwig Justi, the building was the first museum of Museum Island to undergo reconstruction and restoration, which was carried out from 1951 to 1966 by [[Hans Erich Bogatzky]] and [[Theodor Voissen]]. Following Schinkel's designs, the murals of the rotunda were restored in 1982. However, neither the ornate ceilings of the ground floor exhibition rooms nor the pairs of columns under the girders were reconstructed. The former connection to the ''Neues Museum'' has also not been rebuilt; instead, an underground passageway connecting all of the museums of Museum Island is planned as part of the ''Museumsinsel 2015'' renovations.&lt;ref name="museumsinsel"/&gt;

The Altes Museum was originally constructed to house all of the city's collections of fine arts, including Old Master paintings, and prints and drawings. However, since 1904, the museum has solely housed the ''Antikensammlung'' (Collection of Classical Antiquities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin.de/orte/museum/altes-museum/ |title=Altes Museum |publisher=Berlin.de |date=2011-11-24 |accessdate=2011-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221094253/http://www.berlin.de/orte/museum/altes-museum/ |archivedate=2011-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, the Collection of Classical Antiquities has displayed its Greek collection, including the treasury, on the ground floor of the Altes Museum.&lt;ref name="smb standorte"/&gt;  Special exhibitions are displayed on the second floor of the museum.

==Production==
Though [[Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini]] had directed documentaries before, ''American Splendor'' was their first narrative feature. Of the film's alternating of fictional portrayals with real-life appearances by Pekar and his friends and family, co-writer/co-director Pulcini recalled, "It really was the only way that made sense to tell that story because we were handed this stack of comic strips where the main character never really looks the same because he’s drawn by so many different artists. We wondered how to stay true to the material, and that’s the concept we came up with. The structure came out of that very naturally. It wasn’t something that we labored over."&lt;ref name="creativescreenwriting"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berman added that upon meeting Pekar they felt compelled to include him in the film. "We also got to know Harvey even before we wrote the screenplay. We actually went to Cleveland and spent time with Harvey and Joyce, and spoke to them on the phone a lot. Once we spent some time with both of them, we were like, “Oh my God, we have to put them in the movie!” That was a case where we were still using our documentary instincts and had to figure out a way to include him in it that was a natural fit for the material."&lt;ref name="creativescreenwriting"/&gt; At one point, Pekar meta-references the structure of the film by doing a voice-over for a one-shot of Paul Giamatti playing him by saying "There's our guy. Well, it's me. Or the guy playing me. Though he don't look nothing like me, but whatever." [[David Letterman]] refused to appear in the film or allow the filmmakers to use footage of Pekar's disastrous final appearance on this show (though he had no problems with the earlier Pekar "Late Night" appearances that are shown), so that final appearance was done using oblique camera angles and a voiced-over audio of the incident.

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 94% approval rating, based on 185 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Exhilarating both stylistically and for its entertaining, moving portrayal of an everyman, ''American Splendor'' is a portrait of a true underground original."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|american_splendor|American Splendor}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 42 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim."&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|american-splendor|American Splendor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Splendor'' won the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Film at the [[2003 Sundance Film Festival]], in addition to the award for Best Adapted Screenplay from the [[Writers Guild of America]]. At the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]], the film received the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI]] critics award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Columnist Jaime Wolf wrote a laudatory review of the film in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', also drawing attention to formal parallels with [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and other Allen films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''''Annales Sancti Quintini Viromandensis''''' (Annals of Saint Quentin of Vermandois) are a set of [[annals]] originally composed in [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] at the [[Basilica of Saint-Quentin|Abbey of Saint-Quentin]] in the [[County of Vermandois]], and found in manuscript 645 of the [[Vatican Library]]. It covers the years 793–994 and was written by five different hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[August Molinier]], "1113. Annales S. Quintini Viromandensis", ''Les Sources de l'histoire de France: Des origines aux guerres d'Italie (1494)'', '''2''', 1 (1902), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican 645 contains a copy of [[Bede]]'s [[Easter table]] based on the [[Metonic cycle]] down to the year 1025. In the margins one hand has added the names of the [[Roman emperor]]s down to [[Charlemagne]] (800–14). Another hand of the ninth century added two brief notices for the years 793 and 844. In the eleventh century, four more monks added notices in the margins of the Easter table. Most of these annals were not, therefore, contemporary. Several of the annals are cut off partially or entirely by poor subsequent bookbinding.&lt;ref&gt;Bethmann (1859), p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armed Peasant Association''' ({{lang-es|Agrupación Campesina Armada}}, short '''ACA''', less commonly '''Armed Campesino Group''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/31/paraguay-guerrillas-epp-aca|title=In Paraguay's remote north guerrillas are still at large, armed and dangerous |author= Laurence Blair |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 August 2015|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Far-left politics|leftist]] rebel group that takes part in the [[insurgency in Paraguay]]. Formed in 2014 as splinter faction of the [[Paraguayan People's Army]] (EPP) by two brothers, Albino and Alfredo Jara Larrea, ACA began to decline almost immediately after its foundation as result of repeated raids and arrests by the Paraguayan security forces. After the death of most of its members and leaders in 2016, the group became defunct. It was refounded in 2017, however, by two sisters of the Jara Larrea brothers and a former member of the "Army of Marshal López", another insurgent group.

== History ==
=== Foundation and operations under the Jara Larrea brothers ===
[[File:Bandera de la ACA.svg|250px|left|thumb|One of the alternate flags used by the group.]]

The formation of ACA was the result of dissent among the EPP. One of the rebel group's columns which was led by the Jara Larrea brothers had long harbored resentment for the EPP central leadership, allegedly because the brothers had been berated for their indiscipline, including drunkenness, partying, looting and womanizing. After the Larrea faction received a ransom of over one million [[Paraguayan guaraní]] (over $230,000) in June 2014 for a kidnapped businessman from Yby Yau, the group had enough funds to become independent. In September 2014, the Larrea brothers and their followers fully broke away from the EPP and formed the Armed Peasant Association; the group was initially believed to have around 13 members.&lt;ref name="split" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TrYi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/la-seguridad/11155.pdf|title=The Paraguayan People’s Army: A new rebel group or simple bandits?|work=[[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]]|date=February 2015|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the government, ACA modeled itself on the [[Colombia]]n [[FARC]] and wanted to become involved in the [[illegal drug trade in Paraguay]] through taxation or extortion of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] farmers; an expert from ''[[InSight Crime]]'' considered this assumption likely, as one ACA member, Rubén Darío López Fernández, was known to have close links with the First Catarinense Group, a [[Crime in Brazil|Brazilian crime group]].&lt;ref name="split" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Paraguayan-Guerrilla-and-Land-Conflict-The-Next-Colombia-20141008-0073.html|title=Paraguayan Guerrilla and Land Conflict: The Next Colombia? |work=[[Telesur (TV channel)]]|date=8 October 2014|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after ACA's foundation, however, the group was targeted by the Paraguayan security forces in course of several raids between 19 and 21 September, with around five ACA fighters killed. Having thus lost about a third of its strength, including the "key fighter" Marcos Ojeda, ACA was already seriously weakened just after its conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/paraguay-security-forces-deal-major-blow-to-dissident-guerrilla-group|title=Paraguay Security Forces Deal Major Blow to Dissident Guerrilla Group |author=Kyra Gurney |work=[[InSight Crime]]|date=22 September 2014|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quick weakening suggested that ACA lacked "the level of professionalism" and civilian support that EPP enjoyed.&lt;ref name=TrYi /&gt; ACA's decline continued afterwards, and already on 5 January 2015 the Joint Task Force managed to corner the group east of [[Concepción, Paraguay|Concepción]]. In course of the following shootout Albino Jara Larrea was killed and several other militants injured, further reducing ACA's fighting strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/does-leader-s-death-mark-demise-of-paraguay-guerrilla-group|title=Does Leader's Death Mark Demise of Paraguay Guerrilla Group? |author=James Bargent |work=[[InSight Crime]]|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30719581|title=Paraguayan rebel leader Albino Jara 'killed' |author= |work=[[BBC]]|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to replenish its numbers, ACA recruited [[Military use of children|child soldiers]]; there were also accounts that some female child soldiers married older ACA fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271262.htm|title=2017 Trafficking in Persons Report: Paraguay |author= |work=[[United States Department of State]]|date=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Albino's death, his brother Alfredo became the group's new leader.&lt;ref name="strikes" /&gt; Under his command, ACA apparently began to work closely with the EPP, leading experts to consider the possibility that ACA, weakened by their many losses, might fully rejoin the EPP.&lt;ref name="fold"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/paraguay-guerrilla-splinter-group-brought-back-into-fold|title=Paraguay Guerrilla Splinter Group Brought Back Into Fold? |author=David Gagne |work=[[InSight Crime]]|date=10 September 2015|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, however, ACA remained officially independent.&lt;ref name="strikes" /&gt; Eventually, the group managed to kidnap police sergeant Idilio Morínigo and [[Mennonite]] settler Abraham Fehr in order to hold them for ransom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Paraguayan-Guerrilla-and-Land-Conflict-The-Next-Colombia-20141008-0073.html|title=Paraguayan Guerrilla and Land Conflict: The Next Colombia? |work=[[Telesur (TV channel)]]|date=17 November 2015|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its demise continued. On 9 September, security forces captured the faction's alleged logistics chief, Daniel Rivarola Areco,&lt;ref name="fold" /&gt; and in November 2015 the Joint Task Force launched a devastating raid against ACA's headquarters at the border of the [[Concepción Department, Paraguay|Concepción]] and [[Amambay Department]]s. In course of this operation, which was later characterized by Interior Minister [[Francisco de Vargas]] as "the most successful" yet during the Paraguayan counter-insurgency campaign, most of ACA's leadership was killed: Namely Alfredo Jara Larrea, [[second-in-command]] Mariano López Velázquez (''alias'' "Fredi Romero"), and third-in-command Ovelar González (''alias'' "Beto Gimenez").&lt;ref name="strikes" /&gt;

=== Decline and revival ===
At this point, ACA had already mostly ceased to exist,&lt;ref name="strikes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/politica/por-inaccion-del-gobierno-surge-un-nuevo-grupo-armado-llamado-eml-1570452.html |title=Por inacción del Gobierno, surge un nuevo grupo armado llamado EML |work=abc |language=Spanish |date=4 March 2017 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304091209/http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/politica/por-inaccion-del-gobierno-surge-un-nuevo-grupo-armado-llamado-eml-1570452.html |archivedate=4 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but remnants of the group remained active. On 17 May 2016, the new ACA commander, Idilio Morínigo, was killed by government forces;&lt;ref name="Idilio" /&gt; this caused a dispute among his surviving followers, who could not agree how to share the 260-300 million guaraní that Morínigo had in his possession when he died. As result, one ACA fighter shot one of his comrades dead and fled with all of the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.com.py:80/nacionales/pelea-y-muerte-en-la-aca-por-g-300-millones-1481458.html |title=Pelea dentro de la ACA por unos G. 300 millones |work=abc |language=Spanish |date=19 May 2016 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524065519/http://www.abc.com.py:80/nacionales/pelea-y-muerte-en-la-aca-por-g-300-millones-1481458.html |archivedate=24 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, four ACA militants stormed the Silva Smith [[hacienda]] in the Concepción Department, and took the family and its employees hostage, demanding 300 million guaraní for their release. Eventually, however, the ACA fighters became nervous about a possible attack by the Joint Task Force, freed the hostages and left without further violence.&lt;ref name="Supuestos" /&gt; In March 2017, Paraguayan security forces arrested several men and women, including relatives of the deceased Jara Larrea brothers, who were suspected to be connected to the ACA or EPP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ultimahora.com/sospechosos-integrar-epp-o-aca-fueron-detenidos-ypane-n1071595.html|title=Sospechosos de integrar EPP o ACA fueron detenidos en Ypané|work=Ultima Hora|language=Spanish|date=20 March 2017|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late May, government forces arrested a man who was believed to be one of the hostage takers of the previous December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/detienen-a-supuesto-nexo-de-la-aca-1598452.html |title=Detienen a supuesto nexo de la banda ACA |work=abc |language=Spanish |date=19 May 2017 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529185209/http://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/detienen-a-supuesto-nexo-de-la-aca-1598452.html |archivedate=29 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2017, two cousins of Albino and Alfredo Jara Larrea, namely Rodrigo and J. Argüello Larrea, disappeared in the Concepción Department. As the police investigated the area where they had last been seen, they found traces of a militant camp, suggesting that the two had been abducted. Just a few days before this incident, the [[vigilante]] self-defense group "Justicieros de la Frontera" had kidnapped the [[Sibling-in-law|sister-in-law]] of Alejandro Ramos, another Leftist rebel leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ultimahora.com/hermanos-argello-larrea-desaparecen-arroyito-n1098201.html|title=Hermanos Argüello Larrea desaparecen en Arroyito|work=Ultima Hora|language=Spanish|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime before October 2017, the Armed Peasant Association was refounded&lt;ref name="refounded"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/judiciales-y-policiales/libro-de-novedades-del-eml-revela-que-la-gavilla-aca-fue-refundada-1726348.html |title=Libro de novedades del EML revela que la gavilla ACA fue refundada |work=abc |language=Spanish |date=31 July 2018 |accessdate=26 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Feliciano Bernal Maíz, a Leftist militant who had been expelled by the "Army of Marshal López" insurgent group, and two sisters of Albino and Alfredo Jara Larrea, namely Zulma and Emiliana Jara Larrea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/judiciales-y-policiales/grupo-criminal-se-jacta-de-tener-el-apoyo-de-la-poblacion-de-arroyito-1726674.html |title=Grupo criminal se jacta de tener el apoyo de la población de Arroyito |work=abc |language=Spanish |date=1 August 2018 |accessdate=26 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known action of the new Armed Peasant Association was a raid on the "La Novia" ranch on 10 October 2017. The group's members, of unknown number, operate as part-time insurgents, stealing and [[Extortion|extorting]] farms during periodic raids and then returning to civilian life.&lt;ref name="refounded"/&gt;

'''''Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc''''', [1998] 1 S.C.R. 591, was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in which the claimant, Pascale Claude Aubry, brought an action against Éditions Vice-Versa for publishing a photo taken of her in public. She claimed the photographing was a violation of her right to [[privacy]] under the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]].  The Court held that under Quebec law a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish the picture unless permission has been obtained from the subject.

The Court limited this requirement to exclude persons whose photographs were taken during an event of public interest. That is, a person of public interest or equally an unknown person who is implicated in a public matter cannot claim image rights. Consequently, anyone whose photograph was incidental to a photo of some matter will be treated as part of the background and will not be able to claim their rights were violated.

==Aftermath==
Photojournalist and photographers groups took issue with the decision, arguing that it had the potential to create a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on their profession. Justice Bastarache later referred to the case in ''[[Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem]]'' (2004), to discuss how the Quebec Charter is relevant to personal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;''Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem'', para. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The photo became part of the public domain since it was handed to the Supreme Court.

'''Bing Shopping''' (formerly '''MSN Shopping''', '''Windows Live Shopping''', '''Live Search Products''' and '''Windows Live Product Search''') is a products search and discovery service that helps save time by bringing products from multiple sellers together on a single website. It uses the power of Bing to show product results–including photos and product details. Products can be filtered and prices compared. Purchases are completed on the seller’s website.

Discontinued around October 1, 2013.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bing Shopping#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; it was relaunched in August 2017 using a paid model where merchants pay to list their products on the service using [https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ad-products/bing-shopping-campaigns Bing Ads Product Ads].

== History ==
[[Image:WLShoppingIE7.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A screenshot of Windows Live Shopping homepage]]

Windows Live Shopping was originally launched in Beta form as part of Microsoft's [[Windows Live]] suite. It was built entirely on AJAX technology and had many social and community features. In addition to a retail shopping website, it featured drag-and-drop items to a shopping list, share lists with other users, product and seller reviews, public shopping guides with ''Windows Live Shopping Guides'' and an enhanced preview.

On February 20, 2007, Windows Live Shopping beta was rebranded as MSN Shopping. Part of the reason for this decision was to reduce the number of shopping services Microsoft offered, which included [[MSN Shopping]], [[Windows Live Expo]] and [[Live Product Search]]. Microsoft's spokesperson stated that the beta testing was intended to obtain an insight into user behavior and the data would be incorporated into plans for future products. It was stated that user-created content from Windows Live Shopping beta (lists, guides, and reviews) would continue to be available on MSN Shopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2007/02/19/windows-live-shopping-no-more-msn-shopping-to-remain.aspx|title=Windows Live Shopping no more - MSN Shopping to remain|date=February 19, 2007|work=LiveSide|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222143252/http://liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2007/02/19/windows-live-shopping-no-more-msn-shopping-to-remain.aspx |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Windows Live Shopping Guides'' was discontinued as part of the rebranding.

As MSN Shopping, the service aggregated millions of product offers from thousands of retailers, allowing users to search or browse for products. Searches could be sorted by relevance, popularity or by price (either ascending or descending). Refinements were available to allow the user to narrow the results set.&lt;ref name=Direct-Marketing-MSN-Shopping&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=Lisa|title=MSN Shopping Adds Comparison Shopping.|url=http://www.dmnews.com/digital-marketing/msn-shopping-adds-comparison-shopping/article/89416/|newspaper=Direct Marketing|date=14 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PC-Magazine-MSN-Shopping&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothberg|first=Deborah|title=Testers Check Out MSN Shopping Portal Beta 2.|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1839478,00.asp|newspaper=PC Magazine|date=21 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Media-Post-MSN-Shopping&gt;{{cite news|last=Gupta|first=Shankar|title=MSN Shopping Surges 21% Thanksgiving Weekend.|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/51792/msn-shopping-surges-21-thanksgiving-weekend.html|newspaper=Media Post|date=29 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Business-Wire-MSN-Shopping&gt;{{cite news|last=Kane|first=Michelle|title=PriceGrabber.com Announces Strategic Alliance with MSN; PriceGrabber's Alliance with MSN Provides Consumers Expanded Selection on MSN Shopping.|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050613005366/en/PriceGrabber.com-Announces-Strategic-Alliance-MSN-PriceGrabbers-Alliance#.Vc21IOEVgu5|newspaper=Business Wire|date=13 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Live Search Cashback.png|thumb|A screenshot of Bing Cashback homepage]]
'''Bing Cashback''' was a [[loyalty program]] which allowed users to search for products from multiple vendors and find their prices and offering [[Rebate (marketing)|money back for purchases]] made through the site. It was originally started in June 2006 by [[Jellyfish.com]].&lt;ref name="rubber_chicken"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/28/AR2007062802053.html|publisher=Washington Post|first=Buzz|last=Worthy|title=At This Auction Site, Prices (on Chickens, iPods, Etc.)

The cashback service was officially announced as ''Live Search Cashback'' on May 22, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18417">'''CANaerospace''' is a higher layer protocol based on [[Controller Area Network]] (CAN) which has been developed by Stock Flight Systems in 1998 for aeronautical applications.

[[File:CANaerospace Logo.jpg|thumb]]

==Background==
CANaerospace supports airborne systems employing the [[Line-replaceable unit]] (LRU) concept to share data across CAN and ensures [[interoperability]] between CAN LRUs by defining CAN [[physical layer]] characteristics, network layers, communication mechanisms, data types and aeronautical axis systems. CANaerospace is an [[Open-source software|open source]] project, was initiated to standardize the interface between CAN LRUs on the system level. CANaerospace is continuously being developed further and has also been published by [[NASA]] as the [[Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments]] Databus Standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockflightsystems.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=16&amp;Itemid=45|title=NASA AGATE Data Bus Specification|publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. It found widespread use in aeronautical research worldwide. A major research aircraft that employs several CANaerospace networks for real-time computer interconnection is the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]] (SOFIA), a [[Boeing]] [[747SP]] with a 2.5m astronomic telescope. CANaerospace is also frequently used in flight simulation and connects entire aircraft cockpits (i.e. in [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] simulators) to the simulation host computers. In Italy CANaerospace is used as [[UAV]] data bus technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avionics-networking.com/av_protocols_en.html Short overview of CAN-based avionics protocols on www.avionics-networking.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, CANaerospace serves as communication network in several [[general aviation]] avionics systems.

The CANaerospace interface definition closes the gap between the [[ISO/OSI]] layer 1 and 2 CAN protocol (which is implemented in the CAN controller itself) and the specific requirements of distributed systems in aircraft. It may be used as a primary or ancillary avionics network and was designed to meet the following requirements:

*'''Democratic network:''' CANaerospace does not require any master/slave relationships between LRUs or a "bus controller", thereby avoiding a potential single source of failure. Every node in the network has the same rights for participation in the bus traffic.
*'''Self-identifying message format:''' Each CANaerospace message contains information about the type of the data and the transmitting node. This allows the data to be unambiguously recognized at each receiving node.
*'''Continuous Message Numbering:''' Each CANaerospace message contains a continuously incremented number which allows coherent processing of messages in the receiving stations.
*'''Message Status Code:''' Each CANaerospace message contains information about the integrity of the data is conveying. This allows receiving stations to evaluate the quality of the received data and to react accordingly.
*'''Emergency Event Signaling:''' CANaerospace defines a mechanism that allows each node to transmit information about exception or error situations. This information can be used by other stations to determine the network health.
*'''Node Service Interface:''' As an enhancement to CAN, CANaerospace provides a means for individual stations on the network to communicate with each other using connection-oriented and connectionless services.
*'''Predefined CAN Identifier Assignment:''' CANaerospace offers a predefined identifier assignment list for normal operation data. In addition to the predefined list, user-defined identifier assignment lists may be used.
*'''Ease of Implementation:''' The amount of code to implement CANaerospace is very little by design in order to minimize the effort for testing and certification of flight safety critical systems.
*'''Openness to Extensions:''' All CANaerospace definitions are extendable to provide flexibility for future enhancements and to allow adaptions to the requirements of specific applications.
*'''Free Availability:''' No cost whatsoever apply for the use of CANaerospace. The specification can be downloaded from the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockflightsystems.com/tl_files/downloads/canaerospace/canas_17.pdf|title=CANaerospace Specification|publisher=[[Stock Flight Systems]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical interface==
To ensure interoperability and reliable communication, CANaerospace specifies the electrical characteristics, bus transceiver requirements and data rates with the corresponding tolerances based on [[ISO 11898]]. The bit timing calculation (baud rate accuracy, sample point definition) and robustness to electromagnetic interference are given special emphasis. Also addressed are CAN connector, wiring considerations and design guidelines to maximize electromagnetic compatibility.

==Communication layers==
The [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] CAN specification itself allows messages being transmitted both periodically and aperiodically but does not cover issues like data representation, node addressing or connection-oriented protocols. CAN is entirely based on Anyone-to-Many (ATM) communication which means that CAN messages are always received by all stations in the network. The advantage of the CAN concept is inherent data consistency between all stations, the drawback is that it does not allow node addressing which is the basis for Peer-to-Peer (PTP) communication. Using CAN networks in aeronautical applications, however, demands a standard targeted to the specific requirements of airborne systems which implies that communication between individual stations in the network must be possible to enable the required degree of system monitoring. Consequently, CANaerospace defines additional [[ISO/OSI]] layer 3, 4 and 6 functions to support node addressing and unified ATM/PTP communication mechanisms. PTP communication allows to set up client/server interactions between individual stations in the network either temporarily or permanently. More than one of these interactions may be in effect at any given time and each node may be client for one operation and server for another at the same time. This CANaerospace mechanism is called "Node Service Concept" and allows i.e. to distribute system functions over several stations in the network or to control dynamic system reconfiguration in case of failure. The Node Service concept supports both connection-oriented and connectionless interactions like with [[TCP/IP]] and [[UDP/IP]] for [[Ethernet]].

Enabling both ATM and PTP communication for CAN requires the introduction of independent network layers to isolate the different types of communication. This is realized for CANaerospace by forming CAN identifier groups as shown in Figure 1. The resulting structure creates Logical Communication Channels (LCCs) and assigns a specific communication type (ATM, PTP) to each of the LCCs. User-defined LCCs provide the necessary freedom for designers and allow the implementation of CANaerospace according to the needs of specific applications.

[[File:CANaerospace 1.jpg]]
'''Figure 1: Logical Communication Channels for CANaerospace'''

As a side effect, the CAN identifier groups in Figure 1 affect the priority of the message transmission in case of bus arbitration. The communication channels are therefore arranged according to their relative importance:

*'''Emergency Event Data Channel (EED):''' This communication channel is used for messages which require immediate action (i.e. system degradation or reconfiguration) and have to be transmitted with very high priority. Emergency Event Data uses ATM communication exclusively.
*'''High/Low Priority Node Service Data Channel (NSH/NSL):''' These communication channels are used for client/server interactions using PTP communication. The corresponding services may be of the connection-oriented as well as the connectionless type. NSH/NSL may also be used to support test and maintenance functions.
*'''Normal Operation Data Channel (NOD):''' This communication channel is used for the transmission of the data which is generated during normal system operation and described in the CANaerospace identifier assignment list. These messages may be transmitted periodically or aperiodically as well as synchronously or asynchronously. All messages which cannot be assigned to other communication channels shall use this channel.
*'''High/Low Priority User-Defined Data Channel (UDH/UDL):''' This channel is dedicated to communication which cannot, due to their specific characteristics, be assigned other channels without violating the CANaerospace specification.  As long as the defined identifier range is used, the message content and the communication type (ATM, PTP) for these channels may be specified by the system designer. To ensure interoperability it is highly recommended that the use of these channels is minimized.
*'''Debug Service Data Channel (DSD):''' This channel is dedicated to messages which are used temporarily for development and test purposes only and are not transmitted during normal operation. As long as the defined identifier range is used, the message content and the communication type (ATM, PTP) for these channels may be specified by the system designer.

==Data representation==
The majority of the real-time control systems used in aeronautics employ "[[big endian]]" processor architectures. This data representation was therefore specified for CANaerospace as well. With big endian data representation, the most significant bit of any datum is arranged leftmost and transmitted first on CANaerospace as shown in Figure 2.

[[File:CANaerospace 2.jpg]]
'''Figure 2: "Big Endian" Data Representation for CANaerospace'''

CANaerospace uses a self-identifying message format which is realized by structuring the message payload as shown in Figure 3. This structure defines a 4-byte message header and a 4-byte parameter section.

[[File:CANaerospace 3.jpg]]
'''Figure 3: CANaerospace Self-Identifying Message Format'''

On first sight the use of 50% of the CAN message payload for purposes other than transmitting operational data may seem like a waste of bandwidth. However, the CANaerospace message header delivers valuable information which would require the use of message payload bytes also when realized otherwise: The header allows receiving stations to analyze received messages immediately with respect to origin, data type, integrity and creation time. To accomplish this, no further information except the knowledge of the CAN identifier assignment for the particular system is needed. The message header bytes have the following meaning:

*'''Node-ID:''' For ATM communication (EED, NOD), the Node Identifier specifies the transmitting node. For PTP communication (NSH, NSL) it specifies the addressed node (client, server). For PTP communication, Node_ID "0" is used to address all stations in the network (multicast).
*'''Data Type:''' The Data Type specifies how the payload of the message shall be interpreted with respect to its data type (i.e. floating-point data or number of bytes in case of integer data). The corresponding data type code is taken from the CANaerospace data type list which allows also user-defined data type definitions.
*'''Service Code:''' For Normal Operation Data (NOD) the Service Code delivers information about the integrity of the parameter transmitted with the message. This may be the result of a continuous sensor built-in test, the current validity flag of a navigation signal or other parameter specific information. In case of PTP communication the Service Code specifies the service for the corresponding client/server interaction.
*'''Message Code:''' For Normal Operation Data (NOD) the Message Code is incremented by one for each message with a particular CAN identifier by the transmitting node. After reaching the value of 255, the Message Code rolls over to zero. This allows receiving stations to determine missing or delayed messages and to react accordingly. Concerning PTP communication (NSH, NSL) the Message Code is used in conjunction with the Service Code to specify the service for the corresponding client/server interaction in more detail.

The above information contained in the CANaerospace message header contains important information to determine the integrity of the parameters for the use in flight safety critical systems and supports system redundancy. Additionally, it significantly improves the interoperability between LRUs of different vendors and allows the monitoring of CANaerospace networks concerning the status of the LRUs attached to it. For further interoperability, CANaerospace defines aerospace specific axis systems with the corresponding sign conventions and physical units. Together with the predefined identifier assignment list, these definitions describe the traffic in a CANaerospace network unambiguously. The CANaerospace Standard Identifier Assignment List reserves the CAN identifiers between 300 and 1799 and assigns parameters to them as shown in the excerpt of this list (Figure 4).

[[File:CANaerospace 4.jpg]]
'''Figure 4: Excerpt from the Standard Identifier Assignment List of CANaerospace V 1.7'''

System designers may use self-defined identifier assignment lists. The mandatory "Node Identification Service" which each CANaerospace LRU has to respond to allows to scan the network for attached LRUs and their identifier assignment list code to avoid inconsistencies. The CANaerospace Standard Identifier Assignment List as well as the lists for data types and units provide user-defined sections which may be used by system designers to expand these lists according to their needs.

==Bandwidth management==
An essential characteristic of all flight safety critical systems is that their behavior has to be precisely defined, analyzed and tested to meet formal certification requirements. This characteristic is often misinterpreted as timing determinism but is in fact predictability. The degree of precision required for timing is specific to each
application and has to be quantified by system analysis. The ultimate target to be reached, however, is that it may be demonstrated to certification authorities (i.e. [[FAA]], [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]]) that a safety critical system behaves predictably under foreseeable circumstances. Using CANaerospace, this predictability may be achieved.

CANaerospace sets forth a concept of managing the available bandwidth of a multi-drop CAN network to ensure predictable behavior for ATM and PTP communication which is called Time Triggered Bus Scheduling. Time Triggered Bus Scheduling is based on a limitation of the number of CAN messages that any node in the network may transmit within a minor time frame. The minor time frame is defined during initial system design. The maximum number of messages transmitted within one minor time frame may differ from node to node and contain growth potential if granted by system design. It is crucial to the Time Triggered Bus Scheduling concept that every node in the network adheres to its transmission schedule at all times when generating network traffic. It is neither required nor prohibited, however, that nodes in the network synchronize to other nodes concerning their message transmission order or transmission times.

[[Controller area network#Error frame|CAN error frames]] may lead to unpredictable behavior if the bandwidth is consumed by error frames resulting from faults of the network or the nodes attached to it. Therefore, CANaerospace recommends to limit the bandwidth usage to 50% of the maximum bandwidth so that unpredictability is mitigated. While Time Triggered Bus Scheduling requires margins and does not optimize network bandwidth usage, it provides a safe and straightforward approach to build certifiable (predictable) systems. For ensuring this under fault conditions the system designer has to define the behaviour under these conditions (error frames and avoidance of [[priority inversion]]).&lt;ref name="AN0104"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vector.com/portal/medien/cmc/application_notes/AN-ION-1-0104_CAN-based_protocols_in_Avionics.pdf |title=Application Note AN-ION-1-0104 |date=7 May 2010 |work=CAN-based Protocols in Avionics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the Time Triggered Bus Scheduling concept, it may be demonstrated that a CANaerospace network behaves predictably. Shown in Figure 5 is the transmission schedule of a CANaerospace network with two nodes transmitting their messages asynchronously, in alternating order and at random times within their minor time frames (worst-case scenario). This example utilizes 50% of the maximum bandwidth.

[[File:CANaerospace 5.jpg]]
'''Figure 5: Simplified CANaerospace Transmission Scheme'''

Using Time Triggered Bus Scheduling, no message in this transmission schedule has a latency exceeding 50% of one minor time frame plus the duration of the longest message. Time Triggered Bus Scheduling reduces the effect of message priority due to the fact that the nodes on the network are required to meter their message transmissions.

Local oscillator tolerances and lack of time synchronization between the nodes will result in minor time frames drifting away from each other. This does not adversely affect message latencies as long as the duration of the minor time frame in all nodes matches closely. To ensure predictability, all aperiodic messages must be included in the bandwidth management calculations.

Time Triggered Bus Scheduling ensures adequate flexibility for increasing network traffic during the lifetime of the system if growth potential is planned. As an example, system design will allow nodes to be integrated into the network without affecting the existing nodes. Furthermore, the predictable behavior enforced by Time Triggered Bus Scheduling allows systems with different criticality levels to coexist on the same network.

Scott Campbell was video recording members of the [[Oakland Police Department]] during an [[Occupy Oakland]] protest on the night of November 2–3, 2011. Shortly before 1am on November 3, he was shot by police using a [[Non-lethal weapon#Ammunition|less-lethal round]] while he was filming a stationary line of police in riot gear, hours after the [[2011 Oakland general strike]] but during ongoing street clashes between protestors and police in what the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' described as "chaos after midnight. Masked vandals shattered windows, set fires and plastered downtown businesses with graffiti before police moved in, dispersing crowds with tear gas and flash-bang grenades and making dozens of arrests."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/04/BANI1LQ2HO.DTL Occupy strike descends into chaos]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparently unprovoked shooting of Campbell was documented by the resulting point-of-view video from his own camera. University of South Carolina criminal justice professor Geoffrey Alpert said that unless something occurred off-camera to provoke the officer, the shooting was "one of the most outrageous uses of a firearm" he'd ever seen. "Unless there's a threat that you can't see in the video, that just looks like absolute punishment, which is the worst type of excessive force," Alpert told the ''Oakland Tribune''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57321440/experts-occupy-vid-shows-excessive-force/ Experts: "Occupy" video shows excessive force]&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell and co-plaintiffs filed suit in Federal Court in November 2011.  In 2013, the City of Oakland approved a $1.17 million settlement to Scott Campbell and 11 other Occupy Oakland protestors who were injured by police.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_23589592/oakland-approves-1-million-occupy-settlement&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cerebus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛr|ə|b|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaA1H-VoeQc Interview with Dave Sim] Sim says the name Cerebus at 3:58 into the interview&lt;/ref&gt; also '''''Cerebus the Aardvark''''') is a [[comic book]] series created by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[cartoonist]] [[Dave Sim]], which ran from December 1977 until March 2004. The title character of the 300-issue series is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[aardvark]] who takes on a number of roles throughout the series—[[barbarian]], [[prime minister]] and [[Pope]] among them. The series stands out for its experimentation in form and content, and for the dexterity of its artwork, especially after background artist [[Gerhard (cartoonist)|Gerhard]] joined with the 65th issue. As the series progressed, it increasingly became a platform for Sim's controversial beliefs.

The comic began as a [[parody]] of [[sword and sorcery]] comics, but explored a variety of other topics, including politics, religion, and gender issues. At a total of 6,000 pages, it progressively became more serious and ambitious than its parodic roots—what has come to be dubbed "[[#Cerebus Syndrome|Cerebus Syndrome]]". Sim announced early on that the series would end with the death of the title character. The story has a large cast of characters, many of which began as parodies of characters from comic books and popular culture.

Starting with the "[[High Society (comics)|High Society]]" storyline, the series became divided into self-contained "novels", which form parts of the overall story. The ten "novels" of the series have been collected in 16 books, known as "[[Cerebus phonebook]]s" for their resemblance, by way of their thickness, to telephone directories. At a time when the series was about 70% completed, celebrated comic book writer [[Alan Moore]] wrote, "Cerebus, as if I need to say so, is still to comic books what Hydrogen is to the [[Periodic Table]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Moore, Alan]]|date=April 1997|url=http://www.linkworthy.com/Moore/Correspondence3.htm|title=From Hell: Part 3|accessdate=April 24, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221081745/http://www.linkworthy.com/Moore/Correspondence3.htm|archivedate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerebus has been rated to be one the greatest characters in comics history. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' rated him as the 63rd greatest comic book character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 |title=Wizard's top 200 characters.

==Publication history==
''Cerebus'' was [[self-publishing|self-published]] by Dave Sim under his [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]], Inc. publishing banner. For the first few years the company's publisher was [[Deni Loubert]], Sim's girlfriend (the two would marry and divorce during the comic's run). Sim's position as a pioneering self-publisher in comics inspired numerous writer/artists after him, most notably [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] (''[[Bone (comic)|Bone]]''), [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]] (''[[Strangers in Paradise]]''), and [[Martin Wagner (artist)|Martin Wagner]] (''[[Hepcats]]'').

In 1979, Sim, who was at the time a frequent [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] user, began using [[LSD]], taking the drug with such frequency that he was eventually hospitalized.&lt;ref name="saturdaynight"&gt;{{Citation | last = Shulgan | first = Christopher | title = Comic Book Anti-Hero! | periodical = Saturday Night | publication-date = November 2003}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20050212165023/http://www.rawbw.com/~kjh/page1.jpg page 1], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060629071824/http://www.rawbw.com/~kjh/page3.jpg page 3]&lt;/ref&gt; It was this incident that Sim claims led to the inspiration to produce ''Cerebus'' for 300 monthly issues.&lt;ref name="saturdaynight" /&gt; 

When Sim published the first ''Cerebus'' "phone book", a paperback collection of the ''High Society'' graphic novel (issues #26–50), he angered distributors—who felt that their support had been instrumental in his series' success in an industry generally indifferent to small publishers—by offering the first printing via mail order only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/ubb/get_topic/f/42/t/000315/p/1.html#000016 ComicCon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091339/http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/ubb/get_topic/f/42/t/000315/p/1.html#000016 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;Coville, Jamie. [http://www.collectortimes.com/2005_07/Clubhouse.html "Dave Sim Interview"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ssUEgduX?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080309210540/www.collectortimes.com/2005_07/Clubhouse.html |date=2010-09-20 }} Collector Times June 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was a financial windfall for Sim, however, grossing over $150,000 in sales ({{Inflation|US|150,000|1986|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; Sim became known for picking up hotel tabs for self-publishers and helping other self-publishers by paying for meals and limo service between stops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/ubb/get_topic/f/43/t/000333/p/4.html#000189 Comicon board posting by Colleen Doran] Colleen talks about Dave's support of self-publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations regarding [[DC Comics|DC]] buying ''Cerebus'' took place over the course of 1985 to 1988, offering $100,000 (${{Inflation|US|100,000|1988|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) and 10% of all licensing and merchandising, which Sim rejected.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;

The series hit a personal sales record with issue #100 which, despite being a normal issue in the middle of a [[story arc]], had a print run of 36,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Wiz17"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grant |first=Paul J. |date=January 1993 |title=A Boy &amp; his Aardvark |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |volume= |issue=17 |pages=56–59 |publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales took a substantial drop over the next 50 issues, however, and Sim commented that the fact that readers could not simply "jump in" to ''Cerebus'', and had to read the entire series in order to be able to understand the current issue, was a major reason for the sales drop.&lt;ref name="Wiz17"/&gt;

In July 1984, ''Cerebus'' publisher [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]] was threatened with possible legal action by [[Marvel Comics]] over a parody of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in ''Cerebus''.&lt;ref name=CJ&gt;{{cite journal |work=[[The Comics Journal]] |author=Heintjes, Tom |author2=Thompson, Kim |issue=91 |date=July 1984 |title=Marvel Threatens Aardvark-Vanaheim Over Cerebus Wolverine Parody |url=http://momentofcerebus.blogspot.com/2015/06/newswatch-marvel-threatens-aardvark.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sim guest-wrote the 10th issue of [[Todd McFarlane]]'s comics series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', he donated his entire fee—over $100,000—to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David, Peter]]||title=But I Digress...|newspaper=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]|number=992|date=November 20, 1992|publisher=[[Krause Publications]]}} Reprinted in ''But I Digress...'' (1994), pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Jaka's Story", a tragic character study dealing with gender roles and the political suppression of [[art]], is generally cited as the series' pinnacle of narrative achievement. Later issues of the series became highly personal and began to alienate many long-time fans, his female readers especially. Issue #186 (collected in ''Reads'') contained a lengthy prose section that was attacked by some readers and critics for what they perceived as overt [[misogyny]], but which Sim describes as "anti-[[feminism]]". During this part of the story, the storyline consisted of a textual treatise written by Viktor Davis, a fictional "reads" author, interspersed with the main ''Cerebus'' storyline. In Davis' material, he refers to the "creative male light" and the "emotional female void", a reversal of the gender-based view of creation espoused by the Judge at the end of ''Church and State'' (namely, the "female light" being raped by the "male void" and shattering into the physical universe). As Sim himself says in an interview with ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', "''Cerebus'' #1–200 [is] the completion of the story. The [[yin and yang]]. The ultra-female reading. The ultra-male reading. I'm attaching an allegory to the [[Big Bang]]. You make up your mind which one's the pit and which one's the top of the mountain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archives.tcj.com/2_archives/i_sim.html# |title=Dave Sim interviewed by Tom Spurgeon, excerpted from The Comics Journal nos. 184 &amp; 192 |access-date=2012-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324031201/http://archives.tcj.com/2_archives/i_sim.html# |archive-date=2012-03-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the series, the Void is again male and identified as God, and the Light is female, now identified with YHWH. Issue #186 was followed by another essay in the back of issue #265 called "Tangent", in which Sim identified a "feminist/homosexualist axis" that opposed traditional and rational societal values. This material appeared as Sim was retreating from public life and becoming more marginalized by his peers in the industry.

Sim himself appeared as a character in ''Cerebus'', as when he berated the title character in the "Minds" story arc.

Sim's religious beliefs heavily influenced the last third of ''Cerebus'''s storyline. Once an [[atheism|atheist]], Sim became a believer in [[God]] while gathering research material for "Rick's Story". However, rather than following an established religion, Sim follows his own personal belief system cobbled together from elements of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;"Just to be clear on the subject of what I consider scripture: the Torah, that is, the Law and the Prophets as held by Orthodox Judaism (i.e. no Ruth, no Esther, no Daniel, no Job, no Song of Songs, etc.), the First Book of Moshe through to Malachi, the four Gospels, Acts and John's Apocalypse, and all of the Koran." Sim, Dave. (2007) ''Collected Letters Volume 2'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; although he described himself in issue #8 of ''Following Cerebus'' as "mostly Muslim". A 2003 magazine interview describes Sim as reciting a prayer of his own devising five times a day (which was published in the back of issue #300), and as having sold much of his furniture to donate the money to charity as an act of religious [[asceticism]]. In an editorial contained in issue #297, Sim stated that he regards the production of ''Cerebus'' as of secondary importance to his religious practice. Sim's religious beliefs tie into his views on gender, and the bulk of the ''Cerebus'' storyline after "Guys" deals with this, especially "Rick's Story", "Latter Days", and "The Last Day".{{fact|date=April 2018}}

A quarterly publication, ''Following Cerebus'', followed in August 2004, featuring correspondence, essays, and previously unpublished artwork from Sim, as well as interviews with other comic writers and artists.

Sim was rumored to have said that had he died or otherwise chosen not to complete ''Cerebus'' prior to issue 300, the remaining issues were to either consist of blank pages or Gerhard was to have drawn his backgrounds only, leaving Sim's contribution blank. It is not known if this plan was ever serious, since it was never put into effect. At the completion of the series, Sim directed that upon his and Gerhard's death, ''Cerebus'' would enter into the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/0304talk.php |title=CFG: Cerebus Mailing List 'talk' with Dave Sim |publisher=Cerebusfangirl.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Grady Hendrix |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0413,hendrix,52244,10.html |title= books &amp;gt; Readers Of The Last Aardvark by Grady Hendrix |work=The Village Voice |date=2004-03-23 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective 31 December 2006, Sim purchased Gerhard's share of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/cerebus/message/107509 |title=Gerhard and Aardvark-Vanaheim have parted ways |accessdate=2007-02-28 |work=Cerebus Yahoo!

In early 2009, Sim launched the bimonthly series ''Cerebus Archive''. It was translated into Italian;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackvelveteditrice.com/spip.php?article337 |title=Alta Società, una storia di Cerebus - Anteprima e Preordine |publisher=Blackvelveteditrice.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718091557/http://www.blackvelveteditrice.com/spip.php?article337 |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011, ''[[Church and State (comics)|Church &amp; State Vol. I]]'' was published in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ponentmon.com/comics-castellano/del-oeste/iglesia-y-estado/index.html Product page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615124614/http://www.ponentmon.com/comics-castellano/del-oeste/iglesia-y-estado/index.html |date=2011-06-15 }} at [http://www.ponentmon.com/comics-castellano/del-oeste/iglesia-y-estado/index.html Ponent Mon]'s website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
&lt;!-- Keep summaries short, if you feel the need to add _lots_ of text, add a new page (As already exists for Jaka's Story). This isn't the appropriate place for commentary, try to keep it brief and to the point. Either add discussions of commentary to other sections, or create new pages or sections for it.
--&gt;

==="Cerebus"===
This first story arc, uniquely in this series, consists of one to three-issue storylines with only occasional back-references. Cerebus is introduced as an amoral barbarian mercenary, fighting (and betraying) for money and drinking it away. During his adventures, he encounters the warrior Pigts (whose religion reveres aardvarks) and the insane wizard Necross, who turns himself into a giant stone Thrunk (visually similar to [[Marvel Comics]]' [[The Thing (comics)|The Thing]]). Most of the series' prominent characters are introduced (or at least mentioned) in these issues, including Elrod of Melvinbone (a parodic representation of [[Michael Moorcock]]'s [[Elric of Melnibone]]), Lord Julius, a character based upon [[Groucho Marx]], Artemis Roach (a.k.a. The Roach) and Jaka. The series takes a sharp change in direction with issue #20 which is the first of the "Mind Games" issues that are a feature of the comic and introduces the philosophical Suenteus Po and the ultra-matriarchial Cirinists.

==="High Society"===
Cerebus comes to the wealthy city-state of Iest as the representative of Lord Julius's city-state of Palnu. He quickly finds himself enmeshed in the fast-paced world of high finance and politics, and comic tension is built through his ignorance of the "high society" machinations going on around him. Cerebus is befriended by the legendary Regency Elf as he adjusts to his new circumstances. He meets and soon finds himself maneuvered into a political campaign by the mysterious Astoria, who is also manipulating Artemis into pseudo-super hero identities that are parodies of [[Moon Knight]] and later [[Sergeant William Preston|Sergeant Preston of the Mounties]]. Cerebus recognizes that he is a pawn in a political game between Lord Julius and Astoria, but he struggles to assert himself and ultimately confounds the expectations of everyone attempting to use him. Cerebus is eventually elected Prime Minister of Iest, but launches an unnecessary war of conquest that causes him to lose everything.

==="Church &amp; State I"===
After some travels, Cerebus returns to Iest and is manipulated by Weisshaupt, who wants to use Cerebus's popularity with the masses, into again becoming Prime Minister of Iest. Weisshaupt has maneuvered himself into the tenuous presidency of a federation of states (including Iest, Palnu and New Sepra) as a bulwark against the Cirinists. Weisshaupt lures Cerebus into a drunken marriage to Red Sophia, but ultimately loses his influence over Cerebus when Weisshaupt's rival, Bishop Powers, appoints Cerebus Pope of the Eastern Church of Tarim. Finally out from under anyone else's control, Cerebus lets absolute power go to his head and demands that all the citizens must give him all their gold or face the end of the world. Sophia walks out on Cerebus, and then he discovers that Jaka is married and pregnant. Cerebus is threatened by Weisshaupt's secret invention of [[cannon]]s, but Weisshaupt suffers a heart attack and Cerebus continues his papal reign of terror. He is finally ejected from the Upper City by the sudden invasion of the giant stone Thrunk, who claims to be the God Tarim.

==="Church &amp; State II"===
Cerebus returns to Iest's Upper City and uses Weisshaupt's cannons to destroy Thrunk and reclaim the papacy. Astoria has mysteriously killed the Western pope ("the Lion of Serrea"), and Cerebus must execute her for the crime in order to retain his papacy. Cerebus confronts her in a dungeon, and after being taunted by Astoria, he grants himself a divorce from Red Sophia, marries himself to Astoria, rapes her, and then divorces himself from her. Astoria's trial, which echoes with similarities to a repeating pattern of historical executions of reformers, is interrupted when Cerebus makes the predicted Ascension to the Moon that is the culmination of the land's religious prophecy. There, Cerebus meets the Judge, a timeless, godlike being who has watched over history from the very beginning. (Sim had based the personality of this character on cartoonist and playwright [[Jules Feiffer]].) The Judge explains his version of the creation myth of Cerebus's universe, before warning Cerebus that he will live only a few more years before dying "alone, unmourned and unloved." The Judge tells Cerebus that if the Aardvark ever questions his suffering, he should remember his "second marriage" to Astoria. Cerebus then falls back to earth, where he discovers that the Cirinists have invaded, and his empire has collapsed.

==="Jaka's Story"===
Cerebus returns to Iest, now under a brutal Cirinist dictatorship, and runs into Jaka again. She is illegally working as a dancer in her landlord's tavern. The landlord/barman, Pud, treats Jaka kindly but secretly spends his days lusting after her. Cerebus agrees to live with Jaka and her husband Rick as their houseguest. That story is interwoven with unreliable tales of Jaka's childhood told by a writer, representing [[Oscar Wilde]], using notes and stories provided by Rick. In the end Cerebus disguises himself and travels to the Lower City to buy a jar of paint. While he is gone, the Cirinists find the tavern, kill Pud and arrest Jaka, Rick, and Oscar. Jaka is made to sign a confession of immoral behavior, and is reunited with Rick; however, the Cirinists reveal to Rick that Jaka aborted the son that Rick always wanted. He lashes out at Jaka and is allowed to divorce her (although he is maimed for striking her). Jaka returns to Palnu, and Cerebus returns to the inn to find it in ruins.

==="Melmoth"===
This story arc concentrates on the last days and death of [[Oscar Wilde]] (who is attended to by his trusted companion [[Robbie Ross]]) rather than on Cerebus himself, who appears in only a few pages. (The title refers to the [[gothic novel]] ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' by [[Charles Robert Maturin]], a relative of Wilde's. Wilde adopted this alias during this period of his life.) Meanwhile, a [[catatonic]] Cerebus, believing Jaka to be dead, spends his days mourning on the patio of a café. In the last few pages of the story, after the main action had concluded, Cerebus overhears a conversation by two Cirinist jailers insulting Jaka. Enraged, Cerebus murders one of the guards and then springs into action.

==="Flight"===
First part of the "Mothers and Daughters" story arc. Cerebus's return to Iest and slaughter of Cirinsts leads to a very brief failed revolution. Cerebus descends into darkness and speaks with Suenteus Po. Meanwhile, Cirin works to manage her sect and arrange her own Ascension. Artemis, with Elrod as his sidekick, also stages his own impromptu revolution under his new persona "PunisherRoach", a parody of the Marvel comics character [[The Punisher]].

==="Women"===
Second part of the story-arc "Mothers and Daughters". Cerebus crashes back to earth. He is assisted by a mysterious old woman who is being openly spied upon by the Cirinists; she sends him to a bar to hide. This story arc includes a parody of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Sandman (DC Comics/Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' in which the Roach plays "Swoon" (a parody of [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]]) and Elrod plays "Snuff" (a transvestite parody of [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]]). Astoria and Cirin symbolically duel in a dream realm. The book includes excerpts from books written by Astoria and Cirin that describe their differing beliefs. Cerebus flies across the city to slay Astoria, but is interrupted by the arrival of Suenteus Po.

==="Reads"===
Third part of the "Mothers and Daughters" story arc. This book primarily consists of two long text pieces. The first revolves around an author of ''Reads'', heavily illustrated books in Cerebus's world. In this story, there is a strong thread about the dangers of commercial success and "selling out". The series moves from this storyline to a long essay attributed to Viktor Davis, a fictional ''Reads'' author. This essay puts forth a theory on the nature of the genders, describing the "Female Void" focused on feeling, and the "Male Light" focused on reason. These two stories are accompanied by a long discussion between Cirin, Astoria, Cerebus, and Suenteus Po. Po gives information about aardvarks, including that all aardvarks have Cerebus' "magnifier" quality, and attempts to convince each of the others to abandon their pursuits of power and return to what they enjoy doing most, then leaves them to their fates. Astoria is convinced and also leaves, but not before giving Cerebus information about her history with Cirin and also informing him of his hermaphrodite nature. Cerebus and Cirin then engage in a long and brutal fight, which leads to the beginning of another ascension.

==="Minds"===
Fourth and concluding part of the "Mothers and Daughters" story arc. Cerebus and Cirin ascend, then are separated by a mysterious force. As Cerebus flies through the solar system, he is shown images from his past and is forced to reconsider his actions and his faith. He then encounters a disembodied voice calling itself "Dave" that acknowledges itself as Cerebus's creator. "Dave" shows Cerebus the history of the Cirinist movement, revealing that Cirin is actually named Serna and was the best friend of the real Cirin (the old woman Cerebus encountered in ''Women''), but usurped Cirin's leadership and effectively exchanged identities with her. "Dave" then gives Cerebus information about his past, showing that Cerebus unwittingly ruined his original destiny, causing chaotic repercussions which have influenced most of his adventures. Cerebus demands that "Dave" ''make'' Jaka love him; in response, "Dave" shows Cerebus visions of possible futures between himself and Jaka, all of which are disastrously flawed for both of them due to Cerebus' nature. After a period of penance and self-reflection on [[Pluto]], Cerebus asks "Dave" to place him in a bar he remembers from his mercenary days.

==="Guys"===
Cerebus spends time, and eventually becomes bartender, in one of the Cirinists' bars where "degenerate" men are essentially quarantined from the female citizens. Described in the trade paperback's introduction as based on a bar that Sim frequented during a near-alcoholic stint between relationships, the series features various parodic characters who come and go while Cerebus remains stationary. Cerebus begins a somewhat reluctant relationship with a woman named Joanne, who was first introduced in one of the possible futures with Jaka that "Dave" showed Cerebus in ''Minds''.

==="Rick's Story"===
Eventually Jaka's ex-husband Rick arrives at the bar. He has significantly aged, become a heavy drinker (having barely been able to tolerate alcohol in "Jaka's Story"), and it is gradually revealed that the mental and emotional scars from the events at the end of "Jaka's Story" have left him mildly insane. Rick is working on a book about his life, which gradually becomes a religious work in which Cerebus is a holy figure and Rick his follower. Joanne returns and taunts Cerebus by courting Rick. At the end of the book, Rick departs, for reasons not entirely clear, and tells Cerebus that he will see Rick only once more in his life. After Rick has left, Jaka shows up at the bar, and she and Cerebus depart together, heading for Cerebus' childhood home of Sand Hills Creek.

==="Going Home"===
First part of the "Going Home" story arc. Cerebus and Jaka travel across land, then on a river boat. Cerebus is eager to make as much time as possible, as he fears being trapped in the mountains near Sand Hills Creek by winter, but instead he indulges Jaka's desire for shopping and public appearances. Along the way, they encounter veiled hostility from the Cirinists. Cerebus and Jaka's relationship begins to show signs of deterioration, and Jaka is almost tempted away by F. Stop Kennedy (a fictional version of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]), a writer who has accompanied them on their river boat.

==="Form and Void"===
Second and concluding part of the story arc "Going Home". Cerebus and Jaka continue their journey towards Sand Hills Creek, in the company of Ham and Mary Ernestway, analogues to [[Ernest Hemingway]] and his fourth wife, Mary. On the trip, Mary tells them about some of her and Ham's journeys. This material is based on Mary Hemingway's journals about Ernest's last African safaris prior to his death. Ham dies in what appears to be suicide, but Cerebus becomes convinced Mary murdered him and flees in panic, taking Jaka with him. They discover that they have been traveling in circles without making any significant progress toward Sand Hills Creek, and nearly die in a blizzard. They finally arrive in Sand Hills Creek only to find that Cerebus' parents are dead and the rest of the community has shunned Cerebus for his perceived abandonment of his family. Cerebus drives Jaka away, blaming her for keeping him away too long.

==="Latter Days"===
First part of the story arc "Latter Days". After a prodigious leap in time over two issues, Cerebus returns from the north intent on provoking the Cirinists into killing him. Instead, he is captured by a trio of characters based on the [[Three Stooges]], who await a religious revelation from him. While Cerebus was in the north, a religious movement developed out of the teachings of Rick and his writings about Cerebus. Once Cerebus supplies the required revelation, he inspires a successful anti-Cirinist rebellion and a subsequent reordering of society. Much of the second half of this chapter consists of Cerebus giving a highly idiosyncratic analysis of the ''[[Torah]]''. Published over the course of nearly a year, this section, called "Chasing YHWH" was presented almost entirely in text format, with minimal art. This story arc is unusual in that disembodied thought balloons give the impression that Cerebus is speaking directly to the reader at times. It is revealed in the last issue of the arc that Cerebus has been talking to a woman reporter who bears a striking resemblance to Jaka. He eventually falls in love with the woman and marries her.

==="The Last Day"===
The second and concluding part of "Latter Days", and the conclusion of the series as a whole. In the first 40 pages Cerebus has a dream or vision in which [[cosmology]] is seen as a reflection of [[theology]], complete with explanatory footnotes by Sim. Upon waking Cerebus &amp;mdash; now incredibly aged, decrepit, pain-ridden, and mildly senile &amp;mdash; makes the laborious trek to his writing desk to write down his new revelation. He then hides the manuscript, and it is implied that nobody will find it for two thousand years.

Cerebus spends most of the rest of the book trying to persuade his chief of security, Walter O'Reilly (named after [[Corporal Walter (Radar) O'Reilly]] from ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M A S H]]'') to admit his son, Shep-Shep, with whom he remembers sharing an idyllic father-son relationship. However, the Sanctuary is under lockdown due to opposition from a new and even more rabidly "feminist-homosexualist" group led by Shep-Shep's mother, whom Cerebus refers to as "New Joanne", which favors such "rights" as [[pedophilia]], [[zoophilia]], juvenile [[recreational drug use]] and [[lesbianism|lesbian]] motherhood. As a result, social values have undergone a complete breakdown.

Cerebus finally goes to bed despairing of seeing his son again, but Shep-Shep manages to sneak into Cerebus' room late that night. Their subsequent conversation shatters Cerebus' last illusions about his son. Shep-Shep has aligned himself with his mother, who has been conducting genetic engineering experiments, partly with knowledge gained from Cirin's earlier experimentation. Cerebus is disgusted and horrified when Shep-Shep shows him the results of one of the experiments, a lion cub with a human baby's head, and explains his mother's plans.

As Shep-Shep leaves, Cerebus grabs a knife, intending to kill him, but falls out of bed and breaks his neck, alone, unmourned, and unloved, just as the Judge had predicted. His life flashes before his eyes in a series of flashback panels and his [[ghost]] sees many of his old friends and enemies waiting for him in "the Light." Jaka, Bear, and Ham beckon to him, and he eagerly rushes to join them, thinking they are in [[Heaven]], but then he notices the absence of Rick and realizes that the Light may in fact be [[Hell]]. He calls out to [[God]] for help, but is dragged into the Light nonetheless.

==Characters==

===Cerebus===
Cerebus is a [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] anthropomorphic {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[biped]]al gray [[aardvark]].&lt;ref&gt;"Cerebus, like [[Howard the Duck]], is a funny animal in the world of humans." Dave Sim, from the "Notes From The President" section in ''Cerebus Number Zero'', June 1993&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to himself by name, in the third person, with occasional exceptions in the early issues. Sim has described Cerebus's voice as sounding like [[George C. Scott]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Although Cerebus considers himself male, and is treated as such, he is a [[hermaphrodite]], possessing both sexes' [[sex organ|genitalia]] and [[reproductive system]]s. Theoretically he is capable of impregnating himself; however, a childhood injury to his uterus makes this impossible.

Cerebus is an [[amorality|amoral]] character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/nftp/zero.php Cerebus #0 Note From The President]"Cerebus is not a hero, a villain, an anti-hero, or an everyman. He is capable of being each of those and he is most often none of those. He's Cerebus." Dave Sim, from the "Notes From The President" section in ''Cerebus Number Zero'', June 1993&lt;/ref&gt; He is often foul-mouthed and uncouth, has a vicious [[anger|temper]], and loves getting [[drunkenness|drunk]]. In the "Guys" story arc, Cerebus is described as having "a self-absorption that borders on the pathological."{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In "Church and State", Cerebus, after becoming Pope, uses brutal methods to teach morality lessons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} However, he is brave, crafty, and can show genuine affection to those he considers equals or those he has feelings for. He is a skilled [[military tactics|tactician]] and [[strategy|strategist]], is very proficient at [[hand to hand combat]], and has a knack for [[improvisation]] and [[social influence|manipulation]]. He received training in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] as a child, but is depicted as being able to recognize magic and deal with it rather than use it.

For most of the series' run, Cerebus possesses an innate "magnifier" ability. This ability, which he shows little (if any) conscious awareness of, is a tendency for events occurring around him to become unusually focused and ordered, with intensified actions and consequences and sometimes with [[paranormal]] effects, then fall out of place in his absence. This ability also affects the people around him to varying degrees, amplifying their personality traits and abilities, and also amplifies any magic that is present.

===Supporting characters===
; Jaka Tavers : The love of Cerebus' life. A dancer by profession, she is the niece of Lord Julius and (ex-)wife of Rick Nash.
; Lord Julius : Grandlord of the city-state of Palnu, who exercises control by making the bureaucracy incredibly dense and incomprehensible. Julius is crafty and intelligent, but often plays the fool to confuse and baffle opponents. His character design and behavior is based on [[Groucho Marx]], including snappy insults, a constant cigar, the chicken walk, and a painted-on mustache.
; Astoria : A beautiful political manipulator, Lord Julius' ex-wife, and the main driving force behind Cerebus' campaign to become Prime Minister in ''High Society''. She is the leader of the Kevillists, a [[feminist]] sect which opposes Cirin. The Kevillists mirror the Cirinists' philosophy, but would prefer power in the hands of daughters instead of mothers. She is named for actress [[Mary Astor]], and may be inspired in some ways by Sim's ex-wife Deni Loubert, though Sim himself denies this in issue 298.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
; Cirin : Leader of the Cirinists, a [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] [[fascist]] sect which conquers Estarcion at the conclusion of the ''Church and State'' storyline. Originally named Serna, she took the name and effectively exchanged identities with the ''real'' Cirin, whose views were much less militaristic. The sect honors mothers primarily, also giving high honors to daughters (potential mothers) and children. Men are tolerated. Like Cerebus, she is an aardvark.
; Elrod the Albino (Elrod of Melvinbone): Essentially [[Michael Moorcock]]'s [[Elric|Elric of Melnibone]] with the voice and personality of [[Senator Claghorn]] (or [[Foghorn Leghorn]]), Elrod is an almost purely comic character whose main purpose is to frustrate and enrage Cerebus. In ''Reads'' it is revealed that he was created by Cerebus' proximity to a magic gem, and after learning this he vanishes from existence. However, Joanne tells Cerebus she and her husband used to live next door to Elrod, who was married at the time to Red Sophia.
; [[The Cockroach|Roach (Artemis)]]: An incompetent [[superhero]] character. Sim used the Roach to satirize popular mainstream comic characters or industry publishing trends, beginning with [[Batman]]. His other guises have included Captain Cockroach ([[Captain America]]), Moonroach ([[Moon Knight]]), Wolveroach ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]), the Secret Sacred Wars Roach (Marvel Super Heroes [[Secret Wars]] series and Frank Miller's Batman from ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''), normalroach (Valentino's [[normalman]]), Punisherroach (The [[Punisher]]), Swoon ([[The Sandman (DC Comics/Vertigo)|Sandman]]), and Sergeant Preston of the Royal Mounted Iestan police (the main character of the radio series ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'').
; Adam Weisshaupt : Introduced in ''Cerebus'', he is a ruthless political opponent of Cerebus throughout the ''Church &amp; State'' storyline. His manipulations of both Cerebus and the Roach lead to his pawns eventually growing more powerful than he ever hoped to be. Weisshaupt is named after the historical [[Adam Weishaupt]] but drawn to look like [[George Washington]] (a connection well known to [[Illuminati]] [[conspiracy theorist]]s).
; Bear : Cerebus' best friend from his mercenary days and main drinking buddy. In "Guys" there are hints Cerebus is suppressing an attraction to him.
; Joanne : Introduced in a possible future for Cerebus and Jaka by "Dave" in "Minds", Joanne is a bored housewife who has an affair with Cerebus, prompting Jaka's suicide.  After Cerebus returns to Estarcion, Joanne reappears and becomes Cerebus's lover, only to be spurned by Cerebus. She later seduces Rick as a way to taunt Cerebus. Joanne is in many ways an opposite of Jaka, and Cerebus bases much of his post-''Guys'' views on how to deal with women on his experience with her. After Sheshep's mother leaves Cerebus, he labels her "New Joanne."
; Bran Mac Mufin: Originally a barbarian warlord whose people worshiped an idol who looked remarkably like Cerebus (and which the aardvark destroyed). He later turns up quite unexpectedly, in civilized clothing, to act as an adviser to Cerebus in two separate occasions, first in Cerebus' campaign and first reign as Prime Minister of Iest and then arriving after Cerebus is Pope to observe the miracles and give Cerebus advice, though he seems to have a hidden agenda. During the Iest campaign Cerebus states that he trusts Mac Mufin's military advice more than anyone else's. When Thrunk deposes Cerebus, Mac Mufin commits suicide by stabbing himself in the chest with a sword.  Mac Mufin is a parody of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s Celtic barbarian [[Bran Mak Morn]]. In his first appearance in issue 5 his name was spelled Bran Mak Mufin, but in subsequent appearances he goes by Bran Mac Mufin.
; Rick Nash : First introduced as Jaka's husband in ''Jaka's Story'', Rick is a friendly, gentle ne'er-do-well, whom Sim described in the introduction to the "phonebook" of ''Jaka's Story'' as "the nearest I will ever come to the portrayal of a good and thoroughly decent human being; completely without guile or malice". After his marriage to Jaka is dissolved, he becomes mildly insane. He eventually goes on to become the prophet of a religion centered on Cerebus.
; Suenteus Po: Estarcion's third aardvark, who has lived several lifetimes and has shaped the history of Estarcion. It is also a very common name and several people named "Suenteus Po" appear in the story in various roles — one as an enigmatic illusionist and another as a historian who narrates a sizable portion of Cerebus' first reign as Prime Minister of Iest (though it is very strongly implied that both these Pos are the aardvark). It is mentioned in ''High Society'' that some of the followers of the original Suenteus Po named their children after him. The name may be a playful misspelling of the name of Roman historian [[Suetonius]]. There was a rock band on San Francisco label Solana Records named Suenteus Po that released an album in 2000.
; The Regency Elf : A childlike, playful spirit who inhabits Cerebus' rooms at the Regency Hotel in ''High Society''; at first, only Cerebus can see her. She helps Cerebus with some of his political scheming, though, as innocent as she seems, it's all just a game to her. It is discovered later that the Regency Elf who appears to Cerebus is a fake created by Cerebus' subconscious. The Regency Elf is inspired in part by ''[[Elfquest]]'' and its creator [[Wendy Pini]]. Visually, the Regency Elf is inspired by [[Debby Harry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beguiling.com/images/regencyelf.html |title=Notes on the auction for page 96 of High Society |publisher=Beguiling.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707222037/http://www.beguiling.com/images/regencyelf.html |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other characters in the series were designed to resemble famous actors, politicians, and other personalities and comic in-jokes, including British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Professor X]] (with a bit of [[Chris Claremont]] thrown in), Canadian Member of Parliament [[Sheila Copps]], director [[Woody Allen]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Rick Veitch]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Chico Marx]].

==Collections==
The first 22 Cerebus stories were collected in six issues of ''Swords of Cerebus'', plus one supplement to volume six, and these stories were then collected in "Cerebus" #1. ''Swords of Cerebus'' also published several new short Cerebus stories, listed under "Other appearances" above, which were not reprinted in the "phone books" 

All of the story arcs from the Cerebus comic book have been reprinted in collected omnibus editions of 240–630 pages each, all of which are presently still in print. They are generally referred to by fans and retailers as [[Cerebus phonebooks|''Cerebus'' "phone books"]] due to their size; also, they use the same newsprint paper as the original comics.

Sim has released two collections of his responses to readers' letters (the original letters are not included) after the publication of ''Cerebus'' #300. ''Collected Letters 2004'' ({{ISBN|0-919359-23-X}}) was released in 2005, and ''Collected Letters vol. 2'' was released in 2007.

Miscellaneous stories not appearing in the above collections have been reprinted in the short collections ''Cerebus World Tour Book'' and in ''Cerebus Number Zero'', which reprints issues #51, 112/113 and parts of issues #137 &amp; 138. A few standalone, uncollected stories have appeared in various collections and magazines over the years, and Cerebus has made cameo appearances on the covers of magazines such as ''[[Comics Revue]]''. Sim also marketed a set of "Diamondback" cards (based upon a game seen in early issues) in the 1980s. All of the material in the ''Cerebus'' arc was reprinted in smaller collections called ''Swords of Cerebus'' before Sim decided on the "phonebook" format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/nftp/189.php Cerebus #189 Note From The President] "With Cerebus, we did the Swords collections first (four issues in each) until it became unwieldy to keep a half-dozen collections in print, so we switched to the phone-book format." Dave Sim, from the "Notes From The President" section in ''Cerebus # 189'', December 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The phonebooks themselves tie into ideas presented in the series. Although grammatically incorrect, the titles of books 8 through 11 could be read as a sentence ("women read minds, guys" – the concept of women reading minds is a key plot point).&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cerebusfangirl.com/uploads/021106letter.jpg |title=Letter from Dave Sim |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, beginning with ''Going Home'' (the first storyline begun after Sim's religious conversion), the covers of each "phone book" are printed in full color, with ''Going Home'' and ''Form and Void'' using Gerhard's scenic nature photography as covers, rather than the drawings used on past books.

'''''Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies''''' is a music [[reference book]] authored by American music journalist and essayist [[Robert Christgau]]. It was first published in October 1981 by [[Ticknor &amp; Fields]].

The book compiles approximately 3,000 [[capsule review|capsule]] album reviews, most of which were originally written by Christgau for his "Consumer Guide" column in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' throughout the 1970s. The entries feature annotated details about each record's release and cover a variety of genres related to [[rock music]]. Many of the older reviews were rewritten for the guide to reflect his matured stylistic approach and changed perspective on the music.

The guide was critically well received, with praise given to its extensive [[discography]], Christgau's judgment, and colorful writing. Reviewers also noted his opinionated tastes, analytical commentary, pithy language, and critical quips. The book later appeared on several expert lists of popular music literature. A staple of rock-era reference works, ''Christgau's Record Guide'' became widely popular in libraries as a source for [[popular music studies]] and as an authoritative guide for fellow critics, record collectors, and music shops.

''Christgau's Record Guide'' has been [[reprint]]ed several times in book form and later on Christgau's website in its entirety. Two more "Consumer Guide" collections have been published, compiling his capsule reviews from the 1980s and the 1990s, respectively.

== Background ==
[[File:Village Voice 36 Cooper Square.jpg|thumb|right|The book originated from Christgau's column in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' (former headquarters pictured).]]
In 1969, [[Robert Christgau]] began reviewing contemporary [[album]] releases in his "Consumer Guide" column, which was published more-or-less monthly in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and for brief periods in ''[[Newsday]]'' and ''[[Creem]]'' magazine during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolk|2010}}; {{harvnb|Applegate|1996|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His method to the column selected some 20 or so albums to assess in [[capsule review]] format, averaging approximately 50 words each, before assigning a [[Grading in education|letter grade]] on a scale of A-plus to E-minus.{{sfn|Wynar|Littlefield|Holte|1982|p=524}} This was a product of ''The Village Voice''{{'}}s deal with Christgau—allotting him one 2,500-word piece per month—and his desire to provide prospective buyers with ratings of albums, including those that did not receive significant [[airplay]].{{sfn|Applegate|1996|pp=49-50}} Some of these columns were reprinted in Christgau's first book, ''Any Old Way You Choose It'', a 1973 anthology of essays previously published in the ''Voice'' and ''Newsday''.{{sfn|Salzman|1986|p=967}}

Among the most revered and influential of the earliest [[rock criticism|rock critics]], Christgau wrote the "Consumer Guide" with confidence in his tastes, conviction that [[popular music]] could be consumed intelligently, and interest in finding new understandings of the aesthetic and political dimensions in [[popular culture]]'s intersection with the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|Horn|Laing|Oliver|2003|p=306}}; {{harvnb|Locher|Evory|1977|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a journalist, he wanted to convey his findings in a way that would entertain and provoke readers.{{sfn|Locher|Evory|1977|p=118}}

== Content and scope ==
{{quote box|quote="I conceived the CG as complementing my monthly essay. It was criticism with an immediate, undeniable practical function—criticism in a pop form, compact and digestible."|source=—''Christgau's Record Guide'', p. 4{{sfn|Applegate|1996|pp=49-50}} |width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

''Christgau's Record Guide'' collects approximately 3,000 "Consumer Guide" reviews of albums through the 1970s.{{sfn|Taylor|1985|pp=50-51}} The reviews are arranged alphabetically by artist name and accompanied by annotations for each record. Some older albums were regraded to reflect Christgau's changed perspective, while other records and text from the original columns were omitted in favor of new material.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1985|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Wynar|Littlefield|Holte|1982|p=524}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the original reviews were expanded and extensively revised by Christgau for the guide, more than half of which consequently features material in previously unpublished form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolk|2010}}; {{harvnb|Christgau|1982|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He later said, "much of the early CG material was rewritten for the book for a reason—I didn't evolve my current high-density stylistic approach until 1975 or so".{{sfn|Anon.|2002|p=1}}

The book covers albums from a variety of rock-related genres including [[hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], [[funk]], [[disco]], [[soul music|soul]], [[blues]], [[country music|country]], and [[reggae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simels|1982|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Super|Irons-Georges|2006|p=432}}; {{harvnb|Wynar|Littlefield|Holte|1982|p=524}}; {{harvnb|Feehan|1981|p=2126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to its scope, Christgau said he "tried to grade every '70s rock album worth owning".{{sfn|Manzler|2000}} The reviews often feature analytical commentary on the aesthetic or cultural significance of the music, as well as critical [[one-liner joke]]s; his review of the 1973 [[Leonard Cohen]] album ''[[Live Songs]]'' states Cohen "risks turning into the [[Pete Seeger]] of romantic existentialism", while [[the Doobie Brothers]]' ''[[Takin' It to the Streets (The Doobie Brothers album)|Takin' It to the Streets]]'' (1976) is panned in a single sentence: "[[wikt:you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink|You can lead a Doobie to the recording studio, but you can't make him think.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Super|Irons-Georges|2006|p=432}}; {{harvnb|Palmer|1982|p=C00020}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is appended with introductory essays by Christgau, including a historical overview of rock and an explanation of his grading system; an A-plus record is defined as "an organically conceived masterpiece that repays prolonged listening", while "E records are frequently cited as proof that there is no God."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1982|p=C00020}}; {{harvnb|Ash|1985|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The last section of the book, titled "A Basic Record Library", has individual listings of what he regarded as the essential records of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, respectively.{{sfn|Wynar|Littlefield|Holte|1982|p=524}}

''Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies'' was first published in October 1981 by [[Ticknor &amp; Fields]] in [[New Haven]].{{sfn|Anon.|1981|p=12}} It was released at a time when bookstores saw an influx of rock music reference books as publishers competed with one another for the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon.|1981|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Marsh|1981|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book saw publication again the following year through the [[London]]-based [[Ebury Publishing|Vermilion]] imprint, and was [[reprint]]ed in 1985 by [[Houghton Mifflin]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1985|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Inge|Hall|2002|p=1528}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, ''Christgau's Record Guide'' was reprinted by [[Da Capo Press]] under the title ''Rock Albums of the Seventies: A Critical Guide''.{{sfn|Anon.|1991|p=7556}} It was followed by ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s]]'' that same year and ''Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s'' in 2000, forming a three-volume series of books compiling the capsule reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|2016|p=277}}; {{harvnb|Wolk|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of all three "Consumer Guide" collections were made available on Christgau's website after it went online in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matos|2011}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2002|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary reception ==
Reviewing the guide in 1982 for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] said it "stands out" in the recent slew of rock reference publications "because it is both obsessively complete and caustically outspoken". Palmer acknowledged Christgau's maturity, intelligence, and humor as a rock critic and wrote in sum, "although one won't always agree with Mr. Christgau, his book is a useful reference source for anyone with a serious interest in recent rock. It's a bit too cantankerously opinionated to deserve an A-plus, but it certainly repays reading and rereading."{{sfn|Palmer|1982|p=C00020}} ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'' magazine highly recommended the guide, arguing that it functions superbly as a read for spontaneous pleasure and a reference to rock's "major and minor classics" while highlighting the last section for "any librarian building a rock music collection".{{sfn|Anon.|1982|p=1374}} ''Illinois Libraries'', the journal publication of the [[Illinois Library Association]], advised [[Audiovisual education|AV librarians]] to consult the guide for help in selecting music recordings to archive. The journal's reviewer called Christgau "a senior critic if rock music has such a thing" and suggested readers focus more on his enthusiasms than dislikes: "As a record selector, you shouldn't care that Christgau looks down his nose at [[John Denver]], but his praise for [[Brian Eno|Eno]], [[The Ramones]], and [[Terry Garthwaite]] is well-founded and meaningful."{{sfn|Anon.|1983|p=456}} Lee Ash, general editor of the [[Haworth Press]]'s ''Special Collections'' journal, reviewed it as among books recommended to library [[special collections]]. The guide's "quality, content, scope, and evaluative notes" impressed Ash, who had a greater familiarity with discographies of early [[chamber music]] and only a mild enthusiasm for rock music. He concluded it was "an indispensable book" for music collection and providing "critical material for argument".{{sfn|Ash|1985|p=44}} In ''Year by Year in the Rock Era'' (1983), [[Herb Hendler]] named it among the books and magazines "relevant to youth and the rock era".{{sfn|Hendler|1983|p=328}}

{{quote box|quote="Christgau's reviews are evaluative in a way that few rock and roll record guides have been. He not only describes his personal likes and dislikes, but he evaluates style, influence, quality of lyrics, and musicianship as well as recording quality. He preserves all the evaluative quality of [[classical music]] record reviews while at the same time using to advantage the informal, colorful, and humorous side of the rock and roll [[music industry|industry]]."|source=—''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'', 1982{{sfn|Anon.|1982|p=1374}}|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px}}

Inspired by Christgau's writing in the early 1970s to pursue a journalistic career, Steve Simels ended up reviewing the book for ''[[Stereo Review]]'' in 1982, with qualified praise. He regarded Christgau as an indisputably well-written reviewer of fair-minded critical judgment, impressive witticisms and one-liners, and deeper interest in [[black music]] than most other white critics; but expressed reservations about what he perceived to be a mawkish sense of [[consciousness raising|feminist conscience]], knee jerk [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal politics]], and a predilection for conceptual music, as exemplified by "A" grades for all four Ramones albums. After laboring through the entire guide, Simels found himself "surprised to discover how even-handed [Christgau]'s been over the long haul", and summed the book up as a "worthwhile", if not entirely reliable, reference work.{{sfn|Simels|1982|p=28}} In ''[[Library Journal]]'', P. G. Feehan found Christgau to be a rigorous and smart critic while deeming the book an excellent companion to the contemporaneous ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'', particularly because of Christgau's extensive coverage of albums from fringe and import record labels. Feehan's one cavil was "his [[Four-letter word|four-letter-word]]-studded, [[Hip (slang)|hip]]/smart style, which may turn oft readers from west of the [[Hudson River]]".{{sfn|Feehan|1981|p=2126}} [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]] shared a similar sentiment in ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]'', believing some of Christgau's musings would be too complicated for newcomers to rock journalism. "But he remains one of pop's most astute critics", Browne concluded, adding that the guide functions best as a way of discovering good records—such as [[Bill Withers]]' ''[[Still Bill]]'' (1972)—obscured by the complex discography of 1970s popular music.{{sfn|Browne|1988}}

Some reviewers were more critical of the book. Fellow rock journalist [[Dave Marsh]], who had cited the "Consumer Guide" concept as an influence on his own ''Rolling Stone Record Guide'', gave the collection a B-plus in ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsh|Swenson|1979|p=xiii}}; {{harvnb|Marsh|1981|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He found Christgau "concise, contentious, condescending, provocative and pedagogic" with a shrewd sense of judgment and sharp insight, but complained of gratuitous, off-topic commentary and possible attempts to keep up with fashionable consensus, as there were no clear indications which reviews had been rewritten in retrospect for the book. Marsh ultimately questioned whether Christgau's tough-mindedness and ideological rigidity made him ideal for a guide book and asked what it means if "the most influential rock critic has never written a book that wasn't an anthology".{{sfn|Marsh|1981|p=18}} A response by Christgau was published in the magazine a few months later, in which he expressed appreciation for Marsh's "kind words" about the book and referred back to its introductory essay to answer questions posed in the review: "Though I don't indicate which reviews are newly written, I do state that I've reconsidered every record I had doubts about and stand by every judgment. As the co-editor of a competing consumer guide, Dave knows that the most important thing to do when you're reviewing records is to listen to them first."{{sfn|Christgau|1982|p=10}} British music scholar Paul Taylor issued different complaints about the book in his 1985 guide to literature on popular music, ''Popular Music Since 1955''. He called ''Christgau's Record Guide'' "an odd collection" for several reasons. "Included are certainly the best albums", he observed, "but it is the way in which the bad examples are selected that is dubious, and simply mediocre records are avoided."{{sfn|Taylor|1985|pp=50-51}}

== Legacy ==
''Christgau's Record Guide'' and similar review collections played a role in the rise of rock critics as tastemakers, promoters, and cultural historians in the music industry, whose standards were being reinvented by the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shuker|1994|p=70}}; {{harvnb|Weisbard|2018|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These critics constructed their own versions of what popular music academic Roy Shuker called "the traditional [[High culture|high]]/[[low culture]] split, usually around notions of artistic integrity, authenticity, and the nature of commercialism". As with ''The Rolling Stone Record Guide'', ''Christgau's Record Guide'' became popular with music aficionados, collectors, and both secondhand and specialty record stores, who kept copies of different volumes on hand. Christgau's guides to the 1970s and 1980s were "bibles in the field", as Shuker described, "establishing orthodoxies as to the relative value of various styles or genres and pantheons of artists".{{sfn|Shuker|1994|p=70}} While reviewing the 1980s volume for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in 1990, [[Greg Kot]] said ''Christgau's Record Guide'' and Ira Robbins' ''[[Trouser Press|Trouser Press Record Guide]]'' had been "the bibles of my existence as a rock critic".{{sfn|Kot|1990}} Christgau believed the 1970s guide to be the most "authoritative" in the series because the decade's smaller music market was easier to process, and also "a kind of canon-defining work, making the case for [[Van Morrison]] and, say, the [[McGarrigle sisters]], and against [[Black Sabbath]] and, say, [[Donny Hathaway]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cartwright|2001}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2002|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Eric Weisbard]]'s opinion, he "wasn't so much canonizing as using the endless listening party to find new wrinkles in his, and popular music's, unsummarizable aesthetic".{{sfn|Weisbard|2018|p=38}}

[[File:Pop Conference 2010 - Music in the '00s panel 03.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Christgau]] (right) and [[Chuck Eddy]] (left), one of several critics to officially recommend the book; photographed in 2010 at the [[Museum of Pop Culture]]'s Pop Conference|alt=Three white men sat behind a table holding microphones and place cards]]

''Christgau's Record Guide'' was published in an era when [[popular music studies]] were the domain of non-academic sources such as journalists rather than [[music department]]s and classical academics. It became widely popular in library catalogues by the late 1980s, along with other anthologized works of rock journalism by critics like [[Ellen Willis]] and [[Lester Bangs]]. The "Consumer Guide" reviews collected in the book were cited by Weisbard as part of rock and popular music's reinvention of critical standards. The end of the 20th century saw a paradigm shift, however, as paid journalism declined and academic departments gradually embraced popular music studies.{{sfn|Weisbard|2018|pp=27–28, 38}} In 1997, the [[Music Library Association]] used the book as a reference to prepare select rock recordings for ''A Basic Music Library: Essential Scores and Sound Recordings'', published by the [[American Library Association]] as a guide for librarians and other specialist collectors.{{sfn|Davis|Bristah|Gottlieb|Underwood|1997|pp=xi, 576}}

''Christgau's Record Guide'' has been regarded as "essential rock writing" by literary academic Cornel Bonca.{{sfn|Bonca|2014|p=155}} [[Chuck Eddy]] included it in his buying guide to books on rock music, while [[Jon Savage]] recommended it as a useful discography of that decade's punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eddy|1997|p=366}}; {{harvnb|Savage|2002|p=559}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, all three "Consumer Guide" books were collectively ranked fifth on ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s list of the 17 essential books about popular music; in the website's opinion, Christgau "made a sublime art of the capsule review, packing pithy observations and heartfelt appreciation into 150-word boxes".{{sfn|Murray|Phipps|Ryan|Modell|2006}} Michaelangelo Matos, a staff writer for the website, was greatly influenced by Christgau and said the first two volumes were books he had read most frequently as an adult. He highlighted Christgau's humor, ability to extract the essence of an album in a few sentences, and punctuating of reviews with letter grades, "a cunning rhetorical device as much as simple judgment".{{sfn|Matos|2011}} Fellow critic [[Rob Sheffield]] named the 1970s guide among his six favorite books in a list published by ''[[The Week]]'', believing other "obsessive music freaks" likely own it too. "This book is the all-time rock-'n'-roll argument starter", he said, "and I'll be arguing with it for the rest of my life."{{sfn|Sheffield|2010}} It was also read by novelists [[Dylan Hicks]] and [[Jonathan Lethem]] when they were young adults; Lethem later revealed that "for years, I calibrated my record collection against the grades ... jotting dissenting views in pencil in the margins".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|2017}}; {{harvnb|Lethem|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' placed it at number 47 on a list of the 100 greatest music books; an accompanying blurb read: "His '70s collection offers a fantastic primer on rock and soul's most fruitful decade. Whether or not you share Christgau's passion for [[Al Green]]'s 'Let's Get Married' or his disdain for all things [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], you'll love his pith and wit."{{sfn|Anon.|2016}}

=== Notes ===
# The 'Music' category is merely a guideline on commercialized uses of a particular format, not a technical assessment of its capabilities.  (For example, in terms of marketshare, MP3 and AAC dominate the personal audio market, though many other formats are comparably well suited to fill this role from a purely technical standpoint.)
# First public release date is first of either specification publishing or source releasing, or in the case of closed-specification, closed-source codecs, is the date of first binary releasing. Many developing codecs have pre-releases consisting of pre-1.0 versions and perhaps 1.0 release candidates (RCs), although 1.0 may not necessarily be the release version.
# Latest stable version is that of specification or reference tools.
# If there happens to be OSI licensed software available for a particular format, this does not necessarily permit one to use said codec free of charge. Likewise, if there is only proprietary licensed software available for a particular format, one might be able to use the codec free of charge.

==Languages features comparison==
The following table compares the number of languages which the following machine translation programs can translate between.
(Moses allows you to train translation models for any language pair, though collections of translated texts (parallel corpus) need to be provided.)

This is not an all-encompassing list. For example, Google and Omniscien Technologies (formerly Asia Online) have many more language pairs than those listed below. This is a general comparison of key languages only. A full and accurate list of language pairs supported by each product should be found on each of the products websites.

{{ProgLangCompare}}

This '''comparison of programming languages (strings)''' compares the features of [[string (computer science)|string]] [[data structure]]s or [[text string|text-string]] processing for over 52 various computer [[programming language]]s.

== Concatenation ==
Different languages use different symbols for the concatenation operator. Many languages use the "+" symbol, though several deviate from this.

===Common variants===

|}

===Unique variants===

* [[Awk]] uses the empty string: two expressions adjacent to each other are concatenated. This is called [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposition]]. [[Unix shell]]s have a similar syntax. [[Rexx]] uses this syntax for concatenation including an intervening space.
* [[C (programming language)|C]] (along with Python) allows juxtaposition for string literals, however, for strings stored as [[Character (computing)|character]] [[Array data structure|arrays]], the &lt;code&gt;[[strcat]]&lt;/code&gt; function must be used.
* [[COBOL]] uses the &lt;code&gt;STRING&lt;/code&gt; statement to concatenate string variables.
* [[MATLAB]] and [[Octave programming language|Octave]] use the syntax "&lt;code&gt;[x y]&lt;/code&gt;" to concatenate x and y.
* [[Visual Basic]] Versions 1 to 6 can also use the "&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;" sign but, this leads to ambiguity if a string representing a number and a number is added together.
* [[Microsoft Excel]] allows both "&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;" and the function "&lt;code&gt;=CONCATENATE(X,Y)&lt;/code&gt;".
*[[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] have the &lt;code&gt;[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format.html concat!]&lt;/code&gt;  macro but no specific operator. Also, the &lt;code&gt;[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format.html format!]&lt;/code&gt; macro is more put forward throughout documentation and examples.

== String literals ==
This section compares styles for declaring a [[string literal]].

=== Quoted interpolated ===
An expression is "interpolated" into a string when the compiler/interpreter evaluates it and inserts the result in its place.
&lt;!-- Before you add your favorite language to this table, make sure it's not listed in another section. --&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Syntax
! Language(s)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;$"hello, {name}"&lt;/tt&gt;
| C#
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;"Hello, $name!"&lt;/tt&gt;
| [[Bourne shell]], Perl, PHP, Windows PowerShell
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;qq(Hello, $name!)&lt;/tt&gt;
| Perl (alternate)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;"Hello, {$name}!"&lt;/tt&gt;
| PHP (alternate)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;"Hello, #{name}!"&lt;/tt&gt;
| CoffeeScript, Ruby
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;%Q(Hello, #{name}!)&lt;/tt&gt;
| Ruby (alternate)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;(format t "Hello, ~A" name)&lt;/tt&gt;
|Common Lisp
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;`Hello, ${name}!`&lt;/tt&gt;
| JavaScript (ECMAScript 6)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;"Hello, \(name)!"&lt;/tt&gt;
| Swift
|}

=== Escaped quotes ===
"Escaped" quotes means that a 'flag' symbol is used to warn that the character after the flag is used in the string rather than ending the string.
&lt;!-- Before you add your favorite language to this table, make sure it's not listed in another section. --&gt;

| C, C++, C#, D, F#, Java, JavaScript, Mathematica, Ocaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Rust, Swift, Wolfram Language, Ya
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'I said \'Hello, world!\''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| CoffeeScript, JavaScript (alternate), Python (alternate)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;"I said `"Hello, world!`""&lt;/tt&gt;
| Windows Powershell
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;"I said ^"Hello, world!^""&lt;/tt&gt;
| REBOL
|- 
| &lt;tt&gt;{I said "Hello, world!"}&lt;/tt&gt;

|-
| &lt;tt&gt;"I said, %"Hello, World!%""&lt;/tt&gt;
| Eiffel
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;!"I said \"Hello, world!\""&lt;/tt&gt;
| FreeBASIC
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;r#"I said "Hello, world!""#&lt;/tt&gt;
|Rust (alternate)
|}

=== Dual quoting ===
"Dual quoting" means that whenever a quote is used in a string, it is used twice, and one of them is discarded and the single quote is then used within the string.
&lt;!-- Before you add your favorite language to this table, make sure it's not listed in another section. --&gt;

| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'I said ''Hello, world!'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| Fortran, rc, COBOL, SQL, Pascal, Object Pascal, APL, Smalltalk
|}

=== Quoted raw ===
"Raw" means the compiler treats every character within the literal exactly as written, without processing any escapes or interpolations.

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| &lt;tt&gt;R"(Hello, world!)"&lt;/tt&gt;
| C++11
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;@"Hello, world!"&lt;/tt&gt;
| C#, F#
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;r"Hello, world!"&lt;/tt&gt;
| Cobra, D, Python, Rust
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;"Hello, world!"&lt;/tt&gt;
| Cobol, FreeBASIC, Pick Basic
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;`Hello, world!`&lt;/tt&gt;
| D, Go
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;raw"Hello, world!"&lt;/tt&gt;
| Scala
|}

=== Multiline string ===
Many languages have a syntax specifically intended for strings with multiple lines. In some of these languages, this syntax is a [[here document]] or "heredoc": A token representing the string is put in the middle of a line of code, but the code continues after the starting token and the string's content doesn't appear until the next line. In other languages, the string's content starts immediately after the starting token and the code continues after the string literal's terminator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4480">The '''Corbitis Atlas''' (sometimes called the '''Corbizzi''' or '''Combitis''') is a late 14th-century atlas of four [[portolan chart]]s, composed by an anonymous [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] cartographer, and currently held by the [[Biblioteca Marciana|Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana]] in [[Venice]], Italy.

== Background ==

The atlas was made by an anonymous [[Venice|Venetian]] cartographer, possibly by the same author of the [[Pinelli–Walckenaer Atlas]].  The Corbitis atlas was once believed to be dated 1368 (on account of a misreading of the label ''y(sole) 368'' on the fifth folio).  More recent readings suggest it was made between 1384 and 1410, with possible later emendations.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2011: [http://www.maphistory.info/PortolanAttributions.html#14ven online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The map has the simple inscription "''hec tabula ex testamento d[omi]nj nicholaj de co[r]bitis deuenit monast[eri]o cart[husiano] flore[ntino]''",&lt;ref&gt;Atlante Corbizzi presentation, at GeoWeb, Biblioteca Marciana, Venice [http://geoweb.venezia.sbn.it/cms/it/articoli/5-latlante-corbitis-combitis.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; implying the Corbitis atlas must have belonged to a certain Corbizzi family of Florence in the 14th century, and was held by the monastery of [[Certosa del Galluzzo]].  The inscription was previously misread as "Combitis", a name by which the atlas is sometimes referred to in older sources.

The Corbitis Atlas is currently held (Ms. It. VI 213) by the [[Biblioteca Marciana|Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana]] in [[Venice]], Italy.

== Features ==

The Corbitis atlas is composed of four [[portolan chart]]s, each measuring 31&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;19&amp;nbsp;cm, with each chart covering two folios:  
* P. 1 – covers the east Mediterranean and Black Sea.
* P. 2 – covers the central Mediterranean
* P. 3 – covers the west Mediterranean and the north Atlantic coast up to the British isles.
* P. 4 – covers the south Atlantic islands and west African coast.

The third sheet (North Atlantic) includes the mythical islands of ''y.fortunate'', ''y beate'', ''y.368'' and the ''montagna de sco brandan'' ([[Saint Brendan's Island]]).

The fourth sheet (South Atlantic) covers the west African coast down to ''inbugder'' ([[Cape Bojador]]) and several [[Atlantic islands]], using the same labels found already in earlier charts (e.g. the 1351 [[Medici Atlas]], the 1367 [[Pizzigani brothers]] chart, etc.). As laid out in the Corbitis atlas, the islands are:

* [[the Azores]], laid out vertically from north to south, and named: ''y de corui marini'' ([[Corvo Island|Corvo]]), ''liconigi'' ([[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]), ''sco zorzi'' ([[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]]),  ''y la uentura'' ([[Faial Island|Faial]]), ''li colonbi'' ([[Pico Island|Pico]]), ''y de brazil'' ([[Terceira Island|Terceira]]), ''caprara'' ([[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]]) and ''louo'' ([[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]]).
* the [[Madeira]] archipelago, with the names ''y de legname'' ([[Madeira]]), ''porto santo'' ([[Porto Santo]]), ''desertas'' ([[Desertas]]) and further south, ''y. saluaze'' ([[Savage Islands]]).
* the [[Canary islands]], only the central and eastern clusters are depicted, and include ''y de rinferno'' ([[Tenerife]]), ''y de canaria'' ([[Gran Canaria]]), ''y de uegi marini'' ([[Lobos Island|Lobos]]), ''forte uentura'' ([[Fuerteventura]]), ''Grazioxa'' ([[Graciosa, Canary Islands|Graciosa]]) and ''y de lanzaroto maloxeli'' ([[Lanzarote]]).

==Biography==
Edward Peacock, the only son of the agriculturalist Edward S. Peacock (died 1861), of [[Bottesford, North Lincolnshire|Bottesford]] Manor, near [[Brigg]], [[Lincolnshire]],&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;''The Catholic who's who &amp; yearbook'', 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lincs"&gt;''Lincolnshire at the opening of the 20th century'', 1907&lt;/ref&gt; was educated by private tutors.&lt;ref name="MOTT" /&gt; Influenced by [[John Henry Newman]], he converted to Catholicism as a young man.&lt;ref name="N&amp;Q" /&gt; In 1853 he married Lucy Anne (died 1887), daughter of John S. Weatherall of [[New York City]], a Captain in the [[United States Navy]],&lt;ref name="Lincs" /&gt; his son, Max, and daughter, [[Mabel Peacock]], also published works on the folklore of Lincolnshire.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Miss Mabel Peacock '''Folk-Lore''' vol. 31 4:338 (Dec. 1920)&lt;/ref&gt; He lived at Bottesford Manor and [[Kirton-in-Lindsey]], and in 1869 was appointed [[Justice of the Peace]] for the [[Parts of Lindsey]].&lt;ref&gt;''Men and women of the time'', 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

Peacock was elected Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1857, and was a corresponding member of the [[New England Historic Genealogical Society]] (1858) and the [[Société des antiquaires de Normandie]] (1871) and a member of the [[Surtees Society]], the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Anthropological Institute]], the English Dialect Society and the [[Early English Text Society]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/search?operation=search&amp;fieldidx1=dc.identifier&amp;fieldrel1=exact&amp;fieldcont1=%20PEA|title=The Edward Peacock Papers|last=|first=|date=13 May 2005|website=ELGAR: Electronic Gateway to Archives at Rylands|publisher=|access-date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s he served on the Committee of the [[London Library]].&lt;ref name="Lincs" /&gt; A prolific contributor to [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]]'s ''[[New English Dictionary]]'',&lt;ref name="Lincs" /&gt; he also wrote contributions to antiquarian journals and other periodicals: the ''[[Archaeologia (London)#Publications|Archaeologia]]'' and ''[[Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries|Proceedings]]'' of the Society of Antiquaries, the ''Journal of the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]]'', ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and the ''[[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|Dublin Review]]''. At the time of his death he left a biographical work of the known notable combatants of the [[English Civil War]] incomplete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Galerie des Modes et Costumes Français''''' is a series of [[fashion]] and [[costume]] [[Fashion plate|plates]] that was distributed in [[Paris]] from 1778 to 1787, during the reign of [[King Louis XVI of France]] and [[Marie Antoinette]]. The first collected volume, which was produced in 1779, had a title page which bore an [[Allegory|allegorical]] illustration as well as the full title of the collection: '''''Gallerie des modes et des costumes français dessinés d'après nature, Gravés par le plus Célèbres Artistes en ce genre, et colorés avec le plus grand soin par Madame Le Beau. Ouvrage commence en l'année 1778. A Paris, chez le Srs Esnauts et Rapilly rue St. Jacques à la Ville de coutances. Avec priv. Du Roi''''' (''Gallery of French fashions and costumes, drawn from life, engraved by the most celebrated artists in this medium, and hand-colored with the greatest care by Madame Le Beau;publication begun in 1778. Paris, Messrs. Esnauts and Rapilly, rue Satin-Jacques, at the sign of the City of Countances. Licensed by the King''). Importantly, this lengthier epithet indicates that the engravings of the ''Galerie'' (or ''Gallerie'', according to eighteenth-century spelling) were created "d'après nature," or "after nature," meaning that they were intended to represent what was actually worn in the streets of Paris during the latter part of the eighteenth century.

Although they vary in their presentation, the majority of images included in this series are ''tableaux vivants'' in which Parisians from various walks of life flaunt their quotidian fashions. These plates were completed by a group of prominent, eighteenth-century designers and engravers and are accompanied by descriptive text.  Although no private or public collection possesses a complete edition of the ''Galerie,'' the series is widely recognized for its high aesthetic value as well as its innovation within the overarching field of the fashion plate. René Colas, who compiled the major reference work ''Bibliographie générale du costume et de la mode'' (1933), calls it "the most beautiful collection in existence on the fashions of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Stella, ''Eighteenth-Century French Fashion Plates: 64 Engravings from the "Galerie des Modes," 1778-1787.'' Mineola: Dover Publications, Inc., 1982, p. v&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
''Galerie des modes'' was conceived during the final decades of the 1700s, a period when France was at the forefront of fashion innovation. To quote the historian [[James Laver]],  at this time "fashionable clothes...meant French clothes."&lt;ref&gt;Laver, James. ''Costume and Fashion: a Concise History.''London: Thame and Hudson, 1985, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; This supreme influence was undoubtedly strengthened by Queen Marie Antoinette as well as figures such as [[Rose Bertin]] (her dressmaker) and Monsieur [[Léonard Autié]] (her hairdresser) who were responsible for designing her iconic courtly wardrobe.&lt;ref&gt;Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, pp.70-72&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1770s (the decade during which Antoinette both married future king Louis-Auguste and assumed the title [[Queen of France and Navarre]]), women's dress came to exhibit greater variation than ever before; the fashion plate emerged under these conditions, as if to disseminate each budding trend.

Despite the prominence of eighteenth-century French style, the first true fashion plates were produced for ''[[The Lady's Magazine]]'', a British publication established in 1770. Prior to this date, the majority of prints published in France, such as [[Jean Dieu de Saint-Jean| Jean Dieu de Saint-Jean's]] engravings of male and female costume at the Court of Louis XIV, were "costume plates," which depicted clothes "after the event." Information concerning the latest fashion was difficult to come by, so difficult, in fact, that the aforementioned Rose Bertin would travel the Continent each year in an enormous ''berline'' containing dolls dressed in the most up-to-date ''modes de Paris''.&lt;ref&gt;Laver, James. ''Costume and Fashion: a Concise History.''London: Thame and Hudson, 1985, pp. 144-147&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly rendered "after nature", according to the everyday observations of prominent contemporary artists, the engravings of the ''Galerie'' thus responded to a growing demand for fashion news as well as a general gap in the market of French prints.

===Publication===
The innovative ''Galerie des modes'' is the most expansive and perhaps the best known project of the print merchants Jacques Esnauts (or Esnault) and Michel Rapilly. Both of these men hailed from the region of [[Normandy]] (Esnauts came from [[Magny-le-Désert]], and Rapilly came from [[Pirou]]), and the name of their publishing house, ''Ville de Coutances'', reflects these common origins. Located on the rue Saint-Jacques, this ''maison'' was established on July 6, 1773 following their brief stint at the nearby ''La Croix de Lorraine,'' where they had worked about three years earlier. Here the editors primarily published portraits of both historical and contemporary subjects; they began issuing the ''Galerie'' after obtaining a ''privilège'' on July 29, 1778 and continued to do so until 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Maxime Préaud, et al., ''Dictionnaire des éditeurs d'estampes à Paris sous l'Ancien Régime.''Promodis: Editions du Cercle de la Librairie, 1987, pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps in an effort to emulate the prints of ''The Lady's Magazine'', various engravers, hairdressers, and booksellers had, at this time, published a number of small almanacs on contemporary fashion. In formulating their ''Galerie'', Esnauts and Rapilly combined the subjects of these early volumes (which primarily focused on hairstyles) with the high quality of engraving found in series by the prolific [[Jean-Michel Moreau|Moreau le Jeune]], such as ''Suite d'estampes pour servir à l'Histoire des Moeurs et du Costume''.&lt;ref&gt;"La Galerie des modes." ''The Fashion Institute'', http://fashioninstitute.canalblog.com/archives/2011/03/10/20594418.html. Accessed 20 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting prints were distributed at random intervals, usually in sets (''cahiers'') of six, for the price of 36 [[French livre|livres]] (around 14 euro's in today's currency). Although many historians differ on the exact number of plates issued throughout publication, it is clear that over 400 engravings were issued in what was probably more than 70 portfolios. The first ''cahiers'' focused solely on hairstyles (''coiffures'') However, from the seventh ''cahier'' onwards, the series began to represent full outfits, illustrated from head-to-toe. The first collected volume of the ''Galerie'' (published in 1779) included 96 plates which came from the initial 16 portfolios of the series and was preceded by a forty-page descriptive introduction written by the lawyer G.François-Roger Molé.&lt;ref&gt;Delpierre, Madeleine. ''Dress in France in the Eighteenth Century.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===The Artists===
The ''Galerie'' implicated the work of numerous prominent visual artists.  In fact, the full title of the series, which was displayed in the epigraph of the collected 1779 volume, vaunts that its illustrations were drawn by "the most celebrated artists ("les plus célebres artistes") of the period, all of which had achieved the highest level of mastery in their medium. Recognized as some of the best fashion illustrators of their time, the designers tied to the project included Pierre Thomas Le Clerc (or Leclére), Claude Louis Desrais, François Louis Joseph Watteau (the grandnephew of [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau]]), Augustin de Saint-Aubin, and Jean-Baptiste Martin. Claude-Ferdinand Gaillard, Jean-Baptiste Patas, Pierre Andrien Le Beau, Nicolas Dupin, his son Jean Pierre Julien, Etienne Claude Voysard, Jean Alexandre Aveline, Pélissier, Jacques Le Roy, J.P. Vossinik (or Wossinik), and Jean-François Janinet appear to have been the enlisted engravers. In certain cases, the draftsman Martin seems to have acted as both the designer and engraver. To quote Peter McNeil and Sanda Miller's ''Fashion Writing and Criticism: History, Theory, Practice'', the compositions completed by each one of these artists demonstrate "the strong influence of figurative painting in their creation."&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, Peter, and Sanda Miller. ''Fashion Writing and Criticism: History, Theory, Practice.'' London and New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there exist no contracts that officially confirm the involvement of these artists, their respective contributions are marked by signatures.&lt;ref&gt;"La Galerie des modes." ''The Fashion Institute'', http://fashioninstitute.canalblog.com/archives/2011/03/10/20594418.html. Accessed 20 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the first six notebooks (which are not signed) as well as a few other plates which seem to have been released later in publication, the names of the designer and the engraver are found below each image included in the ''Galerie'', often with variations in spelling.  The name of the designer normally appears at the lower right of each plate, alongside the words "Dessiné par" or  "del." ("delineavit"). The name of the engraver, meanwhile, is typically found on the lower right beside the terms "Gravé par" (or "Gravée par), "sc." or "sculp." ("sculpsit").&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Stella. ''Eighteenth-Century French Fashion Plates: 64 Engravings from the "Galerie des Modes," 1778-1787.'' Mineola: Dover Publications, Inc., 1982, p. v&lt;/ref&gt; In certain rarer cases, the designer's name is accompanied by the word "inv." ("invenit"), meaning "invented it" or "devised it." This notation can often be viewed, for example, alongside the signature of Jean-Baptiste Martin and seems to have been used for the first time in the twenty-fourth ''cahier'' of the series.

===The Plates===
The prints of the ''Galerie'' were rendered through a process commonly implemented in fashion plate production. The designers provided the drawings for the series, and the engravers accordingly translated their creations into prints (in this case [[etching]]s, or line engravings). These images would then be [[Tints and shades|tinted]] by hand either prior to distribution (presumably by Madame Le Beau) or after distribution by a "home hobbyist".&lt;ref&gt;"Galerie des Modes et Costumes Français: 1778-1787," http://blog.fitnyc.edu/materialmode/2013/08/28/galerie-des-modes-et-costumes-francais-1778-1787/. Accessed 26 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The prints, for this reason, were sold both in color and in black and white. 
 
Plates from the ''Galerie'' can be divided into essentially five categories of composition. Among suites depicting ''coiffures,'' three different formate emerge, all of which feature isolated figures illustrated from the shoulders up. In the first six ''cahiers'' of the ''Galerie'', the designer (whose identity is not confirmed) has rendered four figures that appear in distinct rectangular quadrants. In later four-figure, ''coiffure''-oriented plates, the subjects are distinguished by oval-shaped frames. Particularly in plates depicting more than four hairstyles (some contain twelve or sixteen), figures are separated by individual rectangles as well as overlaid elliptical frames.

Among suites depicting entire outfits ("''habillemens à la mode''"), there emerge essentially two different compositions. In most cases, one to three full-length figures appear in what is supposed to be a general, quotidian scene. Designed to showcase the fashions worn by these characters (rather than any complex narrative action), the backgrounds of these plates contain few elements, if any at all. Though figures are sometimes drawn in a specific setting, such as a garden, patio, or dressing room, they are depicted, perhaps more often, in a nondescript indoor or outdoor space with a mostly blank background. In certain later prints, figures are drawn individually, in frames rendered at the center of the composition on a rather small scale. This inner pictorial space is surrounded by garments that, relative to the depicted figure, appear larger than life. In some cases, these accoutrements are labeled with numbers corresponding to captions at the bottom of the plate.

Captions, indeed, are found on practically every print included in the ''Galerie''. On plates with full-outfit compositions, text is printed directly below each image andusually above some variation of the inscription, "A Paris chez Esnauts et Rapilly rue St Jacques, à la Ville de Countances. Avec Priv du Roi (or A.P.D.R.)," which gives readers general information about publication. On certain plates devoted to ''coiffures'', captions appear in the space of the illustrated figures. Though always descriptive in nature, the content of these captions varies from plate to plate. In some cases, the text simply focuses on the intricacies of the represented fashions. However, in others, it gives a sense of narrative and highlights the identity of the depicted character. Throughout the series, the length of these captions also has a tendency to fluctuate.

===The Subjects===
In the late eighteenth century the courtly presence of Marie Antoinette was, as mentioned, absolutely instrumental to augmenting France's influence on the world of fashion at large. The subjects of the ''Galerie'', however, are by no means relegated to "ladies of the highest rank."&lt;ref&gt;Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to noblewomen, the series represents members of the bourgeoisie and the serving class. (To quote the exhibition catalogue, ''New for Now: The Origin of Fashion Magazines'', published by the Rijksmuseum, "the costumier and the housemaid also appear" in certain plates&lt;ref&gt;Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;) Though outnumbered by these other subjects, the series also devotes some of its prints to the fashions of men and children.

These drawings were touted as "designs after nature" ("''dessinés d'après nature''"), reflecting the fact that the designers who contributed to the series would draw from life. Their compositions were based on the most fashionable garments and hairstyles of period, which they would often observe with their own eyes at popular locales, such as parks, theaters, and even the ''ateliers'' of fashionable dressmakers and tailors.&lt;ref&gt;Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking ever so slightly from this mold, several plates found within the series also depict costumes made for eighteenth-century productions of theater and ballet, many of which were designed by P.N Sarrazin who is listed in various captions as the "'Costumier des Princes"" ("Costume designer of Princes").

==Impact==
''Galerie des Modes'' is a huge monument to the world of fashion. As highlighted in ''New for Now'', the ''Galerie'' was circulated among a wide array of "fashion-conscious" audiences, both in France and abroad, and would ultimately go down in history as "the best and largest" fashion plate series of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Among contemporary audiences, the ''Galerie'' is often regarded as the first illustrated fashion journal. However, the series actually cannot be defined as a true magazine, at least according to the modern definition of the term. The ''Cabinet des Modes ou les Modes Nouvelles'', which was first launched in 1785 and, a year later, came to be called the ''Magazin des Modes Nouvelle Françaises et Anglaises'', is recognized as the first real fashion magazine, for, in contrast to the sporadically distributed ''Galerie des Modes'', it was issued regularly (every fortnight) and reproduced typographically, contained illustrations, and focused exclusively on fashion and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the original prints of ''Galerie'' are extremely rare, particularly in a comprehensively compiled form. Between 1911 and 1914, Paul Cornu and Emile Lévy published a reproduction of the series complete with hand-colored plates as well as text sourced from eighteenth-century periodicals and literature, though only 325 plates are accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;"Galerie des Modes et Costumes Français: 1778-1787," http://blog.fitnyc.edu/materialmode/2013/08/28/galerie-des-modes-et-costumes-francais-1778-1787/. Accessed 26 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This rare edition can be read at a select number prominent research institutions, including [[Brooklyn Museum]] Library where one can also examine the 24-plate volume compiled and by Roger-Armand Weigert. The [[Frick Art Reference Library]], the [[Brooklyn Museum]], the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] (FIT), the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFA) in [[Boston]], and the [[British Museum]] also house significant portions of the ''Galerie''. None, however, possess a complete run of the series.

In collections that have not been arranged as coherent volumes such as those compiled by Cornu and Weigert, each ''cahier'' seems to be categorized by a letter (or letters) which label all of its corresponding prints, and each of these prints is marked with a number, indicating its place in the ''Galerie'' as a whole. The first plate of each ''cahier'' also tends to bear a categorical epithet, such as "9e Cahier des Costumes Français. 3e Suite d'Habillmens a la mode," that gives the reader basic information about its content. This system of notation, however, has not been completely resolved, for certain prints appear without numbers, letters, signatures, or, in some cases, all the above. As a result, many ''cahiers'' have been left with an incomplete appearance. Furthermore, prints that have been arranged in the customary suite of six do not always adhere to a consistent theme or compositional format. Regardless of their degree of accuracy and fidelity, the existence of these posthumous editions reflects the persistent importance of the ''Galerie'' in the worlds of fashion, costume, and, more generally, [[visual culture]].

The '''''Salón de Reinos''''' (translated as "Hall of the Kingdoms" or "Hall of Realms") or '''''salón grande''''' ("great hall") is a 17th-century building in [[Madrid]], originally a wing of the [[Buen Retiro Palace]]. The Salón de Reinos and the [[Casón del Buen Retiro]] are the only survivors of the original grand scheme of the palace.
Built between 1630 and 1635, the Hall of Realms housed the largest paintings in the royal collection, now all in the [[Museo del Prado]]. It is named after its paintings of the [[Coat of arms of Spain|coats of arms]] of the 24 kingdoms which formed the [[Kingdom of Spain]] at the time of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. 

The building served as the [[Army Museum of Toledo|''Museo del Ejército'']] until 2010 when the military collections were put on display at the [[Alcázar of Toledo]].
The Prado Museum acquired the vacant building to display part of its collections and made its renovation the subject of an architectural competition.  The commission to redesign the space as part of the campus of the art museum was won by the British firm [[Foster and Partners]] and the Spanish firm [[Rubio Arquitectura]].&lt;ref name="fr"&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Foster + Partners and Rubio Arquitectura win international Prado Museum competition |date=2016 |url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/es/news/archive/2016/11/foster-plus-partners-and-rubio-arquitectura-win-international-prado-museum-competition/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decoration of the room==
[[File:Salón de Reinos (Madrid) 12.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Exterior of the Salón de Reinos]]
Originally intended as a place from which the king could watch and assist in theatrical productions in the courtyard, the Salón de Reinos was turned into a throne room when it was decided to turn Buen Retiro into a full palace. It was still used for spectacles and [[soiree]]s, so a balcony was added so that festivities could be viewed from above, but as a throne room it had to impress ambassadors and other distinguished members of the courts of Europe who visited the palace. This meant the room's decoration was the most sumptuous in the whole palace, well-illuminated by several windows between jaspers tables and silver lions and with a ceiling covered in [[grotesque]]s. There were also wall paintings full of political symbolism with the ultimate aim of glorifying Philip IV. The designer of the room's decorative programme is unknown, though ultimate responsibility lay in the hands of the [[Conde-Duque de Olivares|conde duque de Olivares]] himself, along with [[Jerónimo de Villanueva]] (who gave the lions and effected the payments) and with the intellectual advice of [[Francisco de Rioja]] and of the painters closest to Philip and Olivares, [[Juan Bautista Maíno]] and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]].

The Salón de Reinos is rectangular in plan, with narrow doors on the two longer sides. On its north and south sides hung twelve paintings (one now lost) on the theme of the major battles won by the armies of Philip IV in the early years of his reign. Between these paintings, and above the Salón's windows, were ten paintings by [[Francisco Zurbarán|Zurbarán]] showing the [[labours of Hercules]], comparing the exploits of the demi-god Hercules (then considered as the ancestor of the [[House of Habsburg]]) with those of the king. 

The battle paintings juxtaposed examples by artists of the older generation such as [[Vicente Carducho]] or [[Eugenio Cajés]] (who had both served [[Philip III of Spain]]) with ones by younger artists trained in naturalism such as [[Juan Bautista Maíno]], Zurbarán (summoned from [[Seville]] for this very commission), [[Jusepe Leonardo]], [[Félix Castelo]] (who did his first major work there), [[Antonio de Pereda]] and especially Velázquez, Philip IV's favourite.

At the east and west ends were portraits by Velázquez of the royal family. The series was made up of equestrian portraits of Philip III and his wife [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret of Austria]] (both on the west all) and equestrian portraits of Philip IV and his wife [[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Elisabeth of France]] either side their son and heir [[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Balthasar Charles]] (all three on the east wall). These five paintings' distribution and staggered positioning exemplified the concepts of hereditary monarchy and dynastic continuity.

Based on the titles held by Philip IV, the hall also contained shields showing the coats of arms of the twenty-four kingdoms that made up his kingdom: in alphabetical order, Algarbe, Algeciras, Aragón, Castilla, Cerdeña, Dos Sicilias, Galicia, Gibraltar, Granada, Indias Orientales y Occidentales, Islas de Canarias, Islas y Tierra firme del Mar Oceano, Jaén, Jerusalén, León, Murcia, Navarra, Portugal, Sevilla, Toledo and Valencia. (Philip IV also held the titles of [[Archduke of Austria]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], [[Duke of Brabant]], [[Duke of Milan]], [[House of Habsburg|Count of Habsburg]], [[Count of Flanders]], Count of Tyrol, Count of Barcelona and Lord of Vizcaya and of Molina.)

==Later history==
[[File:Spanish capture of St Kitts.jpg|thumb|250px|''The recovery of the island of San Cristobal by Don Frederic of Toledo'' by [[Felix Castelo]].]]
The Salón de Reinos, and the Salón de Fiestas (now the [[Casón del Buen Retiro]]) were the only parts of the palace to survive the intense French bombardment between 1808 and 1814 during the [[Peninsular War]] and the appearance of the buildings were transformed by post-war rebuilding.

For a long time the Salón de Reinos housed the Museo del Ejército. In the early 21st century the Spanish Ministry of Culture launched a series of studies and reforms to move the museum to a larger, better and more modern setting at the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], giving the Hall of Realms over to the [[Prado]], which already had responsibility for the Casón and which could then return the Salón de Reinos to its 17th-century appearance and reinstate the paintings originally meant for it. This would be all the easier since the wall paintings, ceiling paintings and grotesques were still well preserved, but the initial proposal caused a debate on the building's final use, with some opposing it since it would separate works by Velázquez such as ''The Surrender of Breda'' from his other works in the Prado, and others since they felt that such a move was unjustified just to recreate a single room.

The Museo del Ejército reopened in Toledo in July 2010, though the works on the Salón de Reinos require more time.
The option taken was to give over the Salón de Reinos and its adjoining rooms to various activities such as temporary exhibitions or exhibiting medium-quality items which there is now room to display in the Prado.
Originally, the tender for the work was expected to be granted in 2009 or 2010, with the works occurring from 2010 to 2012, with a budget of 42.5 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}}

It is now intended that the addition of this building to the Museo del Prado’s Campus, will form part of the Museum’s 200th anniversary celebrations in 2019.&lt;ref name="fr"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 material related to the project was included in an exhibition in the [[Telefónica Building]], Madrid, about [[Norman Foster]]. A comparison was drawn with an earlier project by the architect, the [[Carré d'Art]] in [[Nîmes]]. 

In 2017 the artist [[Cai Guo-Qiang]] used the Hall of Realms for 8 works of art using gun-powder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/cai-guo-qiang-prado-1127741 See Cai Quo-Qiang Turn El Prado’s Hall of Realms Into a Fiery Factory of Explosive Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Henry George Liddell.jpg|thumb|Henry Liddell, in an 1858 portrait]]

'''Henry George Liddell''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|d|əl}};&lt;ref&gt;On p. 57, Naiditch quotes "a variant of the ''Balliol Rhymes'' (p. 29): 'I am the Dean, and this is Mrs Liddell: / She plays the first, and I the second fiddle.'" {{cite journal|last1=Naiditch|first1=P.

[[Lewis Carroll]] wrote ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' for Henry Liddell's daughter [[Alice Liddell|Alice]].

==Biography==

Liddell received his education at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] and Christ Church, Oxford. He gained a [[British undergraduate degree classification|double first]] degree in 1833, then became a college tutor, and was ordained in 1838.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Liddell, Henry George|volume=16|page=588}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HenryLiddell.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Henry Liddell, in an 1891 portrait by [[Hubert von Herkomer|Sir Hubert von Herkomer]]]]
Liddell was Headmaster of [[Westminster School]] from 1846 to 1855. Meanwhile, his life work, the great [[lexicon]] (based on the German work of [[Franz Passow]]), which he and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] began as early as 1834, had made good progress, and the first edition of ''Liddell and Scott's Lexicon'' appeared in 1843. It immediately became the standard Greek–English dictionary, with the 8th edition published in 1897.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

As Headmaster of Westminster Liddell enjoyed a period of great success, followed by trouble due to the outbreak of fever and cholera in the school. In 1855 he accepted the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford. In the same year he brought out his ''History of Ancient Rome'' and took a very active part in the first Oxford University Commission. His tall figure, fine presence and aristocratic mien were for many years associated with all that was characteristic of Oxford life. Coming just at the transition period when the "old Christ Church," which [[Edward Bouverie Pusey|Pusey]] strove so hard to preserve, was inevitably becoming broader and more liberal, it was chiefly due to Liddell that necessary changes were effected with the minimum of friction. 

In 1859 Liddell welcomed the then [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] when he matriculated at Christ Church, being the first holder of that title who had matriculated since [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; While Liddell was Dean of Christ Church, he arranged for the building of a new choir school and classrooms for the staff and pupils of [[Christ Church Cathedral School]] on its present site. Before then the school was housed within Christ Church itself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In July 1846, Liddell married Lorina Reeve (1826-1910), with whom he had nine children including [[Alice Liddell]] (1852-1934) of [[Lewis Carroll]] fame.

In conjunction with Sir [[Henry Acland]], Liddell did much to encourage the study of art at Oxford, and his taste and judgment gained him the admiration and friendship of [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]. In 1891, owing to advancing years, he resigned the deanery. The last years of his life were spent at [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]], where he died on 18 January 1898.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Two roads in Ascot, Liddell Way and Carroll Crescent honour the relationship between Henry Liddell and Lewis Carroll.

==Anecdotes==
[[File:Liddell caricature.jpg|thumb|upright|Liddell as caricatured by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|'Ape']] in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1875)]]
Liddell was an Oxford "character" in later years. He figures in contemporary undergraduate [[doggerel]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Numberland: His Fantastical Mathematical Logical Life | first=Robin | last=Wilson | authorlink=Robin Wilson (mathematician) | publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] | location= UK | year=2008 | isbn=978-0141016108 | page=83 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7Pk1HLZkIwC&amp;pg=PT83&amp;lpg=PT83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the Broad,&lt;br/&gt;

We are the University.}}

The Victorian journalist, [[George W. E. Russell]] (1853–1919), conveys something of Liddell's image:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography | year=1914 | page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Vice-Chancellor who matriculated me [1872] was the majestic Liddell, who, with his six feet of stately height draped in scarlet, his 'argent aureole' of white hair, and his three silver maces borne before him, always helped me to understand what [[Sydney Smith]] meant when he said, of some nonsensical proposition, that no power on earth, save and except the Dean of Christ Church, should induce him to believe it.}}

==Parents and grandparents==
His father was Henry Liddell, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Easington, County Durham|Easington]] (1787–1872), the younger son of [[Sir Henry Liddell, 5th Baronet]] (1749–1791) and the former Elizabeth Steele. His father's elder brother, [[Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth|Sir Thomas Liddell, 6th Baronet]] (1775–1855), was raised to the [[Peerage]] as [[Baron Ravensworth]] in 1821.

His mother was the former Charlotte Lyon (1785–1871), a daughter of Thomas Lyon (1741–1796) (who was the youngest son of the [[Thomas Lyon, 8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]) and the former Mary Wren (died 1811).

==Marriage and children==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">In Turkic mythology, '''Hortdan''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: ''Xortdan'', Turkish: ''Hortlak'', [[Tuva]]n: ''Хортан'') is the troubled soul of the dead rising from the grave.&lt;ref&gt;Haqqında - [http://haqqinda.net/xortdan/ "Xortdan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021143036/http://haqqinda.net/xortdan/ |date=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hortdan can be living people with certain magical properties. Some of the properties of the Hortdan include: the ability to transform into an animal, invisibility, and the propensity to drain the vitality of victims via blood loss. Hortdans are also known as immortal [[vampires]]. 

==Origin==
The Hortdans are creatures of [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] [[mythology]], as a representation of evil spirits, the spirits of the dead. As these stories were transmitted only by [[oral tradition]], legend has lost its original substance, and [[Azerbaijani people]] have transformed Xortdan into bloodthirsty creatures.

Hortdans are fictional undead creatures regularly encountered in horror and fantasy themed narratives. They are typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh in some depictions.

==Etymology==
The name Hortdan (or Hortlak) is related to the Turkic verb ''hortlamak'',&lt;ref&gt;Türk Mitolojisi Ansiklopedik Sözlük, Celal Beydili, Yurt Yayınevi (Page - 243)&lt;/ref&gt; which in Turkish  means ''get out'' and especially ''get out of the grave''.

==Different types of Hortdan==
* '''Hortlak''' is the name of this creature in Turkish (Anatolian) culture. And refers to a [[Zombie|Zombi]]-like entity. 
* '''Xortdan''' is in Azerbaijani folklore same of [[vampire]].
* '''Hortan''' (sometimes Аза-Хортан "Aza-Hortan") is a [[poltergeist]] like an evil spirit in Tuva tradition.

== History ==

The company was founded in December 2005 by entrepreneurs Adrian Walton and Lesley Etienne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/05655962|title=ICELOLLY MARKETING LIMITED - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the company underwent a management buyout backed by Palatine Private Equity for £17 million.&lt;ref name=17m_1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Phil|title=£17m management buyout of Icelolly completed|url=http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2013/09/04/45166/17m+management+buyout+of+icelolly+completed.html|accessdate=22 June 2015|work=travelweekly|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, icelolly.com has relocated their offices from [[Wyke]], [[Bradford]] to [[Leeds]] city centre, [[West Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=cityswitch&gt;{{cite news|title=£17m buyout sees Icelolly.com switch cities to open new HQ|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/business-news/17m-buyout-sees-icelolly-com-switch-cities-to-open-new-hq-1-6450164|accessdate=22 June 2015|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Andrew Latham replaced outgoing CEO Dave Clayton on an interim basis in May 2014 and was converted to a permanent position in December of that year.&lt;ref name="interimCEO"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Edward|title=Dave Clayton leaves icelolly.com|url=http://www.ttgdigital.com/news/dave-clayton-leaves-icelollycom/4691350.article|accessdate=22 June 2015|work=TTG Digital|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="permanentCEO"&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrew Latham made permanent Icelolly.com chief executive|url=http://www.ttgdigital.com/news/andrew-latham-made-permanent-icelollycom-chief-executive/4694548.article|accessdate=22 June 2015|work=TTG Digital|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, icelolly.com underwent a major rebrand, during which their logo and website were both been given an extensive makeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelbulletin.co.uk/news-mainmenu/icelolly-relaunches-with-new-brand-identitiy|title=Travel Bulletin - Icelolly relaunches with new brand identitiy|website=www.travelbulletin.co.uk|language=pl|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/july-2014/lco-refreshes-icelolly-identity/|title=L&amp;CO refreshes Icelolly identity - Design Week|date=2014-07-07|work=Design Week|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product ==
In April 2013, icelolly.com launched a 'Holiday Finder' app for users to compare holiday offers from their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/928521/compare-thousands-of-deals-with-the-icelolly-com-app/|title=Compare thousands of deals with the icelolly.com app|date=2013-08-06|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app was updated in April 2018 to include more travel providers and a click to book function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travolution.com/articles/107017/icelollycom-releases-updated-version-of-its-holiday-finder-app|title=releases updated version of its Holiday Finder app|last=Hayhurst|first=Lee|date=2018-04-11|website=Travel Weekly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Black Friday success in late 2016, a Top Deals* subsection of the site was launched, whereby a selection of handpicked holiday offers are listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2017/03/13/icelollycom-targets-growth-with-new-handpicked-offers-service|title=icelolly.com targets growth with new handpicked offers service|last=News|first=Bdaily Business|work=Bdaily Business News|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sponsorship and advertising campaigns ==
In Summer 2011, icelolly.com ran a tongue-in-cheek commercial, featuring a female heroine relaxing by a pool while surreptitiously ‘checking out’ four male stereotypes, with Hot Chocolate’s ''You Sexy Thing'' playing in the background and a voice over from Gavin and Stacey’s Joanna Page.&lt;ref name="Icelolly.com lands top industry award" /&gt;

The company partnered with ITV in 2013, and has since provided holiday prizes to popular TV game shows, including 'Ant &amp; Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.' In 2018, icelolly.com sponsored 'Change Your Tune,' 'Dickinson’s Real Deal' and STV’s 'Judge Rinder.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/300756/icelollycom-strengthens-itv-ties-with-series-of-programme-sponsorships|title=Icelolly.com strengthens ITV ties with series of programme sponsorships|last=Hayhurst|first=Lee|date=2018-03-28|website=Travel Weekly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, icelolly.com launched a new advertising campaign under the strap line "Compare. Call. Save", the centre of which is a video advert featuring an ice cream van and a [[squirrel]]. The advert was first launched on YouTube before making its television debut on [[Boxing Day]] 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/59217/icelolly-launches-multi-channel-marketing-campaign|title = Icelolly launches multi-channel marketing campaign|date = 19 January 2016|access-date = 20 January 2016|website = Travel Weekly|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kaffir Folk-lore: A Selection from the Traditional Tales''''' is a book by [[George McCall Theal]] published in 1886.  It is sometimes called '''''Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk-lore''''' or even '''''Xhosa Folk-lore''''' to avoid the word [[Kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]], which has since become a derogatory term (in the time the book was written, however, it was frequently used to refer to the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] people{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}).

The book contains twenty-three Xhosa [[folklore|folk-tales]] and a list of common [[proverb]]s, all of which were collected from, recorded by, and verified by native Xhosa whom Theal questioned.  It also includes several pages of [[footnotes]] written by Theal himself, mainly translating Xhosa words and explaining parts of Xhosa culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1579">'''''Kruger v Coetzee'''''&lt;ref&gt;1966 (2) SA 428 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African law, in particular in the law of delict and on the question of negligence.

In an action for damages alleged to have been caused by the defendant's negligence, ''culpa'' arises, for the purposes of liability, only if a ''diligens paterfamilias'' in the position of the defendant not only would have foreseen the reasonable possibility of his conduct injuring another in his person or property and causing him patrimonial loss, but would also have taken reasonable steps to guard against such an occurrence, and if the defendant failed to take such steps.

Whether a ''diligens paterfamilias'' in the position of the person concerned would take any guarding steps at all, and, if so, what steps would be reasonable, must always depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.

Where the defendant has foreseen the possibility and taken certain steps, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove that there were further steps which he could and should have taken.

The decision in the Eastern Cape Division, in ''Coetzee v Kruger'',&lt;ref&gt;1965 (3) F S.A. 677&lt;/ref&gt; was by this reasoning reversed.

The '''''Linguistic Bibliography''''' / '''''Bibliographie Linguistique''''' is an annual publication which first appeared in 1949. The publication provides comprehensive bibliographical descriptions of publications in [[theoretical linguistics]], with about 20,000 items added per year. Since 2002, the database has also been available online, as Linguistic Bibliography Online, and contains data from 1993 onward.

==Overview==
The ''Linguistic Bibliography'' covers all disciplines of [[theoretical linguistics]], both general and [[language]] specific, from all geographical areas, with the emphasis on lesser-known [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[non-Indo-European]] [[languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic Bibliography Online|url=https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Catalogue/FullDescription/Index/944|publisher=JISC Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'' and ''Linguistic Bibliography Online'' are published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] Leiden, Netherlands, on the authority of the Permanent International Committee of Linguists and under the auspices of the [[International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies]].&lt;ref name=brill&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic Bibliography|url=http://bibliographies.brillonline.com/browse/linguistic-bibliography|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1993, the online edition contained all entries of the printed volumes, with new records added on a monthly basis. Annual volumes of the ''Linguistic Bibliography'' are still published in print.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

Linguistic Bibliography's Online [[database]] contains over 360,000 records and is cross-searchable. It is updated 10 times per year with around 20,000 new records added per year. The database contains over 114,000 person's names, 2,400 journals and 10,000 publishers with records classified according to language and subject descriptors. Titles are given in their original language, with English translations provided of titles in lesser-known languages. Only scientific publications are included, and applied linguistic publications are listed only if they have theoretical implications.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

The Bibliography is published on the authority of the Permanent International Committee of Linguistics (CIPL) and is in accordance with the rules of the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD) and the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] (IFLA). Contributors include a network of international specialists, with some of these experts responsible for a specific field of linguistics, while others cover the production of their home country.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

The languages of the world are grouped under large categories, e.g. "Semitic". A separate section for [[Pidgin]] and [[Creole language]]s was added in 1952. Though linguists today study [[Sign language|sign languages]] as true languages, the category "Sign languages" was not added until the 1988 volume, when it appeared with 39 entries.

A '''magical formula''' is generally a word whose meaning illustrates principles and degrees of understanding that are often difficult to relay using other forms of speech or writing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It is a concise means to communicate very abstract information through the medium of a word or phrase.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In the human practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] a [[magic spell]] is used or "cast" by saying it in the proper fashion or context (in [[magic (gaming)|gaming]], by a character generally called a "[[Spellcaster (character class)|spellcaster]]").

These words often have no intrinsic meaning in and of themselves.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However, when deconstructed, each individual letter may refer to some universal concept found in the system that the formula appears.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Additionally, in grouping certain letters together one is able to display meaningful sequences that are considered to be of value to the spiritual system that utilizes them (e.g. spiritual hierarchies, historiographic data, or psychological stages).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Many can be understood only by using various literal [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] techniques such as [[gematria]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Formulae==

*'''[[Abracadabra]]''' a common [[incantation]] used by [[stage magicians]] and used in ancient times as a cure for fevers and inflammations.
*'''[[Abrahadabra|ABRAHADABRA]]'''. This formula, used by author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]], is the Word of the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon of Horus]] and represents the accomplishment of the [[Great Work]].
*'''[[Agape|AGAPE]]'''. A Greek word meaning "Love," whose enumeration in Greek [[isopsephy]] equals 93.
*'''[[AGLA]]'''. Hebrew name of God constructed through [[notariqon]].
*'''[[Elohim|ALHIM]]'''. This is a spelling of [[Elohim]], a Hebrew name of God—or "Gods" in this case, since the spelling makes the name a masculine plural of the feminine noun. According to Crowley, it is a formula best used for consecration, since it "is the breath of benediction, yet so potent that it can give life to clay and light to darkness."&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'', p.155&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''AUMGN'''. Augmented form of the Sanskrit [[mantra]] [[Om|Aum]].
*'''[[Babalon|BABALON]]'''. A [[Babalon|goddess]] in [[Thelema]], whose name means "Gate of the Great God ON" according to ''Liber Samekh''.
*'''HRILIU'''. used in [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass]]
*'''[[Demiurge|IAO]], [[Abraxas]]'''. ΙΑΩ [[Isis]] Apophis [[apep]] [[Osiris]]
*'''[[Tetragrammaton|IHVH]]'''. See YHVH.
*'''INRI'''. {{Hebrew|ינרי}} Yod, Nun, Resh, Yod. Hebrew translation of the Christian [[Jesus, King of the Jews]] formula,&lt;ref&gt;777 p. 16-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 37(30) Repletion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;sepher sephiroth&lt;/ref&gt; This magical formula represents the passing of life to death and [[Resurrection]], Used in many rituals including the [[Rose Cross]] and [[the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram]] by both [[O.T.O]], [[A∴A∴]] and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]],&lt;ref name="Regardie1971vIIp204"&gt;The golden dawn, v. III p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; see also [[deminuge|IAO]], [[Abraxas]] ΙΑΩ,
*'''[[IPSOS]]'''. the word of the [[aeon of Ma'at]] other spellings include IPSOSh, IPShOS, IPShOSh from ''[[Liber Pennae Praenumbra]]'' by [[Nema (occultist)|Nema]].&lt;ref&gt;MAAT MAGICK p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Jahbulon|JAHBULON]]'''.
*'''LVX'''. Lit.= Latin word; Lux, or light. Part of the formula of the, "analysis of the key word," used in the [[Adeptus Minor]] ritual of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, in which it is described in a ritualized manner,&lt;ref name="Regardie1971vIIp204"/&gt; linking each letter with an Egyptian [[Godform]]. Perhaps most popularized amongst the occult community at large by being included as the opening part to the [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram]] in [[Donald Michael Kraig]]'s bestselling book, "Modern Magick," (Llewellyn Publications, 1989.)&lt;ref name="Kraig1989p27"&gt;Kraig (1989), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; "LVX," may also be used as a closing to a letter, in the same manner as the word, "Sincerely," amongst initiates of some [[ceremonial magic]] orders.
*'''MVAVM'''. Neophyte word and formula according to [[Frater Achad]].
*'''ON'''. Looks like the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name for [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], from an original meaning "pillar" or "pillars". This city claimed to hold the [[benben|Primeval Mound]] where [[Atum]] (sometimes identified with the mound) created the world.&lt;ref&gt;Utterance 600 in the Pyramid Texts, quoted at http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html#Atum {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220200810/http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html |date=2008-12-20 }} retrieved November 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By Crowley's numeration, ON equals the Hebrew word [[Samekh#Hebrew Samekh|Samekh]] (a prop or support), which also serves as the name of a Hebrew letter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sepher Sephiroth]]'' for the number 120, in ''777 and other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]]'''. The formula [[Tetragrammaton]] refers to the four-letter Hebrew name of God, [[Jehovah]], or Yod, He, Waw, He (יהוה). These letters have been attributed to numerous four-part symbols, including the classic elements, cardinal directions, [[Tarot]] suits, and so on. The formula is often represented by the Father (Yod) joining with the Mother (He), to produce the Son (Waw) and the Daughter (He-final). Within [[Yoga]] it is possible to see this formula as describing the union of the subject and the object to produce the exalted state of mind and the resulting ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, ''[[Eight Lectures on Yoga]]'', "First Lecture"&lt;/ref&gt; Within a [[Thelemic]] framework, the first letter can also be interpreted as the original creative force, or [[Hadit]], who "marries" the eternally fertile, co-equal female force, [[Nuit]], resulting in the twins, [[Ra-Hoor-Khuit]] and Hoor-Par-Kraat (both of whom make up the deity [[Heru-ra-ha]], perhaps meaning "Horus and Ra be Praised!"). There are many other uses of this formula within the realm of mysticism.
*'''VIAOV'''. Thelemic variation of IAO whose enumeration using gematria equals 93.
*'''VITRIOL''' ''''Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultem Lapidem'''' (Visiting the interior of the Earth, rectifying comes the Occult Stone). Ancient alchemical formula.

From its 1977 foundation until the April 2016 publication of the [[Panama Papers]] it remained mostly obscure, even though it sits at the heart of the global offshore industry, and acts for about 300,000 companies.

{{Main|The Route of the K-Money}}

In 2014, MF Corporate Services was [[subpoena]]ed by a hedge fund seeking to recover money from the Argentinian government.The fund alleged that MF had created shell companies to pass money from the government to [[Lázaro Báez]], an ally of the [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Kirchner family]].&lt;ref name="VICE" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Jürgen Mossack]] testified under oath that M.F. Corporate Services (Nevada) Ltd. had no affiliation with the Panamanian Mossack Fonseca, but the Panama Papers show that it was in fact a wholly owned subsidiary and Mossack Fonseca tried to hide the relationship, ordering emails and other computer footprints deleted.&lt;ref name=icijnev&gt;

In addition, however, the company has said that responsibility for potential legal violations may lie with failures or lapses by other institutions given that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;approximately 90% of our clientele is {{sic|comprised |hide=y| of}} professional clients, such as international financial institutions as well as [[Trust company|trust companies]] and prominent law and accounting firms, who act as intermediaries and are regulated in the [[jurisdiction]] of their business.

The '''Notable Names Database''' ('''NNDB''') is an [[online database]] of [[biography|biographical]] details of over 40,000 people of note. NNDB describes itself as an "intelligence aggregator" of those it determines to be noteworthy, but mainly to identify connections between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNDB|date=October 15, 2009|url=http://www.nndb.com/|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is run by Soylent Communications, a sole proprietorship that also ran the site ''rotten.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/10700/rotten-history-shock-site/|title=The legacy of Rotten.com - The Kernel|date=2014-10-26|work=The Kernel|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contentious facts are footnoted. Some entries have a brief prose biography, or contain facts or citations of note. Entries may contain summaries of the [[organization]]s they belong to, illnesses, [[phobias]], addictions, drug use, criminal records, and other data. In the case of authors, actors, film directors, and architects, the entry lists the person's artistic works in chronological order. Businesspeople and government officials have chronologies of their official posts and positions, as well as board memberships.  NNDB also has articles on films with user-submitted reviews, discographies of selected music groups, and extensive bibliographies on most subjects.&lt;ref name="Schofield"/&gt; Readers may suggest corrections through a form on the website; these are later [[vetted]] by an NNDB staff member.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Pro-drop parameter''' or '''Null subject parameter''' is the [[parameter]] which determines whether a language is a [[pro-drop language]] or not. A positive setting of the parameter allows an empty pro-element to be identified by its governor. This is the case in pro-drop languages.&lt;ref&gt;Hadumod Bussmann/Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A term used in [[Binding Theory|government-binding theory]] for a specification of the types of variation that a principle of [[grammar]] manifests among different languages. It is suggested that there are no rules of grammar in the traditional sense, but only principles which can take a slightly different form in different languages. For example, a head parameter specifies the positions of heads within phrases (e.g. head-first in English, head-last in Japanese). The [[adjacent (graph theory)|adjacency]] parameter of case theory specifies whether case assigners must be adjacent to their noun phrases (e.g. to the left in English, to the right in Chinese). The pro-drop (or ‘null subject’) parameter determines whether the subject of a clause can be suppressed. Determining the parametric values for given languages is known as parameter-setting. The overall approach has been called the principles and parameters theory (PPT) of [[universal grammar]], and has since come to be applied outside of syntactic contexts, notably in characterizing phonological relations. Later versions of metrical phonology, for example, recognize a series of parameters governing the way metrical feet should be represented, such as quantity sensitivity and directionality.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Crystal]]/A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics&lt;/ref&gt;

(in universal grammar) a parameter which determines whether the subject in declarative sentences may be deleted. Parameters vary in different languages within certain defined limits. Languages such as Italian and Arabic can have subject-less declarative sentences, e.g. Italian parla ‘he/she speaks/talks’, and are referred to as pro-drop languages. However, languages such as English, French and German do not typically omit the subject in declarative sentences. They are referred to as non-pro-drop languages, e.g.:
{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| || Subject||Verb|| 
|-
| Italian || (lui) || parla || pro-drop
|-
| Arabic || (huwa) || yatakalamu || pro-drop
|-
| English || he || speaks || non-pro-drop
|-
| French || il || parle || non-pro-drop
|-
| German || er || spricht || non-pro-drop
|}
		
The term pro-drop is used because in the d-structure of the grammar, the empty subject position is filled by the element pro, e.g.
pro parla
The pro-drop parameter and other parameters of Universal Grammar have attracted the interest of researchers working in the fields of child language acquisition and language teaching. For example, the question has been raised: How do children ‘set’ a UG parameter to fit their particular language? Researchers in second language acquisition have investigated what happens if a parameter in the speaker’s native language is different from that of their target language, making it necessary to ‘reset’ the parameter. This would happen, for example, in the acquisition of Spanish (a pro-drop language) by speakers of non-pro-drop languages such as English and French.&lt;ref&gt;Jack C. Richards and [[Richard Schmidt (linguist)|Richard Schmidt]]/Longman Dictionary of Language Teaching and Applied Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt;
	

In GB, anyone of various putative universal statements permitting a specified degree of variation within languages. The idea is that anyone language selects just one of the small number of choices permitted by the theory of grammar. Examples include the Head Parameter, the Adjacency Parameter and the Pro-Drop Parameter.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. L. Trask]]/A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt;

Notion in the theory of Universal Grammar (UG) and language acquisition. Parameters specify certain options that are not specified in UG. The values of parameters are not genetically fixed. Thus, language acquisition becomes a process of parameter setting. Linguistic diversity is characterized in terms of the values of parameters, for example the null subject parameter. Certain languages such as Italian and Spanish may have sentences with no overt subject, while other languages such as English must have an overt subject, even in cases in which this is nonreferential (dummy subject). Parameter theory, thus, provides an explanation for systematic syntactic variation between languages and imposes restrictions on the number of choices which the language learner has to make.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Luraghi and Claudia Parodi/Key Terms in Syntax and Syntactic Theory&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Parti communautaire national-européen''' ('''PCN''') is a [[Belgium]]-based political organisation led by [[Luc Michel]], a former member of the [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[Fédération d'action nationale et européenne|FANE]] party. A largely [[National Bolshevism|National Bolshevik]] movement, it also has activists in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Dossier extrême droite radicale"&gt;[http://www.france-politique.fr/annuaire-extreme-droite.htm 'Dossier extrême droite radicale'].&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCN was founded in 1984 as a successor to the similar ''[[Parti Communautaire Européen]]''. The party bases its ideas on those of [[Jean-François Thiriart]]&lt;ref name="Dossier extrême droite radicale"/&gt; (who served as an advisor to Michel for a time after the foundation of the group) and seeks the creation of a single [[Europe]]an state stretching entity from [[Russia]] to the [[Atlantic]] coast. Including activists with origins on both the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and [[Far-left politics|far-left]], it seeks to liberate Europe from its "Yankee and Zionist enemies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/ Belgium 1996 report].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Professor Piero Ignazi has defined the group as an heir to Thiriart's early influential organisation [[Jeune Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Piero Ignazi, ''Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founding membership included both those whose background was [[neo-fascism]] and former [[Maoism|Maoists]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Lee]], ''[[The Beast Reawakens]]'', Routledge, 1999, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been noted for giving support to controversial world leaders, most notably [[Iraq]]'s [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Libya]]'s [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Mammone, Emmanuel Godin, Brian Jenkins, ''Varieties of Right-Wing Extremism in Europe'', Routledge, 2013, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; It also declared its support for [[ecologism]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bastow, James Martin, ''Third Way Discourse: European Ideologies in the Twentieth Century'', Edinburgh University Press, 2003, pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eric Rossi, the PCN belongs to a strand of the Francophone far-right that he identifies as "ethno-differentialist revolutionary nationalism" in which he also includes [[Nouvelle Résistance]], [[Groupe Union Défense]], [[Troisième voie]] and [[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]]. He contrasts this with the "exclusivist nationalists" (as represented by [[Œuvre française]]) and the "supremacist racialist nationalists" ([[Fédération d'action nationale et européenne]] and [[Parti nationaliste français et européen]]), although including all three groups within a wider model of neo-fascism.&lt;ref&gt;E. Rossi, ''Jeunesse française des années 80-90 : la tentation néo-fasciste,'', Editions LGDJ, 1995, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has from time to time contested elections in Belgium and France (without securing elected office), although at the last Belgian elections they told their supporters to vote for the [[Vlaams Belang]].

The party is not connected to the European Community Party, a more recent initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communityparty.eu European Community Party site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527144853/http://www.communityparty.eu/|date=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Poe v. Lynchburg Training School and Hospital''''', Civ. A. No. 80-0172, 518 [[F. Supp.]] 789 ([[W.D. Va.]] 1981) concerned whether or not patients who had been [[compulsory sterilization|involuntarily sterilized]] in [[Lynchburg Training School and Hospital]], a state mental institution in [[Virginia]], as part of a program of [[eugenics]] in the early and mid-20th century had their constitutional rights violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite case | litigants=Poe v.

The case had been filed in 1980 by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s [[Reproductive Freedom Project]] on behalf of 8,000 women who had been sterilized under the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]  | title=About the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project| url=https://www.aclu.org/about-aclu-reproductive-freedom-project | quote=The Project filed Poe v.

In a settlement reached in 1985, the state agreed to inform the women about what had been done to them and to help them get counseling and medical treatment. | access-date=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that the sterilization did not violate constitutional rights, and that though the statute on involuntary sterilization of "mental defectives" had since been repealed, it had previously been upheld as constitutional (in ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'', 1927).

However, the fact that state officials did not notify or provide subsequent medical services to the sterilized individuals was found to merit further consideration by the court.  In a settlement reached in 1985, the state agreed to inform the women about what had been done to them and to help them get counseling and medical treatment.

The '''Polish Library in Paris''' ({{lang-fr|Bibliothèque Polonaise de Paris}}, {{lang-pl|Biblioteka Polska w Paryżu}}) is a Polish cultural centre of national importance and is closely associated both with the historic [[Great Emigration]] of the [[Polish people|Polish]] élite to Paris in the 19th-century and the formation in 1832 of the Literary Society (''Towarzystwo Literackie''), later the [[Historical and Literary Society]]. The Library was founded in 1838 by [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]], [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]] and Karol Sienkiewicz, among others. Its first task was to safeguard all surviving books, documents, archives and treasures of national significance. It has become a historical and documentary resource open for the use of Poles and other researchers and visitors. The Library houses three museums related to significant Polish artists: the [[Salon Frédéric Chopin]], the [[Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Paris|Adam Mickiewicz Museum]] and the [[Bolesław Biegas]] Art collection. UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Register – Europe and North America|Memory of the World Register]] rates it as an institution unique of its kind.&lt;ref name="unesco1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-2/collections-of-the-19th-century-of-the-polish-historical-and-literary-society-polish-library-in-paris-adam-mickiewicz-museum/ |title=Collections of the 19th century of the Polish Historical and Literary Society / Polish Library in Paris / Adam Mickiewicz Museum |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:David d'Angers - Adam Mickiewicz.jpg|thumb|left|David d'Angers - Adam Mickiewicz in 1835]]
The prime instigator for the creation of the Polish Library in Paris was Karol Sienkiewicz, who had managed to assemble the already existing book collections in the history and statistical departments of the
''Towarzystwo Literackie w Paryżu'', and the ''Towarzystwo Pomocy Naukowej'', the Polish Literary and Scientific Aid societies. A critical role in the venture was played by the French ''Société de Civilisation'', which, spurred on by the effect [[Adam Mickiewicz]] had with his article, "Rabunek bibliotek i muzeów w Polsce" - the pillage of libraries and museums in Poland - started a public appeal to garner support for a library dedicated to Poland. The act of foundation was signed in November 1838, followed in March 1839 by a gala opening of the building. A library committee consisting of eight delegates took on the running of the enterprise. Prince Czartoryski was elected as its life president, while the functions of secretary, librarian and treasurer were entrusted to Sienkiewicz.

To satisfy French legal requirements, Czartoryski took on formal ownership of the institution, thus securing its material survival. The initial plan was to erect a purpose-built Polish mansion in Paris to house the collections, but the shortage of funds led to the abandonment of that ambition, and instead a 17th-century four storey mansion was bought, on the [[Ile Saint-Louis]] along the [[Quai d'Orleans]]. The library moved into eleven rooms on the second floor while the rest of the building was let as accommodation to finance the loans that had been taken out. Meanwhile, the Library saw rapid expansion as gifts and legacies arrived from private individuals, for instance the collections of Małachowski, [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], [[Karol Kniaziewicz]] and [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. By 1845 the Library held 15,000 volumes and three years later, almost 20,000 items. In 1914 the collection contained 100,000 books. In addition, there was a stock of journals and reviews, of photographs, and of medals and coins.&lt;ref&gt;Marek Żukow-Karczewski, ''Biblioteka przy Quai d'Orléans'', "[[Życie Literackie (1951-1991)|Życie Literackie]]", 2 IV 1989 r., nr 13 (1932), s. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 19th century, the activities of the Literary Society had declined, and the maintenance of the library in Paris was transferred in 1893 to the responsibility of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] in Kraków.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleski (b).&lt;/ref&gt; in 1926, Władysław Mickiewicz (son of Adam) bequeathed his important collection of manuscripts to the library. In the following period, a number of valuable books, manuscripts and artworks which the library could not properly maintain were sent to museums and institutions in the [[Second Polish Republic|now independent Poland]].

===World War II===
[[File:Franciszek Jan Pułaski.jpg|thumb|left|Franciszek Jan Pułaski, Director of the Polish Lbrary, 1928-1956]]
On the eve of [[World War II]] there were 145,000 books, 1,000 manuscripts, 12,000 images, 2,800 atlases and maps and 20,000 copies of documents relating to Polish history drawn from British and French archives. Although [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|German occupying forces]] seized the library's collection during [[World War II]], the Library was able to resume work with the [[liberation of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaleski (c).&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the looted materials were returned from Germany by 1947, however, the Library faced bitter legal battles with the post-war [[Communist]] [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish government]] over ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Nowacki, K. "The Polish libraries in Paris and London", ''Journal of Librarianship and Information Science'', Sage, April 1983 15: 87-104.&lt;/ref&gt; These were eventually resolved in the Library's favour in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleski (d).&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[History of Poland (1989–present)|Poland's return to democracy]] in 1989, links were reestablished with the new Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleski (e).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current dilemmas==

The Polish Library in Paris is the oldest cultural institution outside the territory of Poland. Since 1854 the Library has occupied the entire original building. Next to the Library are the premises of the [[Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Paris]], opened in 1903. Attached, are also the [[Salon Frédéric Chopin]], the only permanent exhibition in Paris to the memory of the composer and the [[Musée Boleslas Biegas]] with paintings and sculpture by the artist and other Polish artists.

In 1989 the collection had grown to 220,000 volumes, around 5,000 Polish maps, 7,000  16th - 20th century images, plus the collections of the ''Towarzystwo Historyczno-Literackie w Paryżu''.&lt;ref name="unesco1"/&gt;

Although in 1893 the Library came under the predecessor of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] in [[Kraków]], at that time in partitioned Poland, this did not resolve its relationship with the Library's neighbour and founding institution in Paris, the Historical and Literary Society, ('''Fr.''': Société Historique et Littéraire Polonaise -SHLP). Not until 2004, after a process of arbitration, was it formally agreed that the Library is jointly "owned" by both organisations, through the mechanism of the ''Association de la Bibliothèque Polonaise de Paris'', in effect a governing council, composed of seven delegates from each of the two "parent" institutions. Typically, these are people with distinguished academic credentials from France or Poland. The chairman of the association, or governing council of the Library, is elected for a term of 5 years and is currently C. Pierre Zaleski, from the Polish Academy of Learning. He is also the chief executive of the Library and heads a professional management team for its day-to-day running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque-polonaise-paris-shlp.fr/medias/ORGANIGRAMME_2015_2.pdf |title=ORGANIGRAMME DE LA GESTION QUOTIDIENNE DE LA SHLP/BPP |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-08-22 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library and its part-owner, the Historical and Literary Society, are jointly members of the Standing Conference of [Polish] Museums, Archives and Libraries in the West[ern hemisphere].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mabpz.org/ Website] of the Standing Conference of Polish Museums, Archives and Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; This body groups all recognised collections outside Poland, but it does not cover items held in foreign institutions, nor the many thousands of objects as yet unrecovered from [[World War II|war-time]] looting and displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lootedart.gov.pl/en/what-are-wartime-losses |title=What are wartime losses? |publisher=The Division for Looted Art |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018021117/http://lootedart.gov.pl/en/what-are-wartime-losses |archivedate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present economic decline, although partly funded from Poland's higher education budget, the Library faces continuous challenges as maintenance costs rise, materials age and cultural institutions face financial competition from other social priorities and needs, not least digital ones. There is currently pressure on the Polish collection at [[Rapperswil Castle]] to leave its premises in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="kgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.00017.DownloadFile.tmp/sg2011.pdf|title=Schweizerisches Inventar der Kulturgüter von nationaler Bedeutung: Kanton St.&amp;nbsp;Gallen, A-Objekte|publisher=bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch|author=|language=German|date=2015-01-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219042107/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.00017.DownloadFile.tmp/sg2011.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bodes ill for other such centres which may be obliged either to be scattered or receive more fragile materials, as has already disastrously happened in the case of the decimated Polish Museum at [[Fawley Court]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogalinski.com.pl/fawley-court-campaign-for-your-freedom-and-ours/ |title=Fawley Court Campaign - For Your Freedom And Ours |first=Paweł |last=Rogaliński |publisher=Rogalinski.com.pl |date=2013-01-14 |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Wheeler's research career has focused on the role of [[species exploration]] and [[natural history]] collections in the exploration and conservation of [[biodiversity]]; theory and practice of [[cladistics|phylogenetic systematics]] and [[cybertaxonomy]]; the evolution and classification of insects, especially [[beetles]]; and public [[science education]]. He has received a number of academic honors, including several fellowships.{{such as?}} He has had three species of beetles named in his honor, such as ''Tonerus wheeleri'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Kelly B.|title=On the systematics of Noteridae (Coleoptera: Adephaga: Hydradephaga): Phylogeny, description of a new tribe, genus and species, and survey of female genital morphology|journal=Systematics and Biodiversity|date=2009|volume=7|issue=2|pages=191–214|doi=10.1017/S1477200008002946}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eleodes wheeleri'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Aaron|last2=Dornburg|first2=Rebecca|last3=Wheeler|first3=Quentin|title=Larvae of the genus Eleodes (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae): matrix-based descriptions, cladisticanalysis, and key to late instars|journal=ZooKeys|date=2014|volume=415|pages=217–268|doi=10.3897/zookeys.415.5887|pmid=25009429|pmc=4089825}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Agathisium wheeleri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelini|first1=Fernando|title=New Species and Records of Agathidium from Malaysia (Malaya) and the Philippines (Coleoptera: Leiodidae)|journal=The Coleopterists Bulletin|date=1990|volume=44|issue=3|pages=241–254|jstor=4008726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of approximately 150 scientific articles and six books, including ''What on Earth? – 100 of Our Planet's Most Amazing New Species''. He has named more than 100 new species and writes a periodic column on new species for ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in London.&lt;ref name=esf /&gt;

He was the first [[Department of National Archives|Government Archivist]] in the British Administration of Ceylon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infolanka.com/org/srilanka/people/86.htm Remembering Richard Gerald Anthonisz — a pioneer and visionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2009/11/25/opinion5.html A facet of the European heritage comes alive]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Galle]] and received is primary education in English from The Galle School &lt;ref&gt; It has been stated erroneously that he studied at the Galle Central School. It is in the School that William Gibson was the head teacher or master which was the Wesleyan Methodist School the Galle School, superintended by the Rev Bridgnel. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; The Eighth report of the Central School Commission for the Instruction of the Population of Ceylon 1848 appears in the Volume 36 of 1852 House of Common papers https://books.google.lk/books/about/Parliamentary_Papers_House_of_Commons_an.html?id=LUUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt; the present Richmond College. Winning the Queen’s Scholarship he entered the Colombo Academy (now [[Royal College Colombo]]). Entering the field of law Anthonisz became a [[Proctor]] of the District Court. 

He thereafter became a teacher and served as the Head Master at [[Richmond College (Sri Lanka)|Richmond College, Galle]] and at the Colombo Academy; before becoming the [[head master]] of the English Galle Central School. Joining the government service, he became a [[Recorder of deeds|registrar of lands]], then a [[Magistrate|police magistrate]] and thereafter became the [[Registrar-General|Assistant Registrar General]] in [[Colombo]]. 

A keen student of Dutch history and culture in Ceylon, in July 1899 Anthonisz was appointed to the new post of Examiner of Dutch Records, with the task of searching and organizing the scattered records and documents of the Dutch administration. With successful archive process of Dutch records, a new post of Government Archivist and Librarian was created by the British administration as part of the Chief Secretaries Office (also known as the ''[[Chief Secretary (British Empire)|Colonial Secretary]]'') in 1902 and Anthonisz was made a permanent appointment. He held the post until his retirement in 1921. This office was formally established as the Department of the Government Archivist in 1947 and now known as the [[Department of National Archives]]. 
     
For his government service he was appointment as a [[Justice of the Peace]] and made a [[Imperial Service Order|Companion of the Imperial Service Order]]. He was made a member of the [[Society of Dutch Literature]], [[Leyden]] and the founder of the [[Dutch Burgher Union of Ceylon]].

{{Politics of Rhodesia}}

The '''Unilateral Declaration of Independence''' ('''UDI''') was a statement adopted by the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] of [[Rhodesia]] on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia,{{#tag:ref||group="n"|name="name"}} a British territory in southern Africa that had [[responsible government|governed itself]] since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent [[sovereign state]]. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, it was the first unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] nearly two centuries before. The UK, the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an [[List of historical unrecognized states|unrecognised state]] with the assistance of South Africa and Portugal.

The Rhodesian government, which mostly comprised members of the country's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] minority of about 5%, was indignant when, amid [[decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]] and the [[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]], less developed African colonies to the north without comparable experience of self-rule quickly advanced to independence during the early 1960s while Rhodesia was refused sovereignty under the newly ascendant principle of "[[no independence before majority rule]]" ("NIBMAR"). Most white Rhodesians felt that they were due independence following four decades' self-government, and that the British government was betraying them by withholding it. This combined with the colonial government's acute reluctance to hand over power to black Rhodesians—the manifestation of racial tensions, [[Cold War]] anti-communism and the fear that a dystopian [[Congo Crisis|Congo]]-style situation might result—to create the impression that if the UK did not grant independence, Rhodesia might be justified in taking it unilaterally.

A stalemate developed between the British and Rhodesian prime ministers, [[Harold Wilson]] and [[Ian Smith]] respectively, between 1964 and 1965. Dispute largely surrounded the British condition that the terms for independence had to be acceptable "to the people of the country as a whole"; Smith contended that this was met, while the UK and black Rhodesian leaders held that it was not. After Wilson proposed in late October 1965 that the UK might safeguard future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament by withdrawing some of the colonial government's devolved powers, then presented terms for an investigatory Royal Commission that the Rhodesians found unacceptable, Smith and his Cabinet declared independence. Calling this treasonous, the British [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia|colonial governor]], [[Humphrey Gibbs|Sir Humphrey Gibbs]], formally dismissed Smith and his government, but they ignored him and appointed an "[[Administrator of the Government#Rhodesia|Officer Administering the Government]]" to take his place.

While no country recognised the UDI, the Rhodesian High Court deemed the post-UDI government legal and ''de jure'' in 1968. The Smith administration initially professed continued loyalty to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], but abandoned this in 1970 when it declared a republic in an unsuccessful attempt to win foreign recognition. The [[Rhodesian Bush War]], a guerrilla conflict between the government and two rival communist-backed black Rhodesian groups, began in earnest two years later, and after several attempts to end the war Smith concluded the [[Internal Settlement]] with non-militant nationalists in 1978. Under these terms the country was reconstituted under black rule as [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] in June 1979, but this new order was rejected by the guerrillas and the international community. The Bush War continued until Zimbabwe Rhodesia revoked its UDI as part of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in December 1979. Following a brief period of direct British rule, the country was granted internationally recognised independence under the name [[Zimbabwe]] in 1980.

===Federal dissolution; the roots of mistrust===
Meanwhile, secessionist black Rhodesian parties won electoral victories in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland,&lt;ref name=wood119122/&gt; and [[Harold Macmillan]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] administration in Britain moved towards breaking up the Federation, resolving that it had become untenable. In February 1962, the British [[Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations]], [[Duncan Sandys]], secretly informed the Nyasaland nationalist leader [[Hastings Banda]] that secession would be allowed. A few days later, he horrified Welensky by telling him that "we British have lost the will to govern".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

As Southern Rhodesia had been the UK's legislative partner in forming the Federation in 1953, it would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation.

Field's government was startled by Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised that it was going to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]].{{#tag:ref|Douglas-Home was only a few days into his premiership following Macmillan's resignation on grounds of ill health.

Fearing what the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland.&lt;ref name=wood186190/&gt; The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.&lt;ref name=wood186190/&gt;

==Positions and motivations==

===British government stance===
The British government's refusal to grant independence to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely the result of the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with the Wind of Change, coupled with the UK's wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=mcwilliam/&gt; The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint for questions of decolonisation and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nyamunda
|2016
|pp=1005–1019}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1960s, general consensus in the post-colonial UN—particularly the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], where the [[Eastern Bloc|communist bloc]] and the [[Asian–African Conference|Afro-Asian lobby]] were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms of colonialism, and supported communist-backed black Rhodesian insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the [[Cold War]], Britain opposed the spread of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Fedorowich
|Thomas
|2001
|pp=172–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia came to the fore in the UN and other bodies, particularly the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), even maintaining the ''status quo'' became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nelson
|1983
|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain knew that simply granting independence to Southern Rhodesia was out of the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy.&lt;ref name=mcwilliam/&gt; The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood

|Cunningham

|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.&lt;ref name=mcwilliam&gt;{{Harvnb
|McWilliam
|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At party level, the Labour Party, in opposition until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and supportive of the black Rhodesian movement on ideological and moral grounds. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance.

===Southern Rhodesian government view===
The Southern Rhodesian government found it bizarre that Britain was making independent states out of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, less developed territories with little experience of self-rule, while withholding sovereign statehood from Southern Rhodesia, the Federation's senior partner, which had already been self-governing for four decades and which was one of the most prosperous and developed countries in Africa.

These factors combined with what RF politicians and supporters saw as British decadence, chicanery and betrayal to create the case they put forward that UDI, while dubious legally and likely to provoke international uproar, might nevertheless be in their eyes justifiable and necessary for the good of the country and region if an accommodation could not be found with Whitehall.&lt;ref name=wood190/&gt;

==Road to UDI==

===First steps, under Field===

Field's failure to secure independence concurrently with the end of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964.&lt;ref name=wood186190&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood

|pp=186–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RF [[caucus]] in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence.&lt;ref name=wood190&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2005
|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2005
|pp=193–194, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RF united behind Field after Sandys wrote him a terse letter warning him of the likely Commonwealth reaction to a declaration of independence, but the Prime Minister then lost his party's confidence by failing to pursue a possible route to at least ''de facto'' independence devised by [[Desmond Lardner-Burke]], a lawyer and RF MP for [[Gweru|Gwelo]]. During March 1964, the Legislative Assembly in Salisbury considered and passed Lardner-Burke's motion that the Governor, [[Humphrey Gibbs|Sir Humphrey Gibbs]], should submit a petition to the Queen requesting alteration of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution so that the [[Royal Assent]] described therein would be exercised at the request of the Southern Rhodesian government rather than that of its British counterpart. This would both remove the possibility of British legislative interference and pave the way for an attempted assumption of independence by Order in Council.{{#tag:ref|The Lardner-Burke bill proposed that a two-thirds majority in the Legislative Assembly would prompt automatic consent for alterations from the Governor, who would then sign them into law on behalf of the Queen.&lt;ref name=wood200202&gt;{{Harvnb

The RF's intention was partly to test whether or not the British would attempt to block this bill after Gibbs had granted Royal Assent to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Smith

|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], one of Southern Rhodesia's main supporters in Britain, despaired at Field's lack of action, telling Welensky that as he saw it "the simple time to have declared independence, whether right or wrong, would have been when the Federation came to an end".&lt;ref name=wood204207/&gt; The RF hierarchy interpreted this latest backtrack by Field as evidence that he would not seriously challenge the British on the independence issue, and forced his resignation on 13 April 1964.&lt;ref name=wood204207&gt;{{Harvnb

Salisbury's blunt refusal to be part of the Wind of Change caused the Southern Rhodesian military's traditional British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo,&lt;ref name="wood319"/&gt; and prompted Whitehall and Washington to stop sending Southern Rhodesia financial aid around the same time.{{refn|group=n|Britain told Southern Rhodesia that this was because the British economy was in trouble. When Salisbury pointed out that the UK was still giving aid to other countries, Whitehall implied that financial assistance might resume if progress was made towards an independence settlement acceptable to Britain.&lt;ref name="wood335"/&gt;}} In June 1964, Douglas-Home informed Smith that Southern Rhodesia would not be represented at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, despite Salisbury's record of attendance going back to 1932,{{#tag:ref|Salisbury attended under the Federal flag from 1953 to 1963.&lt;ref name=welenskyspeech/&gt;|group="n"|name="conference"}} because of a change in policy to only include representatives from fully independent states.

[[File:Alec Douglas-Home (c1963).jpg|thumb|upright|left|UK Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] met Smith in London in September 1964.|alt=A photograph of Sir Alec Douglas-Home]]
At [[10 Downing Street]] in early September 1964, impasse developed between Douglas-Home and Smith over the best way to measure black public opinion in Southern Rhodesia. A key plank of Britain's Southern Rhodesia policy was that the terms for independence had to be "acceptable to the people of the country as a whole"—agreeing to this, Smith suggested that white and urban black opinion could be gauged through a general referendum of registered voters, and that rural black views could be obtained at a national ''[[indaba]]'' (tribal conference) of chiefs and headmen. Douglas-Home told Smith that although this proposal satisfied him personally, he could not accept it as he did not believe the Commonwealth, the United Nations or the Labour Party would also do so. He stressed that such a move towards accommodation with Smith might hurt the Conservatives' chances in the British general election the next month, and suggested that it might be in Smith's best interests to wait until after the election to continue negotiations. Smith accepted this argument. Douglas-Home assured Smith that a Conservative government would settle with him and grant independence within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

Attempting to form a viable white opposition to the Rhodesian Front, the UFP resurrected itself around Welensky, renamed itself the Rhodesia Party, and entered the Arundel and Avondale by-elections that had been called for 1 October 1964. Perturbed by the prospect of having to face the political heavyweight Welensky in parliament at the head of the opposition, the RF poured huge resources into winning both of these former UFP safe seats, and fielded [[Clifford Dupont]], Smith's deputy, against Welensky in Arundel.{{#tag:ref|During the bitterly fought campaign,&lt;ref name=byelection&gt;{{Harvnb

===Wilson's Labour government; Salisbury's tests of opinion===
[[File:Harold Wilson (1967).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harold Wilson]] replaced Douglas-Home in October 1964, and proved a formidable opponent of Smith.|alt=A portrait photograph of Harold Wilson]]

Labour defeated the Conservatives by four seats in the British [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|general election]] on 15 October 1964, and formed a government the next day. Both Labour and the Conservatives told Smith that a positive result at the ''indaba'' would not be recognised by Britain as representative of the people, and the Conservatives turned down Salisbury's invitation to send observers. Smith pressed on, telling parliament that he would ask the tribal chiefs and headmen "to consult their people in the traditional manner", then hold the ''indaba'' as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2005
|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 October, 196 chiefs and 426 headmen from across the country gathered at [[Domboshawa]], just north-east of Salisbury, and began their deliberations. Smith hoped that Britain, having taken part in such ''indabas'' in the past, might send a delegation at the last minute, but none arrived, much to his annoyance, particularly as the British government's Commonwealth Secretary [[Arthur Bottomley]] was only across the [[Zambezi]] in [[Lusaka]] at the time.&lt;ref name=wood242243&gt;{{Harvnb

While the chiefs conferred, Northern Rhodesia became independent Zambia on 24 October 1964, emulating Nyasaland, which had achieved statehood as Malawi three months earlier. Reasoning that it was no longer necessary to refer to itself as "Southern" in the absence of a northern counterpart, Southern Rhodesia began calling itself simply Rhodesia.{{#tag:ref|Salisbury passed legislation to shorten the name, but Britain ruled this ''[[ultra vires]]'' as the laws naming the country were British acts passed at Westminster.

|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"|name="name2"}} The same day, the commander of the [[Rhodesian Army]], Major-General John "Jock" Anderson, resigned, announcing publicly that he was doing so because of his opposition to UDI, which he said he could not go along with because of his oath of allegiance to the Queen. Interpreting this as a sign that Smith intended to declare independence if a majority backed it in the referendum, Wilson wrote a stiff letter to Smith on 25 October, warning him of the consequences of UDI, and demanding "a categorical assurance forthwith that no attempt at a unilateral declaration of independence on your part will be made".&lt;ref name=wood243246/&gt; Smith expressed confusion as to what he had done to provoke this, and ignored it.&lt;ref name=wood243246/&gt;

When the ''indaba'' ended on 26 October, the chiefs and headmen returned a unanimous decision to support the government's stand for independence under the 1961 constitution, attesting in their report that "people who live far away do not understand the problems of our country".&lt;ref name=wood243246&gt;{{Harvnb

===Stalemate develops between Smith and Wilson===

Smith wrote to Wilson the day after the referendum, asking him to send Bottomley to Salisbury for talks. Wilson replied that Smith should instead come to London.&lt;ref name=wood251/&gt; The British and Rhodesians exchanged often confrontational letters for the next few months. Alluding to the British financial aid pledged to Salisbury as part of the Federal dissolution arrangements, Wilson's High Commissioner in Salisbury, [[John Baines Johnston|J&amp;nbsp;B Johnston]], wrote to the Rhodesian Cabinet Secretary [[Gerald B. Clarke|Gerald&amp;nbsp;B Clarke]] on 23 December that "talk of a unilateral declaration of independence is bound to throw a shadow of uncertainty on the future financial relations between the two governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

It would appear that any undertakings given by the British government are worthless&amp;nbsp;... such immoral behaviour on the part of the British government makes it impossible for me to continue negotiations with you with any confidence that our standards of fair play, honesty and decency will prevail."&lt;ref name=smith85&gt;{{Harvnb

The two premiers were brought together in person in late January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]]'s funeral. Following an episode concerning Smith's non-invitation to a luncheon at [[Buckingham Palace]] after the funeral—noticing the Rhodesian's absence, the Queen sent a royal [[equerry]] to Smith's hotel to retrieve him, reportedly causing Wilson much irritation—the two Prime Ministers inconclusively debated at 10 Downing Street. They differed on most matters, but agreed on a visit to Rhodesia the next month by Bottomley and the Lord Chancellor, [[Gerald Gardiner, Baron Gardiner|Lord Gardiner]], to gauge public opinion and meet political and commercial figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

|pp=270–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bottomley and Gardiner visited Rhodesia from 22 February to 3 March, collected a wide cross-section of opinions, including some from black Rhodesians, and on returning to Britain reported to the House of Commons that they were "not without hope of finding a way towards a solution that will win the support of all communities and lead to independence and prosperity for all Rhodesians".&lt;ref name=wood286&gt;{{Harvnb

The RF called a new general election for [[Rhodesian general election, 1965|May 1965]] and, campaigning on an [[election promise]] of independence, won all 50 "A"-roll seats (the voters for which were mostly white).{{#tag:ref|The electoral system devised in the 1961 constitution replaced the common voters' roll with two rolls, the "A" roll and the "B" roll, the latter of which had lower qualifications intended to make it easier for prospective voters to enter the political system.

During these discussions, Smith referred to the last resort of a UDI on many occasions,&lt;ref name=young271/&gt; though he said he hoped to find another way out of the quandary.

The Rhodesians were horrified by this prospect, particularly as Wilson's suggestion of it seemed to them to have removed the failsafe alternative of keeping the ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the British Prime Minister left Rhodesia on 30 October 1965, he proposed a Royal Commission to gauge public opinion in the colony regarding independence under the 1961 constitution, possibly chaired by the Rhodesian Chief Justice [[Hugh Beadle|Sir Hugh Beadle]], which would report its findings to both the British and Rhodesian Cabinets.&lt;ref name=wood441442&gt;{{Harvnb

Smith said these conditions amounted to a "vote of no confidence in [the commission] before they commenced", and therefore rejected them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

==Draft, adoption and signing==

The Rhodesian Minister for Justice and Law and Order, Desmond Lardner-Burke, presented the rest of the Cabinet with a draft for the declaration of independence on 5 November 1965. When [[Jack Howman]], Minister of Tourism and Information, said that he was also preparing a draft, the Cabinet decided to wait to see his version too. The ministers agreed that if an independence proclamation were issued, they would all sign it.&lt;ref name="wood453"/&gt; On 9 November, the Cabinet jointly devised an outline for the proclamation document and the accompanying statement to be made by Smith.&lt;ref name=wood460461&gt;{{Harvnb

Attached to the declaration of independence was a copy of the 1961 constitution amended for the circumstances, which became the 1965 constitution. In the eyes of the Smith administration, this document removed Whitehall's remaining authority over Rhodesia. However, the Smith government still professed loyalty to Elizabeth II, and accordingly the document reconstituted Rhodesia as a dominion with Elizabeth as "Queen of Rhodesia".  The new constitution created the concept of allegiance to the "Constitution of Rhodesia," and introduced the post of [[Administrator of the Government|Officer Administering the Government]], a viceregal figure empowered to sign passed legislation into law on behalf of the monarch if she did not appoint a [[Governor-General]].&lt;ref name=wood471/&gt;

The Rhodesian Cabinet waited in vain for Wilson's reply for the rest of 9 November and the next day. After briefly meeting Smith late on 10 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2005
|pp=465–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston warned Wilson that evening that the Rhodesians seemed poised to declare independence in the morning. The British Prime Minister tried repeatedly to call Smith, but did not get through until Smith was already chairing a Cabinet meeting on the independence issue around 08:00 [[Central Africa Time]] (06:00 in London) on 11 November. Wilson attempted to talk Smith out of unilateral action by telling him the ''status quo'' could continue, and the two argued inconclusively about the proposed Royal Commission. Returning to his Cabinet meeting, Smith reported the conversation to his ministers, and, after debating for a while, the Cabinet came to the conclusion that Wilson was simply attempting to buy more time and that there was no sign of actual progress. Smith asked if Rhodesia should declare its independence, and had each Cabinet minister [[Consensus decision-making|answer in turn]]. According to Smith's account, "each one, quietly but firmly, without hesitation, said: 'Yes'."&lt;ref name=wood468470&gt;{{Harvnb

At 11:00 local time on 11 November 1965, [[Armistice Day]], during the traditional [[Two minute silence|two minutes' silence]] to remember the fallen of the two World Wars, Smith declared Rhodesia independent and signed the proclamation document, with Dupont and the other 10 [[Signatories of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|ministers]] of the Cabinet following.

==Text of the declaration==

{{quote|
{{center|Proclamation}}
----
Whereas in the course of human affairs history has shown that it may become necessary for a people to resolve the political affiliations which have connected them with another people and to assume amongst other nations the separate and equal status to which they are entitled:

And Whereas in such event a respect for the opinions of mankind requires them to declare to other nations the causes which impel them to assume full responsibility for their own affairs:

Now Therefore, We, The Government of Rhodesia, Do Hereby Declare:

That it is an indisputable and accepted historic fact that since 1923 the Government of Rhodesia have exercised the powers of self-government and have been responsible for the progress, development and welfare of their people;

That the people of Rhodesia having demonstrated their loyalty to the Crown and to their kith and kin in the United Kingdom and elsewhere through two world wars, and having been prepared to shed their blood and give of their substance in what they believed to be the mutual interests of freedom-loving people, now see all that they have cherished about to be shattered on the rocks of expediency;

That the people of Rhodesia have witnessed a process which is destructive of those very precepts upon which civilization in a primitive country has been built, they have seen the principles of Western democracy, responsible government and moral standards crumble elsewhere, nevertheless they have remained steadfast;

That the people of Rhodesia fully support the requests of their government for sovereign independence but have witnessed the consistent refusal of the Government of the United Kingdom to accede to their entreaties;

That the Government of the United Kingdom have thus demonstrated that they are not prepared to grant sovereign independence to Rhodesia on terms acceptable to the people of Rhodesia, thereby persisting in maintaining an unwarrantable jurisdiction over Rhodesia, obstructing laws and treaties with other states and the conduct of affairs with other nations and refusing assent to laws necessary for the public good, all this to the detriment of the future peace, prosperity and good government of Rhodesia;

That the Government of Rhodesia have for a long period patiently and in good faith negotiated with the Government of the United Kingdom for the removal of the remaining limitations placed upon them and for the grant of sovereign independence;

That in the belief that procrastination and delay strike at and injure the very life of the nation, the Government of Rhodesia consider it essential that Rhodesia should attain, without delay, sovereign independence, the justice of which is beyond question;

Now Therefore, We The Government of Rhodesia, in humble submission to Almighty God who controls the destinies of nations, conscious that the people of Rhodesia have always shown unswerving loyalty and devotion to Her Majesty the Queen and earnestly praying that we and the people of Rhodesia will not be hindered in our determination to continue exercising our undoubted right to demonstrate the same loyalty and devotion, and seeking to promote the common good so that the dignity and freedom of all men may be assured, Do, By This Proclamation, adopt, enact and give to the people of Rhodesia the Constitution annexed hereto;

{{center|God Save The Queen}}

Given under Our Hand at Salisbury, this eleventh day of November in the Year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixty-five.

==Announcement and reactions==

===Announcement===
Prompted by the government, the [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation]] told the public to stand by for an important announcement from the Prime Minister at 13:15 local time. Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence,&lt;ref name=wood471/&gt; then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become "abundantly clear that it is the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution which we could possibly accept&amp;nbsp;... I promised the people of this country that I would continue to negotiate to the bitter end and that I would leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to secure an honourable and mutually accepted settlement; it now falls to me to tell you that negotiations have come to an end".&lt;ref name=wood472&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2005
|p=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith said that he believed that he would be remiss in his duty if he allowed Rhodesia to continue to "drift in its present paralysing state of uncertainty", and that following Britain's abandonment of the Federation his government was determined that "the same will never be allowed to happen here". He claimed that UDI did not mark "a diminution in the opportunities which our African people have to advance and prosper in Rhodesia", described "racial harmony in Africa" as part of his agenda and condemned black Rhodesian activities as attempts to "blackmail the British government into&amp;nbsp;... handing the country over to irresponsible rule". He then attempted to assuage fears that economic sanctions might destroy the economy, and asked Rhodesians to stand firm: "The mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders&amp;nbsp;... In the lives of most nations there comes a moment when a stand has to be made for principles, whatever the consequences. This moment has come to Rhodesia&amp;nbsp;... the first Western nation in the last two decades to say 'so far and no further'." He concluded with an assertion that the declaration of independence was "a blow for the preservation of justice, civilisation and Christianity".&lt;ref name=wood472475&gt;{{Harvnb

===Domestic reactions===

Note the blank spaces where content was removed by state censors.|alt=The front page of a newspaper, "The Rhodesia Herald". The main headline is "UDI—Rhodesia goes it alone".]]
By the time Smith and Dupont arrived at Government House to see Gibbs, Whitehall had instructed the Governor to formally dismiss Smith and his ministers for treason. Gibbs complied without hesitation. Smith and his ministers ignored this, holding that under the new 1965 constitution Gibbs "no longer ha[d] any executive powers in Rhodesia", and his [[reserve power]] to sack them no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Peterson
|1971
|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhodesian government hoped that Gibbs might obligingly resign in light of his impotent situation, but he did not; following orders from London, he remained at his post at Government House. Gibbs told the Rhodesian military's senior officers, some of whom were troubled by the perceived choice between Queen and country, to remain at their posts to maintain law and order.&lt;ref name=wood0834&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2008
|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson briefly flirted with the idea of sending [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] to Rhodesia to support Gibbs as a direct representative of the Queen, but this was dropped after Gibbs asked for somebody "higher up" in the royal family instead.&lt;ref name=wood1999&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Not likely", Wilson retorted.&lt;ref name=wood1999/&gt;

The Rhodesian government accompanied UDI with emergency measures that it said were intended to prevent alarm, unrest and the flight of people and capital. Press censorship and petrol rationing were imposed, import licences were cancelled and emigration allowances were cut to £100. News of UDI was generally received calmly by the local citizenry, apart from some isolated incidents of passing cars being stoned in the black townships outside Bulawayo. A few expected dissenters were arrested, most prominently [[Leo Baron]], Nkomo's lawyer, whose links with black Rhodesians and communists were seen by authorities as "subversive".&lt;ref name=wood0834/&gt; Baron, the younger brother of the scientist [[Jacob Bronowski]], was arrested nine minutes after UDI was made.&lt;ref name=wood0834/&gt;

Welensky, who had opposed UDI, stated that he felt it was nevertheless "the duty of every responsible Rhodesian to support the revolutionary government" as he believed the only alternative was a descent into anarchy.&lt;ref name=wood0834/&gt; João de Freitas Cruz, the Portuguese consul-general in Salisbury, reacted to the news with wild excitement; visiting the Smith residence later in the day, he declared "Only Rhodesians could do this!"&lt;ref name=berlyn171/&gt; A statement from ZAPU's [[Jason Moyo]], who was in London at the time, denounced UDI as an act of "treason and rebellion" and asserted that "the lives particularly of four million unarmed Africans are in jeopardy".&lt;ref name=bbc1965&gt;{{Harvnb
|BBC
|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis M'Gabe of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) said that "For all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life, UDI has set a collision course which cannot be altered. [It has] marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom&amp;nbsp;... from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

A week after UDI, Smith's government announced that Dupont, the Deputy Prime Minister, had resigned from the Cabinet to accept the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution.&lt;ref name=wood1999/&gt; Smith asked the Queen by letter to appoint a Governor-General to supersede Gibbs, recommending Dupont, but was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Young
|1969
|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dupont nevertheless effectively replaced the Governor. The Smith administration assigned him the Governor's official residence at Government House, but no attempt was made to forcibly remove Gibbs and his entourage; the post-UDI government stated that the Officer Administering the Government would live at Governor's Lodge instead "until Government House, at present temporarily occupied by Sir Humphrey Gibbs in a private capacity, becomes available".&lt;ref name=wood1999/&gt;

The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the Rhodesian parliament, A&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;W Stumbles, reconvened the Legislative Assembly on 25 November, resolving that if he did not there would be chaos. He feared that Gibbs might dramatically walk into the chamber in an attempt to stop the proceedings, but Gibbs did no such thing. The parliamentary opposition opened the meeting by asking whether the assembly was legal.&lt;ref name=wood200821/&gt; [[Ahrn Palley]], the lone white opposition MP, announced that as he saw it, "certain Honourable Members in collusion have torn up the constitution under which this House meets. The proceedings have no legal validity whatsoever".&lt;ref name=time65/&gt; Stumbles overruled this objection and two more interruptions from Palley, and suggested that any members with reservations might leave.&lt;ref name=wood200821/&gt; Palley continued his loud protests until he was forcibly ejected by the [[Serjeant-at-Arms|Sergeant-at-Arms]], shouting "This is an illegal assembly! God save the Queen!"&lt;ref name=time65&gt;{{Harvnb

Gibbs received threatening letters from the Rhodesian public, and on 26 November 1965 Smith's government cut off the telephones at Government House, and removed the ceremonial guard, the official cars "and even the typewriters", Wood records.&lt;ref name=wood1999/&gt; Gibbs nevertheless refused to step down or to leave Government House, issuing a statement that he would remain there "as the lawful Governor of Rhodesia until such time as constitutional government is restored, which I hope will be soon."&lt;ref name=wood1999/&gt; He stayed at his post, ignored by the post-UDI government, until the declaration of a republic in 1970.&lt;ref name=wood1999/&gt;

===British and international responses; sanctions===

Wilson was astonished by Smith's actions, and found the timing of the declaration to coincide with the Armistice Day silence deeply insulting.&lt;ref name=thinkagain/&gt; Describing Salisbury as "hell-bent on illegal self-destroying",&lt;ref name=wood5/&gt; the British Prime Minister, supported in the Commons by the Liberals and most Conservatives, called on Rhodesians to ignore the post-UDI government.&lt;ref name=wood5/&gt; Within hours of UDI, the UN General Assembly passed a condemnatory resolution, by 107-to-two—South Africa and Portugal voted against, and France abstained—decrying Rhodesia's actions and calling on Britain to end "the rebellion by the unlawful authorities in Salisbury".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2008
|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] the next day adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 216|Resolution 216]], which denounced the declaration of independence as illegal and racist, and called on all states to refuse recognition and assistance to the Rhodesian government. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 217|Security Council Resolution 217]], following on 20 November, condemned UDI as an illegitimate "usurpation of power by a racist settler minority", and called on nations neither to recognise what it deemed "this illegal authority" nor to entertain diplomatic or economic relations with it. Both of these measures were adopted by ten votes to none with France abstaining.&lt;ref name=gd183&gt;{{Harvnb
|Gowlland-Debbas
|1990
|pp=183–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodesian black nationalists and their overseas supporters, prominently the OAU, clamoured for Britain to remove Smith's government with a military invasion, but Britain dismissed this option because of various logistical issues, the risk of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian strike on Zambia, and the psychological problems that were likely to accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops in what Smith said would be a "fratricidal war".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2008
|p=6}}; {{Harvnb
|Smith
|1997
|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson instead resolved to end the Rhodesian rebellion through economic sanctions; these principally comprised the expulsion of Rhodesia from the [[Sterling area]], a ban on the import of Rhodesian sugar, tobacco, chrome and other goods, and an oil boycott of Rhodesia. When the Rhodesians continued to receive oil, Wilson attempted to directly cut off their main supply lines, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] and [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], by posting a [[Royal Navy]] squadron to the [[Mozambique Channel]] in March 1966. This blockade, the [[Beira Patrol]], was endorsed the following month by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 221|UN Security Council Resolution 221]].&lt;ref name=mobley&gt;{{Harvnb
|Mobley
|2002
|pp=66, 71–76, 83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations proceeded to institute the first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 232|Security Council Resolutions 232]] (December 1966) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 253|253]] (April 1968), which required member states to cease all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Gowlland-Debbas
|1990
|pp=18, 701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson predicted in January 1966 that the various boycotts would force Smith to give in "within a matter of weeks rather than months",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2008
|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the British and UN sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with the breakaway colony, providing it with oil and other key resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Gowlland-Debbas
|1990
|p=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clandestine "sanction-busting" trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic collapse predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rowe
|2001
|pp=124–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhodesian government set up a string of front [[holding company|holding companies]] in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein to help keep trade open, with some success; goods that had previously been imported from Britain were replaced by Japanese, French and West German equivalents. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with vitriol, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Moorcraft

|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States created a formal exception in its embargo with the [[Byrd Amendment (1971)|Byrd Amendment]] of 1971, under which the US replaced its import of chrome from the Soviet Union with Rhodesian chrome ore. This breach of the UN sanctions, passed by the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] on the back of anti-communist Cold War considerations, was warmly welcomed by [[Southern United States|Southern]] white supremacists; it aided the Rhodesian economy until 1977, when the newly elected President [[Jimmy Carter]] successfully pushed Congress to repeal it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

==Recognition==

===Foreign===
[[File:Zimbabwean embassy in London.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Embassy of Zimbabwe, London|Rhodesia House]], the Rhodesian [[High Commission]] in London, represented Smith's government in the UK until 1969, and became a regular target for political activists.|alt=An Edwardian building with six floors stands on a moderate day, a flag flying atop it.]]
Official diplomatic recognition by other countries was key for Rhodesia as it was the only way it could regain the international legitimacy it had lost through UDI.&lt;ref name=white97/&gt; Recognition by the UK itself through a bilateral settlement would be the "first prize", in Smith's words, as it would end sanctions and constitutional ambiguity and make foreign acceptance, at least in the West, far more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

|Borstelmann
|2003
|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RF posited that some Western countries might recognise UDI even without a prior Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement. Specifically, it expected diplomatic recognition from South Africa and Portugal, and thought that France might recognise Rhodesia to annoy Britain and create a precedent for an [[Quebec sovereignty movement|independent Quebec]].&lt;ref name=white97&gt;{{Harvnb
|White
|2010
|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; But although South Africa and Portugal gave economic, military and limited political support to the post-UDI government (as did France and other nations, to a lesser extent), neither they nor any other country ever recognised Rhodesia as a ''de jure'' independent state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nel
|McGowan
|1999
|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodesia's unsuccessful attempts to win Western support and recognition included offers to the US government in 1966 and 1967, ignored by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon B Johnson]]'s administration, to provide Rhodesian troops to fight alongside the Americans and other anti-communist forces [[Vietnam War|in Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Glasgow Herald
|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain withdrew most of its [[High Commission]] staff from Salisbury in the days following UDI, leaving a small skeleton staff to man a "residual mission" intended to help Gibbs keep the British government informed of local happenings.&lt;ref name=berlyn171&gt;{{Harvnb
|Berlyn
|1978
|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries followed Britain's lead and closed their [[consul (representative)|consulates]] in Salisbury, with one prominent exception to this being the United States, which retained its consulate-general in post-UDI Rhodesia, relabelling it a "US Contacts Office" to circumvent the problem of diplomatic recognition.{{#tag:ref|Australia and Canada shut down their trade missions in Salisbury, while Finland, Sweden and Turkey closed their honorary consulates. Denmark, France, Italy, Japan and the United States withdrew their heads of mission, but kept their offices open. Austria, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Switzerland retained their representative missions in Salisbury at the same levels as before UDI.&lt;ref name=strack5152/&gt;|group="n"|name="embassies"}} South Africa and Portugal maintained "Accredited Diplomatic Representative" offices in Salisbury, which were embassies in all but name, while Rhodesia kept its pre-UDI overseas missions in Pretoria, Lisbon and Lourenço Marques. Unofficial representative offices of the Rhodesian government also existed in the US, Japan and West Germany, while a citizen of Belgium was employed to represent Rhodesian interests there. The Rhodesian High Commission in London, located at [[Embassy of Zimbabwe, London|Rhodesia House]] on the [[Strand, London|Strand]], remained under the control of the post-UDI government and effectively became its representative office in the UK.&lt;ref name=strack5152&gt;{{Harvnb
|Strack
|1978
|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[High Commission of South Africa, London|South African Embassy]] on [[Trafalgar Square]], Rhodesia House became a regular target for political demonstrations. These continued even after Britain forced the office to close in 1969.&lt;ref name=brownell&gt;{{Harvnb
|Brownell
|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because UDI claimed to make Rhodesia independent under the Queen as an effective dominion, many countries justified their retention of missions in Rhodesia concurrently with their non-recognition of the state by pointing out that the envoys' accreditation was to the Queen and not to Smith's government ''per se''. But Rhodesia moved away from its original line of independence as a [[constitutional monarchy]] and towards republicanism during the late 1960s, hoping to end ambiguity regarding its claimed constitutional status and elicit official foreign recognition. In March 1970, after the electorate had voted "yes" in a [[Rhodesian constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] the previous year both to a new constitution and to the abandoning of symbolic ties to the Queen, Smith's government declared Rhodesia a republic. Far from prompting recognition, this led all countries apart from Portugal and South Africa to withdraw their consulates and missions, as the justification of royal accreditation could no longer be used.&lt;ref name=strack5152/&gt; After Portugal's [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974, the Rhodesian mission in Lisbon was closed in May 1975, with its counterpart in Lourenço Marques following a month later on Mozambican independence. Portugal also withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia, leaving South Africa as the only country with links to Salisbury. Rhodesia's diplomatic activities were thereafter greatly diminished.&lt;ref name=strack53&gt;{{Harvnb
|Strack
|1978
|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial===
The Rhodesian High Court's nine Appellate and General Division judges initially neither rejected UDI nor openly supported it. The Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle, of the Appellate Division, announced simply that the judges would go on carrying out their duties "according to the law".&lt;ref name=wood1999/&gt; This originally noncommittal stance evolved over time, largely pivoting around legal cases argued at the High Court in Salisbury between 1966 and 1968. The first of these, ''[[Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke|Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke N. O. and Others]]'', concerned Daniel Madzimbamuto, a black Rhodesian who was detained without trial by the Rhodesian government on 6 November 1965, the day after the declaration of a state of emergency and five days before UDI, on the grounds that he might pose a danger to the public. Desmond Lardner-Burke, the Rhodesian Minister of Justice and Law and Order, prolonged the state of emergency in February 1966, prompting Madzimbamuto's wife to appeal for his release, arguing that since the United Kingdom had declared UDI illegal and outlawed the Rhodesian government with the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965, the state of emergency (and, by extension, Madzimbamuto's imprisonment) had no legal basis.&lt;ref name=gowllanddebbas7576/&gt;

The General Division of the Rhodesian High Court ruled on 9 September 1966 that legal sovereignty lay with the British government, but that to "avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law" the Rhodesian government should be considered to be in control of law and order to the same extent as before UDI. In February 1968, ruling on Madzimbamuto's appeal, Beadle concluded that the Smith administration would be recognised by the local judiciary as the ''de facto'' government by virtue of its "effective control over the state's territory", but that ''de jure'' recognition would be withheld as this was not "firmly established".&lt;ref name=gowllanddebbas7576&gt;{{Harvnb
|Gowlland-Debbas

|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madzimbamuto applied for the right to appeal to the British [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]; the Rhodesian Appellate Division promptly ruled that he had no right to do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

|pp=487–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 1968, considering the fate of James Dhlamini, Victor Mlambo and Duly Shadreck, three black Rhodesians convicted of murder and terrorist offences before UDI, Beadle ruled that Salisbury retained its pre-UDI powers regarding executions and could carry out death sentences. Whitehall announced on 1 March that at the request of the UK government, the Queen had exercised the [[royal prerogative of mercy]] and commuted the three death sentences to life imprisonment. Dhlamini and the others applied for a permanent [[stay of execution]] on this basis. At the hearing for Dhlamini and Mlambo on 4 March 1968, Beadle argued that he saw the statement from London as a decision by the UK government and not the Queen herself, and that in any case the 1961 constitution had transferred the prerogative of mercy from Britain to the Rhodesian Executive Council. "The present government is the fully ''de facto'' government and as such is the only power that can exercise the prerogative", he concluded. "It would be strange indeed if the United Kingdom government, exercising no internal power in Rhodesia, were given the right to exercise the prerogative of clemency."&lt;ref name=wood423424&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2008
|pp=423–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Judge President Sir Vincent Quenet and Justice [[Hector Macdonald (judge)|Hector Macdonald]] agreed, and the application was dismissed. Justice [[John Fieldsend]] of the High Court's General Division resigned in protest, writing to Gibbs that he no longer believed the High Court to be defending the rights of Rhodesian citizens. Dhlamini, Mlambo and Shadreck were hanged on 6 March.&lt;ref name=wood423424/&gt;

On 23 July 1968, the Privy Council in London ruled in Madzimbamuto's favour, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether the 1961 or 1965 constitution was considered effective. It declared the latter, "revolutionary" constitution illegal, and ruled that the former was overridden by the [[Southern Rhodesia Act 1965]], which had effectively outlawed the Rhodesian legislative, administrative and legal authorities in British law. [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]], delivering the majority opinion ([[Edward Pearce, Baron Pearce|Lord Pearce]] dissented), argued that the "usurper" government, though the effective master of Rhodesia, could not be considered lawful as the UK government was still attempting to regain control and it was impossible to say whether or not it would succeed. He ruled that only Whitehall could determine what constituted the maintenance of "law and order" in Rhodesia, and that the Rhodesian emergency measures were unlawful as they had been formalised by the Officer Administering the Government, a post-UDI figure who was, in British eyes, unconstitutional. Reid concluded that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained.&lt;ref name=wood487488/&gt; Harry Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice J&amp;nbsp;R Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies' ruling on 12 August and four days later was sworn in as Chief Justice of Botswana.&lt;ref name=wood499&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2008
|p=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhodesian High Court granted full ''de jure'' recognition to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black Rhodesians who had been a month earlier convicted  of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse.&lt;ref name=wood513&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood
|2008
|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that "on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government&amp;nbsp;... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so".&lt;ref name=gowllanddebbas7576/&gt;

Macdonald, a member of Beadle's ruling panel, argued that since UDI, the British government had acted unconstitutionally and illegally regarding Rhodesia by involving the United Nations in what should have been legally considered a domestic problem, and had concurrently abdicated its right to the allegiance of the Rhodesian people by waging economic war against the country and encouraging other nations to do the same. To support this argument, Macdonald referred to the assertion by the 17th-century Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]] that "the purpose of governing and the purpose of destroying cannot subsist together".&lt;ref name=young538541/&gt; Since Britain was in a state of economic war against Rhodesia, the court concluded, it could not at the same time be regarded as governing it.&lt;ref name=young538541&gt;{{Harvnb
|Young
|1969
|pp=538–541}}&lt;/ref&gt; UDI, the associated 1965 constitution and the government were thereafter considered ''de jure'' by the Rhodesian legal system.&lt;ref name=gowllanddebbas7576/&gt;

The British Commonwealth Secretary, [[George Thomson, Baron Thomson of Monifieth|George Thomson]], promptly accused the Rhodesian judges of breaching "the fundamental laws of the land",&lt;ref name=wood513/&gt; while Gibbs announced that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution, which allowed appeals to the Privy Council, he could only reject the Rhodesian court ruling.&lt;ref name=wood513/&gt; The Rhodesian judges continued regardless. Their recognition of the post-UDI order carried over to the 1969 republican constitution, adopted in 1970.&lt;ref name=gowllanddebbas7576/&gt;

Since Elizabeth II was still the Rhodesian head of state in the eyes of Smith's administration until 1970, "[[God Save the Queen]]" remained the Rhodesian national anthem, and continued to accompany official occasions such as the opening of the Rhodesian parliament. This was intended to demonstrate Rhodesia's continued loyalty to the Queen, but the use of the unmistakably British song at Rhodesian state occasions soon seemed "fairly ironic", as ''[[The Times]]'' put it.&lt;ref name=buch243&gt;{{Harvnb

After the Conservatives returned to power in Britain [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|in 1970]], provisional agreement was reached in November 1971 between the Rhodesian government and a British team headed by Douglas-Home (who was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] under Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]]), and in early 1972 a Royal Commission chaired by Lord Pearce travelled to Rhodesia to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion. After extensive consultation, the commission reported that while whites, [[coloured]]s and Asians were largely in favour of the presented terms, most blacks rejected them.

The [[Rhodesian Bush War]], a guerrilla conflict pitting the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] against the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), the respective armed wings of ZANU and ZAPU, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia.&lt;ref name="binda133136"&gt;{{Harvnb

By the mid-1970s, it was apparent that white minority rule could not continue forever.

The UK suspended the constitution and vested full executive and legislative powers in a new Governor, [[Christopher Soames, Baron Soames|Lord Soames]], who oversaw a ceasefire and [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|fresh elections]] during February and March 1980.

'''''Robin Hood: Men in Tights''''' is a 1993 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[Adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] and a [[parody]] of the [[Robin Hood]] story. The film was produced and directed by [[Mel Brooks]], co-written by Brooks, [[Evan Chandler]], and [[J.D. Shapiro|J. David Shapiro]] based on a story by Chandler and Shapiro, and stars [[Cary Elwes]], [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]], and [[Dave Chappelle]] in his film debut. It includes frequent comedic references to previous ''Robin Hood'' films (particularly ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves|Prince of Thieves]]'', upon which the plot is loosely structured, Disney's ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', and the 1938 [[Errol Flynn]] adaptation, ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'').

The film also features Brooks in a minor role; the first time he had appeared in one of his own films where he does not receive top billing or play the lead role since ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''. In addition to Brooks, it features cameos from Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Dick Van Patten]], and [[Rudy De Luca]].

==Plot==
Robin of Locksley is captured during the [[Crusades]] and is imprisoned at Khalil Prison in [[Jerusalem]]. With the help of fellow inmate Asneeze, who was arrested for [[jaywalking]], he escapes and frees the other inmates. Robin is asked by Asneeze to find his son, Ahchoo. Upon returning to England, he finds Ahchoo and discovers that Prince John has assumed control while King Richard is away fighting in the Crusades. Unbeknownst to Richard, the prince is abusing his power. Robin returns to his family home, Loxley Hall, only to find it being repossessed by John's men. His family's blind servant, Blinkin, informs Robin that his family members and pets have all died as well, and the only thing his father left him is a key which opens "the greatest treasure in all the land."

Robin recruits the large and ignorant Little John, and his friend Will Scarlet O'Hara, to help regain his father's land and oust Prince John from the throne. On his quest, Robin also attracts the attention of Maid Marian of Bagelle, who wants to find the man who has the key to her heart and [[Everlast (boxing)|Everlast]] [[chastity belt]]. They are also joined by Rabbi Tuckman, who shares with them his sacramental wine and bargain [[circumcisions]]. While Robin is training his band of tights-clad [[Merry Men]], the [[spoonerism]]-spouting Sheriff of Rottingham, hires the Mafioso [[Vito Corleone|Don Giovanni]] to assassinate Robin at the Spring Festival. Maid Marian hears of the evil plot, and sneaks out of her castle to warn Robin, accompanied by her frumpy [[Germany|German]] Lady-in-Waiting Broomhilde. The Sheriff and Don expect that Robin will not refuse a chance to participate in the archery tournament due to his pride, and Robin does just that.

At the archery tournament, a disguised Robin makes it to the final round, where he makes his shot but loses to his opponent. Robin calls this situation absurd, takes off his disguise and pulls out a copy of the movie's script to discover that he gets another shot; the Sheriff and Prince John then pull out their own copies and confirm this. Giovanni's assassin attempts to kill Robin by shooting at him with a scoped crossbow, but Blinkin catches the arrow in midair. Robin then takes the second shot, this time using a special "[[MIM-104 Patriot|PATRIOT]] arrow" and hits the target. After winning the tournament, Robin is arrested. Before Robin is taken away, Marian promises to do the most disgusting thing she can think of in exchange for Robin's safety: marry the Sheriff.

Several hours later, the ceremony commences with the opening prayer in [[Pig Latin]]. The Abbot quickly and discreetly reveals the Sheriff's unimposing first name, Mervyn. Before Marian can say "I do", the castle is attacked by the Men in Tights, led by Little John, Ahchoo, Blinkin, and Will. They quickly free Robin and a battle ensues. Marian is carried off to the tower by the Sheriff, who wants to [[deflower]] her but cannot get around the chastity belt without some uncomfortable chafing.

Robin arrives and begins to duel the sheriff, during which Robin's key falls into the lock of Marian's chastity belt, and Robin realizes it really is the key to "the greatest treasure in all the land." After winning the fight Robin spares the sheriff's life only to miss his sheath and accidentally run the sheriff through. The witch Latrine, Prince John's full-time cook and part-time adviser, saves him by giving him a magical [[Life Savers|lifesaver]] in exchange for agreeing to marry her. Before Robin and Marian can "celebrate" in her bedroom, Broomhilde arrives, insisting they get married first. Rabbi Tuckman conducts the ceremony, but they are suddenly interrupted by [[Richard I of England|King Richard]], recently returned from the Crusades, who insists on sanctioning the marriage with a kiss to the new bride. He orders John to be taken away to the [[Tower of London]] and made part of the tour. He also announces that, as the Prince has surrounded his given name with a foul stench, all the [[toilet]]s in the kingdom are to be renamed "johns".

All being as it should be, Robin and Marian are married and Ahchoo is made the new sheriff of Rottingham. When the crowd expresses its disbelief at a black sheriff, Ahchoo reminds them that "it worked in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''". When the night comes, Robin and Maid Marian attempt to open the [[chastity belt]], only to realize her lock will not open with his key.

''Robin Hood: Men in Tights'' was not one of Brooks's best grossing films in its theatrical release,&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Sun' Rises Over 'Justice'|work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 2, 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-02/entertainment/ca-19557_1_box-offices/2|accessdate=October 2, 2010|first=David J.|last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Brooks mentions that it and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' are his two top selling films on video in a DVD interview for the latter film.

The film debuted at #6 at the North American box office, with only $6,841,830.&lt;ref name="justice"/&gt; The film went on to gross a domestic total of $35,739,755.&lt;ref name="BoxOfficeMojo" /&gt;

The '''Stumpers-L''' [[electronic mailing list]], was a resource available for [[librarian]]s and others to discuss reference questions which they were unable to answer using available resources. It was succeeded by the similar '''Project Wombat.'''

== Origins ==

Stumpers-L began in 1992, created by Ann Feeney, a [[library school]] graduate student at [[Rosary College]] in [[River Forest, Illinois|River Forest]], [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]]. It was moved to [[Concordia University, Chicago]], then back to Rosary, which was then renamed [[Dominican University of Illinois|Dominican University]]. From 2002 to 2005 it was maintained by the Dominican University Graduate School of Library and Information Science program.  At the end of 2005 Dominican University ceased hosting the list. A replacement list, known as Project Wombat, commenced in January 2006, and is hosted by [[Project Gutenberg]].

Originally the Stumpers-L archive was a [[gopher protocol|gopher]] resource, but migrated to the [[World Wide Web]] once the web became more universally used in the mid-1990s.

== Topics ==

Typical Stumpers-L topics include:
*"Which words in the [[English language]] end in [[-gry]]?"
*"Who wrote ''[[The Book of Counted Sorrows]]'', and where can I get a copy?"
*"Is there a novel with [[lipogram|no letter 'e']] in it?"
*"Where can I find information on [[Kombucha]]/Manchurian Mushroom Tea?"
*"If the average [[human body]] were broken down into its constituent chemicals, how much would they be worth?"

== Public notice ==
A book of Stumpers-L questions and answers was published in 1998 by [[Random House]], edited by [[Fred Shapiro]] of [[Yale]] and titled ''Stumpers! Answers to Hundreds of Questions That Stumped The Experts'' ({{ISBN|0-375-70174-5}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2007/04/ljarchives/lj-talks-to-fred-r-shapiro/  Roncevic, Mirela. "LJ Talks To... Fred J. Shapiro" ''Library Journal'' April 10, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro was an active member;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2006_09/quotations.html Rotella, Carlo. "Can a book of quotations include Cher, MC Hammer, and 'Get a life'? Ask the man who out-Bartletted Bartlett's" ''Yale Alumni Magazine'' September/October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; other prominent members include Barbara and David P. Mikkelson, the co-editors of ''[[Snopes.com]].

The unofficial mascot of the Stumpers-L list is the [[wombat]].

'''''The Jolly Postman or Other People's Letters''''' is an interactive children's picture book by [[Janet and Allan Ahlberg]]. The innovative project required five years to complete, and much discussion with both the publisher [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] and the printer before it was issued in 1986. The first subject heading assigned by [[WorldCat]] is "Toy and movable books". [[Little, Brown]] published a U.S. edition in the same year.&lt;!-- 2012-07-19, I find the first edition in WorldCat for the second and third books only; subject headings are the same for all editions, of course --&gt;

''The Jolly Postman'' has sold more than six million copies, Allan Ahlberg told ''The Guardian'' in 2006. It made innovative use of envelopes to include letters, cards, games and a tiny book.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;!-- 
   piecing this together from WorldCat and our biography; Guardian needs to be checked later for which sentences it supports
 --&gt;

Alternatively, '''The Jolly Postman''' is a series of three books including 1991 and 1995 sequels to ''The Jolly Postman, or Other people's letters''. In the U.K., the first book won the [[Children's Book Award]] and the [[Kurt Maschler Award]].&lt;ref name=redhouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=bizland/&gt; The second book won the 1991 [[Greenaway Medal]] for British children's book illustration.&lt;ref name=medal1991/&gt;

==Summary==

''The Jolly Postman'' follows an unnamed [[mail carrier]] as he delivers letters by bicycle to characters from traditional children's stories that are well known in Britain. Following each sheet of narrative verse and illustration, there is one shaped like an [[envelope]] and containing one of the postman's deliveries. Each envelope is opened and its enclosure read at that point in the story.

[[WorldCat]] gives the entire description: "A Jolly Postman delivers letters to several famous fairy-tale characters such as the [[Big Bad Wolf]], [[Cinderella]], and the [[The Story of the Three Bears|Three Bears]]. Twelve of the pages have been made into six envelopes and contain eight letters and cards. Each letter may be removed from its envelope page and read separately."&lt;ref name=worldcat1/&gt;{{efn|name=WorldCat}}

==Awards==

The Ahlbergs won two major British book awards for ''The Jolly Postman'', the 1986 [[Kurt Maschler Award]]&lt;ref name=bizland/&gt; and 1987 [[Children's Book Award]].
From 1982 to 1999 the "Emil" figurines from Maschler publishers and [[Booktrust]] annually recognised the creator(s) of one "work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other".&lt;ref name=bizland/&gt; The [[Federation of Children's Book Groups]] award (now named for the bookseller Red House) "celebrate[s] the books that children themselves love reading". The winner is determined by vote of British children.&lt;ref name=redhouse/&gt;

Janet Ahlberg was a commended runner up for the 1986 [[Greenaway Medal]]&lt;ref name=ccsu/&gt;{{efn|name=HC}} and she won the 1991 Greenaway for the sequel.&lt;ref name=medal1991/&gt; The annual award by the [[CILIP|Library Association]] then recognised the year's best children's book illustration by a [[British subject]].

==Series==
Following ''The Jolly Postman'''s success, the Ahlbergs and Heinemann produced two sequels. The latter, third in the series, was published after Janet's death in 1994. For the second book, ''The Jolly Christmas Postman'', she won her second [[Kate Greenaway Medal]].&lt;ref name=medal1991/&gt;

==Notes==
{{reflist|25em |group=lower-alpha |refs=
{{efn|name=HC |1=
Today there are usually eight books on the Greenaway shortlist. 
According to CCSU, some runners up through 2002 were Commended (from 1959) or Highly Commended (from 1974). There were 99 commendations of both kinds in 44 years including six in 1986.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; No book series has won two Greenaway Medals. [[Chris Riddell]] was the highly commended runner up and the Medal winner, 1999 and 2001, for illustrating two books in the [[Pirate Diary|Diary series]] by [[Richard Platt]]. [[Graham Oakley]] was highly commended runner up in 1976 and 1982 for two books in his Church Mice series.

'''''The Positive Quotations''''' line is an inspirational [[book series]] [[Publishing|published]] by [[Fairview Press]].  Books in the series have topped the [[Bestseller|best-seller]] lists for [[self-help]], [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] [[nonfiction]] and [[Reference work|reference]] books.

==History==

'''1993-1996'''

Rubicon Press published ''The Rubicon Dictionary of Positive, Motivational, Life-Affirming, and Inspirational Quotations'', compiled and arranged by John Cook, in 1993.

'''1997-2001'''

Fairview Press acquired all [[rights]] to the Rubicon edition, republishing the work in [[hardcover]] in 1996 as ''The Fairview Guide to Positive Quotations''. The book was republished in [[paperback]] in 2007 under the title ''The Book of Positive Quotations'', which immediately gained favor with reference bookbuyers and research [[librarian]]s. ''The Book of Positive Quotations'' eventually climbed to #2 on the U.S. reference charts.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen BookScan Bestseller Report, June 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Fairview Press also released six break-out [[edition (book)|edition]]s of the book in 1997 under the [[trademark]] Pocket Positives(TM). In 1999, Fairview Press sold hardcover rights to ''The Book of Positive Quotations'' to Gramercy Press, an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Random House Value Publishing]].

'''2002-2007'''

Following the [[death]] of compiler John Cook in 2001, [[Steve Deger]] and Leslie Ann Gibson took over as series [[Book editor|editors]], creating ''The Women's Book of Positive Quotations'' (2002, now [[Out of print|out-of-print]]), ''The Little Book of Positive Quotations'' (2006) and a revised and expanded ''The Book of Positive Quotations'', 2nd Edition (2007), which included 3,000 new quotations. Fairview Press also acquired the rights to Pat Corrick Hinton's book, ''Time to Become Myself'', and re-released it in 2007 as part of the series under the title ''The Book of Positive Quotations for Our Golden Years''.
 
'''2008–Present'''

[[Competition]] from [[online]] sources---coupled with [[economic contraction]] within the retail trade book [[Market (economics)|market]]---led Fairview Press to format select volumes as value-priced gift editions for [[discount retailers]] and nontraditional retail book outlets.&lt;ref&gt;Danford, Natalie. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6480723.html Online or on Pages? Publishers Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; Releases from this period included ''The Daily Book of Positive Quotations'' (2008) by Linda Picone; ''The Nightly Book of Positive Quotations'' (2009) by Steve Deger; ''The Girl's Book of Positive Quotations'' (2008) by Steve Deger and Leslie Ann Gibson; ''The Boy's Book of Positive Quotations'' (2009) by Steve Deger, with [[illustration]]s by [[Queenie Chan]] (2009);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/messboard/viewtopic.php?p=91065&amp;sid=6e8704753a751e46380f024961a9a424 Comics Journal Message Board]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Little Book of Positive Quotations'', 2nd Edition (2009) by Steve Deger and Leslie Ann Gibson.

'''''Vasco Dry Cleaners v Twycross'''''&lt;ref&gt;1979 (1) SA 603 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is a classic case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African property law|property]] [[South African law|law]], and illustrative of the courts' treatment of simulated transactions. It was heard in the [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frans Lourens Herman Rumpff|Rumpff CJ]], [[Pieter Jacobus Rabie|Rabie JA]], Corbett JA, Kotzé JA and Hoexter AJA.&lt;/ref&gt; on 28 August 1978, with judgment handed down on 16 November.

== Facts ==
In 1967, "C" sold his dry-cleaning business, Vasco Dry Cleaners, to AC (Pty) Ltd, which was controlled by "D." A term of the contract of sale stipulated that, in respect of the dry-cleaning machinery, the passing of ownership would be suspended until the purchase price, to be paid in instalments, had been met in full; in the meantime, ownership remained with "C."

Before the final instalment had been paid, AC ran into financial difficulties, and "D" approached "T" for help. "T" agreed to purchase the dry-cleaning machines from AC and pay the price directly to "C." "T" also entered into another agreement with AC whereby "T" resold the machines to AC at exactly same purchase price, in instalments. No actual delivery took place, and AC remained in control of the machines.

AC later sold and delivered the machines to Vasco without paying all the instalments due to "T," who then claimed the machines from Vasco on the ground that they were the owners because they had paid "C" and taken delivery first by means of ''[[traditio brevi manu]]'', and then from AC by ''[[constitutum possessorium]]''.

== Judgment ==
The court found that this constituted a simulated transanction. This was evident from the fact, ''inter alia'', that "D" did not want dispose of the machines, that "T" did not need the machines, and that the sale was based not on market value but on the purchase price. The parties did not intend to enter into sale and resale; they intended to create a pledge.

A '''vehicle identification number''' ('''VIN''') is a unique code, including a [[serial number]], used by the [[automotive industry]] to identify individual [[motor vehicle]]s, [[Trailer (vehicle)|towed vehicles]], [[motorcycle]]s, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]]  and [[moped]]s, as defined in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 3779 (content and structure) and ISO 4030 (location and attachment).

VINs were first used in 1954 in the United States.&lt;ref name="nhtsa1"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/| title = Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) | access-date = 2011-07-24 | publisher = National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1954 to 1981, there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers used different formats.

In 1981, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] of the United States standardized the format.&lt;ref name="nhtsa1"/&gt; It required all on-road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN, which does not include the letters I (i), O (o), and Q (q) (to avoid confusion with numerals 1 and 0).

There are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been [[vehicle title branding|written off]]. See the [[Used car]] article for a list of countries where this service is available.

==Classification==
There are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN.
* [[FMVSS]] 115, Part 565: Used in United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=18b4d0415b77325b50963d4312e0a382&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt49.6.565&amp;rgn=div5 |title=eCFR – Code of Federal Regulations – Title 49: Transportation – PART 565—VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VIN) REQUIREMENTS |publisher=www.ecfr.gov |date= |access-date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard 3779: Used in Europe and many other parts of the world
* [[SAE International|SAE]] J853: Very similar to the ISO standard
* [[Australian Design Rules|ADR]] 61/2 used in Australia, referring to ISO 3779 and 3780&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/asmade/bytitle/AB342EFD35B8719ECA2570CF007BE90F?OpenDocument |title=ComLaw Legislative Instruments – Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 61/02 – Vehicle Marking) 2005 (ADR 61/02) |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |access-date=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Modern VINs are based on two related standards, originally issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1979 and 1980: ISO 3779&lt;ref&gt;ISO 3779:2009 Road vehicles—Vehicle identification number (VIN)—Content and structure&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO 3780,&lt;ref&gt;ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles—World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/49cfr565_05.html |title=United States Federal VIN Requirements (Title 49, Chapter V, Part 565) |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |date= |access-date=2010-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527210905/http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/49cfr565_05.html |archive-date=2010-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World manufacturer identifier===
The first three characters uniquely identify the [[manufacturer]] of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code. A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the United States), 1G1 represents [[Chevrolet]] passenger cars; 1G2, [[Pontiac]] passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet [[truck]]s.

The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) in the U.S. assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.&lt;ref name=ISO3780&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/45844.html |title=ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles – World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code |publisher=[[ISO]] |date=2009-10-05 |access-date=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of ''W0L'' because Adam Opel AG is based in Rüsselsheim, Germany).

In the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number. For example, 8X–82 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82, excluding 80.

===Vehicle descriptor section===
The fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the [[automobile platform]] used, the model, and the [[car body styles|body style]]. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]], U is for a 6.0-liter [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, and E is for a 7.0&amp;nbsp;L V8.

====North American check digits====
One element that is fairly consistent is the use of position nine as a [[#Check-digit calculation|check digit]], compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, and used fairly consistently elsewhere.

===Vehicle identifier section===
The 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North America, the last five digits must be numeric.

====Model year encoding====
One consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required worldwide to encode the [[#Model year encoding|model year]] of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the [[model year]] code. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.

The year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], as "A" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the "A" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that "Y" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as "A", "B", "C", etc.

On April 30, 2008, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a final rule amending 49 CFR Part 565, "so that the current 17 character vehicle identification number (VIN) system, which has been in place for almost 30 years, can continue in use for at least another 30 years", in the process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States. There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:
* The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.
* In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980–2009.{{Citation needed|reason=Seems wrong as e.g. a 2013 Volvo V60 has YV1xxx7xxDxxxxxxx|date=May 2017}} If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010–2039.
* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1–8 and 10 that were assigned from 1980–2009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.

====Plant code====
Compulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the factory at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.

====Production number====
In the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.

==Check-digit calculation==
Check-digit validation is compulsory for all road vehicles sold in North America.

When trying to validate a VIN with a [[check digit]], first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see [[#Weights used in calculation|below]]) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0–9, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs &lt;tt&gt;5GZCZ43D13S812715&lt;/tt&gt; (correct with leading five) and &lt;tt&gt;SGZCZ43D13S812715&lt;/tt&gt; (incorrect with leading character "S"). The VINs in the Porsche image, &lt;tt&gt;WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124&lt;/tt&gt;, and the GM-T body image, &lt;tt&gt;KLATF08Y1VB363636&lt;/tt&gt;, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.

===Transliterating the numbers===
Transliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's [[EBCDIC]]) are in the following chart. ''I'', ''O'', and ''Q'' are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with ''N/A'' (''not applicable''). Numerical digits use their own values.

{|class="wikitable"
|+Transliteration key:&amp;nbsp;values for VIN decoding
|'''A''': 1 ||'''B''': 2 ||'''C''': 3 ||'''D''': 4 ||'''E''': 5 ||'''F''': 6 ||'''G''': 7 ||'''H''': 8 ||'''I''': {{n/a}}
|-
|'''J''': 1 ||'''K''': 2 ||'''L''': 3 ||'''M''': 4 ||'''N''': 5 ||'''O''': {{n/a}} ||'''P''': 7 ||'''Q''': {{n/a}} ||'''R''': 9
|-
|{{n/a}} ||'''S''': 2 ||'''T''': 3 ||'''U''': 4 ||'''V''': 5 || '''W''': 6||'''X''': 7 ||'''Y''': 8 || '''Z''': 9
|}

''S'' is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.

===Weights used in calculation===
The following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.

|-

|}

===Worked example===
Consider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.

{|class="wikitable" style="font-size:1.2em;font-family:monospace"
|-
!VIN
||1||M||8||G||D||M||9||A|| ||K||P||0||4||2||7||8||8
|-
!Value
||1||4||8||7||4||4||9||1||0||2||7||0||4||2||7||8||8
|-
!Weight
||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||10||0||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2
|-
!Products
||8&amp;nbsp;||28||48||35||16||12||18||10||0&amp;nbsp;||18||56||0&amp;nbsp;||24||10||28||24||16
|}

# The VIN's value is calculated from the above transliteration table. This number is used in the rest of the calculation.
# Copy the ''weights'' from the above weight factor table.
# The ''products'' row is the result of the multiplication of the vertical columns: ''Value'' and ''Weight.''
# The products (8, 28, 48, 35 ... 24, 16) are all added together to yield a sum, ''351''.
# Find the remainder after dividing by 11&lt;br/&gt;351 [[modulo operation|MOD]] 11 = 10&lt;br/&gt;351 ÷ 11 = 31 &lt;sup&gt;'''10'''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
# The remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is 10, the check digit is X. In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as ''X''.

With a check digit of ''X'', the VIN &lt;tt&gt;1M8GDM9A_KP042788&lt;/tt&gt; is written &lt;tt&gt;1M8GDM9A''X''KP042788&lt;/tt&gt;.

A VIN with ''straight-ones'' (seventeen consecutive ''1''s) has the nice feature that its check digit ''1'' matches the calculated value ''1''. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder {{frac|1|11}}; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.

===Example code===

;Java

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
private static int transliterate(char c) {
	return "0123456789.ABCDEFGH..JKLMN.P.R..STUVWXYZ".indexOf(c) % 10;
}

private static char getCheckDigit(String vin) {
	String map = "0123456789X";
	String weights = "8765432X098765432";
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 17; ++i) {
		sum += transliterate(vin.charAt(i)) * map.indexOf(weights.charAt(i));
	}
	return map.charAt(sum % 11);
}

private static boolean validate(String vin) {
    if(vin.length()!=17) return false;
	return getCheckDigit(vin) == vin.charAt(8);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!-- No more examples in your favourite language; one is plenty to understand the algorithm --&gt;

==VIN scanning==
VINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras, or digitally read via [[OBD-II]] in newer vehicles. There are smartphone applications that can pass the VIN to websites to decode the VIN.

==List of common WMI==
The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) assigns the WMI (world manufacturer identifier) to countries and manufacturers. The following list shows a small selection of world manufacturer codes.

[[File:Qing Hao.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Recipes for Fifty-two Ailments'' contains the first known mention of ''qinghao'' 青蒿, or [[Artemisia annua|wormwood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Artemisia-annua.htm |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | accessdate=24 August 2013 |title=Plants &amp; Fungi: Artemisia annua}}&lt;/ref&gt; in history. Though it appears here in a recipe against female [[hemorrhoids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998|p=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in later Chinese medical texts wormwood was recommended for treating intermittent [[fever]]s. In the 1970s, [[artemisinin]] was isolated from ''[[Artemisia annua]]'' (a kind of wormwood) and shown to have [[antimalarial]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hsu|2006|p=666}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Wushi'er Bingfang''''' ({{zh|c=五十二病方|p=Wǔshí’èr Bìngfāng}}), or '''''Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments''''', is an [[ancient China|ancient Chinese]] medical text that was discovered in 1973 in [[Mawangdui]] in a tomb that was sealed in 168 BCE under the [[Han dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998}}, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was copied in [[seal script]] on [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|sheets of silk]] around 215 BCE, under the [[Qin dynasty]], but might have dated from even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern editors chose its title because the text starts with a list of fifty-two ailments for which recipes are given.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] presents more than 250 [[exorcism|exorcistic]] and drug-based cures for ailments such as [[wart]]s, [[hemorrhoid]]s, [[inguinal hernia|inguinal swellings]], and [[snake bite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998}}, pp. 24 and 73; {{harvnb|Harper|1999|p=875}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other medical treatments, the text also recommends [[lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]] and [[cauterization]], but mention neither [[acupuncture]] nor [[moxibustion]] (cauterization with [[moxa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With roughly 9,950 characters, ''Wushi'er bingfang'' is the longest of the medical texts that have been found in ancient Chinese tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other excavated manuscripts (from [[Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts|Zhangjiashan]] and [[Wuwei,_Gansu#History|Wuwei]], among others), it has shed light on the early development of [[Chinese medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unschuld|Zheng|2005}}, pp. 21-22; {{harvnb|Lo|2002}}, pp. xxviii-xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; It illustrates, for instance, that magical [[incantation]]s were a common therapeutic method among the [[Society of the Han dynasty|social elite of the time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And because it shows the development of [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|channel theory]] in a primitive stage and does not mention the doctrine of [[Yinyang]] and the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]], it has pushed historians to date the more sophisticated ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' (''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon'') to the first century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sivin|1993|p=199}}; {{harvnb|Lo|2002|p=xxxii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original manuscript of ''Wushi'er bingfang'' is kept at the [[Hunan Provincial Museum]] in [[Changsha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|1998|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
