      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3493">The '''1997 Moscow Memorandum''', also known as the '''Primakov Memorandum''' (after the then-Foreign Minister [[Yevgeny Primakov]] of [[Russia]]), is an agreement governing relations between [[Moldova]] and [[Transnistria]].

Translated from the original Russian text, the full formal title of the document is '''Memorandum on the principles of normalizations of the relations between the Republic of Moldova and Transnistria'''.

The memorandum's historical importance followed the need for both [[Tiraspol]] and [[Chişinău]] to normalize relations in the wake of the 1992 [[War of Transnistria]].

It was signed in Moscow on 8 May 1997, by Moldovan President [[Petru Lucinschi]] and Transnistrian President [[Igor Smirnov]],  with the mediation of the Russian Federation, [[Ukraine]] and [[Niels Helveg Petersen]] on behalf of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] Mission in Moldova.

In compliance with the final clause of the memorandum, the relations between the Republic of Moldova and Transnistria shall be developed within the framework of a common state, within the borders of [[Moldovan SSR]]. The Russian Federation and Ukraine stated their readiness to become guarantors of the Transnistrian status observance, as well as of the Memorandum's provisions. Chişinău and Tiraspol have decided to sustain the establishment of legal and state relations: the mutual decision coordination, inclusively regarding prerogatives delimitation and delegation, the safeguard of mutual security, the Transnistrian participation in the process of accomplishment of the foreign policy of the Republic of Moldova. The memorandum also gave Transnistria the right to independently conduct foreign economic activity, although later the Memorandum provisions had widely diverging legal and political interpretations in Chişinău and Tiraspol.

The parties reaffirmed the 1992 ceasefire and requested that Russia, Ukraine and OSCE continue their mediation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Moldova, Peace Agreement, Memorandum on the Basis for Normalization of Relations between the Republic of Moldova and Transdniestria, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=108&amp;regionSelect=9-Eastern_Europe#&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties agreed that the Dniestr Region would have the right to unilaterally establish and maintain international contacts in the economic, scientific-technical and cultural spheres.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Moldova, Peace Agreement, Memorandum on the Basis for Normalization of Relations between the Republic of Moldova and Transdniestria, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=108&amp;regionSelect=9-Eastern_Europe#&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2012 Olympics one minute of silence campaign''' refers to an international campaign created to persuade the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to hold one minute of silence at the opening ceremony of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] to remember the Israeli athletes killed in the [[Munich massacre]] at the 1972 Olympics by the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorist organization [[Black September (group)|Black September]]. Support for the campaign came from a number of high-ranking officials and governments, including the [[United States Congress]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]], the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]], the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]], the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], the [[Bundestag|German Parliament]], and German Foreign Minister [[Guido Westerwelle]].

The IOC declined the request for a minute of silence at the opening ceremony, but IOC officials honoured the victims at a ceremony organised by the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community in London during the Olympics on August 6, 2012. A further ceremony was planned in Germany on the anniversary of the attack on September 5, 2012 at the military airfield of [[Fürstenfeldbruck]].&lt;ref name="Rogge rejects1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/rogge-again-rejects-calls-for-minutes-silence-for-victims-of-1972-munich-massacre/2012/07/21/gJQAjL6h0W_story.html | title=Rogge again rejects calls for minute's silence for victims of 1972 Munich massacre | work=The Washington Post | agency=The Associated Press | date=July 21, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogge rejects 4"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/still-refusing-moment-of-silence-olympic-head-says-memorial-will-be-held-in-germany/ | title=Still refusing moment of silence, Olympic head says memorial will be held in Germany | work=The Times of Israel | date=July 22, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Davidovich, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOC President Rogge led a spontaneous minute of silence during a ceremony on July 23, 2012 which promoted the [[Olympic truce]], marking the first time ever that the IOC honored the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village.&lt;ref name="Rogge minute of silence"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/ioc-president-leads-moment-of-silent-at-olympic-athletes-village/ | title=IOC president leads moment of silence at Olympic athletes' village | work=The Times of Israel | date=July 23, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogge minute of silence1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/ioc-president-rogge-honors-slain-israeils-with-a-minute-of-silence-in-athletes-village/2012/07/23/gJQAJxj53W_story.html | title=IOC President Rogge honors slain Israelis with a minute of silence in athletes village | work=The Washington Post | agency=Associated Press | date=July 23, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munich widows asks crowd"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/munich-widows-ask-crowd-to-hold-own-moment-of-silence-at-olympic-opening/ | title=Munich widows ask crowd to hold own moment of silence at Olympic opening | work=The Times of Israel | date=July 25, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Shaviv, Miriam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Munich massacre]] occurred during the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, in southern [[West Germany]], when members of the [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]] were taken [[hostage]] and eventually murdered by the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AK6QA_WotRYC&amp;pg=PT144&amp;dq=%22munich+massacre%22+terrorists#v=onepage&amp;q=%22munich%20massacre%22%20terrorists&amp;f=false |title=Terrorism &amp; It's Effects&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Google Books |accessdate=June 22, 2010|isbn=9788189940935|date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36PiolMMZrUC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22munich+massacre%22+terrorists#v=onepage&amp;q=%22munich%20massacre%22%20terrorists&amp;f=false |title=Terrorism&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Google Books |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=June 22, 2010|isbn=9781562546663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJJG14mHbGAC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22munich+massacre%22+terrorists#v=onepage&amp;q=%22munich%20massacre%22%20terrorists&amp;f=false |title=The new dimension of international ...&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Google Books |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=June 22, 2010|isbn=9783728129499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOfkAoDb_2IC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=%22munich+massacre%22+terrorists#v=onepage&amp;q=%22munich%20massacre%22%20terrorists&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of terrorism&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Google Books |accessdate=June 22, 2010|isbn=9780761924081|date=December 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWzieu562dQC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22munich+massacre%22+terrorists#v=onepage&amp;q=%22munich%20massacre%22%20terrorists&amp;f=false |title=The terrorist trap: America's ...&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Google Books |date=July 18, 1976 |accessdate=June 22, 2010|isbn=9780253214775}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnappers killed eleven Israeli athletes and coaches, as well as a West German police officer.

Following the attack, a memorial service was held in the Olympic Stadium, although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President [[Avery Brundage]] did not refer to the athletes during his speech.&lt;ref name="CBS remembered"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/05/world/main520865.shtml | title=Munich Massacre Remembered | publisher=CBS News | date=February 11, 2009 | accessdate=July 26, 2012 | author=Grace, Francie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the memorial, the IOC has repeatedly rejected calls to commemorate the victims during the Olympics or hold an official memorial service.&lt;ref name="Guardian fight for remembrance"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/26/munich-olympics-massacre-fight-for-remembrance | title=Munich Olympics massacre: the fight for remembrance | work=The Guardian | date=June 26, 2012 | accessdate=July 26, 2012 | author=Sherwood, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial attempts==
The families of the murdered athletes have attempted since the massacre to receive official remembrance for those killed in the massacre, starting with the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Olympics]] in 1976.

Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, has helped lead the campaign, and has described the idea of a minute of silence or other form of commemoration as "natural in our [the families'] eyes."  However, Spitzer said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;But they told us very clearly: "There are 21 Arab delegations that will leave if we say something about the Israeli athletes." So I said: "Let them leave if they can't understand what the Olympics are all about – a connection between people through sport."&lt;ref name="Guardian fight for remembrance" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the Montreal Olympics, the IOC has continued to reject any official commemoration of the victims.&lt;ref name="Guardian fight for remembrance" /&gt;  Spitzer explained that the International Olympics Committee says it is not in the "protocol of the opening ceremony to have a commemoration."  However, Spitzer said, "Well, my husband coming home in a coffin was not in the protocol either. This was the blackest page in Olympic history. These 11 athletes were part of the Olympic family, they were not accidental tourists. They should be remembered as part of the Olympic framework."&lt;ref name="Guardian fight for remembrance" /&gt;

==Campaign==
In April 2012, the year of the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre, an online petition was created titled "Tell the International Olympic Committee: 40 Years is Enough!", to urge the  International Olympic Committee to honour the memory of the eleven murdered athletes in one minute of silence. The Jewish Community Center of [[Rockland County, New York]], initiated the petition with Ankie Spitzer, the wife of Andrei Spitzer, who was killed at the Munich Olympics. The petition says, "Just one minute — at the 2012 London Summer Olympics and at every Olympic Game, to promote peace."&lt;ref name="CNN 100,000"/&gt; When the London Olympics took place in July, over 100,000 people had signed the petition in support of one minute of silence.&lt;ref name="CNN 100,000"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-22/worldsport/sport_olympics-munich-silence_1_ankie-spitzer-inmates-from-israeli-prisons-israeli-olympians | title=Olympics head rejects silence for Israeli victims | publisher=CNN | date=July 22, 2012 | accessdate=July 27, 2012 | author=Greene, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinton support" /&gt;

Later during the same month, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] wrote an official letter to the International Olympic Committee, in which he requested the commemoration of the eleven murdered athletes in a minute of silence, as well as an emphasis on the Olympic principles of equality and brotherhood. Ayalon said, "We must remain vigilant against acts of hate and intolerance that stand in contrast to the ideals of the international Olympics."&lt;ref name="Ayalon call 2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-foreign-minister-asks-to-remember-murdered-israeli-athletes-at-olympics/ | title=Israel calls for Olympic remembrance for murdered Munich athletes | work=The Times of Israel | date=April 24, 2012 | accessdate=July 27, 2012 | author=Rubin, Shira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Support for the one minute of silence campaign for the London 2012 Olympics emerged from across the globe. Calls for a minute of silence also came from various parliaments and government officials. In addition, over 100,000 people signed a petition in support of one minute of silence.&lt;ref name="CNN 100,000" /&gt;

===Australia===
Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]], Deputy Prime Minister [[Wayne Swan]], Foreign Minister [[Bob Carr]], opposition leader [[Tony Abbott]], New South Wales Premier [[Barry O'Farrell]], Victorian Premier [[Ted Baillieu]], and federal lawmakers [[Michael Danby]] and [[Josh Frydenberg]] signed a letter urging the International Olympics Committee to hold one minute of silence. The letter said, "Silence is a fitting tribute for the athletes who lost their lives on the Olympic stage. Silence contains no statements, assumptions or beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret."&lt;ref name="Australia support"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/australian-lawmakers-write-letter-urging-for-olympic-moment-of-silence/ | title=Australian lawmakers write letter urging for Olympic moment of silence | work=The Times of Israel | date=June 6, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian lawmakers unanimously supported a motion that supported a minute of silence during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. Prime Minister Julia Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbot voted for the motion as well. The motion said that the impact of 1972 Munich Massacre "has been seared on world consciousness" and urged the International Olympic Committee to commemorate the 40th anniversary.&lt;ref name="Australia lawmakers support"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/australian-lawmakers-vote-unanimously-for-olympic-moment-of-silence/ | title=Australian lawmakers vote for Olympic minute of silence for Munich victims | work=The Times of Israel | date=June 26, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The House of Commons unanimously adopted a motion by Liberal Member of Parliament [[Irwin Cotler]] to support the campaign for a special tribute for the victims of the Munich Massacre.&lt;ref name="Canada Gvt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/canadas-federal-government-unanimous-in-support-of-munich-tribute-at-games-158963685.html | title=Canada's federal government unanimous in support of Munich tribute at Games | agency=The Canadian Press | date=June 13, 2012 | accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister of State for Sport [[Bal Gosal]] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] urged IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] to reconsider his position against commemorating the victims. They wrote, "The terrorist attack targeted not only Israel, but the spirit and goals of the Olympic movement. Given the impact of this tragedy, on the Olympic community as a whole and the world, it should be marked publicly as part of the official ceremony of the games, not just by the Israeli delegation."&lt;ref name="Canada Gvt" /&gt;

===Germany===
Foreign Minister [[Guido Westerwelle]] supported a minute of silence at the London Olympics in a letter to Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympics Committee. Westerwelle wrote that the Munich Massacre was "also an attack on the Olympic Games and the Olympic idea of promoting peace and friendship among the nations."  Westerwelle recognized that the focus of the Olympics must be the sports competition, but also appealed to Rogge for "a moment's pause at an appropriate time" during the Olympics, which would be "a humanitarian gesture and a fitting way to send the message that violence and terror are incompatible with the Olympic idea."  Westerwelle added that Germany "looks back with grief and anguish on the tragedy of Munich" and their thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the Israeli team members who survived.&lt;ref name="GermanFM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/german-fm-calls-for-minute-of-silence-for-israeli-athletes-killed-on-his-territory/ | title=German FM calls for minute of silence for Israeli athletes killed on his territory | work=The Times of Israel | date=June 27, 2012 | accessdate=July 27, 2012 | author=Ahren, Raphael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament President [[Norbert Lammert]] pledged his support for one minute of silence in an official letter to Israel's [[Knesset]] Speaker [[Reuven Rivlin]]. Rivlin said, "That Germany, on whose territory the terrorist attacks were carried out, joined the cause is extremely significant."  "The case for a minute of silence to mark the 40th anniversary of the massacre is a moral cause of the first order."&lt;ref name="Germany Rivlin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-us-australia-and-germany-urge-olympic-minute-of-silence-for-munich-victims/ | title=US, Australia and Germany urge Olympic moment of silence for 1972 Munich victims | work=The Times of Israel | date=June 26, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Podoslky, Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The London Assembly unanimously agreed on a motion that called on Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] to ensure that the victims of the 1972 Munich Massacre are remembered during the 2012 Games with a minute of silence in the Olympic Park during the opening or closing ceremonies. The motion said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Assembly notes the widespread, cross-party, support for one minute's silence during the London Olympic Games to mark the 10th Olympiad since and 40th anniversary of the terrorist massacre of Israeli competitors and their coaches during the 1972 Munich Olympics. 
This Assembly urges the Mayor of London to use his position and influence to ensure an official minute's silence remembrance is observed in the Olympic Park during the Opening or Closing Ceremonies of the London Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="London Gov Minute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_london_assembly/assembly-calls-minutes-silence-remember-victims-munich-games | title=Assembly calls for minute's silence to remember victims of Munich Games | publisher=London.gov.UK | date=June 20, 2012 | accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="London Gov UK Full"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=4502&amp;T=1 | title=MINUTES | publisher=Greater London Authority: London Assembly | date=June 20, 2012 | accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo London Assembly" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Andrew Dismore]] AM proposed the motion and said, "It is 40 years since this terrible attack took place and there has not once been a memorial service or event officially part of the scheduled events at Olympic Games. This is simply not good enough. The IOC say to have a minute's silence to commemorate these victims of terrorism would be a 'political gesture' but surely not having a minute's silence is, in itself, the political gesture. This is not about the nationality of the victims – they were Olympians."  [[Roger Evans (London politician)|Roger Evans]] AM seconded the motion and said,  "The IOC needs to show some political courage and allow the commemoration of a tragedy that affected their guests during their event in their venue forty years ago. This important decision should not be dictated by a small number of their members."&lt;ref name="London Gov Minute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo London Assembly"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/06/20/london-assembly-calls-for-1972-munich-tribute_n_1612262.html | title=London Assembly Calls For Olympic Games To Pay Tribute To 1972 Munich Victims | publisher=The Huffington Post | work=Press Association | date=June 20, 2012 | accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
Approximately 140 members of Italy's parliament urged the International Olympic Committee to observe one minute of silence on the 40th anniversary of the Munich Massacre in a letter they wrote to the IOC.&lt;ref name="Italy Support"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/italy-joins-push-for-moment-of-silence-to-remember-slain-israeli-olympians/ | title=Italy joins push for moment of silence to remember Israelis slain at Munich Games | publisher=The Times of Israel | date=July 15, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[United States Senate]] unanimously passed a resolution which urged the International Olympic Committee to hold one minute of silence.&lt;ref name="Senate Support"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=275335 | title=US Senate urges Munich Olympic moment of silence | publisher=The Jerusalem Post| work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency | date=June 26, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House of Representatives]] unanimously passed a similar bill brought by the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], but the full body did not receive a chance to vote on it.&lt;ref name="Senate Support" /&gt; The House of Representatives held a moment of silence themselves, and one-minute speeches were given on the House floor as well. Representative [[Eliot Engel]], who cosponsored the resolution in support of a minute of silence, blamed the IOC's refusal on "being political because frankly they’re afraid of offending some of the Arab nations."  However, Engel said, "If you have this fiction of fraternal bonds and commonality of feeling, then it's appropriate for the IOC to act without any politics whatsoever. The only reason they haven’t done this in 40 years is because it's Israeli athletes, and that makes it even more disgraceful."&lt;ref name="Congress holds minute"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/congressmen-to-hold-moment-of-silence-for-munich-11/ | title=Congressmen to hold moment of silence for Munich 11 | work=The Times of Israel | date=July 26, 2012 | agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] said that he "absolutely" supports a minute of silence. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said "We absolutely support the campaign for a minute of silence at the Olympics to honor the Israeli athletes killed in Munich."&lt;ref name="obama support"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/white-house-obama-absolutely-supports-olympic-moment-of-silence-for-slain-israelis/ | title=Obama 'absolutely' supports Olympic moment of silence for Israeli victims of 1972 massacre | publisher=The Times of Israel | date=July 20, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Ben Goldberg, Ari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] wrote to the International Olympics Committee President Jacques Rogge to urge the IOC to hold an "appropriate memorial event" in London for the victims of the Munich massacre, and urged the IOC to reverse their decision against holding a minute of silence.&lt;ref name="Clinton support"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/apnewsbreak-clinton-urges-ioc-to-hold-moment-of-silence-for-israeli-athletes-killed-in-munich/2012/07/25/gJQA74mf9W_story.html | title=APNewsBreak: Clinton urges IOC to hold moment of silence for Israeli athletes killed in Munich | publisher=The Washington Post | work=The Associated Press | date=July 25, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate, Governor [[Mitt Romney]], supported one minute of silence. [[Andrea Saul]], a spokeswoman for Mitt Romney, said, "Governor Romney supports the moment of silence in remembrance of the Israeli athletes killed in the Munich Olympic Games."&lt;ref name="Romney support"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/23/us-usa-campaign-romney-olympics-idUSBRE86M13520120723 | title=Romney backs Olympics moment of silence to honor Munich victims | publisher=Reuters | date=July 23, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Hosenball, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Olympic Committee response==
The International Olympic Committee refused to hold one minute of silence at the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre. IOC President Jacques Rogge said that, "We feel that the opening ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident."  However, Rogge said that the IOC would honour the victims of the Munich massacre at a reception in London during the Olympics on August 6, and that IOC officials would attend a ceremony in Germany on the anniversary of the attack on September 5 at the military airfield of [[Fürstenfeldbruck]], where most of the Israelis died during a botched rescue attempt. Rogge also said that he has attended several ceremonies with the Israeli Olympic Committee and Israeli athletes during recent games.&lt;ref name="Rogge rejects1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogge rejects 4" /&gt;

Despite the refusal to honour the victims during the opening ceremony of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the Olympic truce. This was the first time that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by "honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals that have brought us together in this beautiful Olympic village" and said that the Israelis "came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity."  Rogge added, "we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them."&lt;ref name="Rogge minute of silence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogge minute of silence1" /&gt; In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, "He is trying to do the bare minimum," and called it "shameful." Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, "This is not the right solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. We asked for a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people."&lt;ref name="IOC Impromptu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://london2012.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/i-o-c-s-impromptu-munich-remembrance-draws-criticism/ | title=I.O.C.'s Impromptu Munich Remembrance Draws Criticism | work=The New York Times | date=July 23, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Gerstner, Joanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had "submitted to terrorism", and would be "written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace." Their attacks were applauded by the audience, but afterwards some attendees privately expressed discomfort at the sustained attack on Rogge, and Andrew Gilbert, formerly chair of [[Limmud International]] tweeted that "the memorial service for Munich 11 became an anti-IOC rally and heavy-handed humiliation of Rogge".'&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Shaviv, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/olympics/article/iocs_rogge_hears_sharp_criticism_at_london_memorial_for_munich_11_20120807/ "IOC’s Rogge hears sharp criticism at London memorial for Munich 11"], at ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', August 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to IOC response===
[[Jibril Rajoub]], the president of the [[Palestine Olympic Committee]], thanked Jacques Rogge in a letter for refusing to hold a minute of silence, saying that it promotes the "spread of racism" and that the Palestinian Olympic team was prepared to "confront the Israeli provocations," referring to a minute of silence. Rajoub added that "sport in Palestine is a means to achieve national goals" as well as "a tool of struggle to present the Palestinian cause," and that "sports are a bridge to love, interconnection, and spreading of peace among nations."&lt;ref name="PA applauds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/pa-official-thanks-olympic-president-for-rejecting-moment-of-silence/ |title=PA official applauds decision to forgo 'racist' moment of silence for Munich victims |work=The Times of Israel |date=July 26, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |author=Miller, Elhanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Al-Hayat al-Jadida]]'', the official daily newspaper of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] referred to the [[Munich massacre]] as "the Munich Operation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/topic/palestinian-nationalism/ The Olympics and the Peace Process]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PA rejects call"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/26/palestinian-authority-rejects-racist-call-for-olympic-silence/ |title=Palestinian Authority Rejects "Racist" Call for Olympic Silence |publisher=The Algemeiner |date=July 26, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] denounced the use of the term "racist" by Rajoub, and insisted that the murder of the Israeli Olympians due to their nationality was the racist act.&lt;ref name="EJP Ayalon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/60664 |title=Eleventh hour calls for Munich silence on the eve of Olympics opening ceremony as Palestinians applaud veto of 'racist' commemoration of Israeli victims |work=European Jewish Press |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPost Ayalon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=279048 |title=PA thanks IOC for refusing Munich victims memorial |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=July 26, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |author=Abu Toameh, Khaled}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ankie Spitzer and Ilana Romano urged members of the crowd to stand for a spontaneous minute of silence during the opening ceremony. Spitzer claimed that Rogge was using a Munich ceremony organised by the Israelis and the London Jewish community on August 6 as an excuse not to hold the moment of silence. Spitzer said, "Jacques Rogge is using it as a hideaway. If the Israeli embassy and London Jewish community were not organizing it, he would not have any memorial to go to."&lt;ref name="Munich widows asks crowd" /&gt;

When the Israeli delegation entered the Olympic Stadium, [[NBC]] sportscaster [[Bob Costas]] noted that the International Olympic Committee denied the requests for a minute of silence, saying in an interview that "many people find that denial more than puzzling but insensitive."  During the opening ceremony, Costas referred to the spontaneous minute of silence the week before as insufficient, saying, "Still, for many, tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to remember those who were lost and how and why they died."&lt;ref name="JTA Costas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/07/19/3101206/nbc-s-bob-costas-advocates-london-olympics-moment-of-silence |title=NBC's Bob Costas advocates London Olympics moment of silence |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=July 21, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Costas WashPo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/costas-remembers-israeli-athletes-killed-at-1972-munich-olympics-stops-short-of-own-protest/2012/07/27/gJQAG4k2EX_story.html |title=Costas remembers Israeli athletes killed at 1972 Munich Olympics, stops short of own protest |work=The Washington Post |agency=The Associated Press |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Costas Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/nbc-sportscaster-to-mark-munich-massacre-at-london-olympics/ |title=NBC sportscaster to mark Munich 11 |work=The Times of Israel |date=July 19, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |author=Winer, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman [[Eliot Engel]] condemned the IOC's refusal, saying, "Shame on you!" [[Joseph Potasnik]], vice president of the New York board of rabbis, said, "37,360: these are the number of minutes in the entire Olympics and they didn't find one."&lt;ref name="Engel Joseph"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h5W32g7DZaRAvSn_WJkNgMalW85A?docId=CNG.197e423b24bfc361d26ae350f64f3c9e.231 |title=New York Jews lambast IOC over silence |agency=AFP |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |author=Smith, Sebastian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823043041/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h5W32g7DZaRAvSn_WJkNgMalW85A?docId=CNG.197e423b24bfc361d26ae350f64f3c9e.231&amp;hl=en |archivedate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Berger, whose brother David Mark Berger was killed in the Munich massacre, felt dismayed and offended at the rejection, explaining that "A moment of silence may not seem like much. But to us, to the families who lost so much, that silent respect will speak volumes."  Such a moment:

{{quote|would not just be a memorial for Israel; it would be a memorial for all Olympians. Our children and brothers, the Munich 11, were not only children of Israel, but children of the Olympics. They embodied the Olympic spirit of teamwork and community, of honest competition and our common humanity. They were integral embers in the flame of the Olympic torch. They were killed only because of who they were: Jews, Israelis, champions of the Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/remember-my-brother-and-the-other-murdered-israeli-olympians.premium-1.455256 |title=Remember my brother and the other murdered Israeli Olympians |work=Ha'aretz |date=August 1, 2012 |accessdate=August 1, 2012 |author=Berger, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Aly Raisman]], a Jewish-American gymnast who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics, expressed her support for a minute of silence at the Olympics, saying that, "The fact it was on the 40th anniversary is special, and winning the gold today means a lot to me. If there had been a moment's silence, I would have supported it and respected it."&lt;ref name="Aly Raisman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/olympics/article/aly_raisman_says_she_was_for_munich_11_moment_of_silence_20120808/ |title=Aly Raisman says she was for Munich 11 moment of silence |publisher=Jewish Journal |work=JTA |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raisman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=280576 |title=US gymnast: 'Special' to win on Munich anniversary |work=The Jerusalem Post |agency=JTA |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, [[Irwin Cotler]], a former Canadian justice minister and attorney-general and a then-member of Parliament, wrote a last-minute plea to Rogge to hold a minute of silence at the closing ceremony of the Olympics. Cotler wrote:

{{quote|The refusal of the IOC to observe a moment of silence on the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre – the slaughter of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches for no other reason than that they were Israelis and Jews – is as offensive as it is incomprehensible.

It is not hard to infer that not only were the athletes killed because they were Israeli and Jewish, but that the moment of silence is being denied them also because they are Israeli and Jewish.

These 11 Israeli Olympians were part of the Olympic family, they were murdered as members of the Olympic family, they should be remembered by the Olympic family at these Olympic Games themselves.}}

Cotler said that the IOC's "steadfast reluctance" to hold a minute of silence ignores and mocks "the calls for a moment of silence by Government leaders... and the sustained international public campaign and anguished civil society appeals."  Cotler also mentioned that such a memorial would not be unprecedented, mentioning the minute of silence observed in memory of the Georgian athlete [[Nodar Kumaritashvili]] in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]; the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]' memorialization of the victims of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]]; and the 2012 Summer Olympics' memorialization of the victims of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], which happened the day after London was awarded the games. Cotler noted that neither of the last two terrorist attacks he mentioned were connected to the Olympics.&lt;ref name="Cotler"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/former-canadian-justice-minister-implores-ioc-to-remember-munich-11-at-closing-ceremony/ |title=Former Canadian justice minister implores IOC to remember Munich 11 at closing ceremony |work=The Times of Israel |date=August 9, 2012 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-IOC commemorations==
On July 25, 2012, the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Italian Chamber of Deputies]] held a minute of silence to mark the 40th anniversary of the [[Munich massacre]] and in honour of the victims of the massacre.&lt;ref name="Italy parliament minute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/italian-parliament-holds-a-minute-of-silence-for-munich-victims/ | title=Italian parliament holds a minute of silence for Munich victims | work=The Times of Israel | date=July 26, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, members of the Italian Olympic delegation also held a moment of silence. Those in attendance consisted of approximately 30 individuals, as well as the Italian Tourism and Sports Minister [[Piero Gnudi]], the head of the Italian Olympic Committee [[Gianni Petrucci]], the Chairman of the Israeli Olympic Committee Zvi Varshaviak, and the head of the Israeli delegation Efraim Zinger.&lt;ref name="Italian team holds minute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/italians-hold-moment-of-silence-for-israeli-athletes-murdered-in-munich/ | title=Italians hold moment of silence for Israeli athletes murdered in Munich | work=The Times of Israel | date=July 29, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Schmulovich, Michal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2012, over 20,000 people throughout London attended a "Minute for Munich" program organised by the British Zionist Federation.&lt;ref name="20,000 JTA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/07/27/3101886/more-than-20000-londoners-hold-munich-moment-of-silence | title=More than 20,000 Londoners hold Munich moment of silence | publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency | date=July 27, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="20,000 Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/more-than-20000-hold-moment-of-silence-in-london-for-munich-11/ | title=Over 20,000 hold moment of silence in London for Munich 11 | work=The Times of Israel | agency=JTA, AP | date=July 27, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, a memorial was held in Trafalgar Square that was attended by approximately 400 people to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Munich massacre. The event, organised by the British Israel Coalition, was "a response to the International Olympic Committee's sustained refusal to include a minute of silence in the opening ceremony due to be held tonight."&lt;ref name="Trafalgar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/27/trafalgar-square-holds-memorial-to-72-israeli-athletes-ahead-of-opening-ceremonies/ | title=Memorial for 1972 Israeli Athletes Held at Trafalgar Square Ahead of Opening Ceremonies | work=The Algemeiner | date=July 27, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] agreed to attend a commemoration at [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] to mark the 40th anniversary of the [[Munich massacre]] and in honour of the victims of the massacre. Prime Minister Cameron said, "It's right that in 2012 – 40 years on from the Munich Olympics – we remember the Israeli team members who were killed there."&lt;ref name="Cameron Guildhall"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/70508/cameron-will-attend-guildhall-munich-commemoration | title=Cameron will attend Guildhall Munich commemoration | work=The Jewish Chronicle | date=July 26, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Lipman, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israelis marked the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre in London, during which prayers were read for the 11 murdered Israelis, wreaths were laid, and a plaque was unveiled approximately four miles from the Olympic Stadium. London Mayor Boris Johnson attended the event, and recalled watching the massacre in 1972 unfold when he was 8 years old. Johnson said, "What sticks in my mind is that sense of sacrilege and a feeling of horror that the world's greatest sporting event should suffer such an attack, and that an attack should be mounted against people who had been training for what should have been the greatest event in their lives. And I think the world watched with a sense of numb disbelief as those events unfolded because sport should transcend politics."&lt;ref name="Israelis mark massacre"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israelis-mark-munich-massacre-at-small-london-ceremony-ahead-of-games/ | title=Israelis mark Munich massacre at small London ceremony ahead of Games | work=The Times of Israel | date=July 22, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | author=Harris, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Israeli TV commentators held an informal 30-second silence during the Olympics opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="Italian team holds minute" /&gt;

On July 31, a minute of silence was held aboard an [[EasyJet]] flight from London to Israel as their airplane flew over [[Munich]], Germany. The captain of the flight agreed to a request from the passengers to hold a minute of silence, and asked passengers to do so.&lt;ref name="EasyJet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/31/easy-jet-passengers-hold-minute-of-silence-for-72-israelis-while-fying-above-munich/ | title=Easy Jet Passengers Hold Minute of Silence for 72′ Israelis While Fying Above Munich | work=The Algemeiner | date=July 31, 2012 | accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial ceremony was held on August 6, organised by the National Olympic Committee of Israel, the [[Embassy of Israel, London|embassy of Israel in London]], and the Jewish Committee for the London Games. IOC president Jacques Rogge, British Prime Minister David Cameron, London mayor Boris Johnson, [[Culture and Sport Ministry|Israeli Sports and Culture Minister]] [[Limor Livnat]] and other representatives attended the ceremony. A message of support was read from Charles, the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref name="August 6"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/rogge-to-attend-memorial-for-israeli-athletes-in-london/ | title=IOC head Rogge to speak at memorial event for Munich athletes | work=The Times of Israel | date=August 1, 2012 | accessdate=August 7, 2012 | author=Shaviv, Miram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Cameron said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is right that we should stop and remember the 11 Israeli athletes who so tragically lost their lives when those values came under attack in Munich 40 years ago.  It was a truly shocking act of evil. A crime against the Jewish people. A crime against humanity. A crime the world must never forget.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cameron also recalled the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], and that Britain too had suffered from terrorism. Livnat said that "not observing a silence grants a moral victory to the evil."  Ankie Spitzer said "Is the IOC only interested in power and money and politics? Did they forget that they are supposed to promote peace, brotherhood and fair play?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19160735 |title=BBC News – Israeli widow of 1972 Munich Olympics massacre slams IOC |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer and Ilana Romana, who had previously requested that Rogge be banned from the ceremony, said that the IOC had discriminated against the dead athletes because they were Israelis and Jews.

US gymnast and gold medal winner at the 2012 London Olympics, [[Aly Raisman]], who won her gold on the floor exercise to the music of Hava Nagila, while the music was not chosen specifically with the Munich 11 in mind, she said she would have supported and respected a moment of silence in tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2185361/Olympics-2012-U-S-gymnast-Aly-Raisman-reveals-gold-medal-winning-routine-tribute-1972-Munch-Games-massacre.html | title=U.S. gymnast Aly Raisman reveals the score for her gold medal-winning routine at the Olympics was a tribute to victims of the 1972 Munich Games massacre | work=The Daily Mail | date=August 8, 2012 | accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qualification''' for the '''2013 [[United States Women's Curling Championship]]''' consists of three different paths. Four teams qualified directly through the High Performance Program or the Order of Merit system. The number of the remaining entrants to the national championships will be cut down to six teams through a challenge round held in mid-January.

==Qualification system==
Teams will qualify to participate in the women's national championship through the High Performance Program, through the [[World Curling Tour]] Order of Merit, or through a challenge round.

===Automatic qualification===
Two spots in the nationals were awarded to two teams on the [[United States Curling Association]]'s High Performance National Program, established as an invitation-based program for the development of the top curling teams in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curlingrocks.net/sites/default/files/press_pdf/national_program_teams2.pdf|title=Eight teams invited to High Performance National Program|date=7 July 2011|publisher=[[United States Curling Association]]|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams qualified through the High Performance Program were those skipped by [[Laura Roessler]], who is filling in for normal skip [[Cassandra Potter]], and [[Allison Pottinger]]. Two more spots were awarded to the top two women's teams on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit standings table following the conclusion of the [[Iron Trail Motors Shoot-Out]]. If one or both of the top teams already qualified for the nationals through the High Performance Program, the spot or spots would have been awarded to the team with the next highest position on the Order of Merit.&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks//images//rules_102412.pdf|title=2012–2013 USCA Rules of Curling and Competition|publisher=[[United States Curling Association]]|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams qualified through the Order of Merit were those skipped by [[Erika Brown]] and [[Patti Lank]].

===Challenge Round===

The strength of field ranking will be based on players' participation and performance in national championships and world championships. The seedings will influence the draw of the triple knockout event.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt;

==Challenge Round==
The challenge round for the women's nationals will be held from January 17 to 21 at the [[Granite Curling Club (Seattle)|Granite Curling Club]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks//images//122812_playdowns.pdf|title=2012 – 2013 USCA Championships Schedule|date=28 December 2012|publisher=[[United States Curling Association]]|accessdate=29 December 2012|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six teams will advance from the challenge round to the nationals.

The '''24 Hour Road Race to End Child Hunger''' was a mini date [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Hunter Hayes]]. The tour was notable because it broke the world record for the most amount of live shows played in multiple cities in the span of 24 hours, with ten shows being played. According to the [[Guinness World Records]], each city played had to be 31 miles apart. Half of the cities had to have a population of over 100,000 and all cities had to have a population of over 15,000. Also, Hayes was required to perform for fifteen continuous minutes at each show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janela|first1=Mike|title=Hitting the road with Hunter Hayes|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/5/hitting-the-road-with-hunter-hayes-57176/|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was in support of Hunters album [[Storyline (album)|Storyline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Maura|title=24 Hours With Hunter Hayes: Country Upstart Breaks Live-Show Record|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/24-hours-with-hunter-hayes-country-upstart-breaks-live-show-record-20140512|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=Korina|title=Hunter Hayes to attempt to break Guinness record|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/03/12/hunter-hayes-announces-24-hour-road-race-to-end-child-hunger/6325015/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''482 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Vibulanus and Iullus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 272 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 482 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''ARTSaha!''' was Omaha's new music festival. Held in the late summer, it was an annual showcase of contemporary music and art that stresses interdisciplinary and collaborative projects. ''ARTSaha!'' is produced by ANALOG ''arts ensemble'', a non-profit global collective of artists.

==History==

''ARTSaha!'' was established as a volunteer festival in 2004 by ANALOG. The first year featured a series of chamber music concerts with eclectic programs ranging from the Baroque to rock music. Highlights included a brass quintet version of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[The Rite of Spring]], a rare [[Morton Feldman]] film score, and a concert of guerrilla electronic music.

''ARTSaha! 2005'' featured a production of [[Bach's]] ''[[Musical Offering]]'' where four ensembles performed the work simultaneously and the audience was able to create their own arrangement by moving between rooms. There were also outdoor performances of [[Alvin Lucier]]'s ''Chambers'' in Omaha's Old Market, and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen|From the Seven Days]]'' on the Gene Leahy Mall. The festival also featured the meta-opera ''Notes from the Next Dark Age''

''ARTSaha! 2006'' highlighted the [[Samuel Beckett]] centenary with a program of several short plays, including ''Quad'', ''[[Nacht und Träume (play)|Nacht und Träume]]'', ''Breath'', ''Come &amp; Go'', ''Not I'', ''Rockaby'' and ''Act Without Words II''. This was the first year of production funding for some events at the festival, such as the reworking of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Les fêtes d'Hébé|The Festivities of Hebe]]''. Other events continued to be produced on a fringe basis such as a concert of electronic music in the Mallory Kountze Planetarium. 2006 also saw the establishment of a production partnership between ANALOG and the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]].

''ARTSaha! 2007'' focused on [[Futurism]] with only the fourth US performance of George Antheil's original soundtrack for ''Ballet Mécanique''. The festival also featured a 24-hour performance of [[John Cage]]'s ''[[ASLSP]]'', and the first [[Iron Composer]] Competition, where five student composers had five hours to complete a score for woodwind quintet based on a secret ingredient. The secret ingredient was the main motif to the theme song for the TV show ''[[The Jetsons]]''.

''ARTSaha! 2008'' celebrated the 80th anniversary of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s birth. ANALOG gave the US premieres of ''Friday Greeting'' and ''Cosmic Pulses'', the latter of which is the last piece of electronic music Stockhausen ever composed. The Iron Composer competition was won by Hermes Camacho, a composer from California and living in Texas. The instrumentation was piano trio and the secret ingredient was Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''. Guest artists included Stuart Gerber (Stockhausen's last percussionist), Monument Piano Trio, dung, and the Microscore Project. The festival program also included several selections from George Brecht's [[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]].

ANALOG announced a hiatus for the festival in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;!--By now, this sounds like a termination rather than a pause.--&gt;

The '''BBC gender pay gap controversy''' refers to a series of incidents in 2017 and 2018.

==Initial revelations==
In July 2017, in response to a demand from the UK government as a condition of its new [[BBC Charter|royal charter]], the BBC published a list of all employees who earned more than £150,000.&lt;ref name="Ruddick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCPay"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40661179 BBC pay: Male stars earn more than female talent], BBC News (19 July 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|The list included only compensation paid directly from BBC's [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|license fees]]; payments from [[BBC Worldwide]] and payments made through independent production firms were not included.&lt;ref name="Ruddick"&gt;Graham Ruddick, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/19/bbc-pay-key-questions-behind-the-disclosure BBC pay: key questions behind the disclosures], ''The Guardian'' (19 July 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCPay"/&gt;}} Of the 96 BBC employees making over this threshold, 62 were men and 34 were women, and of the seven highest earners, all were men.&lt;ref name="Ruddick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santos"&gt;Amanda Proença Santos, [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/bbc-s-list-top-paid-stars-sparks-controversy-over-pay-n784511 BBC's List of Top-Paid Stars Sparks Controversy Over Pay Gap, Lack of Diversity], NBC News (19 July 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The disclosure prompted criticism of the BBC over the [[gender pay gap]]; other critics also criticised a lack of ethnic diversity among the highest-earning BBC personalities.&lt;ref name="BBCPay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Clarke, [https://variety.com/2017/tv/global/bbc-reveals-stars-salaries-controversy-pay-gender-women-1202499715/ BBC Reveals Stars' Salaries Amid Controversy Over Pay for Women], ''Variety''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, however, argued that the mandatory disclosures were an effort by [[Theresa May]]'s government to undermine the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Barnett,

==Carrie Gracie resigns as China editor==
Early in January 2018, it was announced that [[Carrie Gracie]], the BBC's China editor, had resigned from the role because of the salary gender disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42598775|title=BBC China editor Carrie Gracie quits post in equal pay row|work=BBC News|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pre-broadcast conversation between ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' presenter [[John Humphrys]] and [[Jon Sopel]], the BBC's North America editor, was leaked a few days later. Humphrys was recorded joking about the disparity. BBC management itself was said to be "deeply unimpressed" with Humphrys comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Batchelor|first=Tom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/john-humphrys-bbc-pay-gap-carrie-gracie-radio-4-today-jon-sopel-leaked-recording-gender-equality-a8154771.html|title=John Humphrys joked about gender pay gap after BBC China editor Carrie Gracie resigned, leaked tape reveals|work=The Independent|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the BBC's impartiality rules, ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' presenter [[Jane Garvey (broadcaster)|Jane Garvey]], a prominent advocate of equal pay at the BBC, was unable to conduct an interview with Gracie on the programme, while ''[[You and Yours]]'' presenter [[Winifred Robinson]] was briefly taken off-air for tweeting her support for Gracie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42623068|title=Radio 4 host Winifred Robinson taken off air after tweet backing Carrie Gracie|work=BBC News|date=9 January 2018|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a fortnight later, it was reported Conservative Culture minister [[Tracey Crouch]], and other female MPs, have refused to be interviewed by Humphrys in response to his comments about Gracie's resignation.&lt;ref name="Asthana"&gt;{{cite news|last=Asthana|first=Anushka|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/tracey-crouch-john-humphrys-bbc-today-carrie-gracie|title=Tory minister declines John Humphrys interview overpay comments|work=The Guardian|date=25 January 2018|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although reported by [[Anushka Asthana]], co-political editor of ''The Guardian'', and other media sources, Crouch has not commented about the issue.&lt;ref name="Asthana"/&gt;

==Male presenters pay cut==
It became known on 26 January 2018 that some of the BBC's leading male presenters would take a pay cut. According to the BBC's media editor [[Amol Rajan]], [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]], John Humphrys, [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]], Jon Sopel and [[Jeremy Vine]], have agreed to a salary reduction. [[Nicky Campbell]], radio 5 live presenter, also told his listeners that he would be taking a pay cut.

In the [[Netherlands]], the '''Boekenweek''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈbukə(n)ʋeːk|-|Nl-Boekenweek.ogg}}; English: Book Week) is an annual "week" of ten days dedicated to [[Dutch literature]].&lt;ref name="Minnaard2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Minnaard|first=Liesbeth|title=New Germans, New Dutch: Literary Interventions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raQRx0LonncC&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=12 May 2012|year=2009|publisher=Amsterdam UP|isbn=9789089640284|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been held in March annually since 1932. Each Boekenweek has a theme. The beginning of the Boekenweek is marked by the ''Boekenbal'' (''book ball''), a gathering that is attended by writers and publishers. Events are held across the country during the Boekenweek, such as [[book signing]] sessions, [[literary festival]]s and [[debate]]s.

== Publications ==
[[File:Hella Haasse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hella Haasse]], the only author who has written the ''Boekenweekgeschenk'' thrice, [[List of publications during the Boekenweek|in 1948, 1959 and 1994]].]]
Each year a well-known writer, usually Dutch or [[Flemish]], is asked to write a book, usually a novella, called the ''Boekenweekgeschenk'' (''book week gift''), which is to be given away during the festival. [[Bookselling|Book shops]] give a copy of the Boekenweekgeschenk when a customer buys a book in the [[Dutch language]]; libraries also give copies of these books when a new person becomes a member. The Boekenweekgeschenk is published by the [[Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek]] (''CPNB'', ''Collective Promotion for the Dutch Book''). Some authors invited to write for this event have included [[Maarten 't Hart]] (1984), [[Hugo Claus]] (1989), [[Cees Nooteboom]], and [[Harry Mulisch]] (2000).&lt;ref name="books"&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.cpnb.nl/bw/bw_uitgaven.html Boekenweekuitgaven en thema's vanaf 1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327200523/http://www.cpnb.nl/bw/bw_uitgaven.html |date=27 March 2010 }}, Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Boekenweekgeschenk was originally written in English by [[Salman Rushdie]] and later translated into Dutch.

In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the Boekenweekgeschenk was sometimes published anonymously, with a list of possible authors inside the book.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{nl}} [http://historiek.net/Overig/Geschiedenis-van-de-Boekenweek.html Geschiedenis van de Boekenweek], Historiek, 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As a competition, readers could submit their guess by postcard as to who the author was.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Since 2002, the Boekenweekgeschenk can be used as a ticket to travel for free by train with the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] on Sunday in the Boekenweek.

Since 1987, an essay, the ''Boekenweekessay,'' has been written in addition to the Boekenweekgeschenk. The Boekenweekessay can be purchased in book shops. Some authors include [[Jan Wolkers]] (1995), [[Gerrit Komrij]] (1997) and [[Adriaan van Dis]] (2004).&lt;ref name="books" /&gt;

The [[curriculum vitae]] of the author of the Boekenweekgeschenk – called the ''Boekenweek-cv'' – is distributed by [[Public library|public libraries]] among their members.

== History ==
On 15 November 1930, the ''Dag van het Boek'' (''Day of the Book'') was held to protect books from new media, such as radio and cinema.&lt;ref name="press2005"&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.cpnb.nl/persberichten/2005/cpnb_14-11.html Onderzoek Het boek in Nederland 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615031649/http://www.cpnb.nl/persberichten/2005/cpnb_14-11.html |date=15 June 2011 }}, Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek, 14 November 2005, press release&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''De uitgever en zijn bedrijf'' by Johan Tersteeg was published to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the [[Nederlandsche Uitgeversbond]].&lt;ref name="books" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Publishers, booksellers and others interested in supporting books organized a longer event to promote Dutch literature.

In 1932, the first Boekenweek was held and the first Boekenweekgeschenk was published.&lt;ref name="books" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; During [[World War II]], the Boekenweek was not held in the years 1942 till 1945.&lt;ref name="books" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In 1941, a Boekenweekgeschenk was published but it was withdrawn from the stores due to [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|German occupation of the country]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Despite competition from other media, including new technology since 1932, the Boekenweekgeschenk has grown in popularity over the years.&lt;ref name="books" /&gt; In 2010, during the 75th Boekenweek, 958.000 copies of the Boekenweekgeschenk were produced.&lt;ref name="books" /&gt;

== Boekenbal ==
[[File:Boekenbal1985.jpg|thumb|Boekenbal in [[Carré Theatre|Carré]] in 1985]]

The Boekenbal (''book ball'') is an invitation-only event, with the Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek (CPNB) deciding the guest list. It is traditionally held in the [[Stadsschouwburg (Amsterdam)|Stadsschouwburg]] in Amsterdam. The invitation policy of CPNB has sparked some controversy, and another group has organized the independent event called the ''Bal der Geweigerden'' (''ball of the refused'').&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article923456.ece/Bal_der_geweigerden_voor_alle_schrijvers Bal der geweigerden voor álle schrijvers], [[de Volkskrant]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first held in 2002 in [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], which is nearby the location of the official Boekenbal, and it can be attended by anyone.

== Kinderboekenweek ==
Since 1955, a book week for children has been held, called the ''Kinderboekenweek''. It is held in October and it also lasts ten days. It opens with a social gathering, called the ''Kinderboekenbal''. Similar to the Boekenweek, a ''Kinderboekenweekgeschenk'' is written and published to be given away by book shops to clients purchasing [[Children's literature|literature for children]]. Some of the authors include [[Paul Biegel]] (1977), [[Annie M.G. Schmidt]] (1990) and [[Thea Beckman]] (1991).&lt;ref name="books" /&gt; Since 1986, a [[picture book]] is published for [[toddler]]s.

'''Cemetery for North Korean and Chinese Soldiers''' ({{Korean|hangul=북한군/중국군 묘지 제 1 묘역|rr=buk-han-gun/jung-guk-gun myo-ji je 1 myo-yeok}}; also known as the ''Enemy Cemetery'') located in Jajang-Ro, Papyeong-myeon (파평면), [[Paju]], [[South Korea]], is a burial ground for [[North Korea|North Korean]] casualties of the [[Korean War]] and North Korean agents killed in South Korea since the end of the war. The cemetery formerly contained the remains of 437 Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] soldiers but these were all [[Repatriation|repatriated]] in March 2014.

==History==
The cemetery was established in July 1996 as a centralized burial place for the remains of [[Korean People's Army]] and People's Volunteer Army soldiers recovered from battlefield exhumations across South Korea and for North Korean agents killed in South Korea since the end of the Korean War.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/11/us-korea-cemetery-idUSSEO739320080911|title=South Korean cemetery keeps Cold War alive|publisher=Reuters|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea has refused to accept the repatriation of the remains of its personnel on the basis that North Korea claims sovereignty over all of Korea and the soldiers accordingly are already buried on Korean soil. Also, the acceptance of the bodies of agents would amount to acknowledgment of espionage operations denied by North Korea. 

The graves are in the form of traditional Korean burial mounds with plain wooden markers facing north towards North Korea (approximately 5 kilometers away). The majority of the graves are marked 무명 (Pronunciation: mumyeong= Korean word: meaning = anonymous), while those of North Korean agents are marked with 간첩 (Pronunciation: gancheop = Korean word:  meaning=  spy) followed by the name if known. The cemetery receives few visitors because the South Korean intelligence services monitored the site to detect North Korean sympathizers, though the services say they no longer monitor the site.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;

South Korea had previously returned the remains of Chinese soldiers to North Korea through the [[Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission]] which then repatriated them to China. From 1981 to 1989, 42 sets of remains were returned in this manner, however in 1997, North Korea refused to accept any further Chinese remains.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/world/asia/south-korea-returns-bodies-of-hundreds-of-chinese-soldiers.html?_r=0|title=After Six Decades, Chinese Soldiers Killed in South Korea Head Home|publisher=The New York Times|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a visit by South Korean President [[Park Geun-hye]] to Beijing in June 2013, it was agreed that the remains of the Chinese soldiers would be repatriated directly to China. The exhumation of the remains started in December 2013 and on 17 March 2014, the repatriation of the remains of the 437 Chinese soldiers took place. 55 of the sets of remains were identified while the rest were unknowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2582923/Last-casualties-Korean-war-Burial-400-Chinese-soldiers-peninsula-massive-ill-equipped-Red-Army.html|title=Last casualties of the Korean war: Burial for the 400 Chinese soldiers found in peninsula who were part of massive and ill-equipped Red Army|publisher=Daily Mail|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains are to be interred in the Resist America and Aid Korea Martyrs Cemetery in [[Shenyang]], China.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Renovation plans for the cemetery were considered in 2012, but they met with opposition in South Korea and were not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/26/south-korea-enemy-cemetery_n_1705088.html |title=South Korea Badly Neglects 'Enemy Cemetery' |publisher=Huffington Post |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023040226/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/26/south-korea-enemy-cemetery_n_1705088.html |archivedate=October 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===1994 State House campaign===
[[File:Corey Lewandowski (28815701733).jpg|thumb|right|Lewandowski during his 1994 campaign]]
In 1994, while an undergraduate student, Lewandowski ran for a seat in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] as a [[write-in candidate]] in the Republican primary. He received 143 votes, falling short of the 150 votes needed to win the party's nomination for the ballot. In the November general election, the seat was won by [[Thomas A.

===Early work===
After graduating from college, Lewandowski worked as an aide for Republican [[Massachusetts's 6th congressional district|Massachusetts Congressman]] [[Peter G. Torkildsen]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EB54920B99184CA&amp;p_docnum=2&amp;p_queryname=5 Out With Old, In With New]". ''Associated Press''. Tulsa World. November 23, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; from January 1996 to January 1997, while a graduate student at [[American University]].&lt;ref name="BSchCMar"/&gt; Also while a student in 1997, Lewandowski interned for Massachusetts State Senator [[Steven C. Panagiotakos]], a Democrat.&lt;ref name="StumpforTrump" /&gt;

From December 1997 to February 2001, Lewandowski worked  as an administrative assistant for Ohio Republican [[Bob Ney]], a U.S. Congressman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2007, before Ney was [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] on federal corruption charges arising from the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal|Abramoff lobbying scandal]], Lewandowski wrote a letter to the presiding judge, saying that Ney was a mentor and "surrogate father" to him and asking for leniency in sentencing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Will |last=Rahn |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/03/donald-trump-s-campaign-chief-backed-a-crooked-congressman-called-him-my-surrogate-father.html |title=Donald Trump's Campaign Chief Backed a Crooked Congressman, Called Him 'My Surrogate Father' |work=The Daily Beast |date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Rogers |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/22/467499682/meet-donald-trumps-alter-ego |title=Meet Donald Trump's Alter Ego |publisher=All Things Considered |agency=NPR |date=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, while working for Ney, Lewandowski brought a loaded handgun in a laundry bag into the [[Longworth House Office Building]].&lt;ref name=Tumulty&gt;{{cite news |last=Tumulty |first=Karen |authorlink=Karen Tumulty |date=March 30, 2016 |title=Who is Corey Lewandowski?

After leaving Ney's office, Lewandowski worked most of 2001 for the [[Republican National Committee]] as the Northeast legislative political director.&lt;ref name="BSchCMar"/&gt;

===Smith campaign===
Lewandowski was the [[campaign manager]] for the [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2002|2002 re-election campaign]] of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Robert C. Smith]] of New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;DiStaso, John. "[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0F544F68E88BEC97&amp;p_docnum=6&amp;p_queryname=5 Will Stickney back Sununu? Not in the cards]". ''New Hampshire Union Leader''. November 29, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was challenged in the Republican primary by [[John E. Sununu]].&lt;ref name= Babington/&gt;

Speaking about Sununu, Lewandowski said, "The people of New Hampshire want someone in the U.S. Senate with clear, concise views on terrorism. They'll judge a congressman based on the people he associates with, his voting record and his campaign contributions."&lt;ref name= Babington&gt;Babington, Charles. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/12/23/smith-takes-swipe-at-sununu-white-house-swipes-back/55cd43f2-c6a0-4cc0-b3ff-fe721ffd95d6/ Smith Takes Swipe at Sununu, White House Swipes Back]". ''The Washington Post'' (December 23, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Lewandowski told a reporter he would be interested to know whether anyone associated with [[Hamas]] had attended a fundraising event for Sununu.&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, Tom. "[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0F544F6B5279E742&amp;p_docnum=8&amp;p_queryname=2 White House gets involved in Smith-Sununu election discord]". ''The New Hampshire Union Leader''. December 15, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (Lewandowski cited contributions made by Washington lawyer George Salem to Sununu; Salem, who chaired Arab Americans for Bush-Cheney during the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|2000 Bush/Cheney campaign]], was the attorney for the [[Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development]], which had its assets frozen by the U.S. government in 2001 on suspicion of ties to Hamas.)&lt;ref name= Babington/&gt; Lewandowski's comments were interpreted as publicly suggesting that Sununu, who is of [[Lebanese American|Lebanese descent]], had divided loyalties in fighting terrorism.&lt;ref name=Tumulty/&gt;

Former [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire Governor]] [[Steve Merrill]] said, "The politics of ethnic slurs and bigotry have no place in any campaign."&lt;ref name= Babington/&gt; Former [[List of United States Senators from New Hampshire|New Hampshire Senator]] [[Warren Rudman]] said, "Bob Smith is a better human being than that, and he ought to tell his people to watch themselves."&lt;ref name= Babington/&gt; [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s spokesperson said, "The White House called Senator Smith's office ... Remarks that paint [[Arab Americans]] with a broad brush aren't helpful. We need to reassure Arab Americans that this war is about al-Qaida, not Islam. Mr. Salem is a good friend of the president's and an honorable man."&lt;ref name= Babington/&gt;

Smith's press secretary said Lewandowski was "merely responding to media inquiries" about Salem's fund raising and that "Senator Smith has repeatedly said this campaign is about records—Congressman Sununu's record and Senator Smith's record. Someone's ethnic background has absolutely nothing to do with this election."&lt;ref name= Babington/&gt;

Sununu defeated Smith in the Republican primary, winning 53% of the vote to Smith's 45%.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2002/senate.htm Federal Elections 2002 U.S. Senate Results]".

===Schwartz MSL, Americans for Prosperity, and other work===
From 2003 to 2004, Lewandowski was executive director of the New England Seafood Producers Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Can Corey Lewandowski save New England's seafood industry? |date=July 16, 2003 |url=http://www.intrafish.com/news/article1313282.ece |magazine=Intrafish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JasonDick"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Dick |url=http://www.sunherald.com/news/politics-government/article69028562.html |title=Who Is Corey Lewandowski?

From 2004 to 2012, Lewandowski worked for [[Schwartz Communications|Schwartz MSL]], a strategic communication and engagement firm where, according to his [[LinkedIn]] profile, he served as director of public affairs from September 2004 until July 2012. Lewandowski was registered as a lobbyist for Schwartz MSL on behalf of Passport Systems in 2011, lobbying on homeland security issues.&lt;ref name="JasonDick"/&gt; Schwartz represented Passport Systems for six years, and the firm paid Schwartz more than $350,000 over that period. Between 2008 and 2011, Passport Systems secured more than $23.9 million in federal funds. Lewandowski represented two other clients: health care software company Logical Images and solar-power company Borrego Solar.&lt;ref name="Choma"&gt;{{cite web |first=Russ |last=Choma |url=http://www.newsweek.com/corey-lewandowski-donald-trump-solar-power-442314 |title=Donald Trump Campaign Manager's Diametric Double Life as a Solar Power Lobbyist |work=Newsweek |date=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewandowski graduated from the New Hampshire police academy in 2006&lt;ref name=Tumulty/&gt; and worked from 2006 to 2010 as a [[Seasonal industry|seasonal]] marine patrol officer trainee&lt;ref name="Choma"/&gt; with the [[New Hampshire State Police]].&lt;ref name="PoliticoConcerns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/donald-trump-corey-lewandowski-220742 |title=Trump campaign manager's behavior prompted staff concerns |last2=Schreckinger |first2=Ben |date=March 15, 2016 |last3=Gold |first3=Hadas |last1=Vogel |first1=Kenneth |work=Politico |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stevenson |first1=Seth |title=A Week on the Trail With the "Disgusting Reporters" Covering Donald Trump |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/03/on_the_trail_with_donald_trump_s_disgusting_press_corps.html |website=Slate |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Lewandowski began working for [[Americans for Prosperity]], a [[Political activities of the Koch brothers|Koch brothers]]-backed advocacy group.&lt;ref name="JasonDick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Choma"/&gt; Lewandowski's period working for Americans for Prosperity overlapped with his tenure as a marine patrol officer trainee and registered federal lobbyist.&lt;ref name="Choma"/&gt; Lewandowski was Americans for Prosperity's New Hampshire director,&lt;ref name="Choma"/&gt;&lt;ref name= freer&gt;{{cite news |title=How to Live Freer in New Hampshire |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=February 25, 2011 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/853948353/CC39FFE005574B6APQ/6?accountid=46320}}&lt;/ref&gt; and East Coast regional director before becoming the national director of voter registration, a position he held until January 2015.&lt;ref name="SVDate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/donald-trump-is-buying-a-new-hampshire-campaign-wholesale-20150707|title=Donald Trump Is Buying a New Hampshire Campaign Wholesale|last=Dáte|first=S.

While working for Americans for Prosperity, Lewandowski criticized the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]], a [[cap-and-trade]] system for state utilities, saying "it does nothing to reduce greenhouse gases because jobs and businesses just move to other states."&lt;ref name= freer/&gt; At the same time, Lewandowski lobbied for Borrego Solar, helping to secure a $500,000 [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] in the 2010 Energy and Water Appropriations Act that benefited a solar electricity project in [[Lancaster, Massachusetts]], that Borrego was involved in. ''Newsweek'' noted, "though he had succeeded as a pro-solar lobbyist looking for government assistance, at AFP he waged a campaign against government programs that supported [[green energy]]."&lt;ref name="Choma"/&gt;

In 2012, while still working for Americans for Prosperity, Lewandowski unsuccessfully ran for town treasurer of [[Windham, New Hampshire]]. NPR reported that during the campaign, Lewandowski "upended the town's politics, using public records laws to probe local government and launching [[robocall]]s targeted at voters to stoke outrage over a visit to the town by President Obama."&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; Robert Skinner defeated Lewandowski, receiving 1,941 votes to Lewandowski's 714.&lt;ref name= 2012p&gt;"[http://www.eagletribune.com/community/windham-town-results/article_d25052c6-a08d-5b95-97ec-985ad3e50040.html Windham Town Results]".

==Trump 2016 presidential campaign==
Lewandowski first met Trump in April 2014 at a political event in New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="APhillips"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/23/meet-the-man-behind-donald-trumps-presidential-campaign/|title=Meet the man behind Donald Trump’s presidential campaign|last=Phillips|first=Amber|date=July 23, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tumulty/&gt; In January 2015, six months before Trump announced his campaign, Lewandowski was invited to [[Trump Tower]], where he accepted an offer from Trump to become campaign manager.&lt;ref name="StumpforTrump"/&gt; His salary was $20,000 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-spends-big-on-campaign-and-salaries-1437067020 |title=One Sign of Inflation: Salaries for Some Presidential Campaigns |last=Ballhaus |first=Rebecca |date=July 17, 2015 |last2=Haddon |first2=Heather |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |issn=0099-9660|access-date=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lewandowski was hired, Trump's political staff consisted of three people: his lawyer [[Michael D. Cohen (lawyer)|Michael D.

Lewandowski's motto as Trump's campaign manager was "Let Trump be Trump"; those words appeared on his office white board.&lt;ref name="wsjprofile"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-man-who-helps-trump-be-trump-1455153779 |title=Meet the Man Who Helps Trump Be Trump |date=February 10, 2016 |work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump said of Lewandowski, "He leaves me alone, but he knows when to make his presence felt."&lt;ref name="UnorthodoxManager"/&gt;

Two weeks later, [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] [[State Attorney]] [[Dave Aronberg]] said that his office would not prosecute Lewandowski; they believed that "there was [[probable cause]] to make an arrest" and "the facts support the allegation that Mr. Lewandowski did grab Ms. Fields' arm against her will," but "the evidence cannot prove all legally required [[Element (criminal law)|elements of the crime]] alleged and is insufficient to support a criminal prosecution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Curt |last=Anderson |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GOP_2016_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_MANAGER?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-04-14-13-46-32 |title=Prosecutor won't pursue battery charge against Trump aide |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 14, 2016 |archivedate=April 14, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gljGiEDo?url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GOP_2016_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_MANAGER?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-04-14-13-46-32 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Departure ===
In April 2016, Lewandowski's influence within the Trump campaign was reported to be waning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ben |last1=Schreckinger |first2=Kenneth P. |last2=Vogel |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/donald-trump-corey-lewandowski-shrinking-role-campaign-221487 |title=Trump campaign shrinks Lewandowski's role: Despite the billionaire's staunch defense, his embattled campaign manager is losing clout |work=Politico |date=April 2, 2016 |accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ben |last1=Jacobs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-battery-charges |title=Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski will not face battery charges |newspaper=The Guardian |date=April 14, 2016 |accessdate=April 14, 2016 |quote=While Trump has stood by Lewandowski through the controversy, the political operative's influence has been waning in recent weeks.

On June 20, 2016, Trump's campaign announced that it was parting ways with Lewandowski; according to reports, Lewandowski was fired, although [[Donald Trump Jr.]], Trump's son, described the split as "amicable."&lt;ref name="NYTSplits"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Maggie |last1=Haberman |authorlink=Maggie Haberman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-donald-trump.html |title=Donald Trump Fires Corey Lewandowski, His Campaign Manager |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 20, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxSplits"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/20/trump-splits-with-campaign-manager-lewandowski.html |title=Trump splits with campaign manager Lewandowski |publisher=Fox News |date=June 20, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move occurred after Lewandowski clashed with Trump chief strategist and campaign chairman [[Paul Manafort]] in an internal "power struggle."&lt;ref name="NYTSplits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxSplits"/&gt; After Lewandowski's departure, Manafort (who had been brought on the campaign in March 2016) became the ''[[de facto]]'' campaign manager.&lt;ref name="FoxSplits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Jonathan |last1=Martin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/us/politics/john-kasich-rnc.html |title=Trump Campaign Denounces John Kasich in Ohio, Where Convention Begins |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political commentator and lobbyist==

===CNN===
Days after Lewandowski left the Trump campaign, he was hired by the cable news network [[CNN]] as a political commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/23/media/corey-lewandowski-cnn/ |title=CNN hires Corey Lewandowski as political commentator |publisher=[[CNN]] |first=Brian |last=Stelter |date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |archivedate=June 24, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624113831/http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/23/media/corey-lewandowski-cnn/ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lewandowski remains subject to a [[non-disclosure agreement]] that he signed with Trump, forbidding him "from making disparaging or revealing remarks about the candidate."&lt;ref name="CorasanitiBirther"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Nick |last1=Corasaniti |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-obama-birther.html |title=Corey Lewandowski, Former Trump Campaign Manager, Dives Back Into 'Birtherism' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 3, 2016 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewandowski received [[severance pay]] from the Trump campaign while working for CNN. In July 2016, after the group [[Media Matters for America]] noted that CNN had not disclosed this to viewers, CNN hosts began making on-air disclosures of the severance payments before Lewandowski's appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=David |last1=Bauder |url=http://www.wthr.com/article/cnn-revealing-lewandowskis-severance-payments |title=CNN revealing Lewandowski's severance payments |agency=Associated Press |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Lewandowski defended Trump who had been criticized after [[Twitter|tweeting]] a graphic that labeled [[Hillary Clinton]] the "most corrupt candidate" alongside a pile of cash and a six-pointed star evoking the [[Star of David]]. (The image originated on an Internet message board featuring [[Antisemitic canard|antisemitic conspiracy theories]]). During an appearance on CNN's ''[[State of the Union (TV series)|State of the Union]]'' with [[Brianna Keilar]], Lewandowski denied allegations of [[antisemitism]] and said that criticism of the tweet was "[[political correctness]] run amok."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Jeremy |last1=Diamond |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/02/politics/donald-trump-tweet-graphic-star-hillary-clinton/ |title=Trump campaign defends tweet as a 'basic star' in wake of criticism |publisher=CNN |date=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robillard |first1=Kevin |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/corey-lewandowski-star-david-donald-trump-225072 |title=Lewandowski blames Star of David blowup on 'political correctness' |work=Politico |accessdate=July 4, 2016 |date=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2016 appearance on CNN, Lewandowski espoused the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|"birther" conspiracy theory]], suggesting that President [[Barack Obama]] was not a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born-citizen]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="CorasanitiBirther"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GassBirther"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Nick |last1=Gass |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/obama-birther-corey-lewandowski-226607 |title=CNN contributor Corey Lewandowski: Was Obama a citizen when he went to Harvard? |work=Politico |date=August 3, 2016 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewandowski's statement was criticized by the other panelists,  Angela Rye and [[Bakari Sellers]].&lt;ref name="CorasanitiBirther"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GassBirther"/&gt;

On November 11, 2016, Lewandowski resigned as a CNN commentator amid speculations that he would play a role in the [[Trump administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brian |last1=Stelter |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/11/media/corey-lewandowski-resigns-cnn/ |title=Corey Lewandowski resigns from CNN |work=CNNMoney |date=November 11, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OANN===
After leaving CNN, Lewandowski worked as a political commentator for the cable news television channel [[One America News Network]] (OANN).&lt;ref name="OANN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2017/01/corey-lewandowski-joins-conservative-news-network-as-commentator-233559|title=Corey Lewandowski joins conservative news channel OANN as commentator|last=Sutton|first=Kelsey|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2017|publisher=''[[Politico]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he mainly worked for OANN, he made sporadic appearances on [[Fox News]].

===Avenue Strategies===
On December 21, 2016, Lewandowski and &lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017"/&gt; Barry Bennett, a "former Trump senior adviser", whom Lewandowski had known for ten years,&lt;ref name="NYT_Inside_Trump_track"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/opinion/want-to-keep-the-president-at-bay-two-consultants-have-an-inside-track.html |title=Want to Keep the President at Bay? Two Consultants Have an Inside Track |first=Elizabeth |last=Williams |date=March 13, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-founded as equal partners a political consulting firm called Avenue Strategies.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Avenue_strategies"/&gt; They were joined by other Trump presidential campaign veterans.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Avenue_strategies"/&gt; Bennett, Mike Rubino, Jason Osborne, and most of Lewandowski's associates at Avenue Strategies filed lobbying registrations.&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017" /&gt;

Mainly because of Lewandowski, Avenue Strategies soon became one of "the highest-profile government-affairs outfits in Washington".&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Avenue_strategies"/&gt; Avenue Strategies' office "overlooks the White House", and Lewandowski has "relatively unimpeded access" to President Trump either by phone or in person at the White House.&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017" /&gt; Access to President Trump can be "highly lucrative" — "relatively few established K Street powerhouses have ties to the new president".&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Avenue_strategies"/&gt;

In February 2017, Avenue Strategies "quietly agreed" to lobby for [[Citgo|Citgo Petroleum Corporation]] (Citgo). In April they signed a $25,000 a month contract as tensions mounted between the United States, Venezuela, and Russia.&lt;ref name="POLITICO_citgo_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/03/corey-lewandowski-citgo-deal-237960 |work=Politico |date=May 3, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |first1=Kenneth P. |last1=Vogel |title=Lewandowski’s firm quietly inked deal with Venezuela-owned company: Contract to lobby for Citgo comes amid rising tensions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citgo is headquartered in Houston, Texas, but is owned by the government of Venezuela. Citgo took out a loan from Russian state-owned oil giant, [[Rosneft]] in December 2016 that it has been unable to pay. It is under threat of a takeover by Rosneft.&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017" /&gt;  By early May the legally required paperwork had not been filed revealing the contract to the U.S. Government through the Senate Office of Public Records.&lt;ref name="POLITICO_citgo_2017"/&gt;

The governor of debt-ridden Puerto Rico hired Avenue Strategies to lobby Congress for funding.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Avenue_strategies"/&gt; Avenue Strategies also "operates a fledgling super PAC to help Trump win re-election".&lt;ref name="NYT_Inside_Trump_track"/&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the firm's corporate clients —  [[Fortune 100]] companies — hire them as insurance against "tweet risk". Bennett said, "If he’s gonna come after you, there’s nothing we can do to stop it. But if you want to figure out how to win in this environment, we can help you. [For example], [c]all [[Jared Kushner]] and tell him you’re gonna build a new factory," or invite Mr. Trump to "fly somewhere, cut a ribbon, and high-five 200 employees... [That] "drives optimism, and it drives his power. There are few things a president can do to build power faster than to lead a great economic comeback." Lewandowski added, "We’re your sherpa through turbulent times."&lt;ref name="NYT_Inside_Trump_track"/&gt;  While at the firm, Lewandowski won a $160,000 account with Community Choice Financial, a large [[payday lender]].&lt;ref name=NYT2august17&gt;{{cite news |last1=Confessore |first1=Nicholas |authorlink1=Nicholas Confessore |last2=Vogel |first2=Kenneth P. |title=Trump Loyalist Mixes Businesses and Access at ‘Advisory’ Firm |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-trump.html |accessdate=August 3, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=August 2, 2017 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewandowski did not formally register as a lobbyist as he did not consider himself to be a lobbyist.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Avenue_strategies"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-04/lewandowski-breaks-with-partner-amid-reports-of-foreign-clients |title=Lewandowski Exits Lobby Firm Amid Reports of Foreign Clients |first1=Jennifer |last1=Jacobs |first2=Ben |last2=Brody |date=May 4, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was criticized by "competing lobbyists and ethics watchdogs" for "flouting the spirit of the lobbying rules, and abusing his access to the Trump White House".&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017"/&gt; On May 3, 2017,  [[Public Citizen]], a "government-ethics group, asked the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] to investigate whether Lewandowski should have registered as a foreign or domestic lobbyist".&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Avenue_strategies"/&gt;

On May 4, 2017, Lewandowski left Avenue Strategies.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Avenue_strategies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017" /&gt;

====Washington East West Political Strategies====
In an article published on April 28, 2017 ''POLITICO'' revealed that they had obtained documents about Washington East West Political Strategies  — an "affiliate of Avenue Strategies".&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017" /&gt; It was one of "several international recruitment vehicles" through which business partners globally — including those in the Middle East, Canada, and Central America — could "earn commissions by enlisting international clients" for Avenue Strategies. East West solicited "business in Eastern Europe and elsewhere by offering access to Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials".&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/28/corey-lewandowski-trump-meetings-237725 |work=Politico |date=April 28, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |first1=Kenneth P. |last1=Vogel |first2=Josh |last2=Dawsey |title=Lewandowski’s firm appears to offer Trump meetings: Ex-campaign manager says he’s not a lobbyist, but documents suggest his firm has been offering to secure face time with the president for foreign politicians.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ___?___ that described "numerous proposed activities that would seem to trigger [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA) registration".&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017"/&gt; East West was created by Lewandowski, Bennett, Rauf Mammadov, "an Azerbaijani oil executive and an American political consultant who works extensively in Russia", Marshall Comins, who "worked extensively in the former Soviet Union and Sub-Saharan Africa consulting governments, high net-worth individuals and politicians", Jeff Monson, a "prominent figure in Russia’s Communist Party", and Mike Nicholas Sango, "Zimbabwe's ambassador to Russia."&lt;ref name="POLITICO_2017"/&gt; On May 3 Avenue Strategies dissolved East West with Bennett and Lewandowski both claiming that their collaborators, Mammadov and Comins, had issued the East West document, not them. Bennett explained that "Avenue Strategies owned the equity — and that is me and Corey — but he didn’t have any role....[I]t is a "violation of our understanding with them." Lewandowski said he had "no affiliation or involvement" and "never entered into any agreement with [East West]."&lt;ref name="POLITICO_citgo_2017"/&gt;

===Lewandowski Strategic Advisors===
On May 12, 2017, eight days after leaving Avenue Strategies, Lewandowski incorporated Lewandowski Strategic Advisors in Delaware, which, as an advisory firm, does not register as a lobbyist or disclose its clients.&lt;ref name=NYT2august17/&gt;  He then sought to recruit [[David Bossie]] and [[George Gigicos]].&lt;ref name=NYT2august17/&gt;

In July 2017, Community Choice Financial, a payday lender, offered Lewandowski a $20,000-a-month retainer.&lt;ref name=NYT2august17/&gt;  On the July 30, 2017 episode of ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Lewandowski told President Trump to fire [[Richard Cordray]], the Director of the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]; Cordray had led efforts to enact new payday lending regulations.&lt;ref name=NYT2august17/&gt;  When [[Chuck Todd]] then asked Lewandowski if he was advocating for a client, Lewandowski replied "No, No. I have no clients whatsoever".&lt;ref name=NYT2august17/&gt;

===Turnberry Solutions LLC===
Lewandoski was reported to be working as a lobbyist for Turnberry Solutions LLC, though he denied having any involvement with the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/corey-lewandowski-lobbying-trump-243043?lo=ap_e1 |title=Corey Lewandowski appears to be working with another lobbying firm |first=Theodoric |last=Meyer |first2=Daniel |last2=Lippman |date=September 22, 2017 |publisher=[[Politico]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923214523/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/corey-lewandowski-lobbying-trump-243043?lo=ap_e1 |archive-date=September 23, 2017 |quote=Months after Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, quit the lobbying firm he co-founded after the 2016 election, he appears to be working with a new one, reviving questions about whether he is still cashing in on his relationship with the president.

While Lewandowski has denied any link to the firm, there’s plenty of evidence to the contrary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoir===
In December 2017, the [[memoir]] ''[[Let Trump Be Trump]]'', co-authored by Lewandowski and [[David Bossie]], was published by Center Street. The memoir chronicles Lewandowski's and Bossie's experiences working for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/revealed-new-lewandowski-bossie-book-let-trump-be-trump/article/2637676 |title=Revealed: New Lewandowski, Bossie book 'Let Trump Be Trump' |last=Bedard |first=Paul |date=October 16, 2017 |work=Washington Examiner |access-date=December 17, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2018, Lewandowski appeared on [[Fox News]] alongside Democratic strategist Zac Petkanas. When Petkanas mentioned a case of a 10-year-old immigrant girl with [[Down syndrome]] who had been forcibly taken away from her mother under the [[Trump administration family separation policy]] and put in a cage, Lewandowski responded "[[wikt:womp womp|womp, womp]]" (an [[onomatopoeia]] for the "sad trombone" sound effect that often accompanies a comedic failure), which angered Petkanas and received widespread criticism from various sources.&lt;ref name=usat&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Cummings|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/06/19/corey-lewandowski-mocks-migrant-girl-down-syndrome/716645002/|title='Womp, womp': Ex-Trump campaign manager Lewandowski mocks migrant girl with Down syndrome|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=June 19, 2018|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sophie|last=Turner|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/corey-lewandowski-undocumented-immigrant-womp-womp/index.html|title=Lewandowski refuses to apologize for 'womp womp' comment|work=[[CNN]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Fox News contributor [[Meghan McCain]] commented: "This is so horrible, even by Lewandowski standards."&lt;ref name=usat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Doha|last=Madani|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corey-lewandowski-fox-news-womp-womp-down-sydrome-detainee_us_5b299dbae4b0a4dc99220176|title=Corey Lewandowski Dismisses Girl With Down Syndrome Separated From Mother: ‘Womp, Womp’|website=[[Huffington Post]]|location=New York City|date=June 19, 2018|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing on Fox News on June 20, Lewandowski refused to apologize for the remark and instead reiterated his belief that undocumented aliens are criminals who should be held accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tatum |first1=Sophie |title=Lewandowski refuses to apologize for 'womp womp' comment |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/corey-lewandowski-undocumented-immigrant-womp-womp/index.html |accessdate=June 21, 2018 |publisher=CNN |date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2018, Lewandowski was dropped by Leading Authorities, Inc., a speakers bureau based in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/21/media/corey-lewandowski-speakers-bureau/index.html|title=Corey Lewandowski dropped by speakers bureau after 'womp womp' comment|last=Byers|first=Dylan|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2018, Lewandowski revisited the topic of the 10-year-old immigrant on [[CNN]], asserting, contrary to the available evidence, that the "10-year-old that was separated at the border was separated because her mother was a member—or a potential member—of a child-smuggling ring.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Andrew|last=Kirell|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/corey-lewandowski-doubles-down-down-syndrome-girls-mom-was-potential-child-smuggler|title=Lewandowski Now Claims Down-Syndrome Girl’s Mom Is ‘Potential Child Smuggler’|date=June 27, 2018|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=June 27, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Julieta|last1=Chiquillo|first2=Dianne|last2=Solis|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/20/mexican-immigrant-separated-child-syndrome-held-smuggling-witness|title=Mexican mother separated from girl with Down syndrome was detained in smuggling case, officials say|date=2018-06-20|work=Dallas News|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lewandowski met his future wife Alison Hardy, when he was in ninth grade and she was in eighth grade.  In 1998, Hardy married Brian Kinney, but Kinney was killed on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] after [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists hijacked his flight, [[United Airlines Flight 175|United Airlines 175]], and flew it into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.  Four years later, in 2005.  Lewandowski married Hardy.&lt;ref name=Tumulty/&gt; Together they have four children.&lt;ref name="PoliticoConcerns"/&gt;

On November 28, 2017, a pro-Trump performer, [[Joy Villa]], filed a police complaint against Lewandowski for allegedly slapping her buttocks at a holiday party at the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/singer-joy-villa-justice-served-sexual-assault-allegation/story?id=52041661|title=Singer Joy Villa says she wants justice to be served in sexual assault allegation against Corey Lewandowski|date=December 29, 2017|work=ABC News|language=en-US|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/26/trump-supporter-joy-villa-says-filed-sexual-assault-complaint-against-corey-lewandowski.html|title=Trump supporter Joy Villa says she filed a sexual assault complaint against Corey Lewandowski|date=December 26, 2017|work=Fox News|language=en-US|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villa alleged that after she told him that she could report him for sexual harassment, Lewandowski said, "I work in the private sector" and slapped her again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/26/politics/joy-villa-corey-lewandowski-police-report/index.html|title=Singer Joy Villa alleges Corey Lewandowski assaulted her at Trump hotel party|date=December 27, 2017|work=CNN|language=en-US|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewandowski responded to the allegations by saying that “There is a due process and there is a process which they will go through to determine a person’s innocence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/12/27/corey-lewandowski-responds-to-joy-villa-s-sexual-assault-allegations.html|title=Corey Lewandowski Responds to Joy Villas Sexual Assault Allegations|date=December 27, 2017|work=Fox Business|language=en-US|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philip-ii-of-macedon.jpg|thumb|right|Tradition attributes the origin of the motto to [[Philip of Macedonia]]: διαίρει καὶ βασίλευε ''diaírei kài basíleue'', in [[Ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]]: «divide and rule»]]
'''Divide and rule''' (from [[Latin]] ''dīvide et imperā''), or '''divide and conquer''', in [[politics]] and [[sociology]] is gaining and maintaining [[Power (social and political)|power]] by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the one implementing the strategy. The concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people. It was heavily used by [[British Empire]] in [[India]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Ilia Xypolia 2016. P. 9"&gt;Ilia Xypolia. 'Divide et Impera: Vertical and Horizontal Dimensions of British Imperialism'. Critique: journal of socialist theory, vol 44, no. 3, pp. 221-231, 2016. P. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traiano Boccalini]] cites "divide et impera" in ''La bilancia politica''&lt;ref&gt;'''1''' §136 and '''2''' §225&lt;/ref&gt; as a common principle in politics. The use of this technique is meant to empower the sovereign to control subjects, populations, or factions of different interests, who collectively might be able to oppose his rule. [[Machiavelli]] identifies a similar application to military strategy, advising in Book VI of ''The Art of War''&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149a/chapter6.html http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625213056/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149a/chapter6.html |date=25 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Dell'arte della guerra''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ITA1109/_P7.HTM|title=Dell'arte  della guerra: testo - IntraText CT|work=intratext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a Captain should endeavor with every art to divide the forces of the enemy, either by making him suspicious of his men in whom he trusted, or by giving him cause that he has to separate his forces, and, because of this, become weaker.

The maxim ''divide et impera'' has been attributed to [[Philip II of Macedon]], and together with the maxim ''divide ut regnes'' was utilised by the Roman ruler [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and the French emperor [[Napoleon]].

The strategy, but not the phrase, applies in many ancient cases: the example of [[Aulus Gabinius|Gabinius]] exists, parting [[Iudaea Province|the Jewish nation]] into five conventions, reported by [[Flavius Josephus]] in Book I, 169-170 of ''The Wars of the Jews'' (''De bello Judaico'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+BJ+1.159 |title=Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews, Book I, section 159 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |date= |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] also reports in ''Geography'', 8.7.3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+8.7.1 |title=Strabo, Geography, Book 8, chapter 7, section 1 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |date= |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Achaean League]] was gradually dissolved under the Roman possession of the whole of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], owing to them not dealing with the several states in the same way, but wishing to preserve some and to destroy others.

The strategy of division and rule has been attributed to sovereigns, ranging from [[Louis XI]] to [[Habsburgs|the Habsburgs]]. [[Edward Coke]] denounces it in Chapter I of the Fourth Part of the ''Institutes'', reporting that when it was demanded by the [[House of Lords|Lords]] and [[British House of Commons|Commons]] what might be a principal motive for them to have good success in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], it was answered: "''Eritis insuperabiles, si fueritis inseparabiles. Explosum est illud diverbium: Divide, &amp; impera, cum radix &amp; vertex imperii in obedientium consensu rata sunt.''" [You would be insuperable if you were inseparable. This proverb, Divide and rule, has been rejected, since the root and the summit of authority are confirmed by the consent of the subjects.] On the other hand, in a minor variation, [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] wrote the phrase "separa et impera" in a letter to [[James I of England|James I]] of 15 February 1615. [[James Madison]] made this recommendation in a letter to [[Thomas Jefferson]] of 24 October 1787,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch17s22.html |title=Constitutional Government: James Madison to Thomas Jefferson |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which summarized the thesis of ''[[Federalist Papers|The Federalist#10]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm|title=The Federalist #10|work=constitution.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Divide et impera, the reprobated axiom of tyranny, is under certain (some) qualifications, the only policy, by which a republic can be administered on just principles." In ''Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch''
by Immanuel Kant (1795), Appendix one, ''Divide et impera'' is the third of three political maxims, the others being ''Fac et excusa'' (Act now, and make excuses later) and ''Si fecisti, nega'' (when you commit a crime, deny it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/kant/append1.htm |title=Immanuel Kant: Perpetual Peace: Appendix I |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of this technique involve:
* creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign
* aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign
* fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers
* encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political and military spending

Historically, this strategy was used in many different ways by empires seeking to expand their territories.

The concept is also mentioned as a strategy for market action in [[economics]] to get the most out of the players in a competitive market.

A primary strategy the narcissist uses to assert [[Abusive power and control|control]], particularly within his/her family, is to create divisions among individuals. This weakens and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolates]] them, making it easier for the narcissist to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and dominate. Some are favoured, others are [[scapegoated]]. Such dynamics can play out in a workplace setting.&lt;ref&gt; Hall J [http://narcissistfamilyfiles.com/2017/03/27/its-you-and-me-baby-narcissist-head-games/ It’s You and Me Baby: Narcissist Head Games] The Narcissist Family Files 27 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
Clive R. Boddy found that "divide and conquer" was a common strategy by corporate [[psychopaths]] used as a smokescreen to help consolidate and advance their grip on power in the corporate hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;Boddy, C. R. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C0l9DAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==

===Africa===
The divide and conquer strategy was used by foreign countries in parts of [[Africa]] during the [[Scramble for Africa|colonial]] and post-colonial period.
* Germany and [[Belgium]] ruled [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] in a colonial capacity. Germany used the strategy of divide and conquer by placing members of the already dominant [[Tutsi]] minority in positions of power. When Belgium took over colonial rule in 1916, the Tutsi and [[Hutu]] groups were rearranged according to race instead of occupation. Belgium defined "Tutsi" as anyone with more than ten cows or a long nose, while "Hutu" meant someone with less than ten cows and a broad nose. The socioeconomic divide between Tutsis and Hutus continued after independence and was a major factor in the [[Rwandan Genocide]].
* During [[British Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|British]] rule of [[Nigeria]] from 1900 to 1960, different regions were frequently reclassified for administrative purposes. The conflict between the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] made it easier for the British to consolidate their power in the region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ad41|title=HISTORY OF NIGERIA|work=historyworld.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====Mongolian Empire====
* While the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. Pakistan and India were also divided by this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41930343|journal=Journal of Asian History|title=SINO-KHITAN ADMINISTRATION IN MONGOL BUKHARA|last=BUELL|first=PAUL D.|volume= 13|number=2|date=1979|pages=137–8|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian subcontinent====
The strategy of "Divide and Rule" was employed by most imperial powers in [[Indian subcontinent]]. The British and French backed various Indian states in conflicts between each other, both as a means of undermining each other's influence and consolidating their authority. The [[Durrand line]] divided [[Afghanistan]] and Northwest [[Pakistan]], the homeland of the [[Pashtuns]].

Further, it is argued that the British used the strategy to destroy the harmony between various religions and use it for their benefits&lt;ref&gt;Shashi Tharoor - Inglorious Empire What the British Did to India&lt;/ref&gt;; a ''Times Literary Supplement'' review suggests that although this was broadly the case a more nuanced approach might be closer to the facts&lt;ref&gt;Jon Wilson, 2016, ''India Conquered: Britain's Raj and the chaos of empire'', cited in a review of Tharoor's work by Elizabeth Buettner in "Debt of Honour: why the European impact on India must be fully acknowledged", ''Times Literary Supplement'', August 11 2017, pages 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Middle East====
* The [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], which carved the Middle East, is an example of a 'divide and rule' strategy.
* Some analysts assert that the US is practicing the strategy in the 21st century middle east through escalation of the [[Sunni-Shia conflict]]. [[Nafeez Ahmed]] cites a 2008 [[RAND Corporation]] study for the American military which recommended "divide and rule" as a possible strategy against the Muslim world in "[[War on Terror#Etymology|the Long War.]]" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pernin|first=Christopher G., et al|date=2008|title=Unfolding the Future of the Long War|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2008/RAND_MG738.pdf|journal=US Army Training and Doctrine Command’s Army Capability Integration Center|volume=|pages=|via=RAND Arroyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Christopher Davidson]] argues that the current [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|crisis in Yemen]] is being “egged on” by the US, and could be part of a wider covert strategy to “spur fragmentation in Iran allies and allow Israel to be surrounded by weak states”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/pentagon-plan-divide-and-rule-muslim-world-1690265165|title=The Pentagon plan to ‘divide and rule’ the Muslim world|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
* Romans entered [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] from the south and defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]] in the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168 BC. Macedonia was then divided into four republics that were heavily restricted from relations with one another and other Hellenic states. A ruthless purge occurred, with allegedly anti-Roman citizens being denounced by their compatriots and deported in large numbers.
* During the [[Gallic Wars]], [[Julius Caesar]] was able to use a divide and rule strategy to easily defeat the militarily strong [[Gauls]]. By the time the Gauls united under [[Vercingetorix]], it was already too late for them.&lt;ref name="EB_The_Roman_Conquest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/41196/The-press |title=France: The Roman conquest |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=April 6, 2015 |quote="Because of chronic internal rivalries, Gallic resistance was easily broken, though Vercingetorix's Great Rebellion of 52 bce had notable successes."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The_first_triumvirate_and_the_conquest_of_Gaul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88114/Julius-Caesar/9735/The-first-triumvirate-and-the-conquest-of-Gaul |title=Julius Caesar: The first triumvirate and the conquest of Gaul |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=February 15, 2015 |quote="Indeed, the Gallic cavalry was probably superior to the Roman, horseman for horseman. Rome's military superiority lay in its mastery of strategy, tactics, discipline, and military engineering. In Gaul, Rome also had the advantage of being able to deal separately with dozens of relatively small, independent, and uncooperative states. Caesar conquered these piecemeal, and the concerted attempt made by a number of them in 52 bce to shake off the Roman yoke came too late."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the [[October revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks]] engaged at various times in alliances with the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], some [[Anarchists#Russian Revolution|anarchists]], and various non-Russian ethnic [[nationalist]] groups, against the [[White movement]], [[Right Socialist-Revolutionaries]], and other anarchist and ethnic nationalist groups. This was done to establish the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (the Bolshevik party) as the sole legal party in the [[Soviet Union]]. Similar shifting alliances were played out amongst various dissident factions within the CPSU, such as the [[Workers Opposition]] and [[Left Communists]], with [[Joseph Stalin]] and his supporters gaining absolute power within the party by the mid-1920s.
* The [[Salami strategy]] of Hungarian Communist leader, [[Mátyás Rákosi]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}
* Alliances with various parties played a role in the Nazi ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' and ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', the seizure and consolidation of total power by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]]. The [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], which banned the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] parties, was supported by the Nazis' coalition partner, the [[German National People's Party]], as well as by the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]. Several months later, all political parties in Germany were banned except for the NSDAP.
* The [[British Empire]] urged the Britons in [[British Cyprus]] to stir up the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] minority in order to neutralize agitation from the [[Greeks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grob-Fitzgibbon|first1=Benjamin|title=Imperial Endgame: Britain's Dirty Wars and the End of Empire|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-30038-5|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jordan|first1=Preston Lim|title=The Evolution of British Counter-Insurgency during the Cyprus Revolt, 1955–1959|date=2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319916200|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British colonial policy of “divide and rule” cultivated intentionally animosity between the Greek majority and the Turkish minority (18% of the population) in the island that remains [[Cyprus dispute|divided]] till today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Justice: The Case of Cyprus|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/constantine-tzanos/international-justice-the_b_9934090.html|publisher=The [[HuffPost]]|accessdate=1 November 2017|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''Dog spinning''' ({{lang-bg|тричане на куче(та)}}, ''trichane na kuche(ta)'') is a ritual that was traditionally practiced on the first day of [[Lent]] in the village of [[Brodilovo]] in southeastern [[Bulgaria]]. It is related to similar rituals used on this day at other villages, in which the dogs were whipped or beaten. The ritual is thought to have [[paganism|pagan]] origins&lt;ref name="stclair"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = St. Clair | first1 = Stanislas Graham Bower | last2 = Brophy | first2 = Charles A. | title = A residence in Bulgaria | publisher = J. Murray | date = 1869 | location = London | pages = 39 | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24240013M/A_residence_in_Bulgaria }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and was performed in order to prevent [[rabies]].&lt;ref name="darik"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ameleva | first = Iveta | title = Кмет забрани жесток обичай с кучета | newspaper = Darik News | language = Bulgarian | date = 2006-02-23 | url = http://www.darik.net/view_article.php?article_id=48579 | accessdate = 2015-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In dog spinning, a [[dog]] is suspended above water on a rope. The dog is turned repeatedly in a given direction to wind the rope, or is inserted into a loop of rope that has been twisted already. The dog is then released so that it spins rapidly in the opposite direction as the rope unwinds.

== History ==
Historically the ritual was performed in many other parts of [[Bulgaria]] as well and although the exact practice varied regionally, e.g. whipping or beating the dogs instead of spinning them, it was performed on the same date and with the same goal. Reports of this type of ritual can be found as early as 1869.&lt;ref name="stclair" /&gt;

== Animal welfare concerns ==
The Swedish newspaper [[Aftonbladet]] reported protests at the Bulgarian Embassy in Stockholm about the cruelty of this tradition. These occurred as Bulgaria prepared to join the [[European Union]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ovander | first = Petter | title = Barbarer! | newspaper = Aftonbladet | language = Swedish | date = 2005-03-08 | url = http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10557377.ab | accessdate = 2015-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reference in English is in a press release issued by the [[Green Party of England and Wales|UK Green Party]], issued on July 29, 2005. It includes a statement from Green Party [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Caroline Lucas]], vice-president of the [[RSPCA]] and the European Parliament's cross-party Animal Welfare Intergroup. Dr Lucas criticised it as being cruel to dogs, saying "Dog-spinning is a barbaric practice and must not be allowed to continue into the 21st century."

The "Sofia Echo" reported the practice in March 2011.

The practice of the ritual was banned by the mayor of [[Tsarevo]] in 2006&lt;ref name="darik" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bozhkov | first = Bozhidar | title = Забраниха жестокия ритуал с кучета в Странджа | newspaper = Сега | language = Bulgarian | date = 2006-02-24 | url = http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=2155&amp;sectionid=2&amp;id=0000603 | accessdate = 2015-01-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928215010/http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=2155&amp;sectionid=2&amp;id=0000603 | archivedate = 2011-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; after complaints by Bulgarian [[animal welfare]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwns.org/content/view/167/64/lang,bg/ Сигнал във връзка с "тричане на куче", 15.03.2005] (in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]])&lt;/ref&gt; There have been reports of the practice continuing sporadically, and animal welfare organisations have tried to ensure this does not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Graham | title = Exposed: The cruel dog-spinning ritual to 'ward off rabies' that is STILL being practised Bulgaria | newspaper = Mail Online | date = 2012-02-29 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2107697/Bizarre-dog-spinning-ritual-ward-rabies-practised-rural-Bulgaria-despite-banned-thwarted-animal-rights-activists.html | accessdate = 2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Протести срещу тричането в интернет | newspaper = Burgasnews | date = 2015-01-26 | url = http://www.burgasnews.com/komentari/82611-protesti-sreshtu-trichaneto-v-internet | accessdate = 2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Glee, Actually'''" is the tenth episode of the [[Glee (season 4)|fourth season]] of the American musical television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and the seventy-sixth episode overall as well as the show's third Christmas-themed episode. Written by Matthew Hodgson and directed by Adam Shankman, it aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on December 13, 2012.

The episode garnered mixed reviews from critics; and was watched by 5.26 million viewers, receiving an 18-49 rating of 2.0.

==Plot==
[[Artie Abrams]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) injures himself on an icy wheelchair ramp at McKinley High. [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) helps him to the school nurse's office, where Artie tells Finn he wishes that the accident that paralyzed him had never happened. Artie falls asleep in the nurse's office and enters a [[dream sequence]]. In the dream, as explained by his guide [[Rory Flanagan]] ([[Damian McGinty]]), Artie was never paralyzed and as a result many of the events as he knows them never took place. The glee club never got off the ground, and [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) has become an apathetic alcoholic under the control of his wife, [[Terri Schuester]] ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]). [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) is bullied by jocks – including several of the glee club members – because of his homosexuality, and as a result never graduated from high school. [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]) works as a librarian in the school library, having never had a chance to be a star. [[Becky Jackson]] ([[Lauren Potter]]) is the school slut because she was never treated with respect because Artie never took her on a date. Artie gathers the glee club as he knows it and performs "[[Feliz Navidad (song)|Feliz Navidad]]" in an attempt to inspire them to establish a glee club, but fails. Last, Rory informs Artie that [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) never managed to recover from her car accident, which happened regardless of her participation in the glee club, and, since she didn't have the support of her friends, died of a broken heart. Rory explains to Artie that wheelchair-bound Artie is the heart and soul of the glee club, and Artie wakes up from the dream with a better appreciation of his role in the club.

[[Burt Hummel]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]) surprises Kurt and Rachel by showing up at their New York apartment. Burt explains to Rachel the significance of Christmas in Kurt's life, especially after the death of Kurt's mother. Rachel goes on a cruise, while the Hummels continue to bond in New York. Burt reveals to Kurt that he has prostate cancer, but it was diagnosed at an early stage and his chances for survival are very high. Burt then surprises Kurt again by revealing that he has paid for [[Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]) to travel to New York to spend Christmas with them. They have an awkward but cordial reunion, and sing "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]". Back at the apartment, Burt, Kurt, and Blaine continue several of the Hummels' Christmas traditions, and have dinner.

[[Noah "Puck" Puckerman]] ([[Mark Salling]]) invites [[Jake Puckerman]] ([[Jacob Artist]]) to travel to Los Angeles with him. Puck tries to impress Jake with the lifestyle he lives in Los Angeles, but when the actual owner of the house where Puck told Jake he had been living returns home and kicks them out, Puck admits he has been lying about his lifestyle. The brothers return to Lima and later have a Hanukkah dinner at Breadstix, together with their respective mothers. The dinner goes badly at first, as the two women resent each other, but Puck and Jake convince their mothers that all four of them have a common bond: they were all placed into a difficult situation by Puck and Jake's father. The women begin to talk and soon start to bond. Puck informs Jake that he will be staying in Lima, while he works on a screenplay.

[[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris]]) and [[Sam Evans]] ([[Chord Overstreet]]) reveal to each other that they believe in the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 Mayan apocalypse]]. Believing that the world is about to end, Brittany cashes out her savings and gives her friends expensive gifts, and Sam proposes to Brittany. Coach [[Shannon Beiste]] ([[Dot-Marie Jones]]) performs the wedding ceremony. When the apocalypse does not occur as expected, Sam and Brittany realize that they are still married, and meet Coach Beiste at Breadstix to ask for help. Beiste reveals that she is not actually qualified to perform weddings, and that they are not officially married. She did this because she didn't really want them to get married. Both Brittany and Sam are disappointed that the world didn't end, but they realized that it felt good being nice to others. Coach Beiste, feeling sorry for them, pretended that an archaeologist named [[Indiana Jones]] found a Mayan calendar predicting that the world would end on September 27, 2014. This lifted Brittany and Sam's spirits, who were delighted to find out that there was still time to tell others how they felt.

After failing to satisfy Becky with her Christmas gifts, [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) draws Millie Rose's ([[Trisha Rae Stahl]]) name in a Secret Santa event held among the McKinley High faculty and staff. Unsure what to get Millie, Sue happens upon a conversation between Millie and her daughter [[Marley Rose]] ([[Melissa Benoist]]). Marley wants to have a Christmas tree and at least some gifts, but Millie explains that they need to save money to pay a counselor to treat Marley for her eating disorder. After seeing this, Sue breaks into the Roses' home that night and surreptitiously leaves them a Christmas tree, several presents, and enough money to pay Marley's counselor. Becky reveals to Millie that Sue was behind the surprise when bribed by candy and Millie attempts to return the money, but Sue insists that Millie keep it. Millie then brings Sue to the auditorium, where several of the glee club members including Marley sing "[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]", joined in unison by the four glee clubbers singing in Breadstix and the two singing in the New York apartment.

===Reviews===
The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Laurel Brown of ''[[Zap2it]]'' gave the episode a mixed review, and wrote, "If you were hoping (like me) that ''Glee'' would pay homage to the brilliance of ''[[Love Actually|Love, Actually]]'' in its holiday-themed 'Glee, Actually', you may have been sorely disappointed." She criticized the Marley storyline calling it "a bit of a snooze", but called Artie's dream segment "a strong (if insane) segment". The storyline that featured Kurt and Burt was characterized as "cheesy", though she called the Hummel duo and Blaine "just so darn sweet!"&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/12/glee-christmas-episode-recap-5-stories-in-search-of-some-holiday-cheer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Rae Votta of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' also gave the episode a mixed review, and noted, "The one truth of ''Glee'' is the Christmas episode always involves a plethora of holiday sweet with just a dash of WTF."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1481384/glee-recap-christmas-brings-marriage-cancer-ice-skating-love-actually&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignite''' (Ignite Talks) is a series of events where speakers have five minutes to talk on a subject accompanied by 20 slides, for 15 seconds each, automatically advanced. Ignite started in Seattle, and it has spread to 350+ organizing teams in cities, universities, governments and companies who have hosted thousands of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ignite co-founder Brady Forrest acquires the popular speaker series from O'Reilly Media - GeekWire|url = http://www.geekwire.com/2015/ignite-co-founder-brady-forrest-acquires-popular-speaker-series-from-oreilly-media/|website = GeekWire|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ignite has a new home - O'Reilly Radar|url = http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/11/ignite.html|website = radar.oreilly.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A New Start for Ignite|url = https://medium.com/@brady/a-new-start-for-ignite-2a35a25288c1|website = Medium|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tc&gt;{{Cite web|title = Community Speaker Series Ignite Gets A Reboot|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/16/letsbecyborganthropologists/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 2015-11-23|first = Sarah|last = Buhr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignite Talks is similar in its form to and probably inspired by [[PechaKucha]], found 12 years earlier.

The first Ignite was held in 2006 in [[Seattle, Washington]] by Brady Forrest and [[Bre Pettis]], and was sponsored by [[O'Reilly Media]] and ''[[Make (magazine)|MAKE]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/fashion/03webparty.html?_r=2&amp;ref=fashion&amp;oref=slogin|title=Night Life Reprogrammed|last=Salkin |first=Allen |date=August 3, 2008|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/405192_IGNITE16.html|title=A Seattle geek fest spreads its wings|last=Guzman |first=Monica |date=April 16, 2009|work=[[Seattle Post Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/sharing-ideas-quickly/article_e9a05236-0fb1-5054-b917-f62a6e0ac85b.html|title=Sharing ideas quickly|last=Neznanski|first=Matt|date=November 14, 2008|work=[[Corvallis Gazette Times]]|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://igniteshow.com/howto|title=Testing How-to Layout|work=igniteshow.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2007/04/16/ignite-lights-up-web-20-expo/ |title=Ignite Lights Up Web 2.0 Expo |work=VentureBeat }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2008/02/attention_deficit_theater.html |title=Attention Deficit theater |date= February 5, 2008 |last=Oppenheimer |first=Laura |work=[[The Oregonian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/thebigblog/archives/132223.asp |title=Ignite Seattle 5: Big ideas and really fast talking hit Capitol Hill |work=[[Seattle Post Intelligencer]] |last=Guzman |first=Monica |date=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly continued to support Ignite until November 2015 when the franchise was handed off to its founder, Brady Forrest, who formed Ignite Talks, PBC - a [[Public-benefit corporation|Public Benefit Corporation]].

'''Captain Jameel Sayhood''' was an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] pilot in the [[Gulf War]] who it is claimed managed to attain one of the few aerial victories by the [[Iraqi Air Force]] in his [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29B]], before being shot down by [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Captain Craig Underhill and Captain Cesar Rodriguez with their [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15Cs]] mere minutes after his air-air victory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cooper/Sadik, ''The First Night''. [[IAPR]], Vol. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="victories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://128.121.102.226/aaloss.html|title=Fixed Wing Combat Air Attrition Coalition Aircraft Attrition in Desert Storm|accessdate=2010-09-11|last=|first=|year=2004|publisher=acig.com}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial engagement==
Captain Sayhood was flying his MiG-29B in Iraq on the third day of the war in order to root out and shoot-down Coalition aircraft bombing Iraq. It is claimed that [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilots Gary Lennox and Adrian Weeks were flying their [[Panavia Tornado]] on a bombing mission at Tallil Airfield in Iraq. Sayhood spotted them and promptly brought them down with an [[Molniya R-60|R-60]] missile from his MiG's arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sistemadearmas.sites.uol.com.br/aam/bvr09golfo.html |title=Combates BVR no Golfo Pérsico |accessdate=2010-09-11 |last= |first= |year=2004 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105193504/http://sistemadearmas.sites.uol.com.br/aam/bvr09golfo.html |archivedate=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks and Lennox were killed in the crash of their aircraft, serial ZA467. However this aircraft is recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tornado-data.com/Production/RAF%20Crash%20Data.pdf |title=RAF Crash Data |accessdate=2010-09-11 |last= |first= |year=2004 |publisher=tornado-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second engagement==
Sayhood continued his mission defending Iraqi airspace and came across two F-15Cs piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and [[Cesar Rodriguez (USAF pilot)|Cesar Rodriguez]]. Underhill and Rodriguez were pursuing another pair of MiG-29s when they spotted Sayhood and his wingman. Sayhood and his wingman promptly engaged the two American aircraft and one of the most intense dogfights of the [[Gulf War]] ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify their aggressors. Underhill faced Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself faced Rodriguez. Underhill fired an [[AIM-7]] at Sayhood's wingman, hitting him head on and killing him instantly. At the same time, Rodriguez sensed a radar lock by Sayhood, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove down to the deck in order to confuse Sayhood's radar with ground clutter, hoping to shake the radar lock on his aircraft. After seeing his wingman killed, Sayhood briefly broke off the attack. Rodriguez and Underhill started heading south for a tanker, when Sayhood approached them from the north. Rodriguez and Underhill turned around to face Sayhood. Underhill got a radar lock on Sayhood with an AIM-7, but didn't fire because he wasn't sure if Sayhood was friendly or not. Sayhood sliced into their formation causing a "classic merge". Underhill climbed, keeping his lock on Sayhood, while Rodriguez stayed committed to the merge in order to visually identify the aircraft as hostile. As they passed each other, Rodriguez identified it as Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on the MiG's better turning radius to get onto Rodriguez's tail. They slowly spiraled towards the ground until Sayhood attempted to pull out using a [[Split-S|split-s]]. Rodriguez didn't follow, and just before Sayhood could pull out, he crashed into the ground. He managed to eject from his MiG, reportedly with his crash site reportedly being merely a mile from the British jet previously shot down by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Dogfights of Desert Storm  |accessdate=2010-09-11 |last= |first= |date=14 September 2008 |publisher=History Channel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://iraqimilitary.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1304&amp;p=8841&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f-16.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=263048&amp;sid=8b1cfaf0a770a3beef056794f5579dd4#p263048&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-War==
It was reported decades later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg upon landing from his ejection and evacuated to a local hospital. Afterwards he was allegedly deemed unfit to fly, and retired from the Iraqi Air Force with a promotion to Major General.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f-16.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=263048&amp;sid=8b1cfaf0a770a3beef056794f5579dd4#p263048&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lafayette Curry Baker''' (October 13, 1826 – July 3, 1868) was a United States investigator and spy, serving the [[Union Army]], during the [[American Civil War]] and under [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Andrew Johnson]].

==Early life==

Baker was born in Stafford, New York on October 13, 1826.&lt;ref name="Eicher588"&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher]], ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-3641-1}}. p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a mechanic, moved to Michigan in 1839, returned to New York in 1848, moved to California in 1853, and was a San Francisco vigilante in 1856.&lt;ref name="Eicher588"/&gt; He moved to the [[District of Columbia]] in 1861.&lt;ref name="Eicher588"/&gt;

==American Civil War==

Baker's exploits are mainly known through his book ''A History of the Secret Service'' which he published in 1867 after his fall from grace.&lt;ref name="Eicher588"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, 2001, p. 588 states that Baker was "prone to fabrication.'&lt;/ref&gt; During the early months of the Civil War, he spied for General [[Winfield Scott]] on [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces in [[Virginia]]. Despite numerous scrapes, he returned to [[Washington, D.C.]], with information that Scott evidently thought valuable enough to raise him to the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]. As [[Provost Marshal]] of Washington, D.C. from September 12, 1862 to November 7, 1863, Baker ran the National Detective Bureau also sometimes known as the "National Detective Police Department."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Toole|first1=G.J.A.|title=Honorable Treachery: A History of U. S. Intelligence, Espionage, and Covert Action from the American Revolution to the CIA|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0802123282|edition=Reprint 2014|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J0bRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT200&amp;dq=%22National+Detective+Bureau%22+%22Secret+Service%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj75LunpfnRAhWoC8AKHbf2Asg4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22National%20Detective%20Bureau%22%20%22Secret%20Service%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 February 2017|chapter=Part Three}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed colonel of D.C. Cavalry, May 5, 1863.&lt;ref name="Eicher588"/&gt; According to Glenn Hastedt "Although his accomplishments were many, Baker operated with little regard for warrants or the constitutional rights of those he pursued. He is also reported to have employed brutal interrogation techniques in order to obtain information."&lt;ref name="Hastedt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hastedt|first1=Glenn|title=Espionage: A Reference Handbook|date=2004|publisher=ABC-Clio|isbn=978-1576079508|page=109|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YTHlty6deKgC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22National+Detective+Bureau%22+baker+ruthless%7Crights&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji_e2DqvnRAhUlCsAKHSzxDc0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22National%20Detective%20Bureau%22%20baker%20ruthless%7Crights&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker owed his appointment largely to [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]], but suspected the secretary of corruption and was eventually demoted for tapping his [[telegraph]] lines and packed off to New York.

==Lincoln assassination investigation==

Baker was recalled to Washington after the assassination of President Lincoln in 1865. Within two days of his arrival in Washington, Baker's agents in [[Maryland]] had made four arrests and had the names of two more conspirators, including the actual presidential assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Before the month was out, Booth along with [[David Herold]] were found holed up in a barn and Booth was himself shot and killed by Sgt. [[Boston Corbett]]. Baker received a generous share of the $100,000 reward offered to the person who apprehended the president's killer.&lt;ref&gt;''[[North &amp; South - The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society]]'', Volume 11, Number 1, Page 44, [http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf  "Lafayette Baker and Civil War Security in the North"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714195019/http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf |date=2011-07-14 }}, accessed April 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Baker for appointment to the grade of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, April 26, 1865, but the [[United States Senate]] never confirmed the appointment.&lt;ref name="Eicher588"/&gt; Baker was mustered out of the volunteers on January 15, 1866.&lt;ref name="Eicher588"/&gt;

==Firing and death==

The following year, Baker was sacked from his position as government spymaster. President Johnson accused him of spying on him, a charge Baker admitted in his book which he published in response. He also announced that he had had Booth's diary in his possession which was being suppressed by the Department of War and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. When the diary was eventually produced, Baker claimed that eighteen vital pages were missing. It was suggested by [[Otto Eisenschiml]] in his book, "Why Was Lincoln Murdered?," that these would implicate Stanton in the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;"Why was Lincoln Murdered," by Otto Eisenschml, pgs. 140-145&lt;/ref&gt; However, this notion has been proven as speculation by author [[Edward Steers Jr.]] and based on non-reputable sources.&lt;ref&gt;"Lincoln Legends" by Edward Steers Jr., pgs. 177-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 1868, Baker retired to home complaining of soreness from a gun wound during a hunting trip. He had been out drinking with Wally Pollack, his brother-in-law, and came home feeling sick, passing away later that night, reportedly from [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name="Eicher588"/&gt;

A widely criticized 1977 book, ''[[The Lincoln Conspiracy (book)|The Lincoln Conspiracy]]'' by conspiracy theorists David W. Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier, alleges that Baker was poisoned by high-placed conspirators, including Stanton, who supported [[John Wilkes Booth|John Wilkes Booth's]] plan to kidnap Abraham Lincoln in 1864 and early 1865. The conspirators supposedly planned to have Lincoln impeached in his absence. The authors speculate that the conspirators were concerned that Baker could link them to the planned kidnapping, which might lead to accusations that they were conspirators in Lincoln's assassination. The authors believe the conspirators did not support Booth after March 1865. Academic historians have treated the book with hostility and derision, having many objections based on errors and misuse of sources in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Basiger, David W. and Charles E. Sellier. ''The Lincoln Conspiracy'' Park City, Utah: [[Sunn Classic Pictures|Schick Sunn Classic Books]], 1977, {{ISBN|978-0-917214-03-5}}. pp. 295-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interment==

Baker is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Eicher588"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Find-a-grave states Baker is
buried in Forest Hills Memorial Park [[Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania]] in an unmarked grave which can be found behind the Hanover-Kensington Memorial plot. [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8088964 Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26605">[[File:Titanicsinking.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']] has inspired many urban legends]]

There have been several legends and myths surrounding the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] over the years. These have ranged from the myth about the ship being unsinkable, to the myth concerning the final song played by the ship's orchestra.&lt;ref name="BBC Myths"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17515305 |title=Five Titanic myths spread by films |accessdate=5 April 2012|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsinkable==
Contrary to popular mythology, ''Titanic'' was never described as "[[Ship floodability|unsinkable]]", ''without qualification'', until ''after'' she sank.&lt;ref name="The Myth of the Titanic"&gt;Richard Howells ''The Myth of the Titanic'', {{ISBN|0-333-72597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Staff |date=19 April 1912 |title=Lead Article |journal=[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]] |quote=The phrase 'unsinkable ships' is certainly not one that has originated from the builders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three trade publications (one of which was probably never published) described ''Titanic'' as ''practically'' unsinkable prior to her sinking.  Many survivors recalled in video interviews as well as in testimony that they had considered the ship "unsinkable." Shipbuilder [[Harland and Wolff]] did not claim she was unsinkable, but a promotional item from the White Star Line stressed the safety of ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'', claiming that "as far as it is possible to do so, these two wonderful vessels are designed to be unsinkable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyonthenet.com/Titanic/unsinkable.htm The Titanic – Why Did People Believe Titanic Was Unsinkable?] (especially inset: "designed to be unsinkable"). History on the Net. Accessed 2011.04.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Claims by trade publications that vessels were unsinkable or being practically unsinkable were not unique to the ''Olympic'' class liners or other White Star ships. Similar claims were made about the Cunarders ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'', and German liners ''[[SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse|Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse]]'' and ''Kaiser Wilhelm II''. Advanced safety features on these liners were heavily publicized, de-emphasizing the likelihood of these ships' sinking in a serious accident.

[[File:Titanic structure en.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|left|General arrangement of the 16 main compartments of ''Titanic''. The double bottom was 7&amp;nbsp;feet high and divided into 44 watertight compartments. There were additional 13 small compartments above the tank top, e.g., for the shaft tunnels.&lt;ref name=wildingtestimony&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq18Wilding01.php |title=Testimony of Edward Wilding |date=30 July 1912 |work=British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry |accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ''Titanic'' was designed to comply with the Grade 1 subdivision proposed by the 1891 Bulkhead Committee, meaning that it could stay afloat with any 2 adjoining out of its 16 main compartments open to the sea. The height of the bulkhead deck above the water line in flooded condition was well above the requirements, and the vessel would have been able to float with 3 adjoining compartments flooded in 11 of 14 possible combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Hacket C. and Bedford, J.G. (1996). ''The Sinking of the S.S. Titanic – Investigated  by Modern Techniques''. pp. 167–171, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The subdivisions could be sealed from communication with each other with cast iron watertight doors. To somewhat lower the chance of a sailor being caught in them, a geared system dropped the doors gradually, over 25 to 30 seconds, by sliding them vertically on hydraulic cataract cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.titanic-theshipmagnificent.com/synopsis/chapter06/|title=Titanic: The Ship Magnificent|last1=Beveridge|first1=Bruce|last2=Andrews|first2=Scott|last3=Hall|first3=Steve|last4=Klistorner|first4=Daniel|publisher=History Press|year=2009|isbn=9780752446066|editor1-last=Braunschweiger|editor1-first=Art|volume=I|location=Gloucestershire, United Kingdom|chapter=Chapter 6: Watertight Bulkheads, Doors, and Coal Bunkers|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;!--0-7524-4606-1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first unqualified assertion of ''Titanic''{{'s}} unsinkability appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 16&amp;nbsp;April 1912, a day after the tragedy. [[Philip Albright Small Franklin|Philip A.&amp;nbsp;S. Franklin]], vice president of the [[International Mercantile Marine Company]] (White Star Line's holding company) stated after being told of the sinking, "I thought her unsinkable, and I based my opinion on the best expert advice available. I do not understand it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |date=16 April 1912 |title=Titanic sinks four hours after hitting iceberg |work=The New York Times |pages= 1–2 |url= http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser/1912/04/16/100530234/article-view |accessdate=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comment was seized upon by the press, and the idea that the White Star Line had ''previously'' declared ''Titanic'' unsinkable (without qualification) gained immediate and widespread currency.&lt;ref&gt;Leavy (2007: 39)&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Sarnoff, wireless reports and the use of SOS==
An often-quoted story that has been blurred between fact and fiction states that the first person to receive news of the sinking was [[David Sarnoff]], who would later lead media giant [[RCA]]. In modified versions of this legend, Sarnoff was not the first to hear the news (though Sarnoff willingly promoted this notion), but he and others did staff the [[Guglielmo Marconi#Titanic|Marconi]] wireless station (telegraph) atop the [[Wanamaker's|Wanamaker Department Store]] in New York City, and for three days, relayed news of the disaster and names of survivors to people waiting outside. However, even this version lacks support in contemporary accounts. No newspapers of the time, for example, mention Sarnoff. Given the absence of primary evidence, the story of Sarnoff should be properly regarded as a legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/technology/bigdream/masarnoff.html |title=More About Sarnoff, Part One |work=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Internet Challenge to Television |author=Bruce M. Owen |chapter=The Evolution of Broadcast Radio |year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-00389-6 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zworykin, Pioneer of Television |author=Albert Abramson |chapter=An Invitation from Westinghouse |year=1995 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0-252-02104-5 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=They Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine |author=Harold Evans |year=2006 |publisher=Little Brown And Company |isbn=0-316-27766-5 |page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond Control: ABC and the Fate of the Networks |author=Huntington Williams |year=1989 |publisher=Atheneum |isbn=0-689-11818-X |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite popular belief, the sinking of ''Titanic'' was not the first time the internationally recognised [[Morse code]] distress signal "[[SOS]]" was used. The SOS&amp;nbsp;signal was first proposed at the International Conference on Wireless Communication at Sea in Berlin in 1906. It was ratified by the international community in 1908 and had been in widespread use since then. The SOS&amp;nbsp;signal was, however, rarely used by British wireless operators, who preferred the older [[CQD]]&amp;nbsp;code. First Wireless Operator Jack Phillips began transmitting CQD until Second Wireless Operator Harold Bride half jokingly suggested, "Send SOS; it's the new call, and this may be your last chance to send it." Phillips then began to intersperse SOS with the traditional CQD&amp;nbsp;call.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2008: 1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports that, in 1936, a [[Amateur radio|ham radio]] operator named Gordon Cosgrave claimed to be receiving [[long delayed echo]] SOS messages from the ''Carpathia'' and ''Titanic'' 24 years after their transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Macklin |title=Time Out: Save our souls: Distress call from a ship of ghosts |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/pdflinks/streams/2009/5/4/2_288607_1_255.pdf |date=May 3, 2009 |newspaper=[[Gulf Times]] |page=12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530204501/http://www.gulf-times.com/pdflinks/streams/2009/5/4/2_288607_1_255.pdf |archivedate=30 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Spencer | title=The Paranormal: A Modern Perspective on the Forces Within, Without &amp; Beyond | publisher=Crescent | isbn=978-0517073322 | date=July 28, 1992 | page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Titanic''{{'s}} band==
{{main|Musicians of the RMS Titanic}}
[[File:Titanic Band.jpg|thumb|upright|The eight members of [[Musicians of the RMS Titanic|''Titanic''{{'s}} band.]]]]
One of the most famous stories of ''Titanic'' is of the ship's band.  On 15&amp;nbsp;April the eight-member band, led by [[Wallace Hartley]], had assembled in the first-class lounge in an effort to keep passengers calm and upbeat. Later they moved on to the forward half of the boat deck. The band continued playing, even when it became apparent the ship was going to sink, and all members perished.&lt;ref name="Faith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5259669&amp;ct=9353535 |title=Did faith drive Titanic musicians? |author=Joey Butler |publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]] |accessdate=2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420005228/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5259669&amp;ct=9353535 |archivedate=20 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much speculation about what their last song was.&lt;ref&gt;Barczewski (2006: 132)&lt;/ref&gt; A first-class Canadian passenger, Mrs. Vera Dick, and several other passengers, alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn "[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/titanic.htm|title=Titanic Conspiracies|date=2017-10-06|work=Titanic Conspiracies {{!}} Stuff They Don't Want You to Know|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship, "Nearer, My God, to Thee" would be one of the songs he would play.&lt;ref name="Barczewski 2006: 133-134"&gt;Barczewski (2006: 133–134)&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Walter Lord]]'s book ''[[A Night to Remember (book)|A Night to Remember]]'' popularised wireless operator [[Harold Bride]]'s 1912 account (''New York Times'') that he heard the song "[[Autumn]]" before the ship sank.&lt;ref name="Songe d’Automne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5259669&amp;ct=9353535 |title=Did faith drive Titanic musicians? |author=Joey Butler |publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]] |quote="It’s more likely that they played a French waltz called ‘Songe d’Automne.’ The most reliable accounts I’ve heard mention that song," Gowan said. "[[Wallace Hartley]] once told a friend that if he was on a ship going down, the best thing he could do would be to play a hymn like 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,’" Turner said. "One of the most convincing accounts I read, by one of the sailors, was that at the end, there was a lone violinist playing ‘Nearer, My God, to Thee.’ I suspect that was Wallace Hartley." |accessdate=2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420005228/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5259669&amp;ct=9353535 |archivedate=20 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as "Autumn" or the tune of the then-popular waltz "[[Songe d'Automne]]" but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band.&lt;ref name="Barczewski 2006: 133-134"/&gt; Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band, as he floated off the deck before the ship went down. Some consider his statement to be reliable. Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20&amp;nbsp;minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band's final moments. The notion that the band played "Nearer, My God, to Thee" as a [[swan song]] is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of {{SS|Valencia}}, which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick's recollection.&lt;ref name = "The Myth of the Titanic"/&gt;

There are three, very different versions of the hymn using the lyrics of "Nearer, My God, to Thee": ''Horbury'', written in 1861 by the Rev John Dykes was popular in Britain, and another, ''Bethany'', written in 1856 by Dr Lowell Mason was popular in the U.S. The third tune associated with the hymn was ''Propior Deo'', was written by Sir Arthur Sullivan and was also popular in Britain.&lt;ref name=Richards/&gt; Additionally, the British melody might sound like the other [[hymn]] ("Autumn").&lt;ref name="Barczewski 2006: 133-134"/&gt; On 24 May 1912, the seven chief London orchestras performed at a memorial for the musicians who perished, as they played ''Horbury'', two ''Titanic'' survivors in the audience became emotional and stated that this was the tune they heard while they were in their lifeboat. The film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'' (1958) uses the tune ''Horbury''; while the 1953 film ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'', with Clifton Webb, uses the tune ''Bethany'' as does [[James Cameron]]'s 1997 ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]].'' To further complicate things, ''Horbury'' was the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] version of the hymn, while ''Propior Deo'' was the [[Methodism|Methodist]] version. The ''Titanic''{{'}}s bandmaster, Wallace Hartley was a devout Methodist and son of a Methodist choirmaster leading a band containing several devout Methodists. ''Propior Deo'' was not only sung at Hartley's funeral but was also carved into his headstone.&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=Imperialism and Music: Britain, 1876–1953|date=2001|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719061431|pages=395–398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, another possibility has been raised. Among items left behind by Hartley's fiancée, Maria Robinson, was the sheet music of a third tune to the hymn written by Lewis Carey in 1902 and made popular by the Australian contralto Ada Crossley. As Crossley performed in both Britain and America, it is possible that this may have been a tune known to passengers on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Turner, ''The Band That Played On'' Thomas Nelson, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel [[Archibald Gracie IV|Archibald Gracie]], an amateur historian who was aboard the ship until the final moments, and was later rescued on a capsized collapsible lifeboat, wrote his account immediately after the sinking but died from his injuries eight months later. According to Gracie, the tunes played by the band were "cheerful" but that he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played "Nearer, My God, to Thee" as claimed in the newspaper, "I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death to us all and one likely to create panic."&lt;ref name="Gracie"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gracie | first = Archibald | year = 2009 | title = Titanic: A Survivor's Story | publisher = The History Press | isbn = 978-0-7509-4702-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The stories of W.T. Stead ==
{{Main|William Thomas Stead}}
Another oft-cited ''Titanic'' legend concerns perished first-class passenger [[William Thomas Stead]]. According to this folklore, Stead had, through [[precognition|precognitive]] [[insight]], foreseen his own death on the ''Titanic''. This is apparently suggested in two fictional sinking stories, which he penned decades earlier. The first, [[How the Mail Steamer went down in Mid Atlantic by a Survivor|"How the Mail Steamer Went Down in Mid-Atlantic, by a Survivor" (1886)]], tells of a mail steamer's collision with another ship, resulting in high loss of life due to lack of lifeboats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/pmg/steamer.php |title=How the Mail Steamer Went Down in Mid-Atlantic, by a Survivor |author=W.T. Stead |date=22 March 1886 |work=[[Pall Mall Gazette]] |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, "From the Old World to the New" (1892) features a [[White Star Line]] vessel, ''[[SS Majestic (1890)|Majestic]]'', that rescues survivors of another ship that had collided with an [[iceberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=From the Old World to the New |url= http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/reviews/oldworld.php |author=W.T. Stead |work=[[The Review of Reviews]] |date=December 1892 |accessdate =25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mystery ship ==
Some believe that there was another ship, the Norwegian [[Seal hunting|sealer]] ''Samson'', in the vicinity of ''Titanic'' when she sank. Proponents of the theory argue either that the ''Samson'' was a third ship in the area the night of the sinking, in addition to the ''Titanic'' and the [[SS Californian|''Californian'']], or that the ''Californian'' was not near at all and it was the ''Samson'' which ''Titanic'' passengers spotted in the distance while the ship was sinking. Advocates of [[Stanley Lord|Captain Lord]]'s innocence have avidly adopted the latter theory, beginning with Leslie Harrison, the general secretary of the Mercantile Marine Association in the 1960's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-ships/samson.html| title=Samson| publisher=encyclopedia-titanica.org| access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ken Ringle"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/30/the-ship-that-passed-in-the-night/70e7a51e-c170-4b2e-8364-6cbed909e303/| title=The SHIP THAT PASSED IN THE NIGHT| author=Ken Ringle| publisher=Washington Post| date=1991-06-30| access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The root of this claim comes from the testimony of one of the ''Samson'''s officers, Hendrik Bergethon Naess, who told a Norwegian newspaper in 1912 that his ship had been near a large liner with "many lights" shooting rockets into the sky the morning of April 15th.&lt;ref name="Ken Ringle"/&gt; Because the ''Samson'' was seal hunting illegally in territorial waters, the ship's officers decided to move on quickly to avoid detection. This claim seems unlikely as the Titanic was 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, well beyond territorial waters in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;owlcation.com/humanities/Where-Did-the-Titanic-Sink&lt;/ref&gt; The ship had no radio, so they wouldn't have received any of the ''Titanic''{{'}}s distress signals. Naess claimed that the crew only became aware of the ''Titanic''{{'}}s sinking after they arrived in [[Isafjordur, Iceland]] in mid-May. If correct, the coordinates of ''Samson'' place her within 10 miles of ''Titanic''{{'}}s position as the ship was sinking. .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/ship/195/&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanic historians have pointed to numerous inconsistencies in Neass' four published accounts. He cited the ''Samson'' as returning from seal-hunting south of [[Cape Hatteras]] ([[North Carolina]]), which is more than a thousand miles away from the cold waters of the [[Arctic circle]] where seals live. The ''Titanic'' historian Leslie Reade obtained [[microfilm]]ed ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' records reporting that the ''Samson'' docked in Isafjordur twice that April: on the 6th and the 20th, then on the 15th of May. The April dates would not have allowed anywhere near enough time for the ''Samson'' to be in the vicinity of the ''Titanic'' on April 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Leslie | last=Reade | title=The Ship That Stood Still: The ''Californian'' and Her Mysterious Role in the ''Titanic'' Disaster | publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co Inc |date=September 1993 | isbn=978-0-393-03537-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Lee | title=The Titanic and the Indifferent Stranger | page=237 | publisher=Dr Paul Lee | date=June 27, 2009 | isbn=978-0-9563015-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the idea that the crew of the ''Californian'' spotted the ''Sampson'' instead of ''Titanic'' is illogical since their descriptions are of a large steamer, not a small [[schooner]] like ''Samson''. And finally, no other crew member from the ''Samson'' ever gave testimony supporting Naess' claim.&lt;ref name="Ken Ringle"/&gt;

Defenders of the ''Samson'' theory argue that Neass said Cape Hatteras when he meant they were south of [[Cape Race, Newfoundland]], seal-fishing waters which are physically very close to the site of ''Titanic''{{'}}s sinking. They argue that the Lloyd's Register dates of arrival in April are invalid because they were merely the ''expected'' arrival dates of the ''Samson'', which did not dock until the mid-May date. Such theories have been dismissed by ''Titanic'' historians including Leslie Reade, [[Walter Lord]] and Edward DeGroot.&lt;ref name="Ken Ringle"/&gt;

==The ''Titanic'' curse==

When ''Titanic'' sank, claims were made that a curse existed on the ship. The press quickly linked "the ''Titanic'' curse" with the [[White Star Line]] practice of not [[Ship naming and launching|christening]] their ships.&lt;ref name = "The Myth of the Titanic"/&gt;

One of the most widely spread legends linked directly into the [[sectarianism]] of the city of [[Belfast]], where the ship was built. It was suggested that the ship was given the number 390904 which, when reflected, resembles the letters "NOPOPE", a sectarian slogan attacking Roman Catholics, used by extreme Protestants in [[Northern Ireland]], where the ship was built. In the extreme sectarianism of the region at the time, the ship's sinking was alleged to be on account of anti-Catholicism by her manufacturers, the Harland and Wolff company, which had an almost exclusively Protestant workforce and an alleged record of hostility towards Catholics (Harland and Wolff did have a record of hiring few Catholics; whether that was through policy or because the company's shipyard in Belfast's bay was located in almost exclusively Protestant East Belfast—through which few Catholics would travel—or a mixture of both, is a matter of dispute). In fact, RMS ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' were assigned the yard numbers 400 and 401 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton: Haas (1996: 56)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/mystery-titanic-central-propeller.html |title=The mystery of Titanic's central propeller |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=8 January 2009 |author=Mark Chirnside}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary foreshadowing of the disaster==
At the time the ''Titanic'' sank, the 1 May 1912 issue of ''[[The Popular Magazine]]'', an American [[pulp magazine]], was on the news stands. It contained the short story "The White Ghost of Disaster," which described the collision of an ocean liner with an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean, the sinking of the vessel, and the fate of the passengers. The story, by [[Mayn Clew Garnett]] (the pseudonym of sea-story author [[T. Jenkins Hains]]), created a minor sensation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ocean: 100th Anniversary Collection'', Off-Trail Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. ''When You Were a Tadpole and I Was a Fish'', Hill and Wang, 2009. See Chapter 8. Was the Sinking if the ''Titanic'' Foretold?&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, fourteen years prior to the ''Titanic'' disaster,
[[Morgan Robertson]] wrote a book called ''[[Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan]]''. This story features an enormous British [[passenger liner]] called the ''Titan'', which, deemed to be unsinkable, carries insufficient lifeboats. On a voyage in the month of April, the ''Titan'' hits an [[iceberg]] and sinks in the North Atlantic with the loss of almost everyone on board. There are some similarities between the fictional sinking of the ''Titan'' and the real-life sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Paul ''et alia'' (1986). ''The Hayes book of mysteries: the strange, the bizarre, and the unexplained ''. Penworthy Pub. Co., p. 13. {{ISBN|0-87617-024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the German ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'' newspaper published a book in serial form that ran from January 9 until April 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gerhart Hauptmann und der Film |first=Sigfrid |last=Hoefert |publisher=Erich Schmidt Verlag |year=1996 |language=German |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gespräche und Interviews mit Gerhart Hauptmann |first=Gerhart |last=Hauptmann |page=51 |language=German |publisher=Erich Schmidt Verlag |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work of fiction was written by [[Gerhard Hauptmann]], who would receive the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hauptmann|first=Gerhart|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1912|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1912/press.html#|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month before the fateful April maiden voyage of the RMS ''Titanic'', the story was published by [[S. Fischer Verlag]] as the novel ''Atlantis''. ''Atlantis'' is a romantic tale set aboard the fictitious ocean liner ''Roland'', which is coincidentally doomed to a fate very similar to that of the RMS ''Titanic''. This perceived anticipation of the ''Titanic'' disaster received considerable attention at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Gerhart Hauptmann |first=Warren |last=Maurer |page=76 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |date=October 1992 |isbn=978-0-87249-823-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[List of Danish films: Pre 1920|Danish silent film]] also titled ''[[Atlantis (1913 film)|Atlantis]]'' was produced by [[Nordisk Film]] based on the novel. The film was released less than a year following the actual tragic event. The association became evident, and it was banned in Norway, perceived as being in "bad taste".&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, Sune Christian, [http://www.teponia.dk/museumsposten/index.php?artikelid=128 ''The Titanic Myth''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209162405/http://www.teponia.dk/museumsposten/index.php?artikelid=128 |date= 9 February 2012}}, Post &amp; Tele Museum of Denmark, 3rd quarterly, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], '''Meditrinalia''' was a now obscure [[Roman festival|festival]] celebrated on October 11 in honor of the new [[vintage]], which was offered as [[libation]]s to the gods for the first time each year&lt;ref&gt;https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/meditrinalia-e728370&lt;/ref&gt;. The festival may have been so called from ''medendo'', because the Romans then began to drink new [[wine]], which they mixed with old and which served them instead of physic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/Meditrinalia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Little information about the Meditrinalia survived from early Roman religion, although the tradition itself did. It was known to be somehow connected to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and to have been an important ceremony in early agricultural [[Rome]], but beyond that, only speculation exists.

'''Meditrina''' was a Roman goddess who seems to have been a late Roman invention to account for the origin of Meditrinalia&lt;ref&gt;https://journeyingtothegoddess.wordpress.com/tag/meditrinalia-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;. The earliest account of associating the Meditrinalia with such a goddess was by 2nd century grammarian [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], on the basis of which she is asserted by modern sources to be the Roman goddess of health, longevity and wine, with an etymological meaning of "healer" suggested by some.

The '''NASCAR Pinty's Series''' ({{lang-fr|Série NASCAR Pinty's}}), commonly abbreviated as '''NPS''', is a national [[NASCAR]] racing series in [[Canada]], with one race in the [[United States]] starting in 2018, that derives from the old [[CASCAR Super Series]] which was founded in 1981.

==History==
[[NASCAR]] announced in September 2006 the purchase of the [[CASCAR Super Series]],&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/sports/060912/s0912100.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130110120645/http://www.cbc.ca/cp/sports/060912/s0912100.html|deadurl=yes|title=Sorry - we can't find that page|author=|date=10 January 2013|archivedate=10 January 2013|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top stock-car racing series at the time. At the same time, they announced a long-term sponsorship agreement with [[Canadian Tire]]  as the title sponsor. They also introduced a television contract was signed with [[The Sports Network|TSN]] to carry all events as inked with select races being aired live.
Three of the series races, [[Edmonton]], [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], had crowds in excess of 50,000 fans.

The [[2007 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series|2007 season]] was the inaugural season for the Series with the first event being held on May 26, 2007 at Cayuga Motor Speedway and [[Don Thomson Jr.]] won in a spirited battle for the first series win. [[Andrew Ranger]], in his first year of stock-car competition, won the second race at [[Mosport International Raceway]]. He took over the lead in the point standings after that event and never relinquished it on his way to the first championship. The first season saw five races decided on last lap passes.[[File:Nascar Canadian Tire Series Chaudiere.jpg|thumb|NASCAR Pinty's Series cars at [[Autodrome Chaudiere]] in 2015|left]]The second season, the [[2008 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series|2008 season]], featured [[Scott Steckly]] who dominated many events. He won three of the first four events of the year and held the lead in the driver championship point standings all season long. He set a series record with four victories throughout the year.

The [[2009 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series|third season]] had [[Andrew Ranger]] taking center stage by winning his second series championship in three seasons. He completed his transition from the open-wheel racing world by incorporating his road courses experience with a strong performances on the oval tracks. On the season, he won a single-season series record six races—three on road courses and three on ovals.

The [[2010 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series|2010 season]] belonged to [[D.J. Kennington]]. He won his first series title on the power of five wins, nine top fives and 11 top-10 finishes. Kennington battled [[JR Fitzpatrick]] for the points lead all season long as the two exchanged the top spot an unprecedented five times. Kennington also finished second to fellow Pinty's Series competitor [[Jason Bowles]] in the [[Toyota All-Star Showdown]].

[[File:DJ Kennington in Toronto 2010.jpg|thumb|[[D.J. Kennington's]] car]]

In [[2011 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series|2011]], Scott Steckly had a strong season where he won three events and finish in the runner up position four times on his way to capture his second championship over [[D.J. Kennington]] who had a pair of wins. Long time road racer Robin Buck and Rookie [[Peter Shepherd (racing driver)|Peter Shepherd]]  won their first events respectively. [[Andrew Ranger]] won the two biggest events of the year in dominant fashion at Montreal and Toronto. Former champion [[Don Thomson Jr.]] retired after a lengthy career.

In [[2012 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series|2012]], [[D.J. Kennington]] won a record seven events including five consecutively during the summer. Kennington would win his 2nd championship in 3 years. He faced competition from runners up J.R.

On February 17, 2015, Canadian Tire announced it would not renew their sponsorship of the series after the [[2015 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series season|2015 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pappone|first=Jeff|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/news/motorsports/canadian-tire-looking-to-end-partnership-with-canadian-nascar-series/article23023894/|title=Canadian Tire ending partnership with Canadian NASCAR series|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=February 17, 2015|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, NASCAR and Pinty's Delicious Foods Inc. announced a six-year agreement to sponsor the series beginning with the [[2016 NASCAR Pinty's Series|2016 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hometracks.nascar.com/ncats/story/pintys-sponsor-canadian-series_12072015|title = Pinty's To Sponsor Canadian Series|date = December 7, 2015|accessdate = December 7, 2015|publisher = NASCAR Media Group|website = NASCAR.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASCAR Pinty's Series contains drivers with many different agendas and backgrounds. Veteran Canadian drivers compete in the series on part-time basis for fun while maintaining full-time careers, while others are serious championship contenders. Recent years, a NASCAR regional series driver from the United States will often run in the races to gain experience and with NASCAR's specification engine rule, gain more experience running with the said engine, such as [[Cale Gale]], [[Jason Bowles]], [[Timmy Hill]], [[Tony Stewart]], [[Dave Blaney]] and [[Austin Dillon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racingnewsnetwork.com/2012/09/21/nascar-canadian-tiremax-papis-scheduled-to-race-season-finale/|title=NASCAR CANADIAN TIRE: Max Papis Scheduled To Race Season Finale - Racing News|author=|date=21 September 2012|website=racingnewsnetwork.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers with open-wheel and road racing back grounds have also attempted races including, [[Jacques Villeneuve]], [[Max Papis]], [[Alex Tagliani]], [[Jean-François Dumoulin]] and [[Patrick Carpentier]]. Even former [[National Hockey League]] player [[Patrice Brisebois]] runs in the major events which now feature over 40 cars.

In 2011 at [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] a record three female drivers [[Maryeve Dufault]], Caitlin Johnston and Isabelle Tremblay attempted the event, female drivers make up a good portion of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/974939/-r-e-p-e-a-t-isabelle-tremblay-nascar-canadian-tire-series-driver-media-invitation|title=/R E P E A T -- Isabelle Tremblay, NASCAR Canadian Tire Series driver - Media invitation/|author=|date=|website=www.newswire.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is a development or feeder series for NASCAR's top national touring divisions. Driver like Fitzpatrick, Kennington, Ranger, Steckly and Thomson Jr. have competed in the [[Xfinity Series]], while [[Pierre Bourque (racing driver)|Pierre Bourque]] and [[Derek White (racing driver)|Derek White]] have raced in the [[Camping World Truck Series]]. Ranger finished third in the 2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series event in Montreal after having a spirited battle with eventual race winner [[Carl Edwards]] for much of the race. He competed in the 2011 [[Sprint Cup Series]] event at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] for [[FAS Lane Racing]] finishing 35th suffering from transmission failure.

A gradual implementation of both competition and safety-based modifications have been made to the cars used in the [[CASCAR Super Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cascar.com/about.html About at cascar.com], Retrieved July 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These have included a move to a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] 9.5" tire, the same size that is used in all NASCAR stock-car series, on-dash [[electrical]] and [[ignition system|ignition]] systems, in-car fire suppression equipment and increased fuel cell protection. In 2009, the option of utilizing the NASCAR spec engine program was introduced. The cars uses steel tube-framed [[Silhouette racing car|silhouette]] [[stock car racing|stock]] cars powered by carbureted V8 engines. The cars have a relatively high minimum weight, so development of lightweight components is minimal. A number of components are specified by the rules, as parity is given priority over vehicle development. Manufacturer involvement is therefore limited largely to supply arrangements for long-developed [[Automobile engine replacement|crate motors]], and branding on the largely standard bodywork.

The '''National Theatre''' ({{lang-sr|Народно позориште у Суботици}} / ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Narodno Pozorište u Subotici}}''; {{lang-hr|Narodno kazalište u Subotici}}; {{lang-hu|Népszínház}}) is a theater in [[Subotica]], [[Serbia]].

==Reconstruction==
[[File:Pozoriste Subotica - Rekonstrukcija.jpg|thumb|right|250px|National Theatre reconstruction, 2008]]
The original building of the theater, which was built in 1854 as the first monumental public building in Subotica, was razed with the purpose of reconstruction by City authorities in 2007, although it was declared a historic monument under state protection in 1983,{{cn|date=July 2012}} and in 1991 it was added to the National Register as a monument of an extraordinary cultural value.{{cn|date=July 2012}} An international campaign was organized both in Serbia and in Hungary to save the original building.{{cn|date=July 2012}} ICOMOS and INTBAU also protested against the decision, but with no avail.{{cn|date=July 2012}} According to some opinions, the old town center of Subotica was severely damaged visually by this action.{{cn|date=July 2012}} Some scanty remains of the destroyed building will be allegedly incorporated into the new theater.

The '''Nintendo World Championships''' ('''NWC''') is a nationwide [[Electronic sports|video game competition]] video game tournament series, organized  by [[Nintendo of America]].

There have been three Championships. The first was in 1990, touring 30 American cities. It was based on a custom game [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which would historically become one of the most [[Video game collecting|rare and valuable]] NES cartridges. On June 14, 2015, the second Nintendo World Championships event took place for its 25th anniversary as part of Nintendo's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|E3 2015]] coverage. The third edition of the Nintendo World Championships was held on October 7, 2017.

In 2014, Nintendo released ''[[NES Remix|NES Remix 2]]'', featuring the reminiscent ''Nintendo World Championships Remix'', which uses emulation and online [[leaderboards]] to incite informal public competitiveness.

==1990==
Preceding the NWC in 1989 and in 1990, and coinciding with Nintendo's 100th anniversary, Nintendo started its first annual nationwide video game competition series as the Nintendo Challenge Championship (NCC) in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.org/download/Nintendo_Power_Flash_Canada_Issue_05_Summer-Fall_1989/Nintendo_Power_Flash_Canada_Issue_05_Summer-Fall_1989.pdf|title=Nintendo Power Flash Canada Issue 5, 1989|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo assumed full distribution and marketing from its partners and rebranded its competitions as the Nintendo World Championships.

The original Nintendo World Championships began on March 8–11, 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/13/the-story-of-the-first-nintendo-world-championships|title=The Story of the First Nintendo World Championships - IGN|work=[[IGN]]|date=2015-05-13|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/nwc.html|title=The Nintendo World Championships '90|work=AtariHQ|date=1997|accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Fair Park|Fair Park's Automobile Building]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and ended up touring through 30 cities across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/96972011@N00/3042263008/|title=NWC Contestant Information - Flickr - Photo Sharing!|work=[[Flickr]]|date=2008-11-18|accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players from three separate age groups (11 and below, 12–17, and 18 and above) competed across three days. The top two scorers then competed for the title of City Champion. The finalists won a trophy, {{USD|250}}, and a trip for two to the World Finals at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The runners-up won a Nintendo [[Power Pad]] and a [[Game Boy]].

The World Finals were held December 7–9, 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/the-quest-for-the-golden-nintendo-game/2/|title=The quest for the golden Nintendo game - Ars Technica|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=2011-09-12|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-12-07/entertainment/9004110423_1_thor-aackerlund-jeff-falco-video-game-showdown|title=Nintendo`s Powerfest `90 Is The Video Game Olympics - tribunedigital-chicagotribune|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1990-12-07|accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.math.miami.edu/~jam/azure/forum/buzz/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=6;t=000426;p=|title=The Azure Heights Forum: Nintendo World Championships 1990|work=[[University of Miami|Miami.edu]]|date=2000-12-07|accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted similarly to the City Championships and were located at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, California within the Star Trek Theater, now [[Shrek 4-D]]. There, contestants played a special Nintendo World Championships cartridge for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  The cartridge contains three customized minigames based upon the popular games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Rad Racer]]'', and ''[[Tetris]]''. The objective is to achieve a high score according to a custom cumulative scoring formula across all games, within a total time limit of 6 minutes and 21 seconds.&lt;ref name="MGspecs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nintendo World Championships 1990 for NES |publisher=MobyGames.com |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-world-championships-1990 |date=September 16, 2005 |accessdate=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three 1990 World Champion titles were given. Jeff Hansen won in the 11 and under category, Thor Aackerlund won in the 12–17 category, and Robert Whiteman won in the 18 and older category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Scan of official contestant information flyer | publisher = Bob Whiteman | date = October 18, 2008 | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/96972011@N00/3042263008/ | accessdate = October 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no official competition round to crown a single winner. However, after the competition ended there was an informal face-off between the three winners, with Thor Aackerlund taking first place, Jeff Hansen taking second, and Robert Whiteman finishing third.

The top winner in each age category were awarded a $10,000 U.S. [[savings bond]], a new 1990 [[Geo Metro]] Convertible, a 40" [[Rear-projection television]], and a gold painted [[Mario]] trophy. Runners up in each age category received a $1,000 U.S. savings bond and a silver Mario trophy.

Thor Aackerlund later became the official games spokesperson for [[Camerica|Camerica Corporation]], a direct competitor to Nintendo, immediately after winning the Nintendo World Championship. Jeff Hansen later became the United States representative to Japan to win the World Championship title in Tokyo, Japan, and again in Las Vegas at a rematch with the Japanese champion, Yuichi Suyama.

===Cartridge===
The Nintendo World Championships competition was based on a custom NES [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] by the same name.  Ninety copies exist as the official gray cartridge, given to finalists after the championships concluded. Another twenty-six copies exist in gold, like ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' cartridge, and were given as prizes in a separate contest held by ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo World Championships 1990|publisher=AtariHQ.com|url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/nes/nwc/nwc.html|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playing with Power|last=Theobald|first=Phil|publisher=PlayerOnePodcast.com|date=March 7, 2009|url=http://www.playeronepodcast.com/2009/03/07/playing-with-power|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nintendo World Championships'' game cartridge is considered to be the most [[Video game collecting|valuable]] NES cartridge ever released and one of the rarest, with collectors having been paid more than {{USD|15000}} per copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital Press Mini Rarity Guide|year=2005 |publisher=Messiah Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racketboy.com.

[[File:Super Mario Maker - Nintendo World Championships Screenshot.jpg|thumb|A screenshot of [[Narcissa Wright]]'s run through a level in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', during the final of the 2015 Nintendo World Championships.]]
On May 13, 2015, Nintendo announced the return of Nintendo World Championships for the event's 25th anniversary, as part of the company's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|E3 2015]] coverage.&lt;ref name="NWC2015 E3 Nintendo"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo World Championships headline Nintendo's expanded lineup at E3 2015 | date=May 13, 2015 | publisher=Nintendo | url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/HNLBx_g_7fGRPfyY9JIRrCTTXrcpQ1ev | accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualifying competitions began on May 30 in eight [[Best Buy]] locations across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nintendo-world-championships-headline-nintendos-expanded-lineup-at-e3-2015-2015-05-13|title=Nintendo World Championships Headline Nintendo's Expanded Lineup at E3 2015|work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At each location, contestants competed for the high score in ''[[Ultimate NES Remix]]''. The winners from each of these eight locations, plus eight players invited by Nintendo, became the contestants for the final event.&lt;ref name="NWC announce"&gt;{{cite av media | title=Nintendo World Championships - Announcing More Details! | publisher=Nintendo | date=June 9, 2015 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccqyFfhMv20 | accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The live video of the Championship's final event was streamed online from Los Angeles on June 14, 2015.&lt;ref name="NWC2015 stream"&gt;{{cite av media | title=Nintendo World Championships 2015 | publisher=Nintendo | date=June 14, 2015 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9H8VcU21j4 | accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualifying games were ''[[Splatoon]]'' ([[Wii U]]), ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' ([[NES]]), ''[[Metroid Prime: Federation Force]]'' ([[3DS]]), ''[[Super Metroid]]'' ([[SNES]]), ''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' (Wii U), ''[[Balloon Fight]]'' (NES), and ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'' (Wii U). 

The final contest consisted of custom levels within the then unreleased ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' (Wii U), played by the two finalists: [[John Numbers]] and professional [[speedrun|speedrunner]] [[Narcissa Wright]] (then known as Cosmo Wright). In the first two levels the players were alternately blindfolded while the other played. The player who completed the levels the fastest would receive a 5-second advantage in the final level. In the final level they then raced simultaneously to the end, where John Numbers won the championship title.  Gamesradar said that Numbers demonstrated "impulsive mastery" of the ''Super Mario Maker'' levels which were "hellish", "sadistic", "evil", and "truly weird".&lt;ref name="NWC2015 Gamesradar review"/&gt; [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] made a surprise appearance to present a trophy to the winner, and an autographed [[New Nintendo 3DS|New Nintendo 3DS XL]] system to each of the two finalists.&lt;ref name="NWC2015 at IGN"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo World Championships 2015 Winner is John Numbers | publisher=IGN | first=Alex | last=Osborn | date=June 15, 2015 | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/15/nintendo-world-championships-2015-winner-is-john-numbers | accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NWC2015 at Polygon"&gt;{{cite web | title=John Numbers wins Nintendo World Championships 2015 | date=June 14, 2015 | first=Matt | last=Leone | url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/14/8779431/john-numbers-wins-nintendo-world-championships-2015 | accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017==
On August 8, 2017, Nintendo of America announced the return of the Nintendo World Championships. Qualifying rounds took place August 19, 2017 through September 10, 2017 at selected [[Best Buy]] locations across eight cities in the United States. John Numbers, the returning champion of 2015, was one of the 13-and-older qualifiers.&lt;ref name="nwc-homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwc.nintendo.com/|title=Nintendo World Championships 2017 – Official Site| deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007024110/https://nwc.nintendo.com/ | archivedate=October 7, 2017 | date=October 7, 2017|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main event was held on October 7, 2017 at the [[Manhattan Center]]'s Grand Ballroom, and was streamed online via [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch.tv]], as well as being simulcast on [[Disney XD]]'s "D|XP" block. It used an [[elimination tournament]] format with a [[repechage]] bracket named the Underground, with competition based on a wide history of Nintendo's game library since the 1980s. This includes select gameplay modes and levels from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'' ([[Nintendo Switch|Switch]]/[[Wii U]], 2017), ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'', ''[[Metroid: Samus Returns]]'' ([[3DS]], 2017), ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'' (Switch, 2017), ''[[Splatoon 2]]'' (Switch, 2017), ''[[Balloon Fight]]'' ([[NES]], 1985), and other games for those consoles and for [[Nintendo 64]], [[Wii]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[Game Boy]].

The overall winner was Thomas G, who defeated the 2015 champion John Numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NintendoVS/status/916839289920487424|title=Congratulations to Thomas G., your #NWC2017 champion! 🏆|website=Twitter|accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

'''Online child abuse''' is a unique form of [[child abuse]] due to its virtual, distanced, and anonymous nature. Such abuse may not happen face-to-face, nor does it necessarily require physical contact. However, online abuse can result in negative face-to-face consequences in the form of [[statutory rape]], forcible [[sexual assault]], [[harassment]], etc.&lt;ref name="Janis Wolak"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Janis Wolak, David Finkelhor, Kimberly J.

Online abuse of children can occur through a variety of forms including, but not limited to [[cyber-bullying]], [[Child grooming|grooming]], and [[sexual abuse]]. Such abuse requires the use of the [[World Wide Web]] or cellphones, increasing its significance in an increasingly technological world.&lt;ref name="NSPCC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online abuse|url=https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/online-abuse/|website=NSPCC|publisher=National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator of such online abuse may be a stranger or someone who is previously known by the victim.&lt;ref name="NSPCC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online abuse|url=https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/online-abuse/|website=NSPCC|publisher=National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A report by the Data &amp; Society Research Institute and the Center for Innovative Public Health Research showed that 72% of U.S. Internet users have witnessed some form of online harassment or abuse, while 47% have personally experienced it. This study found no distinction between genders with respect to harassment, but deduced that women were at risk for a wider variety of online abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New report shows the reach of online harassment, digital abuse, and cyberstalking|url=https://datasociety.net/blog/2016/11/21/online-harassment/|website=Data&amp;Society|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=September 2018|Why cite general figures in the lead which include adults when the subject is child abuse?}}

Governments across the world have acknowledged the importance of recognizing and combating online abuse of children.{{citation needed lead|date=September 2018}} In the United States this effort is led by the [[Internet Crimes Against Children|Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force]]. This task force consists of 61 individual task forces engaging with 4,500 federal, state, and local law-enforcement agencies all with the goal of combating online abuse of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAC TASK FORCE PROGRAM|url=https://www.icactaskforce.org/about-us|website=iCAC|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyber-bullying ==
{{main|Cyber-bullying}}
                                         
Cyber-bullying, or Internet bullying, occurs when an individual or group electronically distributes negative, false, or otherwise harmful content about an individual or group using personal or private information that causes humiliation or distress to that individual.&lt;ref name="What is Cyber-bullying" &gt;{{cite web|title=What is Cyberbullying|url=https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/index.html|website=stopbullying.gov|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber-bullying can happen through the use of any device that is able to connect to the Internet (desktop, mobile devices, gaming devices, etc.) of cellphones and does not require the perpetrator to be in the same vicinity of the victim.&lt;ref name="What is Cyber-bullying" &gt;{{cite web|title=What is Cyberbullying|url=https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/index.html|website=stopbullying.gov|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slonje, R., &amp; Smith, P. K. (2008). Cyber-bullying: Another main type of bullying? Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 49(2), 147-154. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9450.2007.00611.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Motivations/&gt;
Cyber-bullying is especially prevalent among children as an extension of bullying within schools.&lt;ref name="ojs.unisa.edu.au"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beran|first1=Tanya|last2=Li|first2=Qing|title=The Relationship between Cyber-bullying and School Bullying|journal=The Journal of Student Well-being|date=31 January 2008|volume=1|issue=2|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/JSW/article/view/172/139|language=en|issn=1835-7806}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian research study found that children who were victims of cyber-bullying and also bullied in school were more likely to bully others over [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref name="ojs.unisa.edu.au"/&gt;

=== Prevalence ===

=== Variation ===

A study in 2011 found three primary reasons for targeting others over the Internet: informal social control, dominance, and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Motivations"&gt;Rafferty, R. S. (2011). ''Motivations behind Cyber Bullying and Online Aggression: Cyber Sanctions, Dominance, and Trolling Online'' (Doctoral dissertation, Ohio University).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Informal social control]] is applying pressure to change another person's behavior. [[Dominance and submission|Dominance]] refers to the attempt(s) of hurting someone, humiliating someone, or gaining access to their personal information (secrets, explicit photos, etc.). Entertainment refers to what is commonly known as [[Internet troll|trolling]]:&lt;ref name=Motivations/&gt; purposefully humiliating, annoying, or bothering someone for the purpose of eliciting an emotional response for the bully's enjoyment.&lt;ref name=Motivations/&gt; Perpetrators of trolling are called ''trolls'', which are a subset of cyberbullies.&lt;ref name=Motivations/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craker, N., &amp; March, E.

====United States====
In the United States, parents are encouraged to monitor their children's online activity and deal with cyber-bullying appropriately. If cyber-bullying involves sexual content or [[sexting]], however, the cyberbully and their parents can also be subject to legal consequences, including being registered as sexual offenders.&lt;ref name="Cyber-bullying Stats"/&gt; Cyber-bullying that does not involve explicit sexual content can be more difficult to prosecute because there are no federal laws directly protecting children from direct forms of cyber-bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCallion |first1= Gail |title= Student Bullying: Overview of Research, Federal Initiatives, and Legal Issues |journal= Congressional Research Service |date=2013 |url= http://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.crs/crsmthaacar0001&amp;i=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of cyber-bullying are difficult to pursue in the United States due to infringement on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment rights]] (i.e.: freedom of speech).&lt;ref name="Donegan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Donegan |first1=R |title= Bullying and Cyber-bullying: History, Statistics, Law, Prevention and Analysis |journal= The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi= 10.15417/1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. schools can take action on incidents that occur outside of school if there is either a clear 'disruption to the educational process' or a 'true' threat to one (or more) of the students.&lt;ref name=Donegan/&gt; For an expression to be considered a 'true' threat, the federal court must determine "whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault".&lt;ref name=Donegan/&gt; As cyberbulling is increasingly recognized as a nationwide issue in the United States, whether or not public schools can limit their students' speech outside of school hours is becoming more of an issue.&lt;ref name=Donegan/&gt;&lt;ref name="Motivations" /&gt;

High-profile cases of cyberbullying have been brought to the attention of state and local legislatures, and most U.S. states have implemented laws that ban any online communication that aims to cause humiliation, emotional distress, or fright.&lt;ref&gt;"[Unites States of America v. Lori Drew," 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecution of cyber-bullying cases are usually a combination of civil laws that best fit the nature of each individual case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blanch |first1=Joey |title= Cyber-bullying: How Can United States Attorneys’ Offices Address This Problem in Our Schools and Communities? |journal= The United States Attorneys’ Bulletin |date=2013 |volume=64 |issue=3 |url= https://www.justice.gov/usao/file/851856/download}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states have both anti-bullying laws and policies, save for Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas. Stopbullying.gov, a federal agency tasked with preventing all forms of bullying, has created a detailed list of state laws and policies. An examples of a state anti-bullying campaign is the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center, which provides curriculum to educators about cyber-bullying and its connection to bullying inside of schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Resources for Educators |url= https://www.marccenter.org/educators |website= Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber-bullying was specifically targeted in federal law by the [[Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act|Megan Meier Cyber-bullying Prevention Act]] introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linda|first1=Sanchez,|title=H.R.1966 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Megan Meier Cyber-bullying Prevention Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1966|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|date=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=September 2018|Did the act pass? If not, remove as irrelevant.}} This prevention act sought to:

{{quote|Amend the federal criminal code to impose criminal penalties on anyone who transmits in interstate or foreign commerce a communication intended to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to another person, using electronic means to support severe, repeated, and hostile behavior.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linda|first1=Sanchez,|title=H.R.1966 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Megan Meier Cyber-bullying Prevention Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1966|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|date=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This act was the result of the [[suicide of Megan Meier]] in 2006. Megan was the victim of cyber-bullying by a mother and teen daughter, which resulted in Megan committing suicide in her home in Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=News|first1=A. B.

== Grooming ==
{{main|Child grooming}}

Grooming is a phenomenon that can occur on or offline. The official definition of grooming used by the U.S. Department of Justice is: 
{{quote|a method used by offenders that involves building trust with a child and the adults around a child in an effort to gain access to and time alone with her/him. In extreme cases, offenders may use threats and physical force to sexually assault or abuse a child...
The offender may assume a caring role, befriend the child or even exploit their position of trust and authority to groom the child and/or the child's family. These individuals intentionally build relationships with the adults around a child or seek out a child who is less supervised by adults in her/his life. This increases the likelihood that the offender's time with the child is welcomed and encouraged.&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Daniel|last2=MacIver|first2=Andrea|title=Understanding Sexual Grooming in Child Abuse Cases|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/child_law/resources/child_law_practiceonline/child_law_practice/vol-34/november-2015/understanding-sexual-grooming-in-child-abuse-cases.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The above definition emphasizes the use of the child's family in building trust with the child. When grooming occurs online, however, this is frequently done without the knowledge or compliance of any adult. When children can use the Internet without supervision, there is more room for potential abuse.

Online grooming itself can be driven by a variety of things. Most common is the use of online grooming to build a trusting relationship with a child in order to engage in either online or in-person sexual acts. The Internet is used to lead a child to potential sexual behavior. Grooming can also be used for other forms of exploitation of the child, such as blackmail for monetary gain and more. The two forms may be used in combination, with groomers convincing children to perform these sexual acts, such as the sending of nude photographs, and then blackmailing the victim by threatening to release information about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peachey|first1=Paul|title=Paedophiles blackmail thousands of UK teens into online sex acts|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/paedophiles-blackmail-thousands-of-uk-teens-into-online-sex-acts-8827794.html|website=Independent|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variation ===

Online grooming can occur in a variety of ways. Most commonly, chat rooms or social networks are used to make initial contact with possible victims. Groomers may also use photo-sharing apps, dating apps, or gaming websites to find their victims.&lt;ref name="Childline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Grooming|url=https://www.childline.org.uk/info-advice/bullying-abuse-safety/online-mobile-safety/online-grooming/|website=childline|publisher=NSPCC Weston House|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing an online relationship, the groomer turns conversations to more personal matters, frequently sexual topics.&lt;ref name="Childline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Grooming|url=https://www.childline.org.uk/info-advice/bullying-abuse-safety/online-mobile-safety/online-grooming/|website=childline|publisher=NSPCC Weston House|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groomers may then engage in sexual conversations with their victims, send nude photos or videos, encourage sexual acts on webcam, or persuade the victim to meet in person for sexual acts.&lt;ref name="Childline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Grooming|url=https://www.childline.org.uk/info-advice/bullying-abuse-safety/online-mobile-safety/online-grooming/|website=childline|publisher=NSPCC Weston House|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Groomers are not exclusively strangers. They can be family friends or individuals who have met the child before but primarily use the Internet in order to strengthen that relationship for future exploitation of the child. Individual groomers can be of any sex, gender, or age. Grooming is considered a complicated matter, and groomers may use many tactics. Groomers may use compliments or make promises to the child in order to elicit certain behaviors. Groomers may also assert control over the child to exploit natural sexual curiosity.&lt;ref name="Everyhting you need to know about grooming"&gt;{{cite web|title=Everything You Need to Know about Online Grooming|url=https://nobullying.com/online-grooming/|website=NObullying.com|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, groomers make a fake profile in order to create a persona more likely to be trusted by their possible victims. Such a phenomenon is known as [[catfishing]]. The definition of a catfish is "a person who sets up a false personal profile on a social networking site for fraudulent or deceptive purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=catfish|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catfish|website=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although catfishing is not exclusively used by online groomers, it is a common way in which groomers contact their potential victim and build trust through a more-trustworthy false identity. Catfishing itself is not illegal in the United States, unlike [[identity theft]], but when used as a method for online grooming is considered as the crime of grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Cherry|title=Should "catfishing" be made illegal?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39078201|website=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevalence ===

Grooming and overall online abuse of children is an issue of growing concern in the modern technological era. Victims of online grooming are frequently young teens, with the majority of victims being between the ages of 13 and 15.&lt;ref name="Everyhting you need to know about grooming"&gt;{{cite web|title=Everything You Need to Know about Online Grooming|url=https://nobullying.com/online-grooming/|website=NObullying.com|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 literature review of research in the area conducted by various English scholarly institutions,  it was found that 9% of Internet users aged 10–17 reported unwanted online sexual solicitation or attempted grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Livingstone|first1=Sonia|last2=Davidson|first2=Julia|last3=Bryce|first3=Joanne|last4=Batool|first4=Saqba|title=Children’s online activities, risks and safety|date=October 2017|publisher=London School of Economics|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/business-and-consultancy/consulting/assets/documents/childrens-online-activities-risks-and-safety.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laws ===
{{expand section|date=September 2018}}

====United States====

In the United States, grooming is considered a federal offense. Several federal laws include sections involving grooming. Under section § 2422 of the [[United States Code|United States Criminal Code]]:{{quote|(a) Whoever knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to travel in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. (b) Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years or for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Grooming Law and Legal Definition|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/child-grooming/|website=US Legal|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The U.S. Bar Association claims that this statute "targets the sexual grooming of minors as well as the actual sexual exploitation of them."&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Daniel|last2=MacIver|first2=Andrea|title=Understanding Sexual Grooming in Child Abuse Cases|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/child_law/resources/child_law_practiceonline/child_law_practice/vol-34/november-2015/understanding-sexual-grooming-in-child-abuse-cases.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of grooming's complex nature and the relationship of trust between the groomer and the victim, grooming in and of itself is infrequently left unrecognized. Only when the grooming results in sexual acts between an adult and a minor, the exchange of sexual images, or the extortion of money does it come to the eyes of a court. In the case of Shelly Chartier, the online grooming and resulting crimes were met with jail time. Chartier, through the use of [[catfishing]] both NBA star [[Chris Andersen]] and aspiring model Paris Dunn, groomed 17-year-old Dunn into exchanging nude photos and sexual acts under the false identity of Andersen. She then sent such images to Andersen who was under the impression that he was both receiving these from Dunn herself and that Dunn was not underage. Chartier then extorted money from Andersen, claiming she would reveal his possession of child pornography unless he paid her. Chartier was eventually caught and faced 18 months in prison for various crimes, including, but not limited to, extortion, impersonation, and making threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paparella|first1=Andrew|last2=Balthasar|first2=Marc Dorian Johnathan|last3=Effron|first3=Lauren|title=How this Canadian woman catfished an NBA star and an aspiring model, almost ruining their lives|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/canadian-woman-catfished-nba-star-aspiring-model-ruining/story?id=46778331|website=abc News}}&lt;/ref&gt; State legislatures, such as Illinois, have introduced language that specifically includes electronic or web-based methods of grooming into their laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=720 ILCS 5/ Criminal Code of 2012.|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=072000050HArt%2E+11+Subdiv%2E+25&amp;ActID=1876&amp;ChapterID=53&amp;SeqStart=20100000&amp;SeqEnd=20800000|website=www.ilga.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-govermental advocacy ===

In addition to legislation, there are several non-governmental programs and initiatives aimed at the issue. For example, R.AGE, a Malaysian-based group of journalists, aims to spread information about many important issues, including online safety and the occurrence of online grooming, in the hopes of "telling stories that matter, that make a difference, that hold people accountable, that give a voice to those who don't have one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://rage.com.my/aboutrage/|website=R.AGE|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, Pandora's Protect is a nonprofit organization that aims to provide support to the victims of crimes such as online grooming and assault. In addition, they spread information in order to prevent further assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support and Resources for the Survivors of Rape and Sexual Abuse|url=http://www.pandys.org/|website=Pandora's Project|accessdate= 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual abuse ==
{{main|Sexual abuse}}

Online sexual abuse is a relatively modern trend, in which perpetrators utilize modern forms of technology such as live stream web cameras, cell phones, or social media to coerce targeted victims into inappropriate and sometimes illegal sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child sexual exploitation|url=https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/child-sexual-exploitation/|website=NSPCC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abusers do not discriminate and target victims of every walk of life. Online sexual abuse differs from other forms of sexual abuse in that it can be perpetrated stealthily on a global scale, allowing the offender to evade capture. At the same time, technology offers predators greater opportunities to find the youth that they prey upon.{{contradiction inline|date=September 2018|Do they prey on people from all walks of life or just youths? The subject should be children.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact of online and offline child sexual abuse|url=https://www.nspcc.org.uk/services-and-resources/research-and-resources/2017/impact-online-offline-child-sexual-abuse/|website=NSPCC|publisher=National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are often the targets of online sexual predators who will often bully, emotionally manipulate, blackmail, or befriend willing communicators on the web in order to obtain their desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online abuse|url=https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/online-abuse/|website=NSPCC|publisher=National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online sexual abuse may vary from personal interactions between a victim and offender to a more mechanized process, in which children are sexually exploited for the perpetrators' profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Sexual Exploitation of Children: An Alarming Trend|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/fs/2017/272010.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|publisher=The Office of Website Management, Bureau of Public Affairs|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online sexual predators often target young victims, with a study showing that 13% of children receive negative unwanted attention of a sexual nature on the Internet.&lt;ref name="NSOPW"&gt;{{cite web |title= Facts and Statistics |url= https://www.nsopw.gov/en-US/Education/FactsStatistics?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |website= The U.S. Department of Justice NSOPW |publisher= U.S. Department of Justice |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predators make contact with prospective targets in a variety of settings, although the most prolific place that predators troll is chat rooms, where 76% of known first encounters with online sexual predators occur.&lt;ref name=NSOPW/&gt; Predators troll chat rooms and other forms of social media like MySpace of Facebook, seeking people who outwardly share personal information.&lt;ref name="Janis Wolak"/&gt;

Detection and deterrence of online sexual abuse are difficult because of the anonymous nature of the Internet; however, stopping and detecting an online predator's criminal activity is the task of various government organizations like the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). The FBI's Violent Crimes Against Children Program was specifically created, "...to provide a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive counter to all threats of abuse and exploitation of children" in its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Violent Crimes Against Children Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Violent Crimes Against Children/Online Predators|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/cac|website=FBI.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI accomplishes quick response times by having agents scouring the Internet in search of perpetrators; they ask for information in forums and chat-rooms and look for the telltale signs of abusive behavior in the children they interact with. Online sexual predators, however, are often diffisult to distinguish because they show a misleading representation of themselves to avoid incriminating evidence.&lt;ref name="Violent Crimes Against Children Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Violent Crimes Against Children/Online Predators|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/cac|website=FBI.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than relying completely on authorities to apprehend the perpetrators of online sexual abuse, one may decrease the chances of unwanted and unsolicited advances from online predators by keeping one's intimately private details off of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Janis Wolak"/&gt; Another way to avoid unwanted sexual solicitations is to ignore, block, and report an offender to the website's management staff.&lt;ref name="Janis Wolak"/&gt;

=== Laws ===
{{expand section|date=September 2018}}

====United States====

A variety of laws are in place to deter online criminal activity pertaining to sexual abuse. The ''Federal Criminal Code and Rules'' outlines a variety of rules and regulations regarding sexual abuse under Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1462 titled ''Importation or transportation of obscene matters'', outlines what would be considered transporting obscene material over the Internet. Child pornography violates this law, among others, because under this code, "Any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture, motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matter of indecent character" may be subject to fine or imprisonment of up to five years.&lt;ref name="Title 18"&gt;{{cite web|title=TITLE 18-CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap71-sec1462.pdf|website=www.gpo.gov|publisher=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online sexual offenders who target children may also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 2243 ''Sexual abuse of a minor or ward'' or Section 2251 ''Sexual exploitation of children'' under which they could be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. These sections are outlined as, "...aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward, or sex trafficking of children, or the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography ... not less than 30 years or for life [or can carry] any term years or for life."&lt;ref name="Title 18"&gt;{{cite web|title=TITLE 18-CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap71-sec1462.pdf|website=www.gpo.gov|publisher=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted, any sexual abuse of children, whether online or in person, is subject to strict punishment by law.

=== Examples ===

Online abuse often manifests itself in physical and psychological harm to victims, as previously stated. In recent history, [[Larry Nassar]], a [[USA Gymnastics]] team doctor, was charged with 60 years in federal prison when he pleaded guilty to charges related to receiving child pornography, possessing child pornography, and destroying and concealing evidence relating to child pornography. Prosecutors have stated that a supremely close link between his child pornography activities had directly impacted his repeat, "molestation of children".&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Joseph"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elizabeth Joseph, Ray Sanchez, Eric Levenson|title=Larry Nassar, ex-USA Gymnastics doctor sentenced to 60 years on child porn charges|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/larry-nassar-usa-gymnastics-sentence/index.html|website=www.cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of his child pornography obsession, Nassar had thousands of pictures of underage children.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Joseph"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elizabeth Joseph, Ray Sanchez, Eric Levenson|title=Larry Nassar, ex-USA Gymnastics doctor sentenced to 60 years on child porn charges|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/larry-nassar-usa-gymnastics-sentence/index.html|website=www.cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of this scandal, affecting hundreds of women of a variety of ages, reforms have been made to further combat future occurrences of this abuse by USA Gymnastics and [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Joseph"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elizabeth Joseph, Ray Sanchez, Eric Levenson|title=Larry Nassar, ex-USA Gymnastics doctor sentenced to 60 years on child porn charges|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/larry-nassar-usa-gymnastics-sentence/index.html|website=www.cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also gathering a large following in the wake of this scandal is the [[Me Too movement]].

'''Operation Eagle Pull''' was the [[United States military]] evacuation by air of [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]], on 12 April 1975.&lt;ref name=Final&gt;{{cite web |year=2000 |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/seairland/chap5.htm |title=Chapter 5: The Final Curtain, 1973–1975 |publisher=history.navy.mil |accessdate= 24 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of April 1975, Phnom Penh, one of the last remaining strongholds of the [[Khmer Republic]], was surrounded by the [[Khmer Rouge]] and totally dependent on aerial resupply through [[Pochentong Airport]]. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.

==Strangulation of Phnom Penh==
At the beginning of 1975 the [[Khmer Republic]], a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the [[Mekong River]] that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from [[South Vietnam]]. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the [[Khmer Rouge]] set out to cut off the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked [[Neak Luong]], a key [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack over the {{convert|100|km}} journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit [[naval mine]]s laid by the Khmer Rouge at Phu My approximately {{convert|74|km}} from Phnom Penh. The FANK naval branch, the [[Khmer National Navy]] (MNK), had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or at best extremely costly.&lt;ref name=Dunham&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunham |first=George R |title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Bitter End, 1973–1975 (Marine Corps Vietnam Operational Historical Series)|publisher=Marine Corps Association|year=1990|url=https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd|isbn=978-0-16-026455-9|pages=102–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.&lt;ref name=Shawcross&gt;{{cite book |title=Sideshow Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia |last=Shawcross |first=William |publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited |year=1979 |isbn=0-233-97077-0 |page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line. In future, all supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to [[Pochentong Airport]].&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|105}} The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the [[Case–Church Amendment]],&lt;ref name=Shawcross/&gt;{{rp|347}} [[BirdAir]], a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of [[C-130]] and [[DC-8]] planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|105}}

On 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap, north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in on the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift.  On 1 April the Khmer Rouge overran Neak Luong and Ban-am, the last remaining FANK positions on the Mekong. The Communists could now concentrate all their forces on Phnom Penh.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|105}} Premier [[Lon Nol]] resigned that day and went into exile; the final collapse of the Khmer Republic was imminent.&lt;ref name=Shawcross/&gt;{{rp|358}}

==Planning==
[[File:Map of Operation Eagle Pull evacuation sites.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Operation Eagle Pull evacuation sites showing the Embassy and LZ Hotel]]

The evacuation plan was developed and refined by the US Military as [[Khmer Rouge]] forces closed in on Phnom Penh, starting as early as 1973.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|42}}  On 27 June 1973 the [[Seventh Air Force]] published Contingency Plan 5060C "Eagle Pull" covering the evacuation of Phnom Penh. Conplan 5060C had three options:
*Option 1: the evacuation of Embassy personnel, US citizens and designated Cambodians by regular or chartered civilian airlift from Pochentong Airport.
*Option 2: if Khmer Rouge action forced the cancellation of civilian flights from Pochentong Airport, security police from the 56th Security Police Squadron at [[Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base]] would be flown in to provide security for the evacuation of approximately 600 Embassy personnel, US citizens and designated Cambodians by [[United States Air Force|USAF]] fixed wing aircraft (and [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion|CH-53]] and [[Sikorsky MH-53|HH-53]] helicopters if needed).
*Option 3: if Pochentong was closed to traffic the 56th Security Police Squadron would be landed to secure [[landing zone]]s (LZs) in central Phnom Penh (and other towns if required) for use by CH-53 helicopters of [[21st Special Operations Squadron]] and HH-53 helicopters of the [[40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] with airborne mission command performed by C-130 King aircraft of the [[56th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]].&lt;ref name=Tilford&gt;{{cite book |last=Tilford |first=Earl |title=Search and Rescue in Southeast Asia 1961–1975 |publisher=Office of Air Force History |year=1980 |isbn=978-1-4102-2264-0 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Option 3 was later revised to provide for the use of [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] helicopters together with USAF helicopters and C-130 Airborne Mission Command based in Thailand, and for the ground security force to be made up of marines rather than air force security police. The LZs were to be adjacent to the US Embassy in Phnom Penh.&lt;ref name=Tilford/&gt;{{rp|138}}

On 6 January 1975, [[CINCPAC]] placed the [[31st Marine Expeditionary Unit|31st Marine Amphibious Unit]] on 96-hour alert to move the evacuation fleet into position off Kampong Som (previously [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]]) in the Gulf of Thailand for the implementation of Operation Eagle Pull.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|105}} On 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour cruising radius from Kampong Som. This was further reduced on 28 February to 24 hours, effectively meaning that the fleet had to remain within the [[Gulf of Thailand]].&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|106–107}}

On 21 March the Embassy predicted there would be 3,600 evacuees, far exceeding the original estimate of approximately 400. This necessitated the development of a new evacuation plan whereby Marines would secure Pochentong Airport, while helicopters would ferry evacuees from central Phnom Penh to Pochentong from where they would be flown on C-130 planes to Thailand.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|109}} However, this plan was quickly overtaken by events as the supply C-130s coming into Pochentong were used for evacuees on the return journey, quickly reducing the number of evacuees that would need to be moved in a final evacuation.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|110}}

On 3 April, given the deterioration in the defences around Phnom Penh, Ambassador [[John Gunther Dean]] requested the deployment of the 10-man Operation Eagle Pull command element which landed at Pochentong on a BirdAir C-130 plane.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|110}} The command element supervised the ongoing fixed-wing evacuation of more than 750 Cambodians over the next seven days in the face of 80–90 rounds of 105&amp;nbsp;mm artillery and 107&amp;nbsp;mm rocket fire each day.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|111–12}} By 10 April Khmer Rouge fire had become so heavy that the fixed-wing evacuation was ended.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|112}}

The command group then turned its attention to the selection of helicopter landing zones for the evacuation. As the Khmer Rouge controlled the east bank of the Mekong opposite Phnom Penh, the command group selected LZ Hotel, a soccer field about {{convert|900|m}} north-east of the embassy. Masked from the river by a row of apartment buildings, this LZ could not be interdicted by direct fire weapons, making it the safest location. The embassy staff prepared to leave on 11 April, but the evacuation was delayed until the following day in order to allow {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|6}} to join the evacuation fleet off Kampong Som.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|113}}

==Evacuation fleet==
[[File:Freq% 20Wind% 20and% 20Eagle% 20Pull% 20014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|HMH-462 helicopters and Operation Eagle Pull evacuation fleet]]
On 3 March 1975 [[Amphibious Ready Group Alpha|Amphibious Ready Group Alpha (Task Group 76.4)]], and the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit (Task Group 79.4) embarked and arrived at the designated station off Kampong Som in the Gulf of Thailand, the force comprised:

Task Group 76.4 (Movement Transport Group Alpha)&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|111}}
* {{USS|Okinawa|LPH-3|6}} carrying [[HMH-462]] comprising 14 CH-53, 3 [[CH-46]], 4 [[AH-1J]], and 2 [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois variants|UH-1E]] helicopters&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|106}}
* {{USS|Vancouver|LPD-2|6}}
* {{USS|Thomaston|LSD-28|6}}

* {{USS|Henry B. Wilson|DDG-7|6}}
* {{USS|Knox|FF-1052|6}}
* {{USS|Kirk|FF-1087|6}}

On 17 March the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], concerned that one Marine helicopter squadron was insufficient for the evacuation, ordered that USS ''Hancock'' offload its air wing and proceed to [[Pearl Harbor]]. On 26 March Marine Heavy Lift Helicopter Squadron [[HMH-463]] comprising 25 CH-53, CH-46, AH-1J and UH-1E helicopters embarked on USS ''Hancock'' and it proceeded to [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]].&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|108}} After taking on more helicopters at Subic Bay, USS ''Hancock'' was temporarily assigned to Amphibious Ready Group Bravo, standing by off [[Vung Tau]], South Vietnam, but on 11 April she joined Amphibious Ready Group Alpha in the Gulf of Thailand.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|110}}  The marine evacuation contingent comprised one battalion landing team, [[2nd Battalion 4th Marines|2nd Battalion, 4th Marines]] (2/4).&lt;ref name=Final/&gt;

As the Khmer Rouge had no air force and only limited [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess [[Strela 2|SA-7]] shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with [[ALE-29]] flare dispensers.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|110–111}}

==Evacuation==
On the afternoon of 11 April 1975, the 31st MAU received orders to execute Operation Eagle Pull.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|116}} At 06:00 on 12 April, 12 CH-53s of HMH-462 launched from the deck of USS ''Okinawa'' and then at 10-minute intervals descended again to pick up their marines. Elements of Companies F and H, and the command group embarked from USS ''Okinawa'' while elements of Company G boarded their helicopters on USS ''Vancouver'', giving a total ground security force of 360 Marines. As the helicopters completed loading they formed into groups of three orbiting the task force.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|119}}

At 07:30 Ambassador Dean notified the acting Cambodian Chief of State, Prime Minister [[Long Boret]] and other Cambodian leaders including Prince [[Sisowath Sirik Matak]], that the US personnel would officially leave the country within the next few hours and asked if any desired evacuation, in which case they should be at the embassy by 09:30. All declined except for [[Saukham Khoy]], successor to Lon Nol as President of the Khmer Republic, who left without telling his fellow leaders.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|114}} Prince Sirik Matak, a former Prime Minister and a driving force behind the formation of the Khmer Republic rejected the offer of evacuation and said to Ambassador Dean that "I have committed this mistake of believing in you, the Americans."&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|121}}

The 10 man command group proceeded to drive vehicles to LZ Hotel, purposely disabling them to block vehicle access from any part of the city, other than the road from the Embassy to the LZ.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|114–115}} The command group then proceeded to make contact with ''King Bird'', an orbiting [[HC-130]] plane of the [[56th Rescue Squadron|56th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]], that would control the flow of the helicopters.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|115}}

At 07:43 the first group of helicopters crossed the Cambodian coastline and about one hour later, after traversing {{convert|160|km}} of hostile territory, the initial wave set down on LZ Hotel and the Marines quickly established a defensive perimeter. Large crowds of Cambodians soon gathered, more out of curiosity rather than to interfere. Having established the perimeter defense, the marines began the process of moving the crowds back in order to keep the LZ clear and then began moving the evacuee groups to the waiting CH-53 helicopters. As LZ Hotel could only hold three CH-53s at any time, flights arriving after the initial build-up had to be held at Point Oscar, some {{convert|50|km}} south of Phnom Penh until called in by "King Bird".&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|121}} The evacuation proceeded smoothly although the number of evacuees was substantially less than anticipated. The last estimate indicated there would be 590 evacuees, 146 US nationals and 444 Cambodians and third country nationals. HMH-462 evacuated 84 US nationals and 205 Cambodians and third country nationals.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|121}}

At 09:45, the US Embassy closed.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|121}} There would be no diplomatic relations between the US and Cambodia again until 11 November 1991. By 10:41 all the evacuees including Ambassador Dean and President Saukham Khoy had been lifted out by helicopters of HMH-462. Helicopters of HMH-463 operating from USS ''Hancock'' then began to land to extract the ground security force.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|122}}

At approximately 10:50, 107&amp;nbsp;mm rocket fire began impacting in the vicinity of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 minutes later, the LZ also received 82&amp;nbsp;mm mortar fire. As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers in the zone notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in [[23d Tactical Air Support Squadron]] [[OV-10]]s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|122}} At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left the zone and the last marine helicopter landed on USS ''Okinawa'' at 12:15.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|123}}

At 11:15, two USAF HH-53 [[Super Jolly Green Giant]]s, from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, as scheduled, extracted the Eagle Pull command element.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|122}} Small arms fire during the final extraction caused minimal damage to the first aircraft, but a {{convert|12.7|mm}} machine gun round hit the second helicopter's tail rotor as it climbed out of the zone. Despite severe vibrations the helicopter made it safely back to [[Ubon Air Base]] in Thailand.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|123}} At 14:50 an HMH-462 CH-53 launched from USS ''Okinawa'' to carry Ambassador Dean to [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield|U-Tapao Air Base]] in Thailand.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|123–124}}

On 13 April, the evacuees were flown to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand on HMH-462 helicopters and Amphibious Ready Group Alpha proceeded to the South China Sea to rendezvous with Task Force 76 as it stood by to implement [[Operation Frequent Wind]], the evacuation of Saigon.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|124}}

==Aftermath==
[[Henry Kissinger]] observed in his Vietnam War memoir that the [[Gerald Ford|Ford Administration]] was astonished and shamed by the fact that top Cambodian officials refused to leave the country. These included Premier [[Long Boret]] and [[Lon Non]], the Prime Minister's brother, both of whom were on the Khmer Rouge's advertised death list.&lt;ref&gt;"Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War". ed. Spencer Tucker, s.v. "EAGLE PULL, Operation"&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh bringing the [[Cambodian Civil War]] to an end. Long Boret, Lon Non and other top officials of the Khmer Republic Government were executed at the ''Cercle Sportif'' (ironically now the location of the US Embassy), while FANK troops in the city were disarmed, taken to the [[Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium|Olympic Stadium]] and executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When The War Was Over Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution|last=Becker |first=Elizabeth |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1988 |isbn=1-891620-00-2 |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2/4 Marines and Amphibious Ready Group Alpha, Operation Eagle Pull served as a small-scale dress rehearsal for the more complex Operation Frequent Wind 17 days later.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|124}}

'''Phillip John Lamason''' [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] [[Medal bar|&amp; Bar]] (15 September 1918 – 19 May 2012)  was a [[aviator|pilot]] in the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) during the [[Second World War]], who rose to prominence as the [[Commanding officer|senior officer]] in charge of 168 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airmen taken to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], Germany, in August 1944. Raised in Napier, he joined the RNZAF in September 1940, and by April 1942 was a [[pilot officer]] serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]]. On 8 June 1944, Lamason was in command of a [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] heavy bomber that was shot down during a raid on railway marshalling yards near [[Paris]]. [[Parachute|Bailing out]], he was picked up by members of the [[French Resistance]] and hidden at various locations for seven weeks. While attempting to reach Spain along the [[Comet line]], Lamason was double-crossed by a [[Treason|traitor]] within the Resistance and handed over to the [[Gestapo]].

After [[interrogation]], he was taken to [[Fresnes prison]]. Classified as a "Terrorflieger" (terror flier), he was not accorded [[prisoner-of-war]] (POW) status, but instead treated as a criminal and spy. By 15 August 1944, Lamason was [[Military rank#Field or senior officers|senior officer]] of a group of 168 captured Allied airmen who were taken by train to Buchenwald concentration camp, arriving there five days later.

At Buchenwald, the airmen were fully shaved, [[Starvation|starved]], denied shoes, and for three weeks forced to sleep outside without shelter in one of the sub-camps known as "Little Camp". As senior officer, Lamason took control and instilled a level of [[Military courtesy|military discipline]] and bearing.

For several weeks Lamason negotiated with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly got word to the [[Luftwaffe]] of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled [[Capital punishment|execution]], 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to [[Stalag Luft III]]. Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to [[Dannevirke]] and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at [[KLB Club]] and POW reunions.

==Early career==
Lamason was born and raised in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], a city in New Zealand's [[North Island]], on 15 September 1918.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Thompson, H. L. (1953).

Lamason joined the RNZAF in September 1940. By April 1942, he had been posted to the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre of operations]] as a [[pilot officer]] in [[No. 218 Squadron RAF]]. During a bombing raid on [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], Czechoslovakia, he was in command of an aircraft that was attacked by an enemy fighter and badly damaged, but managed to return to base.  As a result of his actions, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) on 15 May 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19420516.2.60&amp;srpos=2&amp;e Skill and Gallantry].

One night in April, 1942, this officer was the captain of an aircraft which attacked Pilsen. During the return flight his aircraft was attacked by an enemy fighter and sustained damage; the hydraulics were shot away and the turret rendered unserviceable, while a fire broke out in the middle of the fuselage. Displaying great presence of mind, Pilot Officer Lamason coolly directed his crew in the emergency and, while 2 of them dealt with the fire, he skilfully outmanoeuvred his attacker and finally shook him off.

Lamason then instructed the group not to trust the SS, or provoke them in any way because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy.

'''Rajdowe Samochodowe Mistrzostwa Polski''' (RSMP) – the annual series of Polish Rally Championship existing from 1928. Consisting of several rounds on different surfaces throughout Poland. The organizer and owner of the cycle is [[Polski Związek Motorowy]] (PZM). In 2008 the main sponsor of the series is [[Orlen|Orlen oil]] company and its full name is Platinum Rajdowe Samochodowe Mistrzostwa Polski (Platinum Car Rally Championship Polish).

A prerequisite for the start to RSMP is to have a rally license degree "R" or "R co-driver only" (entitles you to take off only as a co-driver). As of 2007, foreign drivers have been allowed to gain points.

== History ==

Rallies in Poland almost always were at a high level of security and organisation ence have moved foreigners. The Second World War stopped high advancement of rallies. After the war Polish Rallies had problems. Just in 60s RSMP launched in high level. Great Polish drivers went to the conquest of Europe and [[Sobiesław Zasada]] has proved to be the best, he won three [[European Rally Championship]] titles (now [[World Rally Championship]]). He imported the latest sports cars, so he dominate of RSMP. In 1975 won title young driver [[Marian Bublewicz]] in [[Fiat 125|Polski Fiat 125p]] from [[Olsztyn]]. Since then RSMP won different drivers: [[Tomasz Ciecierzyński]], [[Włodzimierz Groblewski]], [[Jerzy Landsberg]], [[Błażej Krupa]], [[Maciej Stawowiak]], [[Tomasz Ciecierzyński]].

In 1980s for a title fight Marian Bublewicz and [[Andrzej Koper]]. They imported Japanese sports cars and [[Renault]]. Only in 1987 Bublewicz won championship in [[Polonez 2000]]. so it was amazing. In 1989–1992 Bublewicz had no equal. In 1993 he purchased [[Ford Escort Cosworth]] for next title, but new car was not ready for the first in season [[Rajd Dolnośląski|Zimowy Rajd Dolnośląski]]. He started in hired [[Ford Sierra]]. For unknown reasons, he lost car and hit in tree. Marian Bublewicz died in hospital. Polish fans and PZM were shocked. Bublewicz's fatal crash caused work on security.

In 1990s for title going [[Paweł Przybylski]], [[Krzysztof Hołowczyc]], [[Robert Gryczyński]] and [[Janusz Kulig]]. All the leading drivers have top cars from [[World Rally Championship]] and rivalry was very hard.

In [[physical cosmology]] the '''Quark epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the [[Chronology_of_the_universe#Early_universe|early universe]] when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s. The quark epoch began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]], when the preceding [[electroweak epoch]] ended as the [[electroweak interaction]] separated into the weak interaction and electromagnetism. During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[Lepton|leptons]] and their [[Antiparticle|antiparticles]]. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s. The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons. The following period, when quarks became confined within hadrons, is known as the [[hadron epoch]].

'''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'''&lt;ref&gt;Published in Neunzert 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; is an interactive [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]&lt;ref&gt;Putová 2013, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[performance art|performance artist]] [[Lubo Kristek]] and also a series of his [[happening]]s. The artist started his happening series in 2007 to protest against the addictions to new technologies. He asked the audience to give up their mobile phones and use them to create an assemblage.&lt;ref name="p121"&gt;Putová 2013, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
The first action was held in the city of [[Znojmo]]. The spectators sewed the mobile phones directly on to the artist wearing a jacket with a train (the jacket then became the basis for new assemblage). 

The second happening took place in public area – on the pavement of Mariahilfer Straße in [[Vienna]] in 2007. Kristek who likes to remove the barriers between art and reality, deliberately got with his action in the way of passers-by to pull them out of their stereotype and to force them adopt an attitude. The artist dipped the balerina’s [[pointe shoe]]s into the paint and let her dance on a blank canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Putová 2013, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The pointe shoes also became part of the assemblage afterwards. Then he invited school pupils and passers-by to help to create the new assemblage, to paint and sew more mobile phones on to it. Art and life merged in the [[avant-garde]] sense.

The assemblage travelled to an exhibition at the Barockschloß Riegersburg, today [[Schloss Ruegers]] (2007). The artist continued to travel with his mission to other states. With each happening interaction the assemblage changed its shape.

In 2008, the happening series continued in the Neues Stadtmuseum, [[Landsberg am Lech]]. It was part of the retrospective exhibition of the works by Lubo Kristek titled ''Third Eye of Distant Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Manuela|last=Rieger|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/landsberg/Kunst-zum-Nachdenken-id3697011.html|title=Kunst zum Nachdenken|website=Augsburger Algemeine|publisher=|date=12 May 2008|access-date=16 August 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In the happening a new character appeared, Temptation (played by the prima ballerina of the Brno National Theatre Jana Přibylová), who gives the spectators electronic devices from a pink sack and who suddenly turnes into the devil). In one of the last scenes, this character toys with a representation of human fate – a black figurine – which she throws to the ground as soon as she tires of her plaything. At the end of the happening, Kristek carried the pink sack full of electronic refuse to the altar of the Landsberg Church of the Holy Cross. In this way, he emphasised the sharp contrast between our ancestors´ legacy and what will remain after the current epoch.&lt;ref name="requiem"&gt;Putová 2018, [http://glyptotheque.com/index.php/meeting-point/requiem-for-mobile-telephones Chapter: Meeting place – Requiem for Mobile Telephones]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following happening took place in a Polish city of [[Sucha Beskidzka]]  in 2010. According to Kristek, the relationship of contemporary society to the mobile telephone bears the traits of a [[cult]] or even a pathological dependency. Therefore he places this “modern god” on the altar (with the inscription Rest in Peace) and lets a giant triple-breasted angel to drill it through. The participants of the happening actively contribute to the act of [[sacrifice|sacrificing]] the mobile phones.

{{Quote|The artist destroys the mobiles in the happenings. He disposes of them like refuse, but at the same time, he applies the ritual principle of sacrifice. The participants of the happening then “receive” the destroyed telephone (analogous with the torn up god) or even “consume” it via their reconnection in the creative process (analogous with the resurrection). The characters and spectators sew the mobiles on to the travelling assemblage, and they become co-creators of a work of art with a shape that changes from event to event. So through his message ''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'', Kristek achieves what he foretold in his picture ''The Moss Covered Telephone Call''. He experiments with the involvement of the public in events at he{Clarification}} interface between ritual and theatrical and creative art, with the use of random impulses during a collective creative process and with emphasis on the experiencing of the current moment. He attempts to restore lost communication and transform relations in an alienated “digital society”.&lt;ref name="requiem" /&gt;}}

''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'' belongs to Kristek’s critical assemblages as well as ''Soundproof Aesthetic of Luxuriety'' (1976) that reveals the traps of consume approach and ''In the Prematurely Cloned Age of One Planet'' (2003) that questiones the ethics of current medical science.

'''Sofar Sounds''' (an acronym for ''Songs from a Room'') is a music events [[startup company]], based in [[Shoreditch]], founded in 2009. The company calls itself a global community where guests and artists come together to experience music in an intimate and respectful setting at a secret concert.

{{toc limit|2}}

==History==

{{Advert section|date=October 2018}}
The events started in London in March 2009 by [https://rafe-offer.com/ Rafe Offer], Rocky Start and Dave J. Alexander who went to a [[Friendly Fires]] concert and became annoyed by people talking over the music, gazing into their [[Smartphone]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Secret gigs place the next big thing right into your front room | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/27/secret-gigs-pop-music-prince-batille | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hearing the clanging of beer bottles. As a consequence, they decided to put on their own gig in Alexander's [[North London]] flat and invited eight friends over to listen to him play five songs in his living room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=How Sofar Sounds is redefining the live music scene around the globe | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sofar-sounds-songs-from-a-room-live-music/ | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second gig in London, more people showed up because the word had spread. Soon after, Sofar expanded (mostly by word of mouth) to Paris, New York City, and other cities, arriving in Los Angeles in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How Did a Secret Concert Series With Mostly Unknown Bands Get So Popular? | url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/how-did-a-secret-concert-series-with-mostly-unknown-bands-get-so-popular-7339846 | publisher=[[LA Weekly]] | date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What started as a [[grassroots]] movement in London has eventually grown into a global community. In early 2017, Sofar Sounds claimed that they are putting on about 500 gigs per month in more than 300 cities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fans Flock to Secret Home Concerts | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fans-flock-to-secret-home-concerts-1486574385 | publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==

Typically, three artists perform at each Sofar gig with no "[[opening act|opener]]" and no "[[Headliner (performances)|headliner]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sofarsounds.com/faq "Frequently Asked Questions"] Sofar Sounds (Retrieved 31 May 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt; Performers apply to be considered via a form on the website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sofarsounds.com/about/artists "The best audience in the world"] Sofar Sounds (Retrieved 31 May 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians of all genres as well as [[spoken word]] [[poet]]s, [[comedian]]s and even dancers are welcome to apply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sofarsounds.com/faq "Frequently Asked Questions"] Sofar Sounds (Retrieved 31 May 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt; Local Sofar Sounds lead ambassadors / bookers and their review committees and music scouts curate the evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Are living room concerts the future? | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/38761302/are-living-room-concerts-the-future | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line-up for a concert is not disclosed until the event starts; the location (often a private [[living room]]&lt;ref&gt;http://pitchbook.com/news/search?query=sofar%20sounds&lt;/ref&gt; with an average size of 70 people) is announced 24 hours before the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Modern Concert, Pt. 2: What Is Missing From The Artist-Brand Relationship in Live Music? | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/cheriehu/2016/02/29/the-modern-concert-pt-2-what-is-missing-from-the-artist-brand-relationship-in-live-music/#c40714b254f8 | publisher=[[Forbes]] | date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guests arrive on time for the first act and are encouraged to stay for the entire show. Events are normally [[BYOB]], and emphasis is placed on the crowd being respectful – switching off their phones and listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East End Review|url=http://www.eastendreview.co.uk/2014/05/13/sofar-sounds-rafe-offar/|website=East End Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sofar Sounds also claims that highlighting headline acts encourages people to turn up late and not respect the other performers, so that is why all artists are being treated equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Crack in the Road|url=http://www.crackintheroad.com/music/20639-feature-sofar-sounds|website=www.crackintheroad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists are often filmed, with the edited video uploaded to the Sofar Sounds YouTube channel&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sofar Sounds YouTube channel|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/Sofarsounds|website=Youtube|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shared on the website.

===Pricing and payments===

There are two types of Sofar cities: Full-time and [[Volunteering|volunteer]]/ambassador. The majority of Sofar cities are run by volunteers who put on one or two shows a month.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sofarsounds.com/faq "Frequently Asked Questions"] Sofar Sounds (Retrieved 31 May 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the majority of Sofar Sounds cities the audience does not pay beforehand but is encouraged to make a cash contribution at the show. In some cities in the US and UK, people can choose how much they pay for their [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] prior to the show. The minimum amount is set by the local city team. In the rest of the Sofar cities, shows are ticketed. Tickets are $15 per person in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=How Sofar Sounds is redefining the live music scene around the globe | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sofar-sounds-songs-from-a-room-live-music/ | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; £18 in the UK, and 200kr in Norway.

Performing artists are either paid directly, or the A/V team on the night is paid to produce the video for the artists, depending on the [[Financial compensation|compensation]] agreed upon between artist and booker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sofarsounds.com/faq "Frequently Asked Questions"] Sofar Sounds (Retrieved 31 May 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Besatzungszonen ohne text.gif|thumb|right|The four occupation zones in post-war Germany.]]
The '''Stalin Note''', also known as the '''March Note''', was a document delivered to the representatives of the [[Western Bloc|Western allied powers]] (the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and the [[United States]]) from the [[Soviet occupations#Germany|Soviet Occupation]] in [[Germany]] on March 10, 1952. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] put forth a proposal for a [[German reunification|reunification]] and neutralization of Germany, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for "the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly" and free activity of democratic parties and organizations.

[[James Warburg]], member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], testified before the committee on March 28, 1952 and observed that the Soviet proposal might be a bluff, but it seemed "that our government is afraid to call the bluff for the fear that it may not be a bluff at all" and might lead to "a free, neutral, and demilitarized Germany", which might be "subverted into Soviet orbit". This led to an exchange of notes between the Western allies and the [[Soviet Union]], which eventually ended after the Western allies' insistence that a unified Germany should be free to join the [[European Defence Community]] and be [[Wiederbewaffnung|rearmed]], a demand which Stalin rejected.

Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] and the Western allies at the time painted Stalin's move as an aggressive action that attempted to stall the reintegration of West Germany. However, afterwards there were debates on whether a chance for reunification had been missed. Six years after the exchange, two German ministers, [[Thomas Dehler]] and [[Gustav Heinemann]], blamed Adenauer for not having explored the chance of reunification.

==Political background==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
{{POV check|section|date=November 2008}}
}}
After the end of the [[World War II]], Germany was divided into what became eventually a Western and an Eastern Zone. By 1949, Germany had a [[Representative democracy|parliamentary democracy]] in the West, called the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG – natively BRD, commonly "[[West Germany]]"), and a [[communist state]] in the East, called the German Democratic Republic (GDR – natively DDR, commonly "[[East Germany]]"). Opportunities for reunification of these two halves appeared unlikely from the Western standpoint because Stalin and the East German Communists did not want to allow any [[free elections]] in the GDR. The [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] feared losing power if free elections were held. At that point in history, Germany had not yet signed a peace treaty for World War II because of the animosity between the three Western Powers and the Soviet Union. It would not sign one until the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Agreement]] in 1990.

At the beginning of 1950, the United States began negotiations for a peace treaty with [[Japan]], which would also grant them military bases in Japan over a long period of time. This may have had an influence on Stalin's decision to support [[North Korea]] when it attacked [[South Korea]], which was pro-US; however, this has not been proven. The [[Korean War]] (1950–1953) surprised the US and formed a deeper rift into the [[Cold War]].

In discussions about the reunification, East Germany stressed the importance of a peace treaty, while West Germany focused on the importance of free elections for all of Germany. Chancellor Adenauer did not believe that reunification was possible under the given conditions. He and his administration pursued a course that allied the FRG with the [[Western Bloc]], particularly in relationship to military policy. Specifically, Adenauer felt that the FRG should maintain an army, which could be integrated into a larger West European military force. A [[Treaty establishing the European Defence Community|European Defence Community Treaty]] was signed in May 1952, after the rejection of the Stalin note, but the proposed European Defence Community never came into being, due to rejection of the treaty by the [[National Assembly (France)|French National Assembly]].

Stalin and the GDR condemned the EDC despite the fact that the GDR had created a pseudo-military force called the ''[[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]]''. The Stalin notes can be seen as a way of drawing out the propaganda efforts of East Germany so that the reunification would fail.

On September 15, 1951, the East German government offered to discuss holding elections at a meeting with West Germany. However, the West German government refused to hold talks with the SED because this would have meant the actual recognition of East Germany as an equal country. Contact was always maintained through the Western Powers. Instead, West Germany wanted a commission of the [[United Nations]] to check whether or not free all-German elections were possible.

Due to the endeavors of the Western Powers, this commission met in December 1951. East Germany refused to let them enter, however. In their opinion, the possibility of free elections should be investigated by a commission of the four Occupying Powers.

==First Stalin Note==
[[File:Stalin 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Stalin]]
At a conference in Paris, the SED emphasized the importance of the two German states discussing a potential peace treaty. The Soviet leadership also encouraged the discussion of a peace treaty with the Western Powers. The Soviet government continued along this trajectory because they were afraid of the Western push for the integration of the West German armed forces into a larger Western coalition.

The government of the GDR appealed to the four powers to allow for negotiations of the peace treaty for Germany. After about two months, in August 1951, Stalin was able to present the first draft of the plan for a peace treaty. After working through numerous corrections and basic conceptual changes, the final version was ready seven months later.

On March 10, 1952, [[Andrei Gromyko]] gave a diplomatic note about the solution of the "German problem" to representatives of the three western occupiers (the United States, Great Britain, and France) and called for a four-power conference. The note included the following points&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3351|title=Soviet Draft of a German Peace Treaty – First "Stalin Note" (March 10, 1952)|last=|first=|date=|website=germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* A [[peace treaty]] with all participants in the war with Germany should be negotiated with a single, united German government. The Allies must agree on the formation of this government.
* Germany was to be re-established as a united state within the boundaries established by the provisions of the [[Potsdam Conference]].
* All occupation forces were to be withdrawn within one year following the date on which treaty came into effect.
* Germany would have democratic rights, such as having [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of press]], and freedom to have a [[multi-party system]], including for former members of the nazi party in the german armed forces, with the exception of those under criminal prosecution.
* Germany was to become officially neutral and not enter into any kind of coalition or military alliance directed against any of the countries whose military forces had participated in the war against it.
* Germany would have access to world markets and there would be no restrictions to these markets.
* Germany was permitted to have national armed forces for its own defense and to manufacture munitions for these forces.

===West German reaction===
The FRG’s priorities were different from those of the GDR. Chancellor Adenauer’s main priority was the integration of the FRG into the West, and he saw reunification as a rather abstract goal. Specifically, his administration wanted to focus on the re-establishment of Germany into a capitalist Europe, and felt that reunification was not possible until West Germany was securely established in Western Europe. He went so far as to believe that a reunification could only happen at the same time as a radical change in eastern Europe. If the integration of West Germany into the Western Alliance could not be managed, West Germany would be pulled unavoidably in with the Soviet Union. He felt that Germany alone would not be able to afford an army which could provide for the security of a neutral Germany. Thus, Adenauer assumed that two German states would co-exist for an undeterminate amount of time and he followed this goal in the background. For these reasons, Adenauer saw the March note as an annoyance and wanted to continue proceedings with the Western Powers as if there had never been a note at all.

Adenauer's view that Stalin's offer was not meant seriously was widely shared. But there were other views about how to react to the offer. The [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Minister of All-German Affairs]], [[Jakob Kaiser]], had a "bridge theory," which suggested that Germany could be the mediator between East and West. While he agreed with Adenauer about the importance of free elections and the refusal of the Potsdam borders, he took the Soviet offer very seriously. In a radio address on March 12, 1952, Kaiser stated that the note had an important political significance, but he still thought it was important to approach it with caution. He asked that the suggestions of the Soviet Union be carefully explored so that no opportunity for reunification would be missed.

Similarly, other ministers and also members of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) felt that they should at least seriously test Stalin’s proposal so that the world public would not get the impression that reunification fell through because of West Germany. Also, this would quickly prove if Stalin really meant to keep his offer, and if he did not, then his deceit would be unmasked.

However, Adenauer felt that a "test" would have significant disadvantages:
* A conference could be drawn out by the Soviet Union, while the relationship with the West would be delayed at first. If the West finally left the conference unnerved, Stalin could blame the failure of the talks on the West.
* Because of the Second World War (and other German history, such as the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]]), it was essential that the FRG appear to be a reliable partner to the West. Agreeing with the offer would destroy this impression.
* The GDR would also participate in the conference suggested by Stalin, besides the FRG. The GDR would be recognized by the western side by that fact, and Stalin would have already achieved one of his goals, without having given up anything.
* Even if Stalin's offer were meant seriously, according to the historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]], Adenauer was worried about a neutral all-Germany. He believed that "the Germans" would not act responsibly in such a difficult situation between the East and the West. Adenauer also shared this with the Western Powers. For that reason, Adenauer was also against neutrality because Germany could not defend itself alone against the Soviet Union.

All in all, Adenauer, his ministers, the opposing [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the population at large were in agreement: Stalin’s proposal was not sincere and the demand for free elections had to be maintained. However, there was still some uneasiness that the FRG could not do anything against the division of Germany.

===East German reaction===
In the GDR, the note was officially received with excitement. The party organ of the SED, ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' ("New Germany"), gave it great importance "for the battle of the patriotic forces of the German people and the peaceful reunification", where patriotic forces meant principally communist forces.

The Prime Minister of the GDR, [[Otto Grotewohl]], indicated how the draft treaty was interpreted by the GDR in a government declaration on March 14. In it, he described the GDR as a democratic and free state and the FRG as undemocratic and fascist. Anti-peace and anti-democratic groups, however, could not be allowed to exist in a united Germany. In addition, a united Germany had to orient themselves with the five-year plan of the GDR. Finally, [[Walter Ulbricht]], the general secretary of the central committee of the SED, unmistakably spoke about the interpretation of the note. It should be understood as an action against the "general war treaty" (meaning the Germany treaty), through which Germany would become dependent on the West. However, Germany could only develop freely and peacefully in a communist, so-called "world peace bloc".

===The Western powers' response===
The Western Powers were not completely surprised by the proposition offered by the March note, because Stalin had not yet tried to interfere with the Western integration of the FRG. However, the Western Powers did not want to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union until West Germany was securely integrated into the West. Therefore, the response from the Western Powers attempted to delay the start of negotiations for the Peace Treaty.

After the Foreign Ministers of the Western Occupation had finished their response, they asked Adenauer for his opinion on the matter, in case he had any small changes he wished to make. Although he mistrusted Stalin’s note, he asked that it not be outright rejected in the answering note. He didn't want to create the impression that the West had brusquely refused it.

On March 25, 1952, the first note from the governments of Great Britain, France, and the United States was sent to Moscow. It included the following points:

* In order to begin negotiations on the Peace Treaty, the [[United Nations]] must check that all of Germany had free elections, then free elections would be held, and after that a government for all of Germany would be formed.
* The borders from Potsdam (the [[Oder-Neisse line]]) were rejected, since these borders would only be in effect until a peace treaty was worked out.
* Germany would have the right to enter into any alliances within the context of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].
* There would be full agreement of the Western Powers for Germany to be integrated into a defensive, European military alliance, which was understood to be a clear reference to the [[European Defence Community|EDC]]. An independent German military would be a step back into a Europe that was controlled by militaristic and aggressive rivalry.

==Further Stalin notes==

===Second note===
In the second Stalin Note, sent on April 9, 1952, the Soviet Union stood by its position that negotiations for the groundwork of a peace treaty and for the creation of a unified German government should begin. Stalin accepted that free elections could be the groundwork for a unified German government, but insisted that the four occupying powers oversee the elections rather than the United Nations. On the other hand, Stalin stayed firm on the idea that a reunified Germany should have the borders outlined by the [[Potsdam Conference]], and that, even more generally, an armed Germany could not be in an alliance directed aggressively against other states.

In the second Western note of May 13, 1952, it was again emphasized that a freely-elected all-German government must participate in the treaty negotiations. Additionally, the West accepted that a commission of the occupying powers could oversee the elections, but insisted that the commission not be made up of government officials but rather impartial participants. The matter of dispute remained: free elections first (West) or peace treaty negotiations first (Soviet Union).

===Third note===
A day before the official signing of the European Defence Community, the Soviet Union sent a third note, on May 24, 1952. In that note, Stalin criticized the creation of the EDC (which according to the Germany Treaty, should be in effect even after the reunification), and accused the Western Powers of delaying the negotiations for a peace treaty. In addition, the all-German government must remain under the control of the occupying powers at the treaty negotiations.

On their part, the West on July 10, 1952, criticized the centralization, the collectivization and the changes in the justice system of the GDR which the SED had previously passed. The note stated that the conference should not yet negotiate a peace treaty, but should decide about a commission to oversee the elections first. There was still a difference of opinion about whether the decisions of Potsdam could be the basis for negotiation - these decisions contradicted all the developments since 1945.

===Fourth note===
On August 23, 1952, the Soviet Union sent the last note. This note repeated their main positions and accusations. Additionally, although the Western Powers had conceded in allowing the occupying powers oversee the elections, the Soviet Union suddenly refused an international election commission entirely. Instead, both of the German states should be responsible for creating a commission with equal representation. However, this had already been refused by the West in 1951.

For this reason in their answer of September 23, 1952, the West limited themselves to repeating their previous views and to renewing the suggestion of forming a non-partisan commission of the four powers.

If after the first note of the West, the lack of success of the exchange of notes had already been internally determined, in the East as well as in the West, this view was also publicly expressed by the (rather polemic) contents of the last four notes. The signing of the two treaties with the West on May 26 and May 27, 1952, emphasized this even more.

==Debate about the "missed chance"==
There have been several debates about whether a real chance for reunification had been missed in 1952. There are two main disputes:
*The more concrete and easier to research question revolved around Stalin's motives, around how ready he was to permit a neutralized, democratic, unified Germany (and give up the GDR). Sceptics reject this. A completely independent Germany could be just as unpleasant in principle for Stalin as for the West. But above all, the existence of the GDR had great advantages for Stalin:
**As one of four occupying powers of the Second World War, the Soviet Union enjoyed prestige, to begin with.
**The Soviet right of occupation of East German soil was recognized in general by the Western Powers.
**The GDR was an important Soviet bridgehead in the middle of Europe; and above all at a time when Soviet troops had again left [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]. The GDR was important for holding together the system of the Soviet [[Satellite state|satellite states]].
**Because of its precarious situation, the GDR leadership were (for the most part) especially true vassals of the Soviet Union.
**The GDR could be economically exploited and provide soldiers.
**There is no comparison with [[Austria]]&amp;mdash;from which the Soviet Union had withdrawn in 1955 following the [[Austrian State Treaty]] and the declaration of Austria's permanent neutrality&amp;mdash;since Austria has a lesser strategic and economic weight than Germany. Beside, Austria had already had an all-Austrian government since 1945.
*A more political and more speculative question is whether such a Germany would have been more desirable. The sceptics feel:
**Stalin could have still tried to subjugate all of Germany in a roundabout way through reunification.
**Without the Western Alliance, Stalin could have been able to conquer the western European countries little by little, as [[Hitler]] had treated Germany's neighbors.
**Without integration with the West, West Germany or all of Germany would have fared worse economically.

Above all, there is debate about the behavior of the FRG and the Western Powers. The publicist, [[Paul Sethe]], and the historians [[Wilfried Loth]], [[Josef Foschepoth]], [[Karl-Gustav von Schönfels]], and especially [[Rolf Steininger]] belong to the critics. Their views are answered by [[Hermann Graml]], [[Gerhard Wettig]], and [[Gottfried Niedhart]].

The critics alleged again and again that Adenauer, who came from [[Catholic Church in Germany|Catholic]] [[Rhineland]], did not want reunification with the [[Protestantism in Germany|Protestant]], Prussian East at all. The opinion of Adenauer in the [[Weimar Republic]] (he wanted an [[Rhenish Republic|independent Rhineland]] inside of the [[German Empire]]) was used against him. Adenauer could have had a political motive: many of the traditional supporters of the SPD were in the GDR. With the East zone, Germany would have become more Protestant and more Social Democratic than the FRG of the three Western zones.

In essence, the debate had two peaks: at the end of the 1950s and then again after the opening of the archive of the Western Powers in the middle of the 1980s. Newer research since the 1990s also takes into account the archives of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and thus brings up further discussion. Finally, a book on the analysis of the Stalin notes was published in 2002. During the reunification itself (1989&amp;ndash;1990), the debate about the Stalin notes played no part.

===Discussion in the 1950s===
The American historian [[Ruud van Dijk]] remarked that in the later discussions much more sincerity was attributed to Stalin than in 1952. The clearer it became that the chances for German reunification were dwindling, the stronger the debate about whether or not an important chance had been missed in 1952. According to [[Manfred Kittel]], the discussion increased in extent as the chances for reunification decreased.

Within journalism, it was Paul Sethe who most sharply criticized Adenauer's non-acceptance of Stalin's offer. Sethe was the co-publisher of the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung]]'' in the beginning of the 1950s and had always spoken out in his commentaries for at least checking into the seriousness of Stalin's notes. Thus he saw the neutralization of Germany as an appropriate price for reunification. He completed the thesis of the "missed chances" in his book, "Von Bonn nach Moskau" (''From Bonn to Moscow'') and thus he lay the cornerstone for a debate about the Stalin notes that lasted for decades.

The idea of the "missed opportunity" received attention through a debate in the [[Bundestag]] on January 23, 1958. The [[Christian Democratic Party|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] had a government coalition with the small [[German Party (1947)|DP]], when two former Ministers asked to speak, [[Thomas Dehler]] (FDP) and [[Gustav Heinemann]] (first CDU, now SPD). Both of them had left the government in the dispute with Adenauer at that time. They accused Chancellor Adenauer of not having done enough for reunification.

===Discussion in the 1980s===
The debate came again in the 1980s, when the Western archives were opened for historians. The archives of the Soviet Union and the GDR were not yet accessible to researchers at that time. The historian, Rolf Steininger, asked in his article, "Eine Chance zur Wiedervereinigung?" (''A Chance for Reunification?'') in 1985, which is based predominantly on Western sources, whether an important chance had been missed at that time. Steininger and others disputed the question whether it would have inevitably led to a divided Germany and whether the course of Adenauer was the best possible way. His argument is based on three assumptions:

*Stalin's offer was meant seriously
*The Western powers intended to sound out Stalin's offer
*Adenauer attempted to stop any attempt in this direction

The historian [[Hermann Graml]], on the other hand, justified the actions of the Western Powers. Quite the opposite and also on the basis of the Western archives, he attached little importance to Adenauer's influence on the negotiation. Graml interpreted the note itself and the "planned" failure of the negotiations as more or less that the Soviet Union wanted to create an alibi for being able to push forward on the integration of the GDR into the Eastern Bloc.

'''Super Extreme Wrestling War''' was a series of [[professional wrestling]] events produced by [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]] (FMW) in 1997. These events marked the first time that FMW began a partnership with American counterpart [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) and a working relationship began between the two companies as ECW wrestlers competed at these events and it marked the beginning of interpromotional matches and events between ECW and FMW. These events would create a huge impact in FMW's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storylines]] as they concluded with the breakup of [[ZEN (professional wrestling)|ZEN]] when [[Mr. Gannosuke]], [[Kouhiro Kanemura|Yukihiro Kanemura]] and [[Hido (wrestler)|Hido]] attacked their leader [[Atsushi Onita]] out of jealousy after [[Hayabusa (wrestler)|Hayabusa]] pinned Onita in a [[WarGames match]]. They merged with [[Fuyuki-Gun]] to form [[Team No Respect]], which would dominate FMW until 2000.

==Background==
===Production===
The tour marked the beginning of a talent exchange working agreement between ECW and FMW which would last throughout the existence of both promotions. The theme of the tour was that ECW wrestlers would work matches on all of the shows on the tour. The tour also featured the return of FMW wrestlers, who were part of [[List of Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni|ECW roster]] at the time, [[Terry Funk]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] as ECW wrestlers. Funk had been the leader of Funk Masters of Wrestling and was returning the company for the first time since beating [[Hiromichi Fuyuki|Kodo Fuyuki]] at Kawasaki Legend: Fall Spectacular and Sabu was returning since losing to [[Hayabusa (wrestler)|Hayabusa]] at Summer Spectacular in 1994.&lt;ref name="fall97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="summer94"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.htmlsummer94|title=FMW Summer Spectacular 1994|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Storylines===
At Kawasaki Legend: Fall Spectacular, [[Atsushi Onita]] defeated [[Kouhiro Kanemura|W*ING Kanemura]] in a [[hardcore wrestling|no rope barbed wire electrified dynamite land mine time bomb death match]] which stipulated that if Onita lost, he would [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retire]] and if Kanemura lost, then [[W*ING Alliance]] must disband.&lt;ref name="fall97"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.html#fall97|title=FMW Fall Spectacular 1997|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, W*ING Alliance members Kanemura, [[Hideki Hosaka]] and [[Hido (wrestler)|Hido]] were concerned because no group in FMW would accept them. Onita became upset at FMW's team of [[Hayabusa (wrestler)|Hayabusa]], [[Masato Tanaka]] and [[Koji Nakagawa]] for being rude to Kanemura, Hosaka and Hido and then he met Kanemura in his ambulance to conduct a meeting with the former W*ING members. On September 30, Onita held a press conference in which he [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turn]]ed [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] for the first time in his FMW career by denouncing himself as a FMW wrestler and formed [[ZEN (professional wrestling)|ZEN]] with the former W*ING Alliance and FMW's upstart [[Tetsuhiro Kuroda]]. A rivalry blossomed between FMW and ZEN and the Funk Masters of Wrestling was quickly phased out after [[Mr. Gannosuke]], [[Hisakatsu Oya]] and [[Mike Awesome|The Gladiator]] ended it due to the group's leader [[Terry Funk]] leaving FMW and they joined ZEN.&lt;ref name="fmwhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/FMWHistory2.html|title=FMW History Part 2|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, Masato Tanaka, [[Ricky Fuji]] and Mr. Pogo #2 defeated ZEN's Atsushi Onita, Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hido in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|six-man tag team match]] when Tanaka pinned Onita,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purolove.com/misc/fmw/results/97scramble.php|title=Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling - "SCRAMBLE SURVIVOR 1997"|publisher=Puro Love|accessdate=2017-11-28|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMW @ Kitakyushu|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;show=246186|website=Wrestlingdata.com|publisher=Wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=2017-11-28|date=1997-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a match between the two on the first show of the Super Extreme Wrestling War tour on December 19.

At [[FMW 8th Anniversary Show|8th Anniversary Show]], Hayabusa defeated Mr. Gannosuke in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|mask vs. hair match]] and then attempted to reconcile with Gannosuke but Gannosuke attacked him and attempted to [[Professional wrestling attacks#Fireball|blow fire]] on him until Hayabusa's ally [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] made the save, thus forming an alliance with Hayabusa and beginning to feud with Gannosuke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/FMWReview-KudoRetirement.html|title=Megumi Kudo Retirement Show, 4/29/97|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=2017-11-28|author=Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, Gannosuke attacked Shinzaki under a Hayabusa disguise during Shinzaki's entrance before a match at a [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]] show.&lt;ref name="gannosuke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr. Gannosuke's Bio|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/Gannosuke.html|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, Gannosuke, Hisakatsu Oya and The Gladiator defeated Hayabusa, Shinzaki and Koji Nakagawa in a six-man tag team match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMW @ Takaishi|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;show=243076|website=Wrestlingdata.com|publisher=Wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=2017-11-28|date=1997-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 25, Gannosuke, Gladiator and [[Corporal Kirchner|Super Leather]] defeated the team of Shinzaki, Ricky Fuji and [[Ricky Morton]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Barbed Wire Massacre|barbed wire tornado deathmatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMW @ Osaka|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;show=243730|website=Wrestlingdata.com|publisher=Wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=2017-11-28|date=1997-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, Gannosuke attacked Shinzaki from behind before a match between the two and then easily defeated him by making him bleed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMW @ Sapporo|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;show=243791|website=Wrestlingdata.com|publisher=Wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=2017-11-28|date=1997-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, Gannosuke, along with Hisakatsu Oya left Funk Masters of Wrestling and joined ZEN after losing the [[FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship]] to ZEN's Atsushi Onita and Yukihiro Kanemura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMW @ Sendai|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;show=244158|website=Wrestlingdata.com|publisher=Wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=2017-11-28|date=1997-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title would be vacated due to Onita's inactivity. On November 28, Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura defeated Hayabusa and Masato Tanaka to win the vacant title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMW @ Tokyo|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;show=246202|website=Wrestlingdata.com|publisher=Wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=2017-11-28|date=1997-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, Gannosuke stole Shinzaki's clothes and wore them during a tag team match pitting him and Hideki Hosaka against Shinzaki and Ricky Fuji, which Gannosuke and Hosaka won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMW @ Tokyo|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;show=246206|website=Wrestlingdata.com|publisher=Wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=2017-11-28|date=1997-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set up a title defense for Gannosuke and Kanemura against Hayabusa and Shinzaki on the December 19 show of the tour.

Other important changes in the FMW roster took place in December as Hisakatsu Oya quit ZEN after losing to Hayabusa on December 5 and Koji Nakagawa walked out on FMW after feeling betrayed by [[Shoichi Arai]] for not been given major opportunities which had been promised to him in the past.&lt;ref name="fmwhistory"/&gt;

The first show of the Super Extreme Wrestling War took place on December 19, 1997 at the [[Komazawa Gymnasium]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It was the first event in FMW history to host [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]'s (ECW) [[List of Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni|roster]] in FMW and marked the beginning of the talent exchange between FMW and ECW wrestlers which would see wrestlers from both companies appear in interpromotional matches. In the first match, [[Fuyuki-Gun]] ([[Hiromichi Fuyuki|Kodo Fuyuki]], [[Jado]] and [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]]) defeated [[ZEN (professional wrestling)|ZEN]] members defeated [[Tetsuhiro Kuroda]], [[Hido (wrestler)|Hido]] and [[Hideki Hosaka|The Great Fake]] when Fuyuki performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat|Lariat]] on Hido. [[Aja Kong]] defeated [[Shark Tsuchiya]] with a ''[[Professional wrestling attacks#Back fist|Uraken]]''. [[D-Von Dudley]] from ECW defeated [[Ricky Fuji]] with a ''[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Death Drop|Dudley Death Drop]]'' from [[Dudley Boyz]] and ZEN's [[Mike Awesome|The Gladiator]] defeated ECW's [[Tommy Dreamer]] with a ''[[Powerbomb#Superbomb|Super Awesome Bomb]]''. The event marked the return of the former leader of Funk Masters of Wrestling [[Terry Funk]] to FMW as an ECW wrestler. He defeated [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] and [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Buh Buh Ray Dudley]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three-way dance]]. [[Mr. Gannosuke]] and [[Kouhiro Kanemura|Yukihiro Kanemura]] retained the [[FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship]] against [[Hayabusa (wrestler)|Hayabusa]] and [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] when Kanemura hit a diving Hayabusa in his injured ribs with his knee and then [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|rolled him up]] to win the match. The main event of the show featured the [[FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship|Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion]] and the [[FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship|Independent Heavyweight Champion]] [[Masato Tanaka]] competing against ZEN leader [[Atsushi Onita]] in a non-title match, stemming from Tanaka [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]]ning Onita in a match. Onita defeated Tanaka in the match.&lt;ref name="purolove"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dec19"/&gt; A dissension took place within ZEN as Onita [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] himself in the main event while Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura grew upset as they thought that their FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship match deserved to be the main event of the show as they had become [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|popular]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] of FMW.

==Summary==
According to his own account, Alex Malarkey says that he and his father were driving on a highway near [[Rushsylvania, Ohio]] when his father turned onto another road, and was hit by a car, which he did not see behind a [[blind spot (vehicle)|blind hill]]. After the automobile accident, he says he saw his father fly out of the window of his car, only to be caught by an angel and carried to safety. He says he was out of his body while he saw this happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Mark Furler| url= http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/boy-tells-of-his-astounding-visit-to-heaven/767211/ |title= The Boy Who 'Went to Heaven' |publisher= Sunshine Coast Daily |date=2011-02-12 |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was taken to a hospital in an emergency helicopter. The book says that soon after that he felt an angel take him through the gates of Heaven, which he describes as being "tall," to meet [[Jesus]], who appears through a "hole in heaven."&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite web | title=Alex Malarkey, 'The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven,' Admits He Made It All Up| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/15/alex-malarkey-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven_n_6483432.html| author=Ed Mazza| date=15 Jan 2015| work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he woke up in the hospital, he told his family his account of his near-death experience.

== Reception and aftermath ==
Books about purported visits to Heaven make up a popular and highly lucrative genre of religious books in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/oct/23/heaven-and-back/| title=To Heaven and Back!|author=Robert Gottlieb|date=23 October 2014| work=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 book ''[[90 Minutes in Heaven]]'' spent over five years on the New York Times best-seller list, and sold over six million copies,&lt;ref name=cr&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christianretailing.com/index.php/newsletter/latest/26973-pipers-90-minutes-in-heaven-back-on-new-york-times-best-seller-list| title=Piper’s ‘90 Minutes in Heaven’ Back on ‘New York Times’ Best-seller List| work=Christian Retailing| date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the book ''[[Heaven Is for Real]]'' has sold over 10 million copies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christianretailing.com/index.php/newsletter/latest/27680-heaven-is-for-real-hits-major-sales-milestone| title=‘Heaven Is for Real’ hits major sales milestone| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218031545/http://christianretailing.com/index.php/newsletter/latest/27680-heaven-is-for-real-hits-major-sales-milestone| archivedate=18 Dec 2014| author=Christine D. Johnson| date=11 Dec 2014| work=Christian Retailing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Heaven Is for Real (film)|film adaptation]] earned $101 million at the box office.&lt;ref name=mojo&gt;{{cite web | title=Heaven Is for Real| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=heavenisforreal.htm| publisher=boxofficemojo.com| accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven'' sold 112,386 copies in the first year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/religion/article/65293-tyndale-pulls-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven.html| title=Tyndale Pulls 'Boy Who Came Back from Heaven'| author=Claire Swanson| date=16 Jan 2015|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a platinum award from the [[Evangelical Christian Publishers Association]] in 2013 for over a million sales.&lt;ref name="Christian Retailing"/&gt;

In November 2012, Alex's mother, Beth Malarkey, wrote several blog posts saying that her family is not in agreement with the content of the book.  She expressed frustration with several people calling and visiting their home over the years, saying, "[Alex] is just a boy not a statue to be worshipped or person with some supernatural gifts," and, "He does not go to Heaven, have conversations with supernatural beings, and whatever visions/experiences he has had or had not had, is up to him as to what he will do with those."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/alex-malarkey-author-of-the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-says-he-made-up-story-20150116-12sa3j.html| title=Alex Malarkey: Author of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven says He Made Up Story| date=17 Jan 2015| work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that month, she claimed the book's account had been embellished, adding that, "The truth is getting twisted, distorted, and packaged to be sold to the highest bidder."  She also revealed that Alex himself had written a comment on the book's Facebook page in November 2011 calling the book "one of the most deceptive books ever."  That comment was deleted, and Alex was banned from commenting after the moderators suspected he was an imposter.&lt;ref name=AlexFacebook/&gt; Beth and Kevin Malarkey have become estranged since the book was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2015/01/public-statement.html ''Public Statement'']; Beth Malarkey&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2014, Beth Malarkey appeared on the Christian radio show, ''The Bible Answer Man,'' and said that the book is deceptive and embellishes the story of the accident. Beth Malarkey said Alex is still a quadriplegic and cannot legally receive any money from the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hank Hanegraaff]] (June 5, 2014); [http://www.equip.org/articles/boy-came-back-heaven/ ''The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven; The Story Behind the Story'']; ''The Bible Answerman'', at the [[Christian Research Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; She also began communicating with Phil Johnson, the executive director of [[John F. MacArthur]]'s media ministry, ''Grace to You,'' in hopes of communicating her story. Johnson said that Beth had told him she and Alex had been trying to publicize for some time that the book was "an  [[Literary forgery|exaggeration and an embellishment]]."&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; Johnson subsequently revealed in his blog, ''The Spurgeon Archive,'' that Beth Malarkey had sent Tyndale "a stack of correspondence" in which she stated that Alex not only received no royalties from the book, but that Kevin "neglects his duties as a husband and a father," and was "not even adequately supporting his family financially."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Phil. [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/thp.htm ''Tyndale House Publishers Knew the Malarkey Book Was A Fraud'']; The Spurgeon Archive, 2015-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt; She had also revealed this to apologist Justin Peters, who proceeded to e-mail LifeWay leaders [[Ed Stetzer]] and [[Thom S. Rainer]]. They responded, but the book would not be withdrawn from LifeWay stores for another eight months &lt;ref&gt;[http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/15/emails-reveal-lifeway-president-knew-of-heaven-scam-chose-not-to-act/ ''Emails Suggest Lifeway President Knew of Heaven Scam, Chose Not to Act'']; Pulpit and Pen; 2015-01-15&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist and paranormal researcher [[Benjamin Radford]], part of the reason that the story was so well-received and accepted among its American Christian audience is that it reinforced their existing narratives and beliefs. By sticking closely to a widely accepted interpretation of heaven, God and demons, Malarkey was assured that his story would meet his audience’s expectations and be popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Radford| first = Benjamin|authorlink = Benjamin Radford| title=Why People Believed Boy's 'Visit to Heaven' Story| url=http://news.discovery.com/human/psychology/why-people-believed-boys-visit-to-heaven-story150120.htm| website=news.discovery.com| accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession of fraud===
On January 13, 2015, Alex Malarkey released an open letter to Christian publishers and bookstores via the Christian Apologetics blog known as ''Pulpit and Pen'', confessing that the entire account of his journey to Heaven was fictional, and implored them to remove the book from their stores. In his letter he notes:

{{quote|"Please forgive the brevity, but because of my limitations I have to keep this short. I did not die. I did not go to Heaven. I said I went to Heaven because I thought it would get me attention. When I made the claims that I did, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough. The Bible is the only source of truth. Anything written by man cannot be infallible. It is only through repentance of your sins and a belief in Jesus as the Son of God, who died for your sins (even though he committed none of his own) so that you can be forgiven may you learn of Heaven outside of what is written in the Bible... not by reading a work of man. I want the whole world to know that the Bible is sufficient. Those who market these materials must be called to repent and hold the Bible as enough.
In Christ, Alex Malarkey.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/| title="The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven" Recants Story, Rebukes Christian Retailers | work=pulpitandpen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
On January 15, 2015, Tyndale House confirmed it would be withdrawing the book.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

==Recovery==
In 2009, Alex Malarkey, aged 10, became the youngest person to have the surgical procedure first carried out for [[Christopher Reeve]] to allow him to breathe on his own without a ventilator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/01/09/boy-10-is-youngest-person-to-get-christopher-reeve-breathing-device/ |title=Boy, 10, Is Youngest Person to Get 'Christopher Reeve' Breathing Device |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Fox News |date=January 9, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009, he was able to stand upright in a supporting frame and, with helpers moving his legs, to walk on a treadmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.examiner.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5275%3Abellefontaines-ward-to-join-wittenbergs-soccer-program&amp;Itemid=57 |title=Worlds away from ‘sheer survival’ |last=Loehr |first=Many |newspaper=Bellefontaine Examiner |date=April 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5483">[[File:Jonas Mekas.jpg|thumb|150px|Lithuanian artist [[Jonas Mekas]], one of the founders of The Film-Makers' Cooperative]]
'''The Film-Makers' Cooperative''' a.k.a. '''The New American Cinema Group''' is an artist-run, non-profit organization founded in 1962 in New York City by [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Shirley Clarke]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Gregory Markopoulos]], [[Lloyd Williams (filmmaker)|Lloyd Michael Williams]] and other filmmakers to distribute [[avant-garde]] films.

==History==
In the fall of 1960, [[Jonas Mekas]] and Lewis Allen organized several meetings with independent filmmakers in New York City that culminated on September 28, 1960 with them officially declaring themselves the New American Cinema Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = 
http://www.undergroundfilmjournal.com/a-look-back-the-american-new-wave-1958-1967/ | title = A Look Back: The American New Wave 1958-1967 | first = Mike | last = Everleth | publisher = Underground Film Journal | accessdate = March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later on Sept. 30, Mekas presented the first draft of a manifesto for the Group, which included a call to form a cooperative distribution center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = 
http://www.undergroundfilmjournal.com/the-first-statement-of-the-new-american-cinema-group-september-30-1962/ | title = The First Statement of the New American Cinema Group: September 30, 1962 | first = Mike | last = Everleth | publisher = Underground Film Journal | accessdate = March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 1961, at a contentious meeting of the Group, [[Amos Vogel]] attempted to stonewall the formation of the distribution center claiming that his own Cinema 16 organization should be the only distributor of experimental films. However, Vogel is shouted down after it was pointed out that Cinema 16 refused to distribute [[Stan Brakhage]]'s ''Anticipation of the Night''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = 
http://www.undergroundfilmjournal.com/a-look-back-the-american-new-wave-1958-1967/ | title = A Look Back: The American New Wave 1958-1967 | first = Mike | last = Everleth | publisher = Underground Film Journal | accessdate = March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Film-Makers' Cooperative would officially start distributing films in 1962.

==Description==
The Film-Makers' Cooperative holds the world's largest collection of [[Experimental film|avantgarde and experimental films]], with over 5,000 titles by more than 825 filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;Rohter, Larry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/movies/11coop.html "Distributor of Avant-Garde Films Threatened With Eviction"] ''[[The New York Times]].'' 10 Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection includes work authored on 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, video and DVD. The Cooperative rents out the films in its collection to cinématheques, film festivals, schools, universities, museums, and other art institutions in the United States and around the world.

Based upon a belief common to the founding members that the "official cinema is running out of breath" and has become "morally corrupt, aesthetically obsolete, thematically superficial, temperamentally boring" (as the original 1962 manifesto&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.film-makerscoop.com/history.htm History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427100456/http://www.film-makerscoop.com/history.htm |date=2011-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would have it), the Film-Makers' Cooperative was a key institution in the heyday of American experimental or "underground" film in the 1960s and 1970s, and has continued to operate on a non-exclusive basis to ensure the existence of an alternative, non-commercial film culture since then.

The Film-Makers' Cooperative is open to anyone who wishes to become a member.

The New York Film-Makers' Cooperative has inspired similar initiatives both within the United States ([[Canyon Cinema]] in San Francisco) and abroad ([[London Film-Makers' Co-op|The London Film-Makers' Co-operative]] in England, and ABCinema in Denmark, and elsewhere).

Besides distributing its members' films, the Film-Makers' Cooperative is continuously involved in film preservation and DVD release projects, and in arranging screenings and events in and around New York City.

}}'''The Glasgow Gaiety Theatre''' was a cine-theatre in [[Anderston Cross]], [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. Originally known as the Victoria Music Hall, then the Tivoli Variety Theatre, and co-founded by a grandson of [[James Baylis]] of the [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow]] it opened in 1899 presenting [[Musicals]], [[variety shows]] and [[pantomimes]]. When it was rebuilt in 1904 it changed to operate as a cine-variety under the name of Gaiety Theatre, becoming a full cinema in 1935. The Beatles appeared there in 1963. The cinema closed in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/glasgow-empire/theglasgowempirestory.htm|publisher=University of Glasgow|title=Glasgow Gaeity theatre|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Tivoli.htm|title=The Glasgow Gaiety|accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with the Gaiety Theatre, Sauchiehall Street, which became the Empire Theatre.

''Orange Parades: The Politics of Ritual, Tradition and Control'', Pluto Press (2000), p. 94; {{ISBN|0-74531-413-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities attempted to suppress this protest campaign and were accused of [[police brutality]]; it was also met with violence from loyalists, who alleged it was a republican front. Increasing inter-communal violence, and conflict between nationalist youths and police, eventually led to [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|riots in August 1969]] and the [[Operation Banner|deployment of British troops]]. Some Catholics initially welcomed the army as a more neutral force, but it soon came to be seen as hostile and biased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alphahistory.com/northernireland/operation-banner Operation Banner], alphahistory.com. Retrieved 18 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of armed [[Paramilitary|paramilitary organisations]] led to the subsequent warfare over the next three decades.

The main [[Directory of the Northern Ireland Troubles|participants in the Troubles]] were republican paramilitaries such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA); loyalist paramilitaries such as the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA); British state security forces – the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC); and political activists and politicians. The security forces of the Republic played a smaller role. Republican paramilitaries carried out a guerrilla campaign against the British security forces, as well as a bombing campaign against infrastructure, commercial and political targets. Loyalists targeted republicans/nationalists, and attacked the wider Catholic community in what they claimed was retaliation. At times there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat violence. The British security forces undertook both a policing and a [[counter-insurgency]] role, primarily against republicans. There were some incidents of collusion between British security forces and loyalists. The Troubles also involved numerous riots, mass protests and acts of [[civil disobedience]], and led to [[Segregation in Northern Ireland|segregation]] and the creation of [[no-go area]]s.

More than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were civilians, 32% were members of the British security forces, and 16% were members of paramilitary groups.&lt;ref name=suttonstatus/&gt; There has been sporadic violence since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, including [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|a campaign by anti-ceasefire republicans]].&lt;ref name="Ireland 1999, page 221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elliot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/deathsfrom2002draft.htm|title=Draft List of Deaths Related to the Conflict (2003–present)|accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Troubles" refers to the three-decade conflict between [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]]s (mainly self-identified as Irish or Roman Catholic) and [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]s (mainly self-identified as
British or Protestant). The term "Troubles" had previously been used in conjunction with the 17th century [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]],{{efn|The "troubles" was used to describe the 17th century [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] by all three national parliaments. For example, after the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] in 1660 the English ''[[S:An act of free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion|Act of free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion]]'' starts with "The King's most excellent Majesty, taking into his gracious and serious consideration the long and great troubles..."; as does the similar act in Scotland: "The king's most excellent majesty, considering that by the late troubles diverse of his subjects..." {{harv|Scottish Parliament|1662}}; and by the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] to describe the same period in ''An Act for the Conformation of Marriages'' (12 C. 2, 33 Eng.): "...marriages since the beginning of the late troubles..." {{harv|Irish Parliament|1794|p=137}}.}}

The [[British government]]'s position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Nationalists regard the state forces as forces of occupation or partisan [[combatants]] in the conflict. The British security forces focused on republican paramilitaries and activists, and the "Ballast" investigation by the [[Police Ombudsman]] confirmed that British forces colluded on several occasions with loyalist paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and furthermore obstructed the course of justice when claims of collusion and murder were investigated.&lt;ref name="Ballast"&gt;[http://www.policeOmbudsman.org//PublicationsUploads/BALLAST%20PUBLIC%20STATEMENT%2022-01-07%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf The Ballast report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041216/http://www.policeombudsman.org//Publicationsuploads/BALLAST%20PUBLIC%20STATEMENT%2022-01-07%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }}: "the Police Ombudsman has concluded that this was collusion by certain police officers with identified UVF informants".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]] that included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations, the complete decommissioning of the IRA's weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of the British Army from the streets and sensitive [[Irish border]] areas such as [[County Armagh|South Armagh]] and [[Fermanagh]], as agreed by the signatories to the [[Belfast Agreement]] (commonly known as the "Good Friday Agreement"). One part of the Agreement is that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom unless a majority of the Northern Irish electorate vote otherwise.&lt;ref name="Parliament"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1993-12-15/Debate-1.html Parliamentary debate]: "The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of [[Principle of consent|consent]], freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish."&lt;/ref&gt; It also established the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], a devolved power-sharing government, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties.

Although the number of active participants was relatively small, the Troubles affected many in Northern Ireland on a daily basis; their impact sometimes spread to England and the Republic of Ireland, and, occasionally, to parts of mainland Europe.&lt;ref name="holliday"&gt;Laurel Holliday.

==Background==

===1609–1791===
[[File:De slag aan de Boyne (Ierland) tussen Jacobus II en Willem III, 12 juli 1690 Rijksmuseum SK-A-605.jpeg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Boyne]] (12 July 1690) by [[Jan van Huchtenburg]]]]
In 1609, Scottish and English [[settler]]s, known as ''planters'', were given land [[Escheat|escheated]] from the native Irish in the [[Plantation of Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/03/12/northern.ireland/index.html|title=Out of trouble: How diplomacy brought peace to Northern Ireland|publisher=CNN|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coupled with Protestant immigration to "unplanted" areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and Down, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the "planters", leading in turn to two bloody religious conflicts known as the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (1641–1653) and the [[Williamite war in Ireland|Williamite war]] (1689–1691), both of which resulted in Protestant victories.

[[Anglican]] dominance in Ireland was ensured by the passage of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] that curtailed the religious, legal, and political rights of anyone (including both Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, such as [[Presbyterian]]s) who did not conform to the state church, the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]]. As the Penal Laws started to be phased out in the latter part of the 18th century, there was more competition for land, as restrictions were lifted on the [[Irish Catholic]] ability to rent. With Roman Catholics allowed to buy land and enter trades from which they had formerly been banned, tensions arose resulting in the Protestant "[[Peep O'Day Boys]]"&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Frank Wright. ''Ulster: Two Lands, One Soil'', 1996, p. 17.&lt;!-- publishing info and ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Catholic "[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]". This created polarisation between the communities and a dramatic reduction in reformers among Protestants, many of whom had been growing more receptive to democratic reform.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

===1791–1912===
Following the foundation of the [[Irish republican|republican]] [[Society of the United Irishmen]] by Presbyterians, Catholics, and liberal Anglicans, and the resulting failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants continued. The [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding the Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], dates from this period and remains active to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1422212.stm|title=Profile: The Orange Order|publisher=BBC News|date=4 July 2001|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 1801 [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]], a new political framework was formed with the abolition of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] and incorporation of Ireland into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The result was a closer tie between Anglicans and the formerly republican Presbyterians as part of a "loyal" Protestant community. Although [[Catholic Emancipation]] was achieved in 1829, largely eliminating official discrimination against Roman Catholics (then around 75% of Ireland's population), Dissenters, and Jews, the [[Repeal Association]]'s campaign to repeal the 1801 Union failed.

In the late 19th century, the [[Home Rule movement]] was created and served to define the divide between most nationalists (usually Catholics), who sought the restoration of an Irish Parliament, and most unionists (usually Protestants), who were afraid of being a minority under a Catholic-dominated Irish Parliament and who tended to support continuing union with Britain.

Unionists and Home Rule advocates were the main political factions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=English|first=Richard|title=Irish Freedom: The History of Nationalism in Ireland|publisher=Pan Books|date=2006|pages = 200–231|isbn=978-0-330-42759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the campaign for Home Rule which started in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1912, unionists led by [[Edward Carson]] signed the [[Ulster Covenant]] and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. To this end, they formed the paramilitary [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF).&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

In response, nationalists led by [[Eoin MacNeill]] formed the [[Irish Volunteers]], whose goal was to oppose the UVF and ensure enactment of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] in the event of British or unionist recalcitrance. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 and [[Ireland and World War I|Ireland's involvement in the war]] temporarily averted possible civil war in Ireland and delayed the resolution of the question of Irish independence. Home Rule, although passed in the British Parliament with [[Royal Assent]], was suspended for the duration of the war.

The Irish Volunteers split, with a majority, called [[National Volunteers]], joining Irish regiments of the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]]. Many of those who stayed were radical nationalists, among them [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] infiltrators. From these ranks came those who launched the [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin in 1916, led by [[Padraig Pearse]] and [[James Connolly]]. Two and a half years after the executions of fifteen of the Rising's leaders, the separatist [[Sinn Féin]] party won the December 1918 [[Irish general election, 1918|Irish general election]] with 48% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919 [[First Dáil]] (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|threat of conscription for First World War service]]. The [[Irish War for Independence]] followed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the [[Irish Free State]], which comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties. In [[Ulster]], particularly in the six counties which became [[Northern Ireland]], Sinn Féin fared relatively poorly in the 1918 election, and unionists won a majority.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

The [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] partitioned the island of Ireland into two separate jurisdictions, [[Southern Ireland (1921–1922)|Southern Ireland]] and Northern Ireland, both devolved regions of the United Kingdom. This [[partition of Ireland]] was confirmed when the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] exercised its right in December 1922 under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921 to ''"opt out"'' of the newly established Irish Free State.&lt;ref name="Parliament"/&gt; A part of the treaty signed in 1922 mandated that a boundary commission would sit to decide where the frontier of the northern state would be in relation to its southern neighbour. After the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922–1923, this part of the treaty was given less priority by the new Dublin government led by [[W. T. Cosgrave]], and was quietly dropped. As counties [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] and border areas of [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and [[County Down|Down]] were mainly nationalist, the [[Irish Boundary Commission]] could reduce Northern Ireland to four counties or less.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

Northern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom, albeit under a separate system of government whereby it was given its own [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|parliament]] and [[Devolution|devolved government]]. While this arrangement met the desires of unionists to remain part of the United Kingdom, nationalists largely viewed the partition of Ireland as an illegal and arbitrary division of the island against the will of the majority of its people. They argued that the Northern Ireland state was neither legitimate nor democratic, but created with a deliberately [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] unionist majority. Catholics initially composed about 35% of its population.&lt;ref name="familiesatwar"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Taylor|title=Families at War|publisher=BBC|date=1989|page=10|isbn=0-563-20787-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 557 people, mostly Catholics, were killed in political or sectarian violence from 1920 to 1922 in the six counties that would become Northern Ireland, both during and after the Irish War of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=English|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard English|title=Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2003|pages=39–40|isbn=0-19-517753-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxJutBLDxg0C&amp;pg=PR3|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cresc.ac.uk/medialibrary/workingpapers/wp122.pdf |format=PDF |title=CRESC Working Paper Series : Working Paper No. 122 |website=Cresc.ac.uk |accessdate=3 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101170441/http://www.cresc.ac.uk/medialibrary/workingpapers/wp122.pdf |archivedate=1 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; communal strife between Catholics and Protestants, with some historians describing this violence, especially that in [[Belfast]], as a [[pogrom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6318325/Facts_and_Figures_of_the_Belfast_Pogroms_G.B._Kenna_1922 |title=Facts and Figures of the Belfast Pogroms G.B.

A marginalised remnant of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] survived the [[Irish Civil War]]. This would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland. Although the IRA was proscribed on both sides of the new [[Irish border]], it remained ideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free State governments by force of arms to unify Ireland. The [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]] passed the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to do virtually anything seen as necessary to re-establish or preserve law and order. The Act continued to be used against nationalists long after the violence of this period had come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Laura K. Dohonue.

The two sides' positions became strictly defined following this period. From a unionist perspective, Northern Ireland's nationalists were inherently disloyal and determined to force unionists into a united Ireland. This threat was seen as justifying preferential treatment of unionists in housing, employment and other fields. The prevalence of larger families and thus the potential for a more rapid population growth among Catholics was seen as a threat. Unionist governments ignored [[Edward Carson]]'s warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included severe rioting in Belfast in the 1930s and 1950s, and the IRA's brief [[Northern Campaign (IRA)|Northern Campaign]] in the 1940s and [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]] between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists. After the IRA called off its campaign in 1962, Northern Ireland became relatively stable for a brief period.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

==Late 1960s==
{{See also|Timeline of the Northern Ireland Troubles and peace process}}
There is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles. Different writers have suggested different dates. These include the formation of the modern [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/faq/faq2.htm#when|title=Beginning of the Troubles, CAIN|publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the '[[Battle of the Bogside]]' on 12 August 1969 or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

===Civil rights campaign and unionist backlash===
{{Main article|Northern Ireland civil rights movement}}

[[File:Civil Rights mural, Bogside - geograph.org.uk - 1159245.jpg|thumb|A civil rights mural in Derry]]
In the mid-1960s, a non-violent [[Northern Ireland civil-rights movement (1960s)|civil rights campaign]] began in Northern Ireland. It comprised groups such as the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA), the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] (CSJ), the Derry Citizens' Action Committee (DCAC) and [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]],&lt;ref name="NICRA"/&gt; whose stated goals were:
* an end to job discrimination – it showed evidence that Catholics/nationalists were less likely to be given certain jobs, especially government jobs
* an end to discrimination in housing allocation – it showed evidence that unionist-controlled local councils allocated housing to Protestants ahead of Catholics/nationalists
* [[one man, one vote]] – in Northern Ireland, only householders could vote in local elections, while in the rest of the United Kingdom all adults could vote
* an end to [[gerrymandering]] of [[Electoral district|electoral boundaries]] – this meant that nationalists had less voting power than unionists, even where nationalists were a majority
* reform of the police force ([[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]) – it was over 90% Protestant and criticised for [[sectarianism]] and [[police brutality]]
* repeal of the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] – this allowed police to search without a warrant, arrest and imprison people without charge or trial, ban any assemblies or parades, and ban any publications; the Act was used almost exclusively against nationalists&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/pdfs/truth.pdf Northern Ireland: The Plain Truth (second edition)], Campaign for Social Justice in Northern Ireland, 15 June 1969.

Some suspected and accused NICRA of being a republican front-group whose ultimate goal was to unite Ireland. Although republicans and some members of the IRA (then led by [[Cathal Goulding]] and pursuing a non-violent agenda) helped to create and drive the movement, they did not control it and were not a dominant faction within it.&lt;ref name="coogan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Pat Coogan|title=The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal and the Search for Peace|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English (2003), pp. 91, 94, 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cameron"&gt;Lord Cameron, ''Disturbances in Northern Ireland: Report of the Commission appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland'' (Belfast, 1969).

In March and April 1966, Irish nationalists/republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]]. On 8 March, a group of Irish republicans dynamited [[Nelson's Pillar]] in Dublin. At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists warned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="cain1800"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ptuvf"&gt;''Loyalists'', pp. 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1966, loyalists led by [[Ian Paisley]], a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the [[Ulster Constitution Defence Committee]] (UCDC). It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the [[Ulster Protestant Volunteers]] (UPV)&lt;ref name="cain1800"/&gt; to oust [[Terence O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of the Maine|Terence O'Neill]], [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]]. Although O'Neill was a unionist, they viewed him as being too 'soft' on the civil rights movement and opposed his policies.&lt;ref name=tricolour&gt;Andrew Boyd. ''Holy War in Belfast''.

At the same time, a loyalist group calling itself the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) emerged in the [[Shankill Road|Shankill]] area of Belfast. It was led by [[Gusty Spence]], a former British soldier. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV.&lt;ref name="jordan"&gt;Hugh Jordan.

On 20 June 1968, civil rights activists (including [[Austin Currie]], a nationalist [[Member of Parliament|MP]]) protested against housing discrimination by [[squatting]] in a house in [[Caledon, County Tyrone|Caledon]]. The local council had allocated the house to an unmarried 19-year-old Protestant (Emily Beattie, the secretary of a local UUP politician) instead of either of two large Catholic families with children.&lt;ref name="cain1968"&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch68.htm Chronology of the Conflict: 1968], cain.ulst.ac.uk.

[[File:Civil Rights Commemoration, Coalisland - geograph.org.uk - 1413288.jpg|thumb|A monument to Northern Ireland's first civil rights march]]

On 24 August 1968, the civil rights movement held its first civil rights march, from [[Coalisland]] to [[Dungannon]]. Many more marches were held over the following year. Loyalists (especially members of the UPV) attacked some of the marches and held counter-demonstrations in a bid to get the marches banned.&lt;ref name="cain1968"/&gt; Because of the lack of police reaction to the attacks, nationalists saw the RUC, almost wholly Protestant, as backing the loyalists and allowing the attacks to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serve.com/pfc/policing/submiss1.html|title=Submission to the Independent Commission into Policing|publisher=Serve.com|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 1968, a civil rights march in Derry was banned by the Northern Ireland government.&lt;ref name="derrymarch"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Derry March: Main events of the day|author=Martin Melaugh|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/derry/events.htm|publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)|accessdate=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When marchers defied the ban, RUC officers surrounded the marchers and beat them indiscriminately and without provocation.

A few days later, a student civil rights group – [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]] – was formed in Belfast.&lt;ref name="cain1968"/&gt; In late November, O'Neill promised the civil rights movement some concessions, but these were seen as too little by nationalists and too much by loyalists. On 1 January 1969, People's Democracy began a four-day march from Belfast to Derry, which was repeatedly harassed and attacked by loyalists. At [[Burntollet Bridge incident|Burntollet Bridge]] the marchers were attacked by about 200 loyalists, including some off-duty police officers, armed with iron bars, bricks and bottles in a pre-planned ambush. When the march reached Derry City it was again attacked.

In March and April 1969, loyalists bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, blaming them on the dormant IRA and elements of the civil rights movement. Some attacks left much of Belfast without power and water. Loyalists hoped the bombings would force O'Neill to resign and bring an end to any concessions to nationalists.&lt;ref name="cain1969"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch69.htm|title=Chronology of the Conflict: 1969|publisher=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Cusack &amp; Henry McDonald.

===August 1969 riots and aftermath===
{{main article|1969 Northern Ireland riots}}
On 19 April there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC and loyalists in the Bogside. RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an uninvolved Catholic civilian, and ferociously beat him along with two of his teenage daughters and a family friend.&lt;ref name="cain1969"/&gt; One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/police/ombudsman/po041001devenny.pdf Police Ombudsman statement on Devenny investigation], cain.ulst.ac.uk. Retrieved 4 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries. On 13 July, RUC officers beat a Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), during clashes in [[Dungiven]]. He died of his injuries the next day.&lt;ref name="cain1969"/&gt;

On 12 August, the loyalist [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] were allowed to march along the edge of the Bogside. Taunts and missiles were exchanged between the loyalists and nationalist residents. After being bombarded with stones and petrol bombs from nationalists, the RUC, backed by loyalists, tried to storm the Bogside. The RUC used [[CS gas]], armoured vehicles and water cannons, but were kept at bay by hundreds of nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Stetler. [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/battlebogside/stetler/stetler70.htm Extract from The Battle of Bogside (1970)], cain.ulst.ac.uk. Retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous fighting, which became known as the [[Battle of the Bogside]], lasted for two days.

In response to events in Derry, nationalists held protests at RUC bases in Belfast and elsewhere. Some of these led to clashes with the RUC and attacks on RUC bases. In Belfast, loyalists responded by invading nationalist districts, burning houses and businesses. There were gun battles between nationalists and the RUC, and between nationalists and loyalists. A group of about 30 IRA members was involved in the fighting in Belfast. The RUC deployed [[Shorland armoured car]]s mounted with heavy [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]]. The Shorlands twice opened fire on a block of flats in a nationalist district, killing a nine-year-old boy, Patrick Rooney. RUC officers opened fire on rioters in [[Armagh]], Dungannon and Coalisland.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

During the riots, on 13 August, [[Taoiseach]] [[Jack Lynch]] made a television address. He condemned the RUC and said that the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] "can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse". He called for a [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force to be deployed and said that [[Irish Army]] [[field hospital]]s were being set up at the border in [[County Donegal]] near Derry. Lynch added that Irish re-unification would be the only permanent solution. Some interpreted the speech as a threat of military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Ranelagh|title=A Short History of Ireland|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1994|edition=2, illustrated, revised|page=272|isbn=978-0-521-46944-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the riots, Lynch ordered the Irish Army to plan for a possible [[humanitarian intervention]] in Northern Ireland.

Nationalists initially welcomed the British Army, as they did not trust the RUC. Despite the British government's attempt to do "nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community" and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls curfew and a situation that was described at the time as "an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists" meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=WxJutBLDxg0C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA|last=English|first=Richard|date=9 December 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195177534|location=|pages=136|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the riots, the '[[Hunt Report|Hunt Committee]]' was set up to examine the RUC. It published its report on 12 October, recommending that the RUC become an unarmed force and the B Specials be disbanded. That night, loyalists took to the streets of Belfast in protest at the report. During violence in the Shankill, UVF members shot dead RUC officer Victor Arbuckle. He was the first RUC officer to be killed during the Troubles.&lt;ref&gt;[[David McKittrick]].

In 1970 through 1972 an explosion of [[political violence]] occurred in Northern Ireland. The violence peaked in 1972, when nearly 500 people, just over half of them civilians, lost their lives, the worst year in the entire conflict.&lt;ref name="suttonindexofdeaths"&gt;[http://www.cain.ulst.ac.uk Sutton Index of Deaths], cain.ulst.ac.uk. Retrieved 3 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place in [[Derry]], blocking access to what was known as [[Free Derry]]; 16 of these were impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles.&lt;ref name="b83"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter|title=Brits: The War Against the IRA|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date=2001|page=83|isbn=0-7475-5806-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the nationalist/republican "[[no-go area]]s" were controlled by one of the two factions of the Irish Republican Army—the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and [[Official Irish Republican Army|Official IRA]]. There are several reasons offered for why violence escalated in these years.

Unionists claim the main reason was the formation of the Provisional IRA and Official IRA, particularly the former. These two groups were formed when [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)#The 1960s: Marxist tendency and the 1969 split|the IRA split]] into the 'Provisional' and 'Official' factions. While the older IRA had embraced non-violent civil agitation,&lt;ref name="bishopmallie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Bishop &amp; Eamonn Mallie|title=The Provisional IRA|publisher=Corgi Books|date=1987|pages=52–54|isbn=0-552-13337-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new Provisional IRA was determined to wage "armed struggle" against British rule in Northern Ireland. The new IRA was willing to take on the role of "defenders of the Catholic community",&lt;ref&gt;English (2003), pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt; rather than seeking working-class ecumenical unity across both communities.

Nationalists point to a number of events in these years to explain the upsurge in violence. One such incident was the [[Falls Curfew]] in July 1970, when 3,000 troops imposed a curfew on the nationalist Lower Falls area of Belfast, firing more than 1,500 rounds of ammunition in gun battles with the Official IRA and killing four people. Another was the introduction of internment without trial in 1971 (of 350 initial detainees, none were Protestants).&lt;ref name="rkwalker"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.K. Walker|title=The Hunger Strikes|publisher=Lagan Books|date=2006|page=27|isbn=1-904684-18-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, due to poor intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bonner|title=Executive Measures, Terrorism and National Security: Have the Rules of the Game Changed?|publisher=Ashgate|date=2007|page=89|isbn=978-0-7546-4756-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; very few of those interned were actually republican activists at the time, but some internees became increasingly radicalised as a result of their experiences.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

=== Bloody Sunday ===
A third event "[[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]", was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed male civilians by the British Army at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972 (a fourteenth man died of his injuries some months later) while more than fourteen{{how many?|specify quantity|date=November 2017}} other civilians were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/deadinj.htm|title=CAIN: Events: 'Bloody Sunday' – Names of Dead and Injured|last=Melaugh|first=Dr Martin|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walsh|first1=Dermot|title=Bloody Sunday and the Rule of Law in Northern Ireland|date=2000|publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan|isbn=0717130851|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4AMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The march had been organised by the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]], also known as "1 Para".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/widgery.htm|title=CAIN: [Widgery Report] Report of the Tribunal appointed to inquire into events on Sundy 30 January 1972|last=Melaugh|first=Dr Martin|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was one of the most prominent events that occurred during the Northern Irish Conflict as it was recorded as the largest number of civilians killed in a single shooting incident during the Troubles, though more were killed overall in the 1998 Omagh bombing incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/majinc.htm|title=CAIN: Violence: List of Significant Violent Incidents|last=Melaugh|first=Dr Martin|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloody Sunday greatly increased the hostility of Catholics and Irish nationalists towards the British military and government while significantly elevating tensions during the Northern Irish Conflict. As a result, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) gained more support, especially through rising numbers of recruits in the local areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?|last=|first=|publisher=Peter Pringle and Phillip Jacobson|year=2000|isbn=1-84115-316-8|location=London: Fourth Estate.|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the introduction of internment there were numerous gun battles between the British army and both the Provisional and Official IRA. Between 1971 and 1975, 1,981 people were interned; 1,874 were Catholic/republican, while 107 were Protestant/loyalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/intern/sum.htm|title=Internment – Summary of Main Events|publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were widespread allegations of abuse and even [[torture]] of detainees,&lt;ref&gt;Oren Gross &amp; [[Fionnuala Ní Aoláin]]''.

The Provisional IRA, or "Provos", as they became known, sought to establish itself as the defender of the nationalist community.&lt;ref name="moloney"&gt;[[Ed Moloney]].

The Provisional IRA's offensive campaign began in early 1971 when the Army Council sanctioned attacks on the British Army.&lt;ref name=English137&gt;English (2003), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the Provisional IRA killed approximately 100 members of the security forces, wounded 500 others, and carried out approximately 1,300 bombings,&lt;ref name="bobrien"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan O'Brien|title=The Long War – The IRA and Sinn Féin|publisher=O'Brien Press, Ltd.|date=1995|page=119|isbn=0-86278-425-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly against commercial targets which they considered "the artificial economy".&lt;ref name="suttonindexofdeaths"/&gt;&lt;ref name=English137/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

In the same year, the Official IRA killed dozens of soldiers and wounded several more, mostly through gun attacks, according to the CAIN project's Sutton database. The Official IRA called off its campaign in May 1972.&lt;ref name="suttonindexofdeaths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/30/newsid_2973000/2973759.stm|title=1972: Official IRA declares ceasefire|publisher=BBC News|date=30 May 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British troop concentrations peaked at 20:1000 of the civilian population, the highest ratio found in the history of [[counterinsurgency]] warfare, higher than that achieved during the "[[Malayan Emergency]]"/"Anti-British National Liberation War", which the conflict is frequently compared to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592318.2013.866423|title=Counterinsurgency force ratio: strategic utility or nominal necessity|first=Riley M.|last=Moore|date=1 October 2013|publisher=|journal=Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies|volume=24|issue=5|pages=857–878|doi=10.1080/09592318.2013.866423}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operation Motorman]], the military operation for the surge, was the biggest military operation in Ireland since the [[Irish War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="CAIN1972"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch72.htm|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1972|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, almost 22,000 British forces were involved,&lt;ref name="CAIN1972"/&gt; In the days before 31 July, about 4,000 extra troops were brought into Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="CAIN1972"/&gt;

Despite a temporary ceasefire in 1972 and talks with British officials, the Provisionals were determined to continue their campaign until the achievement of a united Ireland. The UK government in London, believing the Northern Ireland administration incapable of containing the security situation, sought to take over the control of law and order there. As this was unacceptable to the Northern Ireland Government, the British government pushed through emergency legislation (the [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972]]) which suspended the unionist-controlled [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] parliament and government, and introduced "[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]" from London. Direct rule was initially intended as a short-term measure; the medium-term strategy was to restore self-government to Northern Ireland on a basis that was acceptable to both unionists and nationalists. Agreement proved elusive, however, and the Troubles continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s within a context of political deadlock. The existence of "no-go areas" in Belfast and Derry was a challenge to the authority of the British government in Northern Ireland, and the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control over the areas in [[Operation Motorman]] on 31 July 1972.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

===Sunningdale Agreement and UWC strike===
In June 1973, following the publication of a British [[White Paper]] and a [[Northern Irish sovereignty referendum, 1973|referendum]] in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]], was established. [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 1973|Elections]] to this were held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the [[Sunningdale Agreement]], which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called "Irish dimension" involving the Republic. The agreement provided for "power-sharing" – the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists—and a "Council of Ireland" – a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic, designed to encourage cross-border co-operation. The similarities between the Sunningdale Agreement and the [[Good Friday Agreement|Belfast Agreement]] of 1998 has led some commentators to characterise the latter as "Sunningdale for slow learners".&lt;ref name="Ó Ceallaigh"&gt;Daltún Ó Ceallaigh. [http://homepage.eircom.net/~mheas/id-art.htm "Along The road to Irish unity?"], ''Irish Democrat'', April/May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion has been criticised by political scientists one of whom stated that "..there are... significant differences between them [Sunningdale and Belfast], both in terms of content and the circumstances surrounding their negotiation, implementation, and operation".&lt;ref name="wilford"&gt;Rick Wilford.

Unionists were split over Sunningdale, which was also opposed by the IRA, whose goal remained nothing short of an end to the existence of Northern Ireland as part of the UK. Many unionists opposed the concept of power-sharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with those (nationalists) who sought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was the unionist opposition to the "Irish dimension" and the Council of Ireland, which was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by a young SDLP councillor, [[Hugh Logue]], to an audience at [[Trinity College Dublin]] that Sunningdale was the tool "by which the Unionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland" also damaged chances of significant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, [[Brian Faulkner]] was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by [[Harry West]]. A [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|UK general election in February 1974]] gave the anti-Sunningdale unionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan "Dublin is only a Sunningdale away", and the result galvanised their opposition: they won 11 of the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to nationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

Ultimately, however, the Sunningdale Agreement was brought down by mass action on the part of loyalist paramilitaries (primarily the Ulster Defence Association, at that time over 20,000 strong {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and workers, who formed the [[Ulster Workers' Council]]. They organised a [[general strike]]: the [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]]. This severely curtailed business in Northern Ireland and cut off essential services such as water and electricity. Nationalists argue that the British Government did not do enough to break this strike and uphold the Sunningdale initiative. There is evidence that the strike was further encouraged by [[MI5]], a part of their campaign to 'disorientate' British prime minister [[Harold Wilson]]'s government.&lt;ref&gt;''Keeping Secrets'', [[London Review of Books]], April 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with such opposition, the pro-Sunningdale unionists resigned from the power-sharing government and the new regime collapsed. Three days into the UWC strike, on 17 May 1974, two UVF teams from the Belfast and [[UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade|Mid-Ulster]] brigades&lt;ref name="taylorloyalists"&gt;[[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]].

Ninety minutes later, a fourth car bomb exploded in [[Monaghan]], killing seven additional people. Nobody has ever been convicted for these attacks.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

===Proposal of an independent Northern Ireland===
Wilson had secretly met with the IRA in 1971 while leader of the opposition; his government in late 1974 and early 1975 again met with the IRA to negotiate a ceasefire. During the meetings the parties discussed the possibility of British withdrawal from an independent Northern Ireland. The failure of Sunningdale led to the serious consideration in London until November 1975 of independence. Had the withdrawal occurred —which Wilson supported but others, including [[James Callaghan]], opposed – the region would have become a separate [[Dominion]] of the [[British Commonwealth]].{{r|fitzgerald2006}}

The British negotiations with an illegal organisation angered the Irish government. It did not know their proceedings but feared that the British were considering abandoning Northern Ireland. Foreign Minister [[Garret FitzGerald]] discussed in a memorandum of June 1975 the possibilities of orderly withdrawal and independence, [[Repartition of Ireland|repartition of the island]] or a collapse of Northern Ireland into civil war and anarchy. The memorandum preferred a negotiated independence as the best of the three "worst case scenarios", but concluded that the Irish government could do little.{{r|fitzgerald2006}}

The Irish government had already failed to prevent the IRA from burning down the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Dublin|British Embassy]] in 1972. It believed that it could not enlarge the country's small army of 12,500 men without negative consequences. A civil war in Northern Ireland would cause many deaths there and severe consequences for the Republic, as the public would demand that it intervene to protect nationalists. FitzGerald warned Callaghan that the failure to intervene, despite Ireland's inability to do so, would "threaten democratic government in the Republic", which in turn jeopardised British and European security against Communist and other foreign nations.{{r|fitzgerald2006}}

The Irish government so dreaded the consequences of an independent Northern Ireland that FitzGerald refused to ask the British not to withdraw—as he feared that openly discussing the issue could permit the British to proceed—and other members of government opposed the Irish Cabinet even discussing what FitzGerald referred to as a "doomsday scenario". He wrote in 2006 that "Neither then nor since has public opinion in Ireland realised how close to disaster our whole island came during the last two years of Harold Wilson's premiership."&lt;ref name="fitzgerald2006"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ria.ie/cgi-bin/ria/papers/100573.pdf|title=The 1974–5 Threat of a British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland|author=Garret FitzGerald|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|year=2006|volume=17|pages=141–150|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926091138/http://www.ria.ie/cgi-bin/ria/papers/100573.pdf|archivedate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-1970s===
[[File:CW. Derry, IRSP-INLA möte.JPG|thumb|The [[Irish National Liberation Army]] began operations in the mid-1970s.]]
[[Merlyn Rees]], the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], had lifted the proscription against the UVF in April 1974. In December, one month after the [[Birmingham pub bombings]] which killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year. The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings actually escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups. This made 1975 one of the "bloodiest years of the conflict".&lt;ref name="taylorloyalists"/&gt;

On 31 July 1975 at Buskhill, outside [[Newry]], the popular Irish cabaret band "[[Miami Showband killings|The Miami Showband]]" was returning home to Dublin after a gig in [[Banbridge]] when it was ambushed by gunmen from the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade wearing British Army uniforms at a bogus military roadside checkpoint on the main [[A1 road (Northern Ireland)|A1 road]]. Three of the bandmembers, two Catholics and a Protestant, were shot dead, while two of the UVF men were killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus detonated prematurely. The following January, eleven Protestant workers were gunned down in [[Kingsmill massacre|Kingsmill, South Armagh]] after having been ordered off their bus by an armed republican gang, which called itself the [[South Armagh Republican Action Force]]. One man survived despite being shot 18 times, leaving ten fatalities. These killings were reportedly in retaliation to a loyalist double shooting attack against the [[Reavey and O'Dowd killings|Reavey and O'Dowd families]] the previous night.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="suttonindexofdeaths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

The violence continued through the rest of the 1970s. The British Government reinstated the ban against the UVF in October 1975, making it once more an illegal organisation. When the Provisional IRA's December 1974 ceasefire had ended in early 1976 and it had returned to violence, it had lost the hope that it had felt in the early 1970s that it could force a rapid British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, and instead developed a strategy known as the "Long War", which involved a less intense but more sustained campaign of violence that could continue indefinitely. The [[Official IRA]] ceasefire of 1972, however, became permanent, and the "Official" movement eventually evolved into the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]], which rejected violence completely. However, a splinter from the "Officials"—the [[Irish National Liberation Army]]—continued a campaign of violence in 1974.&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

===Late 1970s===
By the late 1970s, [[war-weariness]] was visible in both communities. One manifestation of this was the formation of a group known as "[[Community for Peace People|Peace People]]", which won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1976. The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence. Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they appealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to security forces.&lt;ref name="dooley"&gt;Brian Dooley. ''Black and Green: Fight for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland and Black America'', pg 129; {{ISBN|978-0-74531-295-8}}.&lt;!--publishing info needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The decade ended with a double attack by the IRA against the British. On 27 August 1979, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] while on holiday in Mullaghmore, [[County Sligo]], was killed by a bomb planted on board his boat. Three other people were also killed: Lady Brabourne, the elderly mother of Mountbatten's son-in-law; and two teenagers, a grandson of Mountbatten and a local boatman.&lt;ref name="suttonindexofdeaths"/&gt; That same day, eighteen British soldiers, mostly members of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], were killed by two remote-controlled bombs in the [[Warrenpoint ambush]] at [[Warrenpoint|Warrenpoint, County Down]].&lt;ref name="taylorloyalists"/&gt;

[[File:Hunger Strike.JPG|thumb|A republican mural in Belfast commemorating the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|hunger strikes of 1981]].]]
Successive British Governments, having failed to achieve a political settlement, tried to "normalise" Northern Ireland. Aspects included the removal of [[internment]] without trial and the removal of political status for paramilitary prisoners. From 1972 onward, paramilitaries were tried in juryless [[Diplock courts]] to avoid intimidation of jurors. On conviction, they were to be treated as ordinary criminals. Resistance to this policy among republican prisoners led to more than 500 of them in the [[Maze prison]] initiating the "[[blanket protest|blanket"]] and [[dirty protest|"dirty"]] protests. Their protests culminated in [[hunger strike]]s in 1980 and 1981, aimed at the restoration of political status, as well as other concessions.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

==1980s==
[[File:South Belfast 1981.jpg|alt=A picture of a city street with an army vehicle in the road.|left|thumb|British Army in South Belfast, 1981]]
In the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]], ten republican prisoners (seven from the Provisional IRA and three from the INLA) died of starvation. The first hunger striker to die, [[Bobby Sands]], was elected to Parliament on an [[Anti-H-Block]] ticket, as was his election agent [[Owen Carron]] following Sands' death. The hunger strikes resonated among many nationalists; over 100,000 people&lt;ref name="cainhsc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hunger Strike of 1981 – A Chronology of Main Events|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/chronology.htm|publisher=CAIN|accessdate=26 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended Sands' funeral mass in West Belfast and thousands attended those of the other hunger strikers. From an Irish republican perspective, the significance of these events was to demonstrate potential for a political and electoral strategy.&lt;ref&gt;English (2003), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the hunger strikes, Sinn Féin, which had become the Provisional IRA's political wing,&lt;ref name="cainhsc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taylorbehindthemask"&gt;[[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]].

In 1986, Sinn Féin recognised the legitimacy of the [[Irish Dáil]], which caused a small group of members to break away and form [[Republican Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

The IRA's "Long War" was boosted by large donations of arms from [[Libya]] in the 1980s (see [[Provisional IRA arms importation]]) due to [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s anger at [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]'s government for assisting the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] [[Reagan Administration|government]]'s [[1986 bombing of Libya|bombing of Tripoli]], which had killed one of Gaddafi's children, as well as by monies from pro-IRA partisans in the United States and elsewhere throughout the Irish diaspora.

The INLA was highly active in the early and mid-1980s. In 1982, it [[Droppin Well bombing|bombed a disco]] frequented by off-duty British soldiers, killing 11 soldiers and six civilians.&lt;ref name="suttonindexofdeaths"/&gt; One of the IRA's most high-profile actions in this period was the [[Brighton hotel bombing]] on 12 October 1984, when it set off a 100-pound bomb in the [[Grand Brighton Hotel]] in [[Brighton]], where politicians including Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] were staying for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference. The bomb, which exploded in the early hours of the morning, killed five people, including Conservative MP Sir [[Anthony Berry]] and the wife of [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury|Government Chief Whip]] [[John Wakeham]],&lt;ref name="suttonindexofdeaths"/&gt; and thirty-four others were injured, including Wakeham, Trade and Industry Secretary [[Norman Tebbit]], and Tebbit's wife, Margaret. Margaret Tebbit was left permanently paralysed, while her husband's injuries were less serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/12/newsid_2531000/2531583.stm|title=On This Day: 12 October 1984|publisher=BBC News|date=12 October 2000|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1985 in Newry, nine RUC officers, seven Protestants and two Catholics, were killed after a mortar attack on the police station in Corry Square. The attack was planned by the IRA South Armagh Brigade and an IRA unit in Newry. Nine shells were fired from a Mark 10 mortar which was bolted onto the back of a hijacked Ford van in Crossmaglen. Eight shells overshot the station, but the ninth hit a Portakabin which was being used as a canteen. On 8 November 1987, in [[Enniskillen]], [[County Fermanagh]], a Provisional IRA [[Enniskillen bombing|time bomb]] exploded during a parade on Remembrance Day to commemorate victims of World War One. The bomb went off by a cenotaph which was at the heart of the parade. Eleven people (ten civilians, including a pregnant woman, and one serving member of the RUC) were killed and 63 were injured. Former school headmaster Ronnie Hill was seriously injured in the bombing and slipped into a coma two days later, remaining in this condition for more than a decade before his death in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1093598.stm |title=NORTHERN IRELAND &amp;#124; IRA bomb victim buried |publisher=BBC News |date=30 December 2000 |accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA eventually apologised for what it claimed had been a mistake and that its target had been the British soldiers parading to the memorial. The unit which carried out the bombing was disbanded. Loyalist paramilitaries responded to the bombing with revenge attacks on Catholics, mostly civilians. Another bomb had been planted at nearby [[Tullyhommon]] at a parallel Remembrance Day commemoration but failed to detonate.&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

Four months after the Enniskillen attacks, three IRA volunteers were shot dead at a Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue in Gibraltar, the British colony attached to the south of Spain. This became known as [[Operation Flavius]]. Their funeral at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast was attacked by [[Michael Stone (loyalist)|Michael Stone]], a UDA member who threw grenades and fired shots as the coffin was lowered. The attack killed three people, including an IRA volunteer. Stone was jailed for life the following year but freed 11 years later under the Good Friday Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/24/newsid_2515000/2515041.stm On this day: Loyalist killer Michael Stone freed from Maze], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

When two British soldiers, David Howes and Derek Wood, drove into the joint funeral in Andersonstown being held for the three men killed by Stone, they were found to be armed, and were captured, taken away and shot dead. This became known as the [[Corporals killings]].&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

In the 1980s, loyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Ulster Defence Association and [[Ulster Resistance]], imported arms and explosives from South Africa.&lt;ref name="taylorloyalists"/&gt; The weapons obtained were divided between the UDA, the UVF and Ulster Resistance, although some of the weaponry (such as [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s) were hardly used. These killings were reportedly in response to the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] which gave the [[Irish government]] a "consultative role" in the government of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt; In 1987, the [[Irish People's Liberation Organisation]] (IPLO), a breakaway faction of the INLA, engaged in a bloody feud against the INLA which weakened the INLA's presence in some areas. By 1992, the IPLO was destroyed by the Provisionals for its involvement in drug dealing thus ending the feud.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

Around this time republicans alleged that a [[shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland|"shoot-to-kill policy"]] was in operation in Northern Ireland, in which tens of republican paramilitaries and one loyalist paramilitary were killed on active duty, usually by the SAS or RUC.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==1990s==
{{Main article|Northern Ireland peace process}}
Since the late 1980s, while the IRA continued its armed campaign, its political wing [[Sinn Féin]], led since 1983 by [[Gerry Adams]], sought a negotiated end to the conflict, although Adams accurately predicted that this would be a very long process. He predicted the war would last another 20 years. He conducted open talks with [[John Hume]] – the SDLP leader – and secret talks with government officials. Loyalists were also engaged in behind-the-scenes talks to end the violence, connecting with the British and Irish governments through Protestant clergy, in particular the Presbyterian minister, Reverend [[Roy Magee]] and Anglican Archbishop [[Robin Eames]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

When a French TV crew filmed the IRA at a training camp in Donegal, a representative of the General Headquarters Staff of the IRA was interviewed. He said the IRA would "[E]ventually sap the political will of the British government to remain in Ireland". {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Escalation in South Armagh===
The [[Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade|IRA's South Armagh Brigade]] had made the countryside village of [[Crossmaglen]] their stronghold since the 1970s. The surrounding villages of [[Silverbridge, County Armagh|Silverbridge]], [[Cullyhanna]], [[Cullaville]], [[Forkhill]], [[Jonesborough, County Armagh|Jonesborough]] and [[Creggan, County Armagh|Creggan]] were also IRA strongholds. In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter [[1978 British Army Gazelle downing|was shot down near Silverbridge]], killing Lieutenant Colonel [[Ian Corden-Lloyd]] of the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Chronology of the Conflict, 1978|work=Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN)|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch78.htm#Feb|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the IRA came up with a new plan to restrict British Army foot patrols near Crossmaglen. They developed [[South Armagh Sniper (1990–1997)|two sniper teams]] to attack British Army and RUC patrols.&lt;ref&gt;General Sir Michael Jackson.  [http://www.vilaweb.cat/media/attach/vwedts/docs/op_banner_analysis_released.pdf Operation Banner: An Analysis of Military Operations in Northern Ireland (2006)], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]], Army Code 71842. Chapter 2, p. 16, item 247.&lt;/ref&gt; They usually fired from an [[Improvised vehicle armour|improvised armoured car]] using a .50 BMG calibre [[Barrett M82|M82 sniper rifle]]. Signs were put up around South Armagh reading "Sniper at Work". The snipers killed a total of nine members of the security forces: seven soldiers and two constables. The last to be killed before the Good Friday Agreement (GFA), was a British soldier, bombardier Steven Restorick.

The IRA had developed the capacity to attack helicopters in South Armagh and elsewhere since the 1980s,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; including the 1990 [[1990 British Army Gazelle shootdown|shootdown of a Gazelle]] flying over the border between Tyrone and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]; there were no fatalities in that incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1jhAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LVkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2878,3517395&amp;hl=en|title=Soldiers hurt in IRA attack on helicopter|date=12 February 1990|accessdate=17 March 2015|work=Glasgow Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident involving British helicopters in South Armagh was the [[Battle of Newry Road]] in September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heroes of the Skies|author=Michael Ashcroft|publisher=Hachette UK|date=2012|isbn=0755363914|pages=355–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other [[1994 British Army Lynx shootdown|helicopters]], a British Army Lynx and a [[Royal Air Force]] Puma were shot down by [[Barrack buster|improvised mortar]] fire in 1994. The IRA set up checkpoints in South Armagh during this period, unchallenged by the security forces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bandit Country:The IRA and South Armagh|author=Toby Harnden|publisher=Coronet Books|date=2000|isbn=0-340-71737-8|location=London, UK|pages=358–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-06-08/Debate-5.html |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 8 Jun 1993 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |date=8 June 1993 |accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sniperatwork.jpg|thumbnail|'Sniper at Work' sign in Crossmaglen]]

===First ceasefire===
After a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994.
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Irish News - Shankill.jpg|thumbnail|Aftermath of the 1993 Shankill Road bombing]] --&gt;
The year leading up to the ceasefires was a particularly tense one, marked by atrocities. The UDA and UVF stepped up their attacks. The IRA responded with the [[Shankill Road bombing]] in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and one low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely. The UDA retaliated with mass shootings in nationalist areas such as [[Greysteel massacre|Greysteel]] and Castlerock. Twelve people were killed at Greysteel and Castlerock, all but two of whom were Catholic.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

On 16 June 1994, just before the ceasefires, the Irish National Liberation Army killed a UVF member in a gun attack on the Shankill Road. In revenge, three days later, the UVF killed six civilians in a shooting at a pub in [[Loughinisland|Loughinisland, County Down]]. The IRA, in the remaining month before its ceasefire, killed four senior loyalist paramilitaries, three from the UDA and one from the UVF. On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared a [[ceasefire]]. The loyalist paramilitaries, temporarily united in the "[[Combined Loyalist Military Command]]", reciprocated six weeks later. Although these ceasefires failed in the short run, they marked an effective end to large-scale political violence, as they paved the way for the final ceasefires.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jbb"/&gt;

In 1995, the United States appointed [[George J. Mitchell]] as the [[United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland]]. Mitchell was recognised as being more than a token envoy and someone representing a President ([[Bill Clinton]]) with a deep interest in events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2927845.stm|title=US policy and Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=8 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British and Irish governments agreed that Mitchell would chair an international commission on disarmament of paramilitary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03EEDD1139F933A05752C1A963958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=%22George+Mitchell%22+and+%22northern+Ireland%22&amp;st=nyt|title=A Break in the Irish Impasse|work=The New York Times|date=30 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second ceasefire===
On 9 February 1996, less than two years after the declaration of the ceasefire, the IRA revoked it with the [[1996 Docklands bombing|Docklands bombing]] in the Canary Wharf area of London, killing two people, injuring 39 others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/10/newsid_2539000/2539265.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY 1996: Docklands bomb ends IRA ceasefire|publisher=BBC News|date=10 February 1996|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and causing £85&amp;nbsp;million in damage to the city's financial centre. Sinn Féin blamed the failure of the ceasefire on the British Government's refusal to begin all-party negotiations until the IRA decommissioned its weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9602/n_ireland/10/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=IRA claims responsibility for London bombing|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:South Quay bombing - 9.2.96.jpg|alt=A picture of a large office building which has been very badly damaged.|thumb|The destruction caused by the Docklands bombing in London, 1996.]]
The attack was followed by several more, most notably the [[1996 Manchester bombing]], which destroyed a large area of the centre of the city on 15 June. It was the largest bomb attack in Britain since World War II. While the attack avoided any fatalities due to a telephone warning and the rapid response of the emergency services to it, over 200 people were injured in the attack, many of them outside the established cordon. The damage caused by the blast was estimated at £411&amp;nbsp;million. [[Lance Bombardier]] Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier killed before the [[Good Friday Agreement]] (GFA) was finalised, was shot dead at a border crossing on 12 February 1997 by the "[[South Armagh Sniper (1990–1997)|South Armagh sniper]]", later identified as [[Bernard Henry McGinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/4958589/Northern-Ireland-shootings-The-last-soldier-murdered.html|title=Northern Ireland shootings: The last soldier murdered|work=The Telegraph|date=9 March 2009|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA reinstated their ceasefire in July 1997, as negotiations for the document that became known as the Good Friday Agreement began without Sinn Féin. In September of the same year Sinn Féin signed [[Mitchell Principles|the Mitchell Principles]] and were admitted to the talks. The UVF was the first paramilitary grouping to split as a result of their ceasefire, spawning the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] (LVF) in 1996. In December 1997, the INLA assassinated LVF leader [[Billy Wright (loyalist)|Billy Wright]], leading to a series of revenge killings by loyalist groups. A group split from the Provisional IRA and formed the [[Real IRA]] (RIRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/10/real-ira-continuity|title=Explainer: Real IRA and Continuity IRA|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1998, [[Omagh bombing|a Real IRA bomb]] in [[Omagh]] killed 29 civilians. This bombing discredited "[[dissident republican]]s" and their campaigns in the eyes of many who had previously supported the Provisionals' campaign. They became small groups with little influence, but still capable of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/18.%20Eighteenth%20Report.pdf|title=HC 502 Cover|format=PDF|accessdate=2 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726174747/http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/18.%20Eighteenth%20Report.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The INLA also declared a ceasefire after the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Since then, most paramilitary violence has been directed at their "own" communities and at other factions within their organisations. The UDA, for example, has feuded with their fellow loyalists the UVF on two occasions since 2000. There have been internal struggles for power between "brigade commanders" and involvement in organised crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Henry McDonald|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/30/northernireland.henrymcdonald|title=New feud rips apart the UDA|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=30 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisional IRA members have since been accused or convicted of involvement in the killings of [[Murder of Robert McCartney|Robert McCartney]], Matthew Burns, James Curran, and Andrew Kearney, among others.

===Political process===
[[File:Unidentified irish mural.jpg|thumb|A republican mural in Belfast during the mid-1990s. It bids "safe home" ([[Slán Abhaile]]) to British troops. Security normalisation was one of the key points of the Good Friday Agreement.]]
After the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in Northern Ireland to establish political agreement. These talks led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of "power-sharing". In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn Féin. Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]], which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the abolition of [[Diplock courts]] under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nio.gov.uk/media-detail.htm?newsID=13803 Northern Ireland becoming a more normalised society] – Northern Ireland Office, 27 November 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108133243/http://www.nio.gov.uk/media-detail.htm?newsID=13803 |date=8 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A security normalisation process also began as part of the treaty, which comprised the progressive closing of redundant British Army barracks, border observation towers, and the withdrawal of all forces taking part in [[Operation Banner]] – including the resident battalions of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] – that would be replaced by [[19th Light Brigade (United Kingdom)|an infantry brigade]], deployed in ten sites around Northern Ireland but with no operative role in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0607/hc06/0697/0697.pdf|title=Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2006–07 HC 697|format=PDF|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power-sharing Executive and Assembly were suspended in 2002, when unionists withdrew following "[[Stormontgate]]", a controversy over allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont. There were ongoing tensions about the Provisional IRA's failure to disarm fully and sufficiently quickly. IRA decommissioning has since been completed (in September 2005) to the satisfaction of most parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IRA 'has destroyed all its arms'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4283444.stm|publisher=BBC|date=26 September 2005|accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature of Northern Ireland politics since the Agreement has been the eclipse in electoral terms of parties such as the Social Democratic and Labour Party and [[Ulster Unionist Party]], by rival parties such as Sinn Féin and the DUP. Similarly, although political violence is greatly reduced, sectarian animosity has not disappeared. Residential areas are more segregated between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Scanlan. ''Culture and Customs of Ireland'', Greenwood Publishing Group, pg. 51, 2006; {{ISBN|0-313-33162-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-33162-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, progress towards restoring the power-sharing institutions was slow and tortuous. On 8 May 2007, devolved government returned to Northern Ireland. DUP leader [[Ian Paisley]] and Sinn Féin's [[Martin McGuinness]] took office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/people/ian_paisley|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collusion between British forces and loyalists==
[[File:Collusion is not an illusion.jpg|right|thumb|A republican mural in Belfast with the slogan "Collusion is not an illusion"]]
In their efforts to defeat the IRA, there were many incidents of [[collusion]] between the British state security forces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries. This included soldiers and policemen taking part in loyalist attacks while off-duty, giving weapons and intelligence to loyalists, not taking action against them, and hindering police investigations. The ''[[Desmond Lorenz de Silva|De Silva]] Report'' found that, during the 1980s, 85% of the intelligence loyalists used to target people came from the security forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20662412 "Pat Finucane murder: 'Shocking state collusion', says PM"], BBC. Retrieved 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The security forces also had [[double agent]]s and [[Informant|informers]] within loyalist groups who organised attacks on the orders of, or with the knowledge of, their [[Agent handling|handlers]]. Of the 210 loyalists arrested by the [[Stevens Inquiries]] team, 207 were found to be state agents or informers.&lt;ref name=bbcmay2015&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32887445 "UK agents 'worked with NI paramilitary killers'"], BBC News, 28 May 2015.

The British Army's locally recruited [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) was almost wholly Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G.

==Shoot-to-kill allegations==
{{main article|Shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland}}
Republicans allege that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy rather than arresting IRA suspects. The security forces denied this and point out that in incidents such as the [[Loughgall ambush|killing of eight IRA men]] at [[Loughgall]] in 1987, the IRA members who were killed were heavily armed. Others argue that incidents such as the [[Operation Flavius|shooting of three unarmed IRA members]] in [[Gibraltar]] by the [[Special Air Service]] ten months later confirmed suspicions among republicans, and in the British and Irish media, of a tacit British shoot-to-kill policy of suspected IRA members.&lt;ref name="maxinewilliams"&gt;Maxine Williams.[http://www.rcgfrfi.easynet.co.uk/larkin_pubs/older/motr/motr_all.htm ''Murder on the Rock''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204153946/http://www.rcgfrfi.easynet.co.uk/larkin_pubs/older/motr/motr_all.htm |date=4 February 2007 }}, rcgfrfi.easynet.co.uk.

==Parades issue==

Inter-communal tensions rise and violence often breaks out during the "marching season" when the Protestant [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] parades take place across Northern Ireland. The parades are held to commemorate [[William III of England|William of Orange]]'s victory in the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, which secured the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and British rule in Ireland. One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in [[Portadown]], where an Orange parade from [[Drumcree Church]] passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road. This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade, and also loyalist counter-riots against its banning.

In 1995, 1996 and 1997, there were several weeks of prolonged rioting throughout Northern Ireland over the impasse at Drumcree. A number of people died in this violence, including a Catholic taxi driver, killed by the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]], and three (of four) nominally Catholic brothers (from a mixed-religion family) died when their house in [[Ballymoney]] was petrol-bombed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael McGoldrick, 64, Activist in Ulster, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/world/europe/06mcgoldrick.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis|title=Police hold six over loyalist turf war deaths|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/05/uk.northernireland1|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=5 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/12/newsid_2500000/2500503.stm|title=1998: Children die in Drumcree protests|publisher=BBC News|date=12 July 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] on the people of London.&lt;ref&gt;Dervla Murphy. ''A Place Apart''. Penguin Books, 1978, p. 134.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The stress resulting from bomb attacks, street disturbances, security checkpoints, and the constant military presence had the strongest effect on children and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the fear that local paramilitaries instilled in their respective communities with the punishment beatings, "romperings", and the occasional [[tarring and feathering]] meted out to individuals for various purported infractions.&lt;ref name="nelson126"&gt;Sarah Nelson. ''Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political, Paramilitary and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict'', 1984, Belfast: Appletree Press. p. 126.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the violence and intimidation, there was chronic unemployment and a severe housing shortage. Many people were rendered homeless as a result of intimidation or having their houses burnt, and urban redevelopment played a role in the social upheaval. Belfast families faced being transferred to new, alien estates when older, decrepit districts such as [[Sailortown, Belfast|Sailortown]] and the [[Pound Loney]] were being demolished. According to social worker and author Sarah Nelson, this new social problem of homelessness and disorientation contributed to the breakdown of the normal fabric of society, allowing for paramilitaries to exert a strong influence in certain districts.&lt;ref name="nelson126"/&gt; Vandalism was also a major problem. In the 1970s there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in Belfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one historian of the conflict, the stress of the Troubles engendered a breakdown in the previously strict sexual morality of Northern Ireland, resulting in a "confused hedonism" in respect of personal life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]]. ''Hope Against History: The Course of Conflict in Northern Ireland'', 1999, pp. 12–13. &lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Derry, illegitimate births and alcoholism increased for women and the divorce rate rose.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Teenage alcoholism was also a problem, partly as a result of the drinking clubs established in both loyalist and republican areas. In many cases, there was little parental supervision of children in some of the poorer districts.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, pp. 279–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Health has looked at a report written in 2007 by Mike Tomlinson of [[Queen's University of Belfast|Queen's University]], which asserted that the legacy of the Troubles has played a substantial role in the current rate of suicide in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 4 July 2007.

In 2010 it was estimated that 107,000 people in Northern Ireland suffered some physical injury as a result of the conflict. On the basis of data gathered by the [[Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]], the Victims Commission estimated that the conflict resulted in 500,000 'victims' in Northern Ireland alone. It defines 'victims' are those who are directly affected by 'bereavement', 'physical injury' or 'trauma' as a result of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Cunningham.

Most killings took place within Northern Ireland, especially in Belfast. Most of the killings in Belfast took place in the west and north of the city. [[Dublin]], London and [[Birmingham]] were also affected, albeit to a lesser degree than Northern Ireland itself. Occasionally, the IRA attempted or carried out attacks on British targets in Gibraltar, Germany and the Netherlands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7443">'''The Theatre Olympics''' was established in 1993 in [[Delphi, Greece]], on the initiative of the famous [[Greeks|Greek]] [[theatre director]], [[Theodoros Terzopoulos]]. TO is an international theatre festival, which is presenting some of the achievements of the greatest theatre practitioners from around the world.  It is a platform for theatrical exchange, a gathering place for students and masters, where a dialogue despite [[ideological]], [[culture]] and [[language]] differences is encouraged. Moreover, as its subtitle suggests, Crossing [[Millennia]], it is an initiative that emphasizes the importance of connecting the [[past]], [[present]], and [[future]] together. For this reason, the festival is promoting richness and diversity of theatre heritage and also all kinds of experiments and research in the field of [[performing arts]]. The goal of the TO is to strengthen and re-establish the statues of contemporary theatre in the world.  This objective is achieved by contributing to the growth of [[international]] [[collaboration]], building a network among [[artists]] all over the world and, creating an opportunity for the host of the festival to showcase and promote their work in theatre and other performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Jae Kyoung Kim,: International Theatre Olympics: exchanging national traditions and leading new trends in theatre. University of Georgia, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Committee ==

The first official meeting of the International Committee of TO took place on the 18th of June, 1994 in Delphi, Greece. The founding committee was a group of eight internationally renowned theatre directors: Theodoros Terzopoulos, [[Nuria Espert]], [[Antunes Filho]], [[Tony Harrison]], [[Yuri Lyubimov]], [[Heiner Müller]], [[Tadashi Suzuki]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]].  According to their decisions the TO is a [[non-profit organization]]. Its administrative [[headquarters]] are located in [[Athens, Greece]] ([[Europe]]an office) and in [[Togamura, Japan]] ([[Asia]]n office). Moreover, the International Committee of TO meets once a year. It can attract new members, on the condition of gaining at least two-thirds of the votes and being recommended by one of the existing members.  The TO has its one logotype, which was designed by the American theater stage director, Robert Wilson.

Currently the International Committee of TO consists of fourteen members: 
* [[Theodoros Terzopoulos]] ([[Greece]]) - chairmen 
* [[Tadashi Suzuki]] ([[Japan]]) 
* [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] ([[United States]]) 
* [[Wole Soyinka]] ([[Nigeria]])
* [[Yuri Liubimov]] ([[Russia]]) 
* [[Tony Harrison]] ([[Great Britain]]) 
* [[Ratan Tiyam]] ([[India]])
* [[Nuria Espert]] ([[Spain]])
* [[Giorgio Barberio Corsetti]] ([[Italy]])
* [[Georges Lavaudant]] ([[France]])
* [[Antunes Filho]] ([[Brazil]]) 
* [[Jurgen Flimm]] ([[Germany]])
* [[Choi Chy-Rim]] ([[South Korea]])
* [[Liu Libin]] ([[China]]) 
* [[Heiner Müller]] (1929-1995) ([[Germany]]) was a founding member of TO.&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of the TO, Theatre Olympics: Crossing Millennia, Athens, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hosting Countries ==

The TO each time is held in a different country. So far there have been five festivals and, except from one, took place in the countries of the members of the International Committee of TO. An International Committee member, who represents the host country, has the honor to be responsible for its artistic directing. In addition, he also has to establish the national organizing committee, consisting of prominent representatives of the country’s cultural life.

The hosting cities have been:

[[File:Palais-Royal - view 1679 - V Johnson 2008 p88.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View of the Palais-Royal in 1679. The theatre was in the east wing (on the right).]]

The '''Théâtre du Palais-Royal''' (or '''Salle du Palais-Royal''') on the [[rue Saint-Honoré]] in Paris was a theatre in the east wing of the [[Palais-Royal]], which opened on 14 January 1641 with a performance of [[Jean Desmarets]]' tragicomedy ''Mirame''. The theatre was used by the [[troupe of Molière]] from 1660 to 1673 and as an opera house by the [[Académie Royale de Musique]] from 1673 to 1763, when it was destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name=Coey&gt;Coeyman 1998, pp. 60–71.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt and reopened in 1770, but again was destroyed by fire in 1781 and not rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1983, pp. 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First theatre==
The Palais-Royal was originally known as the Palais-Cardinal, since it was built in the 1630s as the principal residence of [[Cardinal Richelieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637 Richelieu asked his architect  [[Jacques Le Mercier]] to begin work on the theatre, which opened in 1641 and was initially known as the '''Great Hall of the Palais-Cardinal'''.&lt;ref name=Coey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1998, pp. 1–2, 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Richelieu's death in 1642, he left the property to [[King Louis XIII]], and it became known as the Palais-Royal, although the name Palais-Cardinal sometimes still continued to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, p. 47; Bjurstrom 1961, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molière===
The troupe of [[Molière]] and the [[Comédie-Italienne|troop of the Italians]] put on the shows here between 1660 and 1673.&lt;ref name=Coey/&gt; Molière's most notable plays were performed here, including ''[[L'École des femmes]]'' (first performed 26 December 1662), ''[[Tartuffe]]'' (12 May 1664), ''[[Dom Juan]]'' (15 February 1665), ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'' (4 June 1666), ''[[L'Avare]]'' (9 September 1668), ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme]]'' (23 November 1670), and ''[[Le malade imaginaire]]'' (10 February 1673).&lt;ref&gt;Garreau 1984, pp. 417–418.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Opera===
[[File:Scene from Armide by Lully - drawing by Saint-Aubin - Boston MFA.jpg|thumb|left|Lully's ''Armide'' as performed at the first Salle du Palais-Royal in the revival of 1761]]

On the death of his old collaborator, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] ejected [[Molière]]'s troupe to a new home at the [[Hôtel de Guénégaud (theatre)|Hôtel de Guénégaud]] and re-used the theatre as the opera house of the Académie royale de Musique (the name of the [[Paris Opera]] at the time).  Lully had much building work done on it in order to allow the installation of new [[stage machinery]] designed by [[Carlo Vigarani]], capable of supporting the imposing sets of the [[opera]]s he would later put on here.  This replaced the old machinery designed by [[Giacomo Torelli]] in 1645.&lt;ref name=Coey/&gt; After Vigarani's modifications the theatre had a total capacity of about 1,270 spectators: a parterre for 600 standing, amphitheatre seating for 120, and boxes with balconies accommodating another 550. The stage was 9.4 meters across and 17 meters deep, with space in front for the orchestra 7.6 meters across and 3 meters deep.&lt;ref&gt;Harris-Warrick, Rebecca (1992). "Paris. 2. 1669&amp;ndash;1725" in Sadie (1992) vol. 3, pp. 856–857.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vue du feu prit à la Salle de l'Opéra de Paris le 6 avril 1763 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|Fire of 1763]]

Several of Lully's operas (''[[tragédies en musique]]'') were premiered at the Palais-Royal, including ''[[Alceste (Lully)|Alceste]]'' (19 January 1674), ''[[Amadis (Lully)|Amadis]]'' (18 January 1684), and ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'' (15 February 1686). In the 18th century many of [[Rameau]]'s works were first performed here, including ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'' (1 October 1733), ''[[Les Indes galantes]]'' (23 August 1735), ''[[Castor et Pollux]]'' (24 October 1737), ''[[Dardanus (opera)|Dardanus]]'' (19 November 1739),  and ''[[Zoroastre]]'' (5 December 1749).&lt;ref name=Simeone&gt;Simeone 2000, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opera's first theatre was destroyed by fire on 6 April 1763.

The City of [[Paris]], which was responsible for the opera house, decided to build a new theatre on a site slightly further to the east (where the rue de Valois is located today).&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1983, p. 26; Ayers 2004, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime the company performed in the [[Salle des Machines]] in the [[Tuileries Palace]], which was first reduced to a size more suitable for opera by the architect [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris-Warrick, Rebecca. "Paris. 3. 1725&amp;ndash;1789" in Sadie 1992, vol. 3, pp. 860–864.&lt;/ref&gt; The new theatre in the Palais-Royal was designed by architect [[Pierre-Louis Moreau Desproux]] and was the first purpose-built opera house in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a capacity of more than 2,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1983, p. 26, gives a capacity of 2,500. Simeone 2000, p. 181, says it held 2,000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new theatre opened on 20 January 1770 with a performance of Rameau's ''[[Zoroastre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1983, p. 26, and Mead 1991, p. 45, both say it opened on 20 January 1770. Simeone 2000, p. 181, says it opened on 26 January 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially noteworthy as the theatre where most of the French operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] were first performed, including ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]'' (19 April 1774), ''Orphée et Eurydice'' (the French version of ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'') (2 August 1774), the revised version of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (23 April 1776), ''[[Armide (Gluck)|Armide]]'' (23 September 1777), ''[[Iphigénie en Tauride (Gluck)|Iphigénie en Tauride]]'' (18 May 1779), and ''[[Echo et Narcisse]]'' (24 September 1779). Among the many other works premiered here are Piccinni's ''[[Atys (Piccinni)|Atys]]'' (22 February 1780), Grétry's ''[[Andromaque (opera)|Andromaque]]'' (6 June 1780), [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor's]] ''[[Persée (Philidor)|Persée]]'' (27 October 1780), and Piccinni's ''[[Iphigénie en Tauride (Piccinni)|Iphigénie en Tauride]]'' (23 January 1781).&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1985, pp. 566–567.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre continued to be used by the Opera until 8 June 1781, when it too was destroyed by fire. The [[Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin]], much further to the north on the [[Boulevard Saint-Martin]], was hurriedly built in two months to replace it. In the meantime the opera company performed in the [[Salle des Menus-Plaisirs (rue Bergère)|Salle des Menus-Plaisirs]] on the rue Bergère.&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1983, pp. 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Times Square Ball''' is a [[time ball]] located in [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]]. Located on the roof of [[One Times Square]], the ball is a prominent part of a [[New Year's Eve]] celebration in Times Square commonly referred to as '''the ball drop''', where the ball descends {{convert|141|ft|m}} in 60 seconds down a specially designed [[flagpole]], beginning at 11:59:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]], and resting at [[midnight]] to signal the start of the new year. In recent years, the festivities have been preceded by live entertainment, including performances by musicians.

The event was first organized by [[Adolph Ochs]], owner of ''[[The New York Times]]'' newspaper, as a successor to a series of New Year's Eve fireworks displays he held at the building to promote its status as the new headquarters of the ''Times'', while the ball itself was designed by [[Artkraft Strauss]]. First held on December 31, 1907, to welcome 1908, the ball drop has been held annually since, except in 1942 and 1943 in observance of [[Blackout (wartime)|wartime blackouts]].

The ball's design has been updated over the years to reflect improvements in lighting technology; the ball was initially constructed from wood and iron, and lit with 100 [[incandescent light bulb]]s. The current incarnation features a computerized [[light emitting diode|LED]] lighting system and an outer surface consisting of triangular [[crystal]] panels. These panels contain inscriptions representing a yearly theme. Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop One Times Square year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 has been on display inside the Times Square visitor's center.

The event is organized by the Times Square Alliance and Countdown Entertainment, a company led by Jeff Strauss,&lt;ref name=cbsny-800hard&gt;{{cite web|title=Nearly 800 Hard At Work On Times Square New Year’s Eve Celebration|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/12/29/nearly-800-people-setting-the-stage-for-times-square-new-years-eve-celebration/|work=CBS New York|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is among the most notable New Year's celebrations internationally: it is attended by at least 1 million spectators yearly, and is nationally televised as part of New Year's Eve specials broadcast by a number of [[List of United States over-the-air television networks|networks]] and cable channels.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite news

==Events==

===Event organization===
[[File:Working New Years Eve Social Media for NBC (9234114888).jpg|thumb|right|Spectators celebrate the arrival of 2013.]]

To facilitate the arrival of attendees, Times Square is closed to traffic beginning in the late afternoon on New Year's Eve. The square is then divided into different viewing sections referred to as "pens", into which attendees are directed sequentially upon arrival.&lt;ref name=cnn-07ball/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn-security2011&gt;{{cite news|title=New Year's Eve security main focus for NYPD|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/29/us/new-york-times-square/|work=CNN|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security is strictly enforced by the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD), even more so since the 2001–02 edition in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Attendees are required to pass through [[security checkpoint]]s before they are assigned a pen, and are prohibited from bringing backpacks or alcohol to the event.&lt;ref name=cnn-security2011 /&gt;

Security was increased further for 2017–18 edition due to recent incidents such as the [[2017 New York City truck attack|truck attack in New York on October 31]], and the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|Route 91 Harvest festival shootings]] in Las Vegas; these included additional patrols of Times Square hotels, rooftop patrol squads and counter-snipers, and the installation of reflective markers on buildings to help officers identify the location of elevated shooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/times-square-new-years-eve-security.html|title=In Wake of Attacks, Tighter Security for Times Square on New Year’s Eve|last=Mueller|first=Benjamin|date=2017-12-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivities===
Festivities formally begin in the early evening with the raising of the ball at around 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]], upon the conclusion of the 20-second “6 Hours to Go” countdown at 5:59:40.&lt;ref name=cnn-07ball/&gt; [[Party favor]]s are distributed to attendees, which have historically included large balloons, hats, and other items branded with the event's corporate sponsors.&lt;ref name=nyt-nivea&gt;{{cite news|title=For New Year’s Eve, the Tie-Ins Erupt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/business/media/14adco.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 10, 2013|date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time-veryconfetti/&gt; The hours before the drop are preceded by hourly countdowns for the arrival of the new year in other countries, along with live music performances by popular musicians. Some of these performances are organized by, and aired on [[#Broadcasting|New Year's Eve television specials]] which are broadcast from Times Square.&lt;ref name=time-veryconfetti&gt;{{cite news|title=A Very Confetti New Year's|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1573429,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=November 10, 2013|date=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday-etheridge/&gt;

===Cleanup===
[[File:New Year Aftermath.jpg|thumb|right|Workers clearing trash from Times Square following the festivities.]]
After the conclusion of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square. When it is re-opened to the public the following morning, few traces of the previous night's celebration remain: following the 2013–14 drop, the [[New York City Department of Sanitation]] estimated that it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square in eight hours, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crews Clean Up Times Square After New Year’s Celebration|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/01/after-party-in-times-square-comes-the-cleanup/|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=CBSNewYork.com|publisher=CBS Radio|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Early celebrations, first ball (1907–1919) ===
The first New Year's Eve celebration in [[Times Square]] was held on December 31, 1904; ''[[The New York Times]]''' owner, [[Adolph Ochs]], decided to celebrate the opening of the newspaper's new headquarters, [[One Times Square]], with a New Year's [[fireworks]] show on the roof of the building to welcome 1905. Close to 200,000 people attended the event, displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]].&lt;ref name=nyt-deconstructed/&gt; However, following several years of fireworks shows, Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area. The newspaper's chief electrician, Walter F. Palmer, suggested using a [[time ball]], after seeing one used on the nearby [[60 Hudson Street|Western Union Building]].&lt;ref name=nyt-deconstructed/&gt;

Ochs hired sign designer [[Artkraft Strauss]] to construct a ball for the celebration; it was built from iron and wood, electrically lit with one hundred [[incandescent light bulb]]s, weighed {{convert|700|lb|kg}}, and measured {{convert|5|ft|m}} in diameter. The ball was hoisted on the building's flagpole with rope by a team of six men. Once it hit the roof of the building, the ball was designed to complete an electric circuit to light a 5-foot tall sign indicating the new year, and trigger a fireworks show.&lt;ref name=nyt-2000ball/&gt; The first ever "ball drop" was held on December 31, 1907, welcoming the year 1908.&lt;ref name=nyt-deconstructed/&gt;

In 1913, only eight years after it moved to One Times Square, the ''Times'' moved its corporate headquarters to [[The Times Square Building|229 West 43rd Street]]. The ''Times'' still maintained ownership of the tower, however, and Strauss continued to organize future editions of the drop.&lt;ref name=telegraph-history&gt;{{cite news|title=History of Times Square|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8664743/History-of-Times-Square.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=January 13, 2013|location=London|date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The second and third balls (1920–1998) ===
The original ball was retired in 1920 in favor of a second design; the second ball remained {{convert|5|ft|m}} in diameter, but was now constructed from [[iron]], weighing {{convert|400|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="crump"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crump|first=William D.|title=Encyclopedia of New Year's Holidays Worldwide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujTfCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=One+Times+Square+building&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRiLf5-K_QAhVL7hoKHVKfBdwQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=One%20Times%20Square%20building&amp;f=false|publisher=McFarland|date=2014|page=242|isbn=9781476607481}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball drop was placed on hiatus for New Year's Eve 1942 and 1943 due to [[blackout (wartime)|wartime lighting restrictions]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="crump"/&gt; Instead, a [[moment of silence]] was observed at midnight in Times Square, accompanied by the sound of church bells played from [[sound truck]]s.&lt;ref name="crump"/&gt;

The second ball was retired in favor of a third design in 1955; again, it maintained the same diameter of its predecessors, but was now constructed from aluminium, and weighed {{convert|150|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="crump"/&gt; In 1981, the ball was modified to make it resemble an [[Big Apple|apple]], by switching to red lightbulbs and adding a green "stem".&lt;ref name=nyt-deconstructed/&gt; For 1988, organizers acknowledged the addition of a [[leap second]] earlier that day (leap seconds are appended at midnight [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], which is five hours before midnight in New York) by extending the drop to 61 seconds, and by including a special one-second light show during the extra second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert D. |last=McFadden |title='88 Countdown: 3, 2, 1, Leap Second, 0 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/29/nyregion/88-countdown-3-2-1-leap-second-0.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 31, 1987 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original white bulbs returned to the ball for 1989, but were replaced by red, white, and blue bulbs in 1991 to salute the troops of [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]].&lt;ref name=nyt-deconstructed/&gt;

The third ball was revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a computerized lighting system with 180 [[halogen lamp|halogen bulbs]] and 144 [[strobe light]]s, and over 12,000 [[rhinestone]]s.&lt;ref name="crump"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nydn-biggerball&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutton|first=Larry|title=Bigger Ball to Peg Square|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/brighter-ball-peg-square-article-1.703159|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting designer Barry Arnold stated that the changes were "something [that] had to be done to make this event more spectacular as we approach the millennium."&lt;ref name=nydn-biggerball/&gt;

The drop itself became computerized through the use of an electric [[winch]] synced with the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s [[time signal]]; the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to pause for a short moment halfway through its descent.&lt;ref name=nyt-vault&gt;{{cite news|title=When Party Is Over, the Ball Lands Here|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/nyregion/31vault.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 15, 2013|first=James|last=Barron|date=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group, owners of One Times Square.&lt;ref name=nyt-deconstructed&gt;{{cite news|title=Deconstructed – Times Square Ball – Lots of Sparkle for a Swift Fall|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/nyregion/27ball.html?ref=nyregion&amp;gwh=DFA1FDC3A94D96DE864D020AB6405314|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 15, 2013|first=Alan|last=Feuer|date=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Into the new millennium (1999–2007) ===

On December 28, 1998, during a press conference attended by New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], organizers announced that the third ball would be retired for the arrival of the new millennium, and replaced by a new design constructed by [[Waterford Crystal]]. The year 2000 celebrations introduced more prominent sponsorship to the drop; companies such as [[Discover Card]], [[Korbel Champagne Cellars|Korbel Champagne]], and [[Panasonic]] were announced as official sponsors of the festivities in Times Square. The city also announced that [[Ron Silver]] would lead a committee known as "NYC 2000", which was in charge of organizing events across the city for year 2000 celebrations.&lt;ref name=nyt-2000sponsors&gt;{{cite news|title=Here Comes 2000, With Sponsors, Too; Official Products in the Right Place: Millennial Partying in Times Sq.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/29/nyregion/here-comes-2000-with-sponsors-too-official-products-right-place-millennial.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 9, 2013|first=Abby|last=Goodnough|date=December 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full day of festivities was held at Times Square to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000, which included concerts and hourly cultural presentations with parades of puppets designed by [[Michael Curry (puppet designer)|Michael Curry]], representing countries entering the new year at that hour. Organizers expected a total attendance exceeding 2 million spectators.&lt;ref name=nyt-puppets&gt;{{cite news|title=There's Another Countdown Before the Famed '10, 9, 8 . . .'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/30/nyregion/there-s-another-countdown-before-the-famed-10-9-8.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 9, 2013|first=Tina|last=Kelley|date=December 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth ball, measuring {{convert|6|ft|m}} in diameter and weighing {{convert|1070|lb|kg}}, incorporated a total of over 600 [[halogen bulb]]s, 504 triangle-shaped crystal panels provided by Waterford, 96 strobe lights, and spinning, pyramid-shaped mirrors. The ball was constructed at Waterford's factory in [[Ireland]], and was then shipped to New York City, where the lighting system and motorized mirrors were installed.&lt;ref name=nyt-2000ball&gt;{{cite news|title=This New Year's Eve, Technology Will Drop the Ball|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/30/technology/this-new-year-s-eve-technology-will-drop-the-ball.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 9, 2013|first=David|last=Kushner|date=December 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the triangles were inscribed with "Hope"-themed designs changing yearly, such as "Hope for Fellowship", "Hope for Wisdom", "Hope for Unity", "Hope for Courage", and "Hope for Abundance".&lt;ref name=cnn-07ball&gt;{{cite news|title=Countdown to Times Square party; 1 million expected|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/12/31/newyears.timessquare/|work=CNN|accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nydn-sep11ball&gt;{{cite news|title=New Year Theme Right On The Ball|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/new-year-theme-ball-article-1.931839|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2002, as part of the theme "Hope for Healing", 195 of the ball's panels were engraved with the names of nations and organizations who were affected by or were involved in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=cnn-07ball/&gt;&lt;ref name=nydn-sep11ball/&gt; In December 2011, the "Hope for Healing" panels were accepted into the collection of the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|National September 11 Museum]].&lt;ref name="911museum-crystals"&gt;{{cite web|title=NATIONAL SEPTEMBER 11 MEMORIAL MUSEUM TO ACCEPT SPECIAL COLLECTION OF WATERFORD CRYSTAL TRIANGLES FROM 2001/2002 TIMES SQUARE BALL|url=https://www.911memorial.org/sites/default/files/Hope_for_Healing_Press_Release.pdf|publisher=nat|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present day (2008–present) ===
In honor of the ball drop's centennial anniversary, a brand new fifth design debuted for New Year's Eve 2008. Once again manufactured by Waterford Crystal with a diameter of {{convert|6|ft|m}}, but weighing {{convert|1212|lb|kg}}, it used [[LED lamp]]s provided by [[Philips]] (which can produce 16,777,216 or 2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; colors), with computerized lighting patterns developed by the New York City-based lighting firm [[Focus Lighting]]. The ball featured 9,576&amp;nbsp;energy-efficient bulbs that consumed the same amount of electricity as only 10&amp;nbsp;toasters.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;  The 2008 ball was only used once, and was placed on display at the Times Square Visitors Center following the event.&lt;ref name=nyt-deconstructed/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-vault/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbsny-preparations14/&gt;

For 2009, a larger version of the fifth ball was introduced—an [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] [[Geodesic dome|geodesic]] sphere lit by 32,256 LED lamps. Its diameter is twice as wide as the 2008 ball, at {{convert|12|ft|m}}, and contains 2,688 Waterford Crystal panels, with a weight of {{convert|11875|lb|kg}}.

Yearly themes for the ball's crystal panels continued; from 2008 to 2013, the ball contained crystal patterns that were part of a Waterford series known as "World of Celebration", including themes such as "Let There Be Light" and "Let There Be Peace". For 2014, all the ball's panels were replaced, marking a new theme series known as "Greatest Gifts", beginning with "Gift of Imagination".&lt;ref name=cbsny-2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbsny-2016ball&gt;{{cite web|title=Workers To Install 288 New Waterford Crystals On New Year’s Eve Ball|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/27/times-square-ball-preps/|website=CBS New York|publisher=CBS Radio|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbsny-preparations14&gt;{{cite web|title=New Year’s Eve Preparations Under Way In Times Square|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/12/27/new-years-eve-preparations-under-way-in-times-square/|work=CBSNewYork.com|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=waterford-2014pr&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterford and Times Square New Year’s Eve Reveal "Gift of Imagination" Crystal Design as Part of New 10-Year "Greatest Gifts" Series|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131227005240/en/Waterford-Times-Square-Year%E2%80%99s-Eve-Reveal-%E2%80%9CGift|work=Waterford Crystal press release|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerical sign indicating the year (which remains atop the tower along with the ball itself) uses Philips LED lamps.

==Broadcasting==
[[File:New Years Eve 1999-2000 - Times Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[ABC News]]' presence at Times Square for ''[[ABC 2000 Today]]'']]
As a public event, the festivities and ball drop are often broadcast on television. As of 2016-17, a host feed of 21 cameras across Times Square is provided to broadcasters to incorporate into their coverage.&lt;ref name="tvtech-timessquare"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Team Behind Times Square New Year’s Eve|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/meet-the-team-behind-times-square-new-years-eve/280039|website=TV Technology|publisher=NewBay Media|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The event is covered as part of New Year's Eve [[television special]]s on several major U.S. television networks. By far the most notable of these is ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]''; created, produced, and originally hosted by the entertainer [[Dick Clark]] until his death in 2012, and currently hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] and [[Jenny McCarthy]], the program first aired on [[NBC]] in 1972 before moving to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], where it has been broadcast ever since.&lt;ref name="2012Edition"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fbny-making/&gt; ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' has consistently been the most-watched New Year's Eve special in the U.S. annually, peaking at 25.6 million viewers for its 2018 edition.&lt;ref name="2018Ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/01/01/new-years-rockin-eve-ryan-seacrest-ratings-2017/ |title=Ratings: Ryan Seacrest's Rockin' Eve Hits All-Time Highs, Fox's Steve Harvey a Big Improvement Over Pitbull |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |work=[[TVLine]] |date=January 1, 2018 |accessdate=January 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2012Edition"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/arts/television/dick-clark-and-rockin-eve-reach-milestone.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print|title=4 Decades Later, He Still Counts|date=December 31, 2011|accessdate=January 1, 2012|first=Brian|last=Stelter|newspaper=New York Times|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyre2012-ratings&gt;{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Gary|title=Nielsens: Clark's 'Rockin' Eve,' football start year well|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/story/2012-01-04/nielsen-ratings-dick-clark/52381476/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=November 30, 2012|date=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Dick Clark in April 2012, a crystal engraved with his name was added to the 2013 ball in tribute.&lt;ref name=fbny-making&gt;{{cite web|last=Barmash|first=Jerry|title=Marking New Year’s Eve at Times Square Without Dick Clark|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/marking-new-years-eve-at-times-square-without-dick-clark_b73011|publisher=FishbowlNY|accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the remaining networks, [[NBC]] broadcasts ''[[New Year's Eve with Carson Daly]]'', hosted from Times Square by [[Carson Daly]] of ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly|Last Call]]'' while [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] has aired New Year's specials covering Times Square with rotating hosts and themes, which were broadcast primarily under the title ''New Year's Eve Live'' until 2014. From 2015 to 2017, Fox broadcast ''[[Fox New Year's Eve specials|Pitbull's New Year's Revolution]]'' from [[Miami]] instead, but returned to a Times Square-based show hosted by [[Steve Harvey]] for 2018.

On [[Cable television|cable]], [[CNN]] carries coverage of the festivities, known as ''[[New Year's Eve Live (CNN program)|New Year's Eve Live]]'', which was historically hosted by [[Anderson Cooper]] and [[Kathy Griffin]] from Times Square. Griffin was removed from her role in 2017 after she published a [[Kathy_Griffin#Depiction_of_President_Trump|controversial political photo]]; she was replaced by [[Andy Cohen (television personality)|Andy Cohen]] for 2018.&lt;ref name="variety-andycohen"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/cnn-new-year-anderson-cooper-andy-cohen-1202587221/|title=CNN Will Replace Kathy Griffin With Andy Cohen for New Year’s Eve|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2017-10-11|work=Variety|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]] carries ''All-American New Year'', which was most recently hosted by [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]] and [[Bill Hemmer]] from Times Square.&lt;ref name=wp-mostentertaining&gt;{{cite news|title=TV highlights: Networks compete for most entertaining New Year’s show|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/tv-highlights-networks-compete-for-most-entertaining-new-years-show/2013/12/30/3826f0fa-715a-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html|work=Washington Post|accessdate=December 31, 2013|date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008-09, an official [[webcast]] of the ball drop and its associated festivities has been produced, streamed via [[Livestream.com]].&lt;ref name="tvtech-timessquare"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-balldroponline&gt;{{cite news|last=Taub|first=Erica A.|title=New Year’s Eve in Times Square Is Now a Webcast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/technology/personaltech/24tsquare.html?_r=0|accessdate=December 6, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extra-bright ball to drop at Times Square|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/news/2007-12-27-bright-ball-drop_N.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=December 6, 2012|first=Jerry|last=Shriver|date=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Past broadcasts ===
Beginning in the 1940s, NBC broadcast coverage from Times Square anchored by [[Ben Grauer]] on both radio and television. Its coverage was later incorporated into special episodes of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', continuing through [[Johnny Carson]] and [[Jay Leno]]'s tenures on the program. NBC would introduce a dedicated special, ''[[New Year's Eve with Carson Daly]]'', beginning in 2004.&lt;ref name=usatoday-battle&gt;{{cite news|last=Oldenberg|first=Ann|title=Battle of Times Square|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-12-29-clark-nye-return_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=January 5, 2013|date=December 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1956 to 1976, [[CBS]] was well known for its television coverage of the festivities hosted by bandleader [[Guy Lombardo]], most frequently from the ballroom of the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City, featuring his band's famous rendition of "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" at midnight. After Lombardo's death in 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians, now led by [[Victor Lombardo]], attempted to continue the special. However, Guy's absence and the growing popularity of ABC's ''New Year’s Rockin’ Eve'' prompted CBS to eventually drop the band entirely. The Royal Canadians were replaced by a new special, ''[[Happy New Year, America]]'', which ran in various formats with different hosts (such as [[Paul Anka]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Andy Williams]], [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Montel Williams]]) until it was discontinued after 1996. CBS, barring a special ''America's Millennium'' broadcast for 2000, has not broadcast any national New Year's programming since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lynch |first=Stephen |title=New Year's song remains ingrained in public mind |url=http://www.augustachronicle.com/stories/123199/cy2_124-4983.shtml |newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]] |pages= |date=December 31, 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426133815/http://www.augustachronicle.com/stories/123199/cy2_124-4983.shtml |archivedate=April 26, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Past, Present, and...Future?|date=December 25, 2006|first=Scott|last=Collins|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppg-Lombardo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011226guy1226p6.asp|title=Next week to be 25th New Year's Eve without Guy Lombardo|accessdate=January 1, 2007|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|first=Frazier|last=Moore|date=December 26, 2001|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ms-newguy&gt;{{cite web|last=Terry|first=Carol Burton|title=New Guy Lombardo?

For 2000, in lieu of ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'', [[ABC News]] covered the festivities as part of its day-long telecast, ''[[ABC 2000 Today]]''. Hosted by [[Peter Jennings]], the broadcast featured coverage of millennium festivities from around the world, including those in New York City. Jennings was joined by Dick Clark as a special correspondent for coverage from Times Square.&lt;ref name=edr-dickclark&gt;{{cite news|last=Bobbin|first=Jay|title=Dick Clark offers longer New Year's Eve special|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mygfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gccEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5437,5342253&amp;dq=rockin+eve&amp;hl=en|accessdate=April 20, 2012|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|date=December 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MTV]] had broadcast [[MTV New Year's|coverage]] originating from the network's Times Square studios at [[One Astor Plaza]]. For 2011, MTV also held its own ball drop in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]], the setting of its popular [[reality television|reality]] series ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', featuring cast member [[Snooki]] lowered inside a giant "[[hamster ball]]". Originally, MTV planned to hold the drop within its studio in Times Square, but the network was asked by city officials to conduct the drop elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snooki 'dropped' from Times Square New Year's Eve celebration|url=http://www.silive.com/entertainment/tvfilm/index.ssf/2010/12/snooki_dropped_from_times_squa.html|accessdate=October 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Staten Island Advance]]|date=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Viva la Quinta Brigada'''" (listed as "'''Viva la Quince Brigada'''" in later recordings) is a [[Christy Moore]] song about the Irishmen who fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]] against [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. The title was inspired by a Spanish song about the war, '[[Ay Carmela (song)|Viva la Quince Brigada]]'.

Moore wrote this song choosing to focus on the [[Irish Socialist Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|Irish socialist volunteers]] (who in later years became known as the [[Connolly Column]]) who were a small contingent within the 15th [[International Brigade]].

The song was inspired by Spanish Civil War veteran [[Michael O'Riordan]]'s book Connolly Column.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moore said: "Without Michael O'Riordan I'd never have been able to write Viva la Quince Brigada. I must have performed the song over a thousand times and every single time I sing it I think of Mick and wonder how can I ever thank him enough. In Spain in 1983 I was reading his book, Connolly Column – the story of the Irishmen who fought for the Spanish Republic, and I began this song as I read on. The song was lifted entirely from his book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siptu.ie/Resources/SIPTUPublications/ArchivedSIPTUpublications/Name,4047,en.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119112655/http://www.siptu.ie/Resources/SIPTUPublications/ArchivedSIPTUpublications/Name,4047,en.html |date=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moore's original song title - which translates as "Long live the Fifth Brigade" - was a slip due to the similarity in Spanish between "quinta" (fifth) and "quince" (fifteen). The bulk of Irish volunteers served with the [[XV International Brigade|XV (Fifteen) International Brigade]]; the "Fifth Brigade" was not one of the [[International Brigades]]. The song later appeared listed as '''Viva la Quince Brigada''' as Moore corrected the mistake in subsequent recordings.
Both titles are correct however, originally there were ten brigades in the  Spanish army, the five international brigades were then added to the list making the 5th International Brigade the 15th Brigade of the Spanish republic.

[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&amp;W).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The "Big Three" at the [[Yalta Conference]]: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]]]

The concept of '''Western betrayal''' refers to the view that the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] failed to meet their legal, diplomatic, military and moral obligations with respect to the [[Czechslovakia|Czechoslovak]] and [[Poland|Polish]] nations during the prelude to and aftermath of [[World War II]]. It also sometimes refers to the treatment of other [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an nations at the time.

The term refers to several events, including the treatment of [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] during the [[Munich Agreement]] and the resulting [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupation]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], as well as the [[Meeting at Abbeville|betrayal at Abbeville]] ([[Anglo-French Supreme War Council]]) [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|of France]] [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|and the UK]] to aid [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] when the country was [[invasion of Poland|invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|the Soviet Union]] in 1939. The same concept also refers to the concessions made by the United States and the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union during the [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]], [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] conferences, to their passive stance during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] against Nazi occupation, and post-war events, which allocated the region to the Soviet [[sphere of influence]] and created the communist [[Eastern Bloc]].

Historically, such views were intertwined with some of the most significant geopolitical events of the 20th century, including the rise and empowerment of the Third Reich (Nazi Germany), the rise of the Soviet Union (USSR) as a dominant [[superpower]] with control of large parts of Europe, and various treaties, alliances, and positions taken during and after World War II, and so on into the [[Cold War]].

==The perception of betrayal==
"Notions of western betrayal" is a reference to "a sense of historical and moral responsibility" for the West's "abandonment of Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War," according to professors Charlotte Bretherton and John Vogler.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="research"/&gt;
In Central and Eastern Europe the interpretation of the outcome of the [[Munich Crisis]] of 1938, and the [[Yalta Conference]] of 1945, as a betrayal of Central and Eastern Europe by Western powers has been used by Central and Eastern European leaders to put pressure on Western countries to acquiesce to more recent political requests such as membership in [[NATO]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

In a few cases deliberate duplicity is alleged, whereby secret agreements or intentions are claimed to have existed in conflict with understandings given publicly. An example is Churchill's covert concordance with the USSR that the [[Atlantic Charter]] did not apply to the [[Baltic states]]. Given the strategic requirements of winning the war, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had no option but to accept the demands of their erstwhile ally, [[Soviet Premier]] [[Joseph Stalin]], at Tehran, Yalta, and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]], argues retired diplomat Charles G. Stefan.&lt;ref name="unc"/&gt;

[[Max Hastings]] states that Churchill urged Roosevelt to continue armed conflict in Europe in 1945 - but carried out against the Soviet Union, to prevent the USSR from extending its control west of its own borders.&lt;ref name="Operation unthinkable: How Churchill wanted to recruit defeated Nazi troops and drive Russia out of Eastern Europe"/&gt; Roosevelt apparently trusted Stalin's assurances, and he was unwilling to support Churchill in ensuring the "liberation" of all of [[Central and Eastern Europe]] west of the USSR. Without American backing, the United Kingdom, with its strength exhausted by six years of war, was unable to take any military actions in that part of Europe.

Specific instances considered {{By whom?|date=January 2017}} to exemplify the concept by historical and contemporary writers include the annexation of most of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany under the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938, the abandonment of [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|the British alliance with Poland]] during the [[invasion of Poland]] of September 1939 and during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] against Nazi Germany in 1944, and the acceptance of the Soviet abrogation of the [[Yalta agreement]] of 1945.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In the latter, the Major Allies against Nazi Germany had agreed to secure democratic processes for the countries that would be liberated from Nazi rule, such as [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Albania]].

There was also a lack of military or political support for the [[anticommunist]] rebels during the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprising in German Democratic Republic]] in 1953, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]],&lt;ref name="ALLIANCES: How to Help Hungary"/&gt; and during the [[Socialism with a human face|democracy-oriented reforms in Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 (the so-called "[[Prague Spring]]").

According to Ilya Prizel, the "preoccupation with their historical sense of 'damaged self' fueled resentment" towards the west generally and reinforced the western betrayal concept in particular.&lt;ref name="google7"/&gt; [[Grigory Yavlinsky]] argues that damage to central European national psyches left by the Western "betrayal" at Yalta and Munich remained a "psychological event" or "psychiatric issue" during debates over [[NATO]] expansion.&lt;ref name="google8"/&gt;

===Munich Conference===
The term ''Western betrayal'' ({{lang-cz|zrada Západu}}) was coined after the 1938 [[Munich Conference]] when Czechoslovakia was forced to cede the mostly German-populated [[Sudetenland]] to Germany. The region contained the [[Czechoslovak border fortifications]] and means of viable defence against German invasion.&lt;ref name="vscht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyklopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History"/&gt; [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia]] a year later.

Along with Italy and Nazi Germany, the Munich treaty was signed by Britain and France - Czechoslovakia's allies. Czechoslovakia was allied by treaty with France so it would be obliged to help Czechoslovakia if it was attacked &lt;ref&gt;Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 23, pp. 164–169.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Munich treaty and the subsequent occupation exposed Czechoslovak citizens to the [[Nazism|Nazi regime]] and its atrocities.

Czech politicians joined the newspapers in regularly using the term ''Western betrayal'' and it, along with the associated feelings, became a stereotype among [[Czechs]]. The Czech terms ''Mnichov'' (Munich), ''Mnichovská zrada'' (''Munich betrayal''), ''Mnichovský diktát'' (''Munich Dictate'') and ''zrada spojenců'' (''betrayal of the allies'') were coined at the same time and have the same meaning. Poet [[František Halas]] published a poem with verse about "ringing bell of betrayal".&lt;ref name="rozhoupaly"/&gt;

Then [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] for Epping, [[Winston Churchill]] said: "Britain and France had to choose between war and dishonour. They chose dishonour. They will have war".&lt;ref name="Scraps of paper: the disarmament treaties between the world wars"/&gt;
===Prague uprising===
{{see also|Prague uprising}}
On 5 May 1945, the citizens of Prague learned of the American invasion of Czechoslovakia by the US Third Army and revolted against German occupation. In four days of street fighting, thousands of Czechs were killed. Tactical conditions were favourable for an American advance, and General [[Patton]], in command of the army, requested permission to continue westward to the [[Vltava]] river in order to aid the Czech partisans fighting in Prague. This was refused by General [[Eisenhower]], who was disinclined to accept American casualties or risk antagonising the Soviet Union. As a result, Prague was liberated on 9 May by the Red Army, raising the standing of the [[Czechoslovak Communist Party]]. According to a British diplomat, this was the moment that "Czechoslovakia was now definitely lost to the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olson |first1=Lynne |title=Last Hope Island: Britain, Occupied Europe, and the Brotherhood That Helped Turn the Tide of War |date=2018 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=9780812987164 |page=429 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xVHDwAAQBAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WWI aftermath===
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, a complex set of alliances was established among the nations of Europe, in the hope of preventing future wars (either with Germany or the Soviet Union). With the rise of Nazism in Germany, this system of alliances was strengthened by the signing of a series of "mutual assistance" alliances between France, Britain, and Poland ([[Franco-Polish Alliance]] and [[Anglo-Polish Alliance]]). This agreement stated that in the event of war the other allies were to fully mobilise and carry out a "ground intervention within two weeks" in support of the ally being attacked.&lt;ref name="Ajnenkiel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ciałowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raczyński"/&gt; Additionally representatives of the Western powers made several military promises to Poland, including such fantastic designs as those made by British General [[William Edmund Ironside]] in his July talks with Marshall Rydz-Śmigły who promised an attack from the direction of [[Black Sea]], or placing a British [[aircraft carrier]] in the Baltic.&lt;ref name="krzysztof"/&gt;

In the commentary on the Anglo-Polish Alliance, Polish publicist [[Stanisław Mackiewicz]] wrote in his 1964 book "Polityka [[Józef Beck|Becka]]":{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;England does not need the existence of Poland, it has never needed it. Sometimes the British push us to fight against Russia, sometimes against Germany, as happened in 1939, when they managed to keep Hitler away from them for some time. After their so-called guarantees of March 1939, England was not interested in our army, it did not help us financially in our war preparations, and did not have the slightest intention to aid us during Hitler's invasion of Poland (...) The guarantee of Poland's independence, provided by England, was not a guarantee at all. On the contrary, it was a speculation, whose purpose was the fastest possible liquidation of the Polish state. England wanted Poland to fight Germany first, and to lose that war as quickly as possible, so that Germany would finally face Russia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Beginning of WWII, 1939===
On the eve of the Second World War polish government tried to buy as much armaments as it could and was asking for arms loans from Britain and France. As a result of that in the summer of 1939 Poland bought 160 French [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] fighters and 111 English airplanes (100 light bombers [[Fairey Battle]], 10 [[Hawker_Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and 1 Spitfire)&lt;ref name="Wojciech Mazur"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mazur |first1=Wojciech |title=Pomocnik Historyczny |journal=Polityka |date=March 2009 |volume=3/2009 |pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite some of this airplanes had been shipped to Poland before 1 September 1939, none of them would take part in combat.  That can be realted vastly to unnecessary extension of negotiations by France and Britain in the face of war. Due to the resistance of the British, weapons were not sold, on which Poles most cared: about 150 technically advanced fighters Spitfires. The total amount of given loan from British government was also much smaller than asked. Britain eventually agreed to borrow just 8 milion pounds instead of 60 milion that Poland applied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wojciech |first1=Mazur |title=Dozbrojenie last minute |journal=Polityka |date=n.d. |volume=3/2009 |issue=3/2009 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Upon the [[invasion of Poland]] by Nazi Germany in September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany. On 3 September a [[Blockade of Germany (1939–45)|naval blockade of Germany]] was initiated, and an attempt was made to [[Bombing of Wilhelmshaven in World War II|bomb German warships in harbour]] on 4 September. Most British bomber activity over Germany was the dropping of propaganda leaflets and reconnaissance. On 4 September, during a Franco-British meeting in France, it was decided that no major land or air operations against Germany would take place, and afterwards French military leader Gamelin issued orders prohibiting Polish military envoys lieutenant Wojciech Fyda and general Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki from contacting him.&lt;ref name="krzysztof" /&gt; In his post-war diaries general Edmund Ironside, the chief of Imperial General Staff commented on French promises "The French had lied to the Poles in saying they are going to attack. There is no idea of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why air forces fail: the anatomy of defeat|first1=Robin D. S. |last1=Higham|first2=Stephen |last2=John|publisher =Harris University Press of Kentucky|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French initiated full mobilisation and began the limited [[Saar Offensive]] on 7 September but halted short of the [[Siegfried Line|German defensive lines]] and then withdrew to [[Maginot Line|their own defences]] around 13 September. Poland was not notified of this decision. Instead, Gamelin informed by dispatch marshal [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] that half of his divisions were in contact with the enemy, and that French advances had forced the [[Wehrmacht]] to withdraw at least six divisions from Poland. The Polish military envoy to France, general Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki, upon receiving the text of the message sent by Gamelin, alerted marshal Śmigły: "I received the message by general Gamelin. Please don't believe a single word in the dispatch".&lt;ref name="krzysztof" /&gt; The following day, the commander of the [[French Military Mission to Poland]], General [[Louis Faury]], informed the Polish Chief of Staff, General [[Wacław Stachiewicz]], that the planned major offensive on the western front had to be postponed from September 17 to September 20. At the same time, French divisions were ordered to retreat to their barracks along the [[Maginot Line]].

On 17 September 1939 the Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], as agreed in advance with Germany following the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Britain and France did not take any action in response to the Soviet invasion.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

France and Britain did not launch a full land attack on Germany. Poland was overcome on 6 October.

===Tehran, 1943===
In November 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Big Three]] (USSR, US, and the UK) met at the [[Tehran Conference]]. President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill officially agreed that the eastern borders of Poland would roughly follow the [[Curzon Line]].&lt;ref name="The origins of the 'Teheran formula' on Polish frontiers"/&gt; The Polish government-in-exile was not a party to this decision made in secret.&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wajszczuk"/&gt; The resulting loss of the [[Kresy]], or "eastern territories", approximately 48% of Poland's pre-war territory, to the Soviet Union was seen by the London Poles in exile as another "betrayal" by their Western "Allies".&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

However it was no secret to the Allies that before his death in July 1943 General [[Władysław Sikorski]], Prime Minister of Poland's London-based government in exile had been the originator, and not Stalin, of the concept of a westward shift of Poland's boundaries along an [[Oder–Neisse line]] as compensation for relinquishing Poland's eastern territories as part of a Polish rapprochement with the USSR.&lt;ref name="Poland's Place in Europe: General Sikorski and the Origin of the Oder-Neisse Line, 1939-1943"/&gt; Dr. [[Józef Retinger]] who was Sikorski's special political advisor at the time was also in agreement with Sikorski's concept of Poland's realigned post-war borders, later in his memoirs Retinger wrote: "At the Tehran Conference, in November 1943, the Big Three agreed that Poland should receive territorial compensation in the West, at Germany's expense, for the land it was to lose to Russia in Central and Eastern Europe. This seemed like a fair bargain."&lt;ref name="Joseph Retinger: Memoirs of an Eminence Grise"/&gt;

Churchill told Stalin he could settle the issue with the Poles once a decision was made in Tehran,&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; however he never consulted the Polish leadership.&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt; When the Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]] attended the [[Moscow Conference (1944)]], he was convinced he was coming to discuss borders that were still disputed, while Stalin believed everything had already been settled. This was the principal reason for the failure of the Polish Prime Minister's mission to Moscow.{{Citation needed|reason=Stalin and Molotv wanted the Lublin Poles, and never intended to negotiate anything with Mikołajczyk|date=January 2015}} The Polish premier allegedly begged for inclusion of [[Lwów]] and [[Wilno]] in the new Polish borders, but got the following reply from [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]: "There is no use discussing that; it was all settled in Tehran."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

===Warsaw Uprising, 1944===
{{main article|Lack of outside support during the Warsaw Uprising}}
[[File:Destroyed Warsaw, capital of Poland, January 1945.jpg|thumb|During World War II [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|85% of buildings in Warsaw were destroyed by German troops]].]]
Since the establishment of the Polish government-in-exile in Paris and then in London, the military commanders of the Polish army were focusing most of their efforts on preparation of a future all-national uprising against Germany. Finally the plans for [[Operation Tempest]] were prepared and on August 1, 1944, the [[Warsaw Uprising]] started. The Uprising was an armed struggle by the Polish [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] to liberate Warsaw from German occupation and Nazi rule.

Despite the fact that Polish and later [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) planes flew missions over Warsaw dropping supplies from 4 August on, the [[United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) planes did not join the operation. The Allies specifically requested the use of Red Army airfields near Warsaw on 20 August but were refused by Stalin on 22 August (he referred to the insurrectionists as "a handful of criminals"). After Stalin's objections to support for the uprising, Churchill telegraphed Roosevelt on 25 August and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin and to "see what happens". Roosevelt replied on 26 August that "I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe."&lt;ref name="CNN.com"/&gt; The commander of the British air drop, Air Marshal Sir [[John Slessor]], later stated, "How, after the fall of Warsaw, any responsible statesman could trust the Russian Communist further than he could kick him, passes the comprehension of ordinary men."

Various scholars argue that during the Warsaw Uprising both the governments of United Kingdom and the United States did little to help Polish resistance and that the Allies put little pressure on Stalin to help the Polish struggle.

===Yalta, 1945===
{{See also|Yalta Conference}}
The Yalta conference (February 4 to 11, 1945) initiated the era of Soviet domination of Central and Eastern Europe, which lasted until the end of the Cold War in early 1990s and left bitter memories of Western betrayal and Soviet dominance in the collective memory of the region.&lt;ref name="dash.harvard.edu"/&gt; To many Polish Americans the Yalta conference "constituted a betrayal" of Poland and the [[Atlantic Charter]].&lt;ref name="The Republican Party and Yalta: partisan exploitation of the Polish American concern over the conference, 1945–1960"/&gt; "After World War II," remarked [[Strobe Talbott]], "many countries in the (center and) east suffered half a century under the shadow of Yalta."&lt;ref name="dash.harvard.edu"/&gt; Territories which the Soviet Union had occupied during World War II in 1939 (with the exception of the [[Białystok]] area) were permanently annexed, and most of their Polish inhabitants expelled: today these territories are part of [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Lithuania]]. The factual basis of this decision was the result of a forged referendum from November 1939 in which the "huge majority" of voters accepted the incorporation of these lands into Western Belarus and Western Ukraine. In compensation, Poland was given former German territory (the so-called [[Regained Territories]]): the southern half of [[East Prussia]] and all of [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], up to the [[Oder–Neisse line]]. The German population of these territories [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|was expelled]] and these territories were subsequently repopulated with [[World War II evacuation and expulsion#Deportation of Poles|Poles expelled]] from the [[Kresy]] regions. This, along with other similar migrations in Central and Eastern Europe, combined to form [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|one of the largest human migrations in modern times]]. Stalin ordered Polish resistance fighters to be either incarcerated or deported to [[gulag]]s in Siberia.

At the time of Yalta over 200,000 troops of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]] were serving under the high command of the British Army. Many of these men and women were originally from the [[Kresy]] region of eastern Poland including cities such as [[Lviv|Lwów]] and [[Vilnius|Wilno]]. They had been deported from Kresy to the Soviet gulags when Hitler and Stalin occupied Poland in 1939 in accordance with the [[Nazi–Soviet Pact]]. When two years later Churchill and Stalin formed an alliance against Hitler, the Kresy Poles were released from the Gulags in Siberia, formed the [[Anders Army]] and marched to Persia to create the [[II Corps (Poland)]] under British high command.

These Polish troops were instrumental to the Allied defeat of the Germans in North Africa and Italy, and hoped to return to Kresy in an independent and democratic Poland at the end of the War. But at Yalta, Churchill agreed that Stalin should keep the Soviet gains Hitler agreed to in the Nazi–Soviet Pact, including Kresy, and carry out [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|Polish population transfers]]. Consequently, Churchill had agreed that tens of thousands of veteran Polish troops under British command should lose their Kresy homes to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; In reaction, thirty officers and men from the II Corps committed suicide.&lt;ref name="pp.374-383 Olson and Cloud 2003"/&gt;

Churchill defended his actions in a three-day Parliamentary debate starting 27 February 1945, which ended in a [[vote of confidence]]. During the debate, many MPs openly criticised Churchill and passionately voiced loyalty to Britain's Polish allies and expressed deep reservations about Yalta.&lt;ref name="pp.374-383 Olson and Cloud 2003"/&gt; Moreover, 25 of these MPs risked their careers to draft an amendment protesting against Britain's tacit acceptance of Poland's domination by the Soviet Union. These members included [[Arthur Greenwood]], [[Sir Alec Douglas-Home]], Commander [[Sir Archibald Southby, 1st Baronet|Archibald Southby]], the [[James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster|Earl of Ancaster]], and [[Victor Raikes]].&lt;ref name="pp.374-383 Olson and Cloud 2003"/&gt; After the failure of the amendment, [[Henry Strauss, 1st Baron Conesford|Henry Strauss]], the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Norwich]], resigned his seat in protest at the British treatment of Poland.&lt;ref name="pp.374-383 Olson and Cloud 2003"/&gt;

Before the Second World War ended, the Soviets installed a pro-Soviet regime. Although president Roosevelt "insisted on free and unfettered" elections in Poland, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] instead managed to deliver an election fair by "Soviet standards."&lt;ref name="daastol"/&gt; As many as half a million Polish soldiers refused to return to Poland,&lt;ref name="acu"/&gt; because of the [[Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)|Soviet repressions of Polish citizens]], the [[Trial of the Sixteen]] and other executions of pro-democracy Poles, particularly the so-called [[cursed soldiers]], former members of the Armia Krajowa. The result was the [[Polish Resettlement Act 1947]],&lt;ref name="legislation"/&gt; Britain's first mass immigration law.

Yalta was used by ruling communists to underline [[anti-Western sentiment]]s.&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; It was easy to argue that Poland was not very important to the West, since Allied leaders sacrificed Polish borders, legal government, and free elections.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharp_2"/&gt;

The Federal Republic of Germany, formed in 1949, was portrayed by Communist propaganda as the breeder of Hitler's posthumous offspring who desired retaliation and wanted to take back from Poland the "[[Recovered Territories]]".&lt;ref name="wielkopolska"/&gt; Giving this picture a grain of credibility was that the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] until 1970 refused to recognize the Oder-Neisse Line and that some West German officials had a tainted Nazi past. For a segment of Polish public opinion, Communist rule was seen as the lesser of the two evils.

Defenders of the actions taken by the Western allies maintain that ''[[Realpolitik]]'' made it impossible to do anything else, and that they were in no shape to start an utterly un-winnable war with the Soviet Union over the subjugation of Poland and other Central and Eastern European countries immediately after the end of World War II. It could be contended that the presence of a double standard with respect to Nazi and Soviet aggression existed in 1939 and 1940, when the Soviets attacked eastern part of Poland, and then the Baltic States, and then Finland, and yet the Western Allies chose not to intervene in the war.

The chief American negotiator at Yalta was [[Alger Hiss]], later accused of being a Soviet spy and convicted of [[perjury|perjuring]] himself in his testimony to the [[HUAC|House Committee on Unamerican Activities]]. This accusation was later corroborated by the [[Venona]] tapes.  In 2001, [[James Barron (journalist)|James Barron]], a staff reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', identified what he called a "growing consensus that Hiss, indeed, had most likely been a Soviet agent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Barron| first = James| title =Online, the Hiss Defense Doesn't Rest| work =The New York Times| date =August 16, 2001| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/16/technology/online-the-hiss-defense-doesn-t-rest.html?scp=1&amp;sq=The%20Hiss%20defense%20doesn't%20rest&amp;st=cse| accessdate =August 29, 2009 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

At the war's end many of these feelings of resentment were capitalised on by the occupying Soviets, who used them to reinforce anti-Western sentiments within Poland. Propaganda was produced by Communists to show the Soviet Union as the Great Liberator, and the West as the Great Traitor. Moscow's ''[[Pravda]]'' reported in February 1944 that all Poles who valued Poland's honour and independence were marching with the "Union of Polish Patriots" in the USSR.&lt;ref name="angelfire"/&gt;

===Aborted Yalta agreement enforcement plans===
{{Further information|Operation Unthinkable}}
At some point of Spring 1944, Churchill had commissioned a contingency military enforcement operation plan (war on the Soviet Union) to obtain "square deal for Poland" ([[Operation Unthinkable]]), which resulted in a May 22 report stating unfavorable success odds.&lt;ref name=OpUnthinkable-1/&gt; The report's arguments included geostrategic issues (possible Soviet-Japanese alliance resulting in moving of Japanese troops from continent to Home Islands, threat to Iran and Iraq) and uncertainties concerning land battles in Europe.&lt;ref name=OpUnthinkable-4/&gt;

==Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Yugoslavia==
{{Main article|Percentages agreement}}
During the [[Moscow Conference (1944)|Fourth Moscow Conference]] in 1944, Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] and British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]] discussed how to divide various European countries into [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].&lt;ref&gt;The American Historical Review, Vol. 83, No. 2, Apr., 1978, p. 368, {{jstor|1862322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Butterfield Ryan|title=The Vision of Anglo-America: The US-UK Alliance and the Emerging Cold War, 1943-1946|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRGu4C1FgKsC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Percentages+agreement|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89284-1|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Roberts|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939-1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GCFUqBRZ-QC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;dq=Percentages+agreement|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-11204-1|pages=217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Churchill's account of the incident is that Churchill suggested that the [[Soviet Union]] should have 90 percent influence in [[Romania]] and 75 percent in [[Bulgaria]]; the United Kingdom should have 90 percent in Greece; with a 50-50 share in Hungary and [[Yugoslavia]]. The two foreign ministers, [[Anthony Eden]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], negotiated about the percentage shares on October 10 and 11. The result of these discussions was that the percentages of Soviet influence in Bulgaria and, more significantly, Hungary were amended to 80 percent.
