'''Affective fallacy''' is a term from [[literary criticism]] used to refer to the supposed error of judging or evaluating a text on the basis of its emotional effects on a reader. The term was coined by [[William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr.|W.K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] in 1949 as a principle of [[New Criticism]] which is often paired with their study of ''The Intentional Fallacy''. 

==Concept==
The concept of affective fallacy is an answer to the idea of impressionistic criticism, which argues that the reader's response to a poem is the ultimate indication of its value. It is the antithesis of affective criticism, which is the practice of evaluating the effect that a literary work has on its reader or audience. The concept was presented after the authors had presented their paper on ''The Intentional Fallacy''.

First defined in an article published in ''The Sewanee Review'' in 1949, the concept of an affective fallacy was most clearly articulated in ''The Verbal Icon'', Wimsatt's collection of essays published in 1954. Wimsatt used the term to refer to all forms of criticism that understood a text's effect upon the reader to be the primary route to analyzing the importance and success of that text. This definition of the fallacy, if strictly followed, touches on or wholly includes nearly all of the major modes of literary criticism, from [[Ovid]]'s ''docere delictendo'' (to teach by delighting), [[Aristotle]]'s [[catharsis]],  and [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]'s concept of "transport" to late-nineteenth century [[belles-lettres]] and the contemporary [[Chicago Critics]]. For Wimsatt, the fallacy led to a number of potential errors, most of them related to emotional relativism. A view of literature based on its putative emotional effects will always be vulnerable to mystification and subjectivity; Wimsatt singles out the belletristic tradition exemplified by critics such as [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[George Saintsbury]] as an instance of a type of criticism that relies on subjective impressions and is thus unrepeatable and unreliable.

For Wimsatt, as for all the New Critics, such impressionistic approaches pose both practical and theoretical problems. In practical terms, it makes reliable comparisons of different critics difficult, if not irrelevant. In this light, the affective fallacy ran afoul of the New Critics' desire to place literary criticism on a more objective and principled basis. On the theoretical plane, the critical approach denoted as affective fallacy was fundamentally unsound because it denied the iconicity of the literary text. New Critical theorists stressed the unique nature of poetic language, and they asserted that—in view of this uniqueness—the role of the critic is to study and elucidate the thematic and stylistic "language" of each text on its own terms, without primary reference to an outside context, whether of history, biography, or reader-response.

In practice, Wimsatt and the other New Critics were less stringent in their application of the theory than in their theoretical pronouncements. Wimsatt admitted the appropriateness of commenting on emotional effects as an entry into a text, as long as those effects were not made the focus of analysis.

==Reception==
As with many concepts of [[New Criticism]], the concept of the affective fallacy was both controversial and, though widely influential, never accepted wholly by any great number of critics.

The first critiques of the concept came, naturally enough, from those academic schools against whom the New Critics were ranged in the 1940s and 1950s, principally the historical scholars and the remaining belletristic critics. Early commentary deplored the use of the word "fallacy" itself, which seemed to many critics unduly combative. More sympathetic critics, while still objecting to Wimsatt's tone, accepted as valuable and necessary his attempt to place criticism on a more objective basis.

However, the extremism of Wimsatt's approach was ultimately judged untenable by a number of critics. Just as [[New Historicism]] repudiated the New Critics' rejection of historical context, so [[reader-response criticism]] arose partly from dissatisfaction with the concept of the text as icon.  Reader-response critics denied that a text could have a quantifiable significance outside its being read and experienced by particular readers at particular moments. These critics rejected the idea of text as icon, focusing instead on the ramifications of the interaction between text and reader.

While the term remains current as a warning against unsophisticated use of emotional response in analyzing texts, the theory underlying the term has been thoroughly eclipsed by more recent developments in criticism.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Wimsatt and Beardsley==

"The Affective Fallacy is a confusion between the poem and its results (what it is and what it does), a special case of [[epistemological]] skepticism [ ... which ...] begins by trying to derive the standard of criticism from the psychological effects of the poem and ends in impressionism and relativism [with the result that] the poem itself, as an object of specifically critical judgment, tends to disappear." 

"The report of some readers ... that a poem or story induces in them vivid images, intense feelings, or heightened consciousness, is neither anything which can be refuted nor anything which it is possible for the objective critic to take into account." 

Wimsatt and Beardsley on an ideal, objective criticism: "It will not talk of tears, prickles or other physiological symptoms, of feeling angry, joyful, hot, cold, or intense, or of vaguer states of emotional disturbance, but of shades of distinction and relation between objects of emotion."

"The critic is not a contributor to statistical countable reports about the poem, but a teacher or explicator of meanings. His readers, if they are alert, will not be content to take what he says as testimony, but will scrutinize it as teaching."

[[File:Alison Lapper auf dem Blauen Sofa.jpg|right|thumb|Alison Lapper on the ''Blue Sofa'' [[Bertelsmann]] program, 2005]]

'''Alison Lapper''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 7{{nbsp}}April 1965 in [[Burton upon Trent]], [[Staffordshire]]&lt;ref name="Lapper-2005"/&gt;) is an English [[Mouth and foot painting|artist]]. She is the subject of the sculpture '''''Alison Lapper Pregnant''''', which was on display in [[Trafalgar Square]] until late 2007. She and her son Parys feature in the ongoing [[BBC]] docuseries ''[[Child of Our Time]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/alison-lapper-happy-son-parys-1734221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Alison Lapper was born without arms and with shortened legs, a condition called [[phocomelia]].  She was institutionalized in her infancy, and is still distant from her relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saner|first1=Emine|title=Alison Lapper: 'Disabled people are looked at as a drain on society, and I'm certainly not that'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/02/alison-lapper-disabled-people-drain-on-society|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was fitted with [[artificial limb]]s, she experienced them only as an attempt to make her look less disconcerting instead of actually helping her. So she abandoned them and learned to live without external aids.

At the age of 19, Lapper left [[Chailey Heritage School]] and moved to [[London]]. She acquired a driving licence and a flat. Lapper studied in [[The Faculty of Arts and Architecture]] at the [[University of Brighton]] and graduated with a first class [[honours degree]] in [[Fine Art]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Lapper-2005"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lapper |first=Alison |date=3 September 2005 |title=Beauty unseen, unsung|url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/features/story/0,11710,1561046,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=14 February 2012 |postscript=. Extract from autobiography, {{harvtxt|Lapper|2005}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Lapper uses [[photography]], [[digital imaging]], and [[painting]] to, as she says, question physical normality and beauty, using herself as a subject. She is a member of the [[Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World]] (AMFPA), having joined as a student member and receiving a full membership after her college graduation.&lt;ref name="Lapper-2005"/&gt; One particular influence is the sculpture [[Venus de Milo]], due to the physical similarities between the idealized classical female statue and Lapper's own body. She has taken part in various British exhibitions, including in the [[Royal Festival Hall]].  In May 2003, Lapper was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for her services for art.

After she had given birth to her son Parys in 2000, she created an installation of photographs of herself with him. Lapper and her son have featured on the ongoing BBC television documentary ''[[Child of Our Time]]''. In 2006, she published her book ''My Life in My Hands''.&lt;ref name="Lapper-2005"/&gt;

==Marc Quinn sculpture==
[[File:Alison Lapper Pregnant Paralympics opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|A giant replica of the sculpture in the [[2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony]].]]
She posed for [[Marc Quinn]] for the sculpture ''Alison Lapper Pregnant''.&lt;ref name="Lapper-2005"/&gt; Initially she refused to pose for Quinn. Lapper's hesitation was regarding the way in which Quinn depicted disability. She wanted to be sure the depiction was not of pity. Quinn expressed how statues where their limbs had fallen off were highly regarded and cherished. His intentions were to create art involving bodies born this way. When Quinn phoned a few months after the initial call, Lapper informed him she was now seven months pregnant. His reply was, "That's even better!" In November 1999, Lapper went to Quinn's studio to have the cast made.&lt;ref name="Lapper-2005"/&gt;

The sculpture is made of [[Carrara]] marble. It occupied the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|fourth plinth]] in London's [[Trafalgar Square]] between September 2005 and late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marc Quinn: ''Alison Lapper Pregnant'' |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/fourthplinth/commissions/marc-quinn |work=Fourth Plinth |publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=8 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426125355/http://www.london.gov.uk/fourthplinth/commissions/marc-quinn |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hart |first=Christopher |date=25 September 2005 |title=Review: My Life in My Hands by Alison Lapper with Guy Feldman |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/biography/article568942.ece |work=Times Online |location=London |accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lyall |first=Sarah |date=10 October 2005 |title=In Trafalgar Square, Much Ado About Statuary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/10/arts/design/10traf.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Charlotte |date=16 September 2005 |title=Sculpture's unveiling is pregnant with meaning |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1571296,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large replica featured in the [[2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony]].

==Honours==
In May 2003, Lapper was awarded  [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/4248926.stm |title=BBC Newsnight Review, 15 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; for services to art.

In July 2014, Lapper was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/28/artist-alison-lapper-doctorate-university-brighton |title=Artist Alison Lapper given honorary doctorate &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''All-Japan Association of Photographic Societies''' was founded in 1926 under the auspices of The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a well established Japanese newspaper, and is [[Japan]]'s leading photography enthusiast group. It has about 700 local chapters with a total membership of around 14,000. It has the objectives of advancing and expanding photographic culture, holding photographic competitions and exhibitions, workshops, events and tours.&lt;ref&gt;Toshifumi Hayasaka, Secretary General, The All-Japan Association of Photographic Societies&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The International Photographic Salon of Japan ==
The primary focus of The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' and the AJAPS is on The International Photographic Salon of Japan. The first Salon was held in 1927. It was suspended during the [[World War II]] but resumed after its end. The 75th Salon will be held in 2015.

Symposiums have been held in Switzerland, Scotland, and Italy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/medien/kultur-und-medien-oxford-in-venedig_id_5912862.html|title=Oxford in Venedig|first=FOCUS|last=Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fellowship aims to create a “dialogue between the disciplines” by having people 'talk and share ideas in a respectful spirit that makes a refreshing and uplifting contrast to the frenetic, angry tone of much contemporary discourse.' It has been described as being 'the antidote to too much time spent on social media in the digital age.'&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In addition to the annual symposium, the Fellowship provides ongoing financial support for young playwrights, writers and artists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015 The Alpine Fellowship endowed the ‘Alpine Fellows’ programme at [[NYU]] ensuring financial support for students pursuing interdisciplinary research at the Graduate Level at NYU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsas.nyu.edu/financial-support/fellowships/Alpine.html|title=The Alpine Fellowship|last1=NYU|first1=GSAS|date=|website=New York University|publisher=NYU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fellowship is above all committed to supporting those who want to help us better understand and appreciate each other through cultural means.

== Past events ==
In 2014 the Fellowship discussed the theme of 'representation' with contributions from the realms of academia, music and the visual arts. Philosophers emphasized the difficulties and dangers inherent in the subjectivist approach that regards the world as the 'mere' representation of the subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since 2015 the annual symposium has been held at the [[Cini Foundation|Fondazione Giorgio Cini]], on the island of San Giorgio, Venice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The 2015 symposium convened over the theme 'authorittrato - self-expression in the age of instant communication'. Participants tried to trace the historical developments that occurred since Albrecht Dürer's self-portrait in 1500 to today's 'selfie-culture'.&lt;ref name="AList" /&gt; In 2016 the Fellowship convened on the topic of ‘Ephemera’ and the nature of time. Philosophers [[Luciano Floridi]] and [[Mark Wrathall]] spoke to underline the way our self-understanding is inextricably bound up with our understanding of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2017 the Fellowship discussed the theme of 'landscape'. Amongst other things, virtual reality pioneer [[Nonny de la Peña|Nonny de la Pena]] gave a talk on 'virtual landscapes' that stirred much debate.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Prizes ==
The Alpine Fellowship offers a number of cash prizes in support of the arts. These include a £3000 Writing Prize, a £3000 visual arts prize and an opportunity to produce and perform a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alpinefellowship.com/submission/|title=Apply to the Alpine Fellowship|last=|first=|date=|website=Alpine Fellowship|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Un amour de femme''''' (''A Woman’s Love''), from the series ''Combats de femme'', is a 2001 [[French film]] directed by [[Sylvie Verheyde]] about Jeanne, a married woman who has an affair with a female dance instructor named Marie.

==Synopsis==
Jeanne ([[Hélène Fillières]]) a successful [[osteopath]] has been married to David ([[Anthony Delon]]) for 8 years and they have a son together Louis ([[William Wayolle]]). One evening, whilst reluctantly accompany her husband David to a party hosted for his friend Franck ([[Jeannick Gravelines]]), Jeanne meets Franck's cousin, a [[Dance education|dance instructor]] named Marie ([[Raffaëla Anderson]]). Jeanne and Marie quickly become friends, bonding over their love for dance, something which Jeanne had given up 10 years ago. As Jeanne and David prepare to leave the party, Marie invites Jeanne to attend her dance classes.

Initially excited to start dancing again, Jeanne becomes disheartened when her old dancing gear doesn't fit her like it used to and she is also unable to keep up with the rest of the class. Marie decides to cheer Jeanne up by taking her to the ocean for the weekend with her little brother Moïse ([[Thierno Sy]]). After walking along to beach together and then going dancing, they check into a hotel were Jeanne and Marie share a room. Both being unable to sleep, Jeanna gives Marie a [[massage]] but stops after she begins to get [[Turn-on|turned on]]. In the morning Jeanne, still confused about her feelings the night before, decides to take the train home early, leaving Marie and Moïse to enjoy the weekend together. However, before boarding the train, Jeanne and Marie kiss.

Jeanne, faced with decisions about her [[sexual orientation]], consults her friend Eloïse ([[Karole Rocher]]), telling her she thinks she is a [[lesbian]] and in love with Marie. Eloïse reacts [[Homophobia|negatively]] calling it disgusting and tells Jeanne she should not see Marie again. Despite this, Jeanne and Marie continue to meet up and after class one day, when David is away, she goes to eat dinner at Marie's house. After arriving at Marie's house, the relationship becomes physical and they have sex for the first time. Three weeks later Jeanne meets with her friend Eloïse again, this time she is slightly more understanding but still wishes she would stop meeting with Marie.

Back home, David asks Jeanne why she has been so distant recently. Unable to continue lying to him, she writes 'I'm in love with Marie' on a piece of paper and hands it to him. David becomes angry and, after a heated argument, he leaves to stay with Franck for a while. The next morning, Franck meets with Marie and tells her to stay away from Jeanne and David. David then goes to meet Jeanne and tells her to stop seeing Marie or he won't let he see her son Louis. Afraid of losing her son, Jeanne cuts contact with Marie and returns to David.

With Marie no longer around, Jeanne and David's relationship becomes worse as they constantly fight. Jeanne is heartbroken and becomes depressed to the point where her son Louis says she is no longer fun to be around. At night David gets [[cross dressing|dressed up]] in [[lingerie]] as an insult to Jeanne, telling her it is what she wants and they begin fighting once more. Jeanne decides she has had enough and in the morning she takes Louis to stay at her mother's ([[Roselyne Delpuech]]). After contacting her [[lawyer]], Jeanne goes to see Marie. The film ends with Jeanne and Marie walking along the beach together.

'''Ashton Lane''' is a cobbled backstreet in the [[Glasgow#The West End|West End]] of [[Glasgow]]. It is connected to [[Byres Road]] by a short linking lane beside [[Hillhead subway station]] and is noted for its bars, restaurants and a licensed cinema.
[[File:Glasgow westend (31).JPG|thumb|right|240px|Off the main thoroughfare of [[Byres Road]], Ashton Lane is a focus for bars, cafes and restaurants.]]

==Overview==
The Lane was not always the focus of West End cafe society. By the early 1970s, it was a run-down area of small residential and empty commercial properties. However, in 1976, the cost to renew the lease on the cramped property in Ruthven Lane that housed the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/16/ubiquitous-chip-glasgow-restaurant-review|title=The Ubiquitous Chip, Glasgow – restaurant review {{!}} Marina O'Loughlin|last=O'Loughlin|first=Marina|date=2014-05-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; forced the owner to look for new premises. 'The Chip', as it is locally known, moved to its current location in a derelict property that had been the stables for a funeral undertaker. The move was a gamble for the owner, Ronnie Clydesdale, since the Lane was a backwater to the thriving [[Byres Road|Byres Rd]] but in 1977 the [[Glasgow Underground|Glasgow Subway]] closed for a major refurbishment. This forced several small businesses to relocate from [[Byres Road|Byres Rd]] and the then-famous Grosvenor Cafe followed The Chip into Ashton Lane.

[[File:AshtonLaneGlasgow.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Ashton Lane, looking from Great George Street.]]

Other bars and restaurants were opened: the Cul-de-Sac creperie in the former [[Barr and Stroud]] factory and Bar Brel in the old coachhouse that had been used latterly as a landscape gardener's yard but was, in 1910, the chauffeur’s house and garage for Dr Marion Gilchrist’s 'prim dark green Wolseley landaulette'. Dr Gilchrist (1864-1952) was, in 1894, the first woman to graduate in medicine in Scotland.

[[File:CresswellLaneGlasgow.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Cresswell Lane, Glasgow.]]

The Grosvenor Picture Theatre was built on site of Henderson’s Cab and Funeral Office in Byres Road and Ashton Lane. The cinema opened on 3 May 1921 with 'Helen of the Four Gates' and 'Eastwards Ho' and the performances were accompanied by the theatre’s own orchestra and organist. The building was designed by architects Gardner &amp; Glen and had a distinctive terracotta façade. The original entrance faced Byres Road and the upper level housed a Café and American Soda Fountain and, by 1929, a waiting room. The original cinema seated around 1,350 people, but in the 1970s it underwent considerable reconstruction. The entrance was moved from Byres Rd to Ashton Lane, and the old entrance became Bonham's Wine Bar (the railing in the original foyer is retained in the upstairs bar). After falling into disrepair, the cinema closed 30 June 2002, but was relaunched in October 2003 after a multimillion-pound refurbishment. This created two screens on the ground floor, a bar and restaurant in the former neglected roof space and a new cafe/bar on Ashton Lane. The cinema now has two screens, each seating a hundred people and shows a mix of blockbuster and art-house movies. 

Today, bars and restaurants occupy most of the premises in Ashton Lane. The Famous Grosvenor Cafe and the now internationally renowned 'Chip' remain a defining feature. Some like Jinty McGuintys Irish Bar have been there a while too, almost 25 years.

Ashton Lane continues north as Cresswell Lane, where the variety of bars and restaurants is supplemented by a gallery of small specialist shops. The Lane and its surroundings might then be regarded as Glasgow's equivalent of [[Dublin]]'s [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] area or [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Rose Street]]. While still popular with local residents and students, it is now firmly established on the Glasgow tourist trail.

'''''Between Hitler and Stalin:  Ukraine in World War II''''' is a 2003 film produced and directed by [[Slavko Nowytski]] and narrated by [[Jack Palance]]. The one-hour documentary, part black-and-white and part color, is a project of [[Ukrainian Canadian Research and Documentation Centre]] – an attempt to tell the story of [[World War II]] from a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] perspective.

In a chronological manner, Nowytski's film unfolds during the years of [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Soviet–Nazi collaboration]] recounting the losses and suffering of the Ukrainian people; the documentary shifts to the destruction wrought by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s scorched earth policy as the [[Soviet Union military]] retreated, and shows the ruins left behind by the German and then the Soviet offensives.&lt;ref name=ukrweekly&gt;Zakydalsky, Oksana.  [http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/2003/450303.shtml Documentary "Between Hitler and Stalin" offers untold story of Ukraine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033316/http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/2003/450303.shtml |date=September 30, 2007}}. ''The Ukrainian Weekly''. 9 November 2003, No. 45, Vol. LXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Between Hitler and Stalin'' describes the activity of the underground resistance movements, and specifically the long and large-scale struggle of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA) on two fronts, against both totalitarian powers, for [[Ukraine]]'s independence. As Oksana Zakydalsky writes for ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'': "although [World War II is] often called the Russo-German war or described as Russia at war, only parts of Russia were occupied, while all Ukrainian territories were invaded and laid waste by both the Nazi and Soviet war machines. ... The film documents Ukraine's contribution to the war against totalitarianism and the price Ukraine paid for its independence."&lt;ref name=ukrweekly /&gt;

For historical and political commentary, the film relies on [[Norman Davies]], a historian from [[University of London]]; [[Robert Conquest]], a Soviet scholar at [[Hoover Institute]]; John Armstrong, an insurgency expert, and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], a former US National Security Adviser.

[[Image:100 views edo 010.jpg|thumb|In this print, [[Hiroshige]] used bokashi in the foreground, at the horizon, in the sky, on the priest's robes, and in the square cartouche]]

'''''Bokashi''''' (Japanese: ぼかし) is a technique used in [[Woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printmaking]].  It achieves a variation in lightness and darkness ([[Lightness (color)|value]]) of a single color or multiple colors by hand applying a gradation of ink to a moistened wooden printing block, rather than inking the block uniformly.  This hand-application had to be repeated for each sheet of paper that was printed.

The best-known examples of bokashi are in the 19th-century ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' works of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]], in which the fading of [[Prussian blue]] dyes in skies and water create an illusion of depth.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=102}} In later work by [[Hiroshige]], for example the series ''[[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]]'', most prints originally featured bokashi such as red-to-yellow-to-blue color sunrises.

==Techniques==

Gradations can be created on the blocks themselves using the ''{{transl|ja|itobokashi}}'' technique, or brushed on by hand using ''{{transl|ja|fukibokashi}}''.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=102}}  They can also be done freehand directly onto a print, without using a printing block.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=106}}

===''Fukibokashi''===

''{{transl|ja|Fukibokashi}}'' requires gradations of ink to be applied to the printing block.  This is not a precise technique; its results are inconsisistent from print to print.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=102}}

The technique ''{{transl|ja|ichimoji bokashi}}'' ({{lang|ja|一文字ぼかし}}, "straight-line bokashi") is the one associated with the works of Hokusai and Hiroshige.  Ink is applied only to one end of the brush's bristles, and the brush is drawn across the desired portion of the printing block; this area is first wetted with a ''{{transl|ja|zōkin}}'' cloth, so that the ink bleeds somewhat across the wet area.  This creates a gradation at the width of the brush.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=103}}

[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|alt=|The darkened peak of Mount Fuji is an example of ''{{transl|ja|hakkake bokashi}}''.&lt;br /&gt;''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning]]'', [[Hokusai]], {{circa|1830}}]]

In ''{{transl|ja|futa-iro bokashi}}'' ({{lang|ja|二色ぼかし}}) two colours are worked toward each other, achieved by applying two inks to opposite edges of the brush.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=106}}  In ''{{transl|ja|hakkake bokashi}}'' a flat colour is printed, and then the same printing block is washed and re-brushed with a ''{{transl|ja|bokashi}}'' effect to overprint over the first; this technique is seen on the dark peak of Mount Fuji in Hokusai's ''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning]]''.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=106}}

===''Itabokashi''===
''Itabokashi'', or 'block shading,' is a technique used to produce ruffled edges on areas of color. It is produced by first cutting an area slightly larger than needed for a color, then abrading the edges of that area to make the transition from that color less sharp. This is commonly used in clouds and shading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/i/itabokashi.htm|title=JAANUS / itabokashi  板ぼかし|last=System|first=Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users|website=www.aisf.or.jp|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Freehand techniques===

Some techniques are performed freehand, without using a printing block, and results can vary considerably from print to print.  ''{{transl|ja|Kumadori bokashi}}'' is used for finer details, such as around eyes, and requires the artist to draw with a brush loaded with ink on a wetted area; as with ''{{transl|ja|ichimonji bokashi}}'', the bleeding of the ink into the water creates gradations.  ''{{transl|ja|Atenashi bokashi}}'' is similar, requiring the wetting of areas to be inked, and is used for details such as clouds.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=106}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4724">'''Book Art''' is the field of art that involves the creation of works that use or refer to structural and conceptual properties of books. The term also is used to describe works of art produced in this field. These works may contain text and/or images, or may be sculptural. Book art has existed for thousands of years, and can be seen in Egyptian papyri, Chinese, Japanese and Korean scrolls and books, Mesoamerican codices, and in one form or another, through all human history. In an interview within Cathy Courtney's book ''Speaking of Book Art,'' book artist Helen Douglas discusses her knowledge of ''livres d' artiste'' and twentieth-century Russian books as examples of book art from previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Book Art|last=Courtney|first=Cathy|publisher=Anderson-Lovelace|year=1999|isbn=0-9626372-5-4|location=Los Altos Hills, CA|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the interview Douglas continues to write about the genre of Book Art stating that "...you can talk about a "painting" and "sculpture" you should be able to talk about "book"." The term "Book Arts" refers to the creative and craft disciplines used to produce book art, such as printing, printmaking, papermaking, typography and bookbinding. As a field of contemporary art, Book Art has seen an explosive growth since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright|first= Betty|title= No Longer Innocent: Book Art In America 1960-1980|place= New York|publisher= Granary Books|date= 2005| isbn= 1887123717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s many college Book Art programs have evolved, including MFA programs at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bookarts.ua.edu/about-the-mfa-program/|title=About the MFA Program - Book Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a MFA in Book Art and Creative Writing Mills College in Oakland, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mills.edu/academics/graduate/eng/programs/MFA_in_bookart.php|title=MFA in Book Art and Creative Writing - Book Arts MFA - Mills College|first=Mills College -|last=English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College Book Art Association (CBAA) was founded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbaa.wildapricot.org/|title=College Book Art Association - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBAA organizes annual conferences, publishes an open access journal titled ''Openings: Studies in Book Art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbaa.wildapricot.org/page-1492718|title=College Book Art Association - CBAA Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a blog on ''Book Art Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbaa.wildapricot.org/bookarttheory|title=College Book Art Association - Book Art Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several sub-fields within Book Art, including [[Fine press|fine press books]], sculptural [[Book Works|bookworks]], [[Artist's book|artist books]], [[Altered book|altered books]], designer bookbindings, installations and performances. As this entry evolves examples of works in the subfields will be added, as well as a history of book art, and organizations that exhibit, teach and promote book art, such as the Center for Book Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforbookarts.org/|title=The Center for Book Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in New York City, the Minnesota Center for Book Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnbookarts.org/|title=Minnesota Center for Book Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Minneapolis and the San Francisco Center for the Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sfcb.org/|title=San Francisco Center for the Book|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Katherine M. Ruffin's 2017 essay "A Typology for the Structures of Book Arts Programs" describes five different types of organizations that now offer programs in Book Art as Book Arts Programs in Liberal Arts Colleges, Book Arts Programs at Universities, Book Arts Programs at Art Colleges and Universities, Book Arts Programs at Craft Schools, and Book Arts Programs as Independent Not-for-Profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruffin|first=Katherine M.|date=2017|title=A Typology of Structures of Book Arts Programs|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/cbaa/index.php/jcbaa/article/view/32/56|journal=Openings|volume=3|pages=36-37|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine press Book Art follows in the tradition of the book as precious object. Publishers like [William Morris|William Morris’s] Kelmscott Press from the British [Arts and Crafts movement] was an imporatant precursor to fine press Book Art. Examples of 20th century fine press Book Art include works published by Arron Press and The Gahenna Press. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Books as Art |last= Eaton |first= Timothy A. |publisher= Boca Raton Museum of Art |year=1991 |location= Boca Raton, FL |pages= 10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cheaper by the Dozen 2''''' is a 2005 American [[Children's film|family]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the [[sequel]] to the family [[comedy film]] ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (2003). [[Shawn Levy]], the director of the first film, did not return as director for this one, which was instead directed by [[Adam Shankman]] (''[[The Pacifier]]''). Levy was a producer of it and made an appearance as a hospital intern in it. [[Steve Martin]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Piper Perabo]], [[Alyson Stoner]], and [[Tom Welling]] reprise their roles as members of the twelve-child Baker family. [[Eugene Levy]] co-stars as the patriarch of a rival family of eight children. [[Carmen Electra]] portrays his wife.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
Two years after Tom Baker resigned from his head coaching position, his family begins to undergo many changes, beginning with Lorraine and her desire to study in New York. Their oldest daughter, Nora, is now married to Bud McNulty and heavily pregnant with their first child. They intend to move to [[Houston]] because of his new job promotion.

Feeling the family is breaking apart as the children grow up and move away, Tom persuades them to take one last family vacation all together at Lake Winnetka. Tom's old rival, Jimmy Murtaugh, and his large family (with "only" eight kids) are also there for the summer. He constantly flaunts his wealth and success to Tom, as well as the accomplishments of his children, often suggesting to Tom that his are less successful because of his parenting style. They get into many incidents, several of which are accidental: Mark Baker, along with Kenny Murtaugh, crashes into a tennis court with a golf cart, Sarah Baker is caught shoplifting in a gift shop, and Mark accidentally sets off a backpack of fireworks, causing widespread panic, especially when it is thrown into a boat, igniting its engine and causing it to explode.

Jimmy again starts the topic that Tom needs to use a firmer hand on his kids. He is angered by this, and they decide to settle the matter at the Annual [[Labor Day]] Family Cup. He trains the kids for days, not realizing they are miserable. Sarah and Elliot Murtaugh watch ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' together, but are spied on by their fathers, which ultimately results in them getting into an argument and humiliating their children. Upon returning home, Sarah is furious and refuses to compete for Tom in the Cup. Everyone, including Kate, is angry with him, not only for spying on Sarah, but also for ruining the entire trip through his competitiveness with the Murtaughs.

The next morning, Tom goes to the Cup to compete with Nigel and Kyle (the only two still willing to go). However, after discovering an old "Team Baker" flag, Kate and the rest of the kids show up, showing they forgive him and are willing to compete. After the events, however, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are tied for first; a tiebreaking canoe race is announced, in which every family member must compete. During it, Nora goes into labor; the Murtaughs want to help, but Jimmy, sensing the opportunity to defeat Tom once and for all, initially refuses to do so. Eventually, his family convince him that he should help the Bakers, and the Bakers and the Murtaughs work together to get Nora to the hospital. Bud, Lorraine, and Kate go with her in the delivery room, while Tom, Jimmy, Sarina, and the rest of the kids stay in the waiting room. While talking to Jimmy, Tom realizes that he has to let his kids grow, but wherever they go, they will always be with him, and he will always be with them. Nora then gives birth to a baby boy who she and Bud name Tom in honor of his grandfather, who has shown them "there is no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one." Bud announces that they have bought "The Big House", the vacation home that the Bakers have been renting. Nora, Bud, and baby Tom leave for [[Houston]] a few days later while the Bakers continue their vacation at Lake Winnetka.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] ranked ''Cheaper by the Dozen 2'' 98th in the 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s, with a rating of 6% based on 93 reviews of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Worst of the Worst Pictures |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/features/special/2007/wotw/?r=4&amp;mid=1119026 |publisher=[[Flixster]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2010-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208094114/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/features/special/2007/wotw/?r=4&amp;mid=1119026 |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's consensus reads " A sequel to a remake, ''Cheaper 2'' wastes its solid cast in scenes of over-the-top, predictable humor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cheaper_by_the_dozen_2/| title = Cheaper by the Dozen 2|publisher =[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], it has a score of 34 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cheaper-by-the-dozen-2 |title=Cheaper by the Dozen 2 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]], gave the film one of its rare positive reviews, awarding it 3/4 stars and stating "As I watched this sequel, a certain good feeling began to make itself known. Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (2005 film)|Yours, Mine, and Ours]]''." Ebert also highly praised [[Alyson Stoner]]'s performance, favorably comparing the then-twelve year old actress to [[Reese Witherspoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Cheaper by the Dozen 2 Movie Review (2005)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cheaper-by-the-dozen-2-2005|website=Roger Ebert|accessdate=8 August 2017|language=en|date=20 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling the overall film "bland", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s Justin Chang agreed with Ebert on Stoner, calling her "an endearingly vulnerable standout" and deeming her subplot to be "the most engaging" in it. Chang was also kind to [[Steve Martin]], [[Bonnie Hunt]] and [[Eugene Levy]], deeming the veteran actors did the best with what was given to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chang|first1=Justin|title=Review: 'Cheaper by the Dozen 2'|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/cheaper-by-the-dozen-2-1200519584/|website=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|accessdate=8 August 2017|date=21 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marrit Ingman of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' conceded that it had a good message, and agreed that Hunt was "marvelous and down-to-earth" but ultimately felt that "the rest of the movie is as funny as mildew", found that "the product placement is particularly egregious" and thought that [[Hilary Duff]] looked "as tanned and raw as buffalo jerky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingman|first1=Marrit|title=Film Review: Cheaper by the Dozen 2|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2005-12-23/320082/|website=''[[Austin Chronicle]]''|accessdate=8 August 2017|date=23 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Gronvall was also horrified by Duff's appearance while writing for the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', calling her "haggard" and "flat-out scary", and overall felt that there was "a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved", however singling out [[Carmen Electra]] for being "the most winning performer of the bunch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gronvall|first1=Andrea|title=Cheaper by the Dozen 2|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/cheaper-by-the-dozen-2/Film?oid=1073436|website=''[[Chicago Reader]]''|accessdate=8 August 2017|language=en|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received two [[Razzie Award]] nominations including Worst Actress ([[Hilary Duff]]) and Worst Supporting Actor ([[Eugene Levy]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The '''cinema of China''' is one of three distinct historical threads of [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] cinema together with the [[cinema of Hong Kong]] and the [[cinema of Taiwan]].

Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on [[Shanghai]] in the first decades. The first [[sound film]], ''Sing-Song Girl Red Peony'', using the [[sound-on-disc]] technology, was made in 1931. The 1930s, considered the first "golden period" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement and the dispute between [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] was reflected in the films produced. After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] and the occupation of Shanghai, the industry in the city was severely curtailed, with filmmakers moving to [[Hong Kong]], [[Chongqing]] and other places, starting a "Solitary Island" period in Shanghai, referring to the city's foreign concessions, with the remaining filmmakers working there. ''[[Princess Iron Fan (1941 film)|Princess Iron Fan]]'' (1941), the first [[Chinese animation|Chinese animated]] feature film, was released at the end of this period. It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later [[Osamu Tezuka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "A Wartime Romance: Princess Iron Fan and the Chinese Connection in Early Japanese Animation," in On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China.|last = Du|first = Daisy Yan|publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison.|year = May 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 15–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941, and until the end of the war in 1945, the film industry in the city was under Japanese control.

After the end of the war, a second golden age took place, with production in Shanghai resuming, with films such as ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), named the [[Hong Kong Film Awards#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|best Chinese-language film]] at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]]. After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]] in 1949, previous and some foreign films were banned in 1951, and movie attendance increased sharply. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the "scar dramas" of the 1980s, such as ''[[Evening Rain]]'' (1980), ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' (1980) and ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984), the rise of the [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation]] brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences, with films like ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'' (1987), ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'' (1992) and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) winning major international awards. The movement partially ended after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system and played mostly on the international film festival circuit.

Following the international commercial success of films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema has increased and there has been a movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. After ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) demonstrated the viability of the commercial model, and with the growth of the Chinese box office in the new millennium, Chinese films have broken box office records and, as of January 2017, 5 of the top 10 [[List of highest-grossing films in China|highest-grossing films in China]] are domestic productions. ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) was the first Chinese film to reach {{CNY|1 billion}} at the Chinese box office, ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) was the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}, ''[[The Mermaid (2016 film)|The Mermaid]]'' (2016) was the first to {{CNY|3 billion}} and ''[[Wolf Warriors 2|Wolf Warrior 2]]'' (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film in China.

[[Motion pictures]] were introduced to China in 1896. The first recorded screening of a motion picture in China occurred in [[Shanghai]] on August 11, 1896, as an "act" on a variety bill.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Chris. "China Before 1949", in ''The Oxford History of World Cinema'', edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Chinese film, a recording of the [[Peking opera]], ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in November 1905 in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=Geiselmann&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.univie.ac.at/Sinologie/repository/ueLK110_ChinFilmgesch/filmgeschichteSkript.pdf

In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, ''[[The Difficult Couple]]'', was filmed in Shanghai by [[Zheng Zhengqiu]] and [[Zhang Shichuan]].&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nydlzbe2LhEC&amp;pg=PA1945 |title=East Asian Cinema |author= David Carter |publisher=Kamera Books |year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhang Shichuan then set up the first Chinese-owned film production company in 1916. The first truly successful home-grown feature film was ''Yan Ruisheng'' ([[:zh:閻瑞生|閻瑞生]]) released in 1921. During the 1920s film technicians from the United States trained Chinese technicians in Shanghai, and American influence continued to be felt there for the next two decades.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

It was during this period that some of the more important production companies first came into being, notably [[Mingxing Film Company|Mingxing]] ("Star") and the Shaw brothers' [[Tianyi Film Company|Tianyi]] ("Unique"). Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, ''[[Laborer's Love]]'' (1922).&lt;ref name=Centennial&gt;{{cite web| url = http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| title = A Centennial Review of Chinese Cinema| accessdate = 2007-04-26| author = Zhang Yingjin| date = 2003-10-10| publisher = University of California-San Diego| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907160026/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| archivedate = 2008-09-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/denton2/courses/c505/temp/history/chapter2.html | title = A Brief History of Chinese Film | accessdate = 2007-04-24 | publisher = Ohio State University | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140410062249/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/denton2/courses/c505/temp/history/chapter2.html | archivedate = 2014-04-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Chris.

===Leftist movement===
[[File:LoveandDuty.jpg|left|thumb|20-year-old [[Ruan Lingyu]], a superstar during the silent film era, in ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931).]]
However, the first truly important Chinese films were produced beginning in the 1930s, with the advent of the "progressive" or "left-wing" movement, like [[Cheng Bugao]]'s ''[[Spring Silkworms (film)|Spring Silkworms]]'' (1933), [[Wu Yonggang]]'s ''[[The Goddess (1934 film)|The Goddess]]'' (1934), and [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]]'s ''[[The Big Road]]'' (1935). These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in ''Spring Silkworms'' and a prostitute in ''The Goddess''.&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first "golden period" of Chinese cinema.&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.&lt;ref&gt;Laikwan Pang, ''Building a New China in Cinema'' (Rowman and Littlefield Productions, Oxford, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[production company|production companies]] dominated the market in the early to mid- 1930s: the newly formed [[Lianhua Film Company|Lianhua]] ("United China"),{{efn|Lianhua is also sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the "United Photoplay Service"}} the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/international/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100802065514/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archivedate = 2010-08-02 | title = Timeline | accessdate = 2006-05-08 | author = Kraicer, Shelly |date= 2005-12-06| work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua's management perhaps more so),&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.

[[File:Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm.ogv|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[Children of Troubled Times]]'', a patriotic 1935 Chinese film most famous as the origin of "The March of the Volunteers", the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.]]

The period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as [[Hu Die]], [[Ruan Lingyu]], [[Li Lili]], [[Chen Yanyan]], [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Zhao Dan]] and [[Jin Yan]]. Other major films of the period include ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931), ''[[Little Toys]]'' (1933), ''[[New Women]]'' (1934), ''[[Song of the Fishermen]]'' (1934), ''[[Plunder of Peach and Plum]]'' (1934), ''[[Crossroads (1937 film)|Crossroads]]'' (1937), and ''[[Street Angel (1937 film)|Street Angel]]'' (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.

===Japanese occupation and World War II===

[[File:ZhouXuan1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Zhou Xuan]], an iconic Chinese singer and film actress.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, in particular the [[Battle of Shanghai]], ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except [[Xinhua Film Company]] ("New China") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to [[Hong Kong]], the wartime Nationalist capital [[Chongqing]], and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the "[[Solitary Island]]" period (also known as the "Sole Island" or "Orphan Island"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an "island" of production in the "sea" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director [[Bu Wancang]]'s ''[[Mulan Joins the Army (1939 film)|Mulan Joins the Army]]'' (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war.&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| title = Sole Island Movies| accessdate = 2006-08-18| author = Ministry of Culture Staff| year = 2003| publisher = ChinaCulture.org| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826094341/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| archivedate = 2006-08-26| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on December 7, 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation. With the Shanghai industry firmly in Japanese control, films like the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]-promoting ''[[Eternity (1943 film)|Eternity]]'' (1943) were produced.&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt; At the end of [[World War II]], one of the most controversial Japanese-authorized company, [[Manchukuo Film Association]], would be separated and integrated into Chinese cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baskett | first = Michael | year = 2008 | title = The Attractive Empire: Transnational Film Culture in Imperial Japan | publisher = [[University of Hawai'i Press]] | location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3223-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4QfrTyvWEC |accessdate= 2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Golden Age==
[[File:New Fisherman's Song.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wang Danfeng]] in the film ''New Fisherman's Song'' (1942)]]

The film industry continued to develop after 1945. Production in Shanghai once again resumed as a new crop of studios took the place that Lianhua and Mingxing had occupied in the previous decade. In 1946, [[Cai Chusheng]] returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the "Lianhua Film Society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/directors_ccwlc.html#cai |title=Chinese Cinema - Cai Chusheng |accessdate=2007-04-25 |author=Zhang Yingjin |date=2007-01-01 |publisher=University of California-San Diego |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307193958/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/directors_ccwlc.html |archivedate=March 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn became [[Kunlun Film Company|Kunlun Studios]] which would go on to become one of the most important studios of the era, putting out the classics ''[[The Spring River Flows East]]'' (1947), ''[[Myriad of Lights]]'' (1948), ''[[Crows and Sparrows]]'' (1949) and ''[[San Mao, The Little Vagabond]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/organisation/13907 | title = Kunlun Film Company| accessdate = 2007-04-25| author = |year= 2004| publisher = British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of these films showed the disillusionment with the oppressive rule of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist Party. ''The Spring River Flows East'', a three-hour-long two-parter directed by Cai Chusheng and [[Zheng Junli]], was a particularly strong success. Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, struck a chord with audiences of the time.

Meanwhile, companies like the [[Wenhua Film Company]] ("Culture Films"), moved away from the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua's fare are its first two postwar features, ''[[Unending Emotions]]'' (1947) and ''[[Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom]]'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;Pickowicz, Paul G. "Chinese Film-making on the Eve of the Communist Revolution", in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'', edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward (2011). BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Another memorable Wenhua film is ''[[Long Live the Missus]]'' (1947), like ''Unending Emotions'' with an original screenplay by writer [[Eileen Chang]]. Wenhua's romantic drama ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), a film by director [[Fei Mu]] shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hkfaa.com/news/100films.html | title = Welcome to the Hong Kong Film Awards| accessdate = 2007-04-04 | author = |year= 2004| publisher =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, it was precisely its artistic quality and apparent lack of "political grounding" that led to its labeling by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] as rightist or reactionary, and the film was quickly forgotten by those on the mainland following the [[Chinese Civil War|Communist victory]] in China in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Yingjin, "Introduction" in ''Cinema and Urban Culture in Shanghai, 1922–1943'', ed. Yingjin Zhang (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the China Film Archive's re-opening after the Cultural Revolution, a new print was struck from the original negative, allowing ''Spring of the Small Town'' to find a new and admiring audience and to influence an entire new generation of filmmakers. Indeed, an acclaimed [[Springtime in a Small Town|remake]] was made in 2002 by [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]. ''[[Remorse at Death]]'' (1948), by the same director, was the first Chinese [[Color motion picture film|color film]].

==Early Communist era==

With the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution in China]] in 1949, the government saw motion pictures as an important mass production art form and tool for [[propaganda]]. Starting from 1951, pre-1949 Chinese films, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and Hong Kong productions were banned as the [[Communist Party of China]] sought to tighten control over mass media, producing instead movies centering on peasants, soldiers and workers, such as ''[[Bridge (1949 film)|Bridge]]'' (1949) and ''[[The White Haired Girl (film)|The White Haired Girl]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"&gt;Yau, Esther. "China After the Revolution", in ''The Oxford History of World Cinema'', edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the production bases in the middle of all the transition was the [[Changchun Film Studio]].

The private studios in Shanghai, including Kunming, Wenhua, Guotai and Datong, were encouraged to make new films from 1949 to 1951. They made approximately 47 films during this period, but soon ran into trouble, owing to the furore over the Kunlun-produced drama ''[[The Life of Wu Xun]]'' (1950), directed by [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]] and starring veteran Zhao Dan. The feature was accused in an anonymous article in ''[[People's Daily]]'' in May 1951 of spreading feudal ideas. After the article was revealed to be penned by [[Mao Zedong]], the film was banned, a Film Steering Committee was formed to "re-educate" the film industry and within two years, these private studios were all incorporated into the state-run [[Shanghai Film Studio]].&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Julian 2011 p. 88"&gt;Ward, Julian.

BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist regime solved the problem of a lack of film theaters by building mobile projection units which could tour the remote regions of China, ensuring that even the poorest could have access to films. By 1965 there were around 20,393 such units.&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"/&gt; The number of movie-viewers hence increased sharply, partly bolstered by the fact that film tickets were given out to work units and attendance was compulsory,&lt;ref name="Ward, Julian 2011 p. 88"/&gt; with admissions rising from 47 million in 1949 to 4.15 billion in 1959.&lt;ref name="Bordwell and Thompson 2010 371"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17 years between the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]], 603 feature films and 8,342 reels of documentaries and [[newsreel]]s were produced, sponsored mostly as Communist propaganda by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/film/84966.htm | title = Film Industry in China | accessdate = 2007-02-27 | author = Li Xiao |date= 2004-01-17| publisher = China.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[Guerrilla on the Railroad]]'' (铁道游击队), dated 1956, the Chinese Communist Party was depicted as the primary resistance force against the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese in the war against invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yumi.

The thawing of censorship in 1956–57 (known as the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]]) and the early 1960s led to more indigenous Chinese films being made which were less reliant on their Soviet counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this campaign the sharpest criticisms came from the satirical comedies of [[Lü Ban]]. ''[[Before the New Director Arrives]]'' exposes the hierarchical relationships occurring between the cadres, while his next film, ''[[The Unfinished Comedy]]'' (1957), was labelled as a "poisonous weed" during the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] and Lü banned was from directing for life.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther.

The most prominent filmmaker of this era was [[Xie Jin]], whose three films in particular, ''[[Woman Basketball Player No. 5]]'' (1957), ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1961 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'' (1961) and ''[[Two Stage Sisters]]'' (1964), exemplify China's increased expertise at filmmaking during this time. Films made during this period are polished and exhibit high production value and elaborate sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Beijing]] and Shanghai remained the main centers of production, between 1957–60 the government built regional studios in [[Guangzhou]], [[Xi'an]] and [[Chengdu]] to encourage representations of ethnic minorities in films. Chinese cinema began to directly address the issue of such ethnic minorities during the late 1950s and early 1960s, in films like ''[[Five Golden Flowers]]'' (1959), ''[[Third Sister Liu]]'' (1960), ''[[Serfs (1963 film)|Serfs]]'' (1963), ''[[Ashima (poem)|Ashima]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=370–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther.

==Cultural Revolution and its aftermath==
During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted. Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the so-called "revolutionary model operas". The most notable of these was a [[ballet]] version of the revolutionary opera ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1970 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'', directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970. Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the [[Gang of Four]] until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975's ''[[Breaking with Old Ideas]]'', were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Yingjin &amp; Xiao, Zhiwei. "Breaking with Old Ideas" in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Film''. Taylor &amp; Francis (1998), p. 101. {{ISBN|0-415-15168-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign [[film festival]]s sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and "exploratory" films like their counterparts in the West.

In the 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and [[martial art]]s films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Ministry of Culture]] to the newly formed [[Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television (China)|Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television]] to bring it under "stricter control and management" and to "strengthen supervision over production."

The end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of "scar dramas", which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin's ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], also helping to legitimize Deng's new policies of "[[reform and opening up]]." For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 [[Golden Rooster Awards]] was given to two "scar dramas", ''[[Evening Rain]]'' ([[Wu Yonggang]], [[Wu Yigong]], 1980) and ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' ([[Xie Jin]], 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther. "China After the Revolution", in ''The Oxford history of world cinema'' edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. ''The Blue Kite'', though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the events of June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square, few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.

==Rise of the Fifth Generation==
[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|A movie theater in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]]]]
Beginning in the mid-late 1980s, the rise of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the [[Beijing Film Academy]] in 1982 and included [[Zhang Yimou]], [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]], [[Chen Kaige]], [[Zhang Junzhao]] and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the [[Cultural Revolution]] and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm | title = The Irresistible Rise of Asian Cinema-Tian Zhuangzhuang: A Director of the 21st Century| accessdate = 2007-04-23 |date= 2002-11-19 | author=Yvonne Ng|publisher = Kinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070416073506/http://kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the so-called [[scar literature]] in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation.{{efn|Notably Zhang Yimou served as cinematographer for both films.}} The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as ''[[King of the Children]]'' (1987), ''[[Ju Dou]]'' (1989), ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) and ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'' (1991), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western [[art film|arthouse]] audience. [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'', the 1992 [[Golden Lion]] for ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'', the 1993 [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', and three [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] nominations from the Academy Awards.&lt;ref name=Greatfall/&gt; All these award-winning films starred actress [[Gong Li]], who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.

Diverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from [[black comedy]] ([[Huang Jianxin]]'s ''[[The Black Cannon Incident]]'', 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's ''[[Life on a String (film)|Life on a String]]'', 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include [[Wu Ziniu]], [[Hu Mei]], [[Li Shaohong]] and [[Zhou Xiaowen]]. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentary fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=639–640}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.

These films came with a new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and [[long shot]]s. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=638–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. [[Wu Tianming]], in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the [[Xi'an Film Studio]] (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'' (1986) and ''[[The King of Masks]]'' (1996).

The Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen Incident]], although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the [[United States]] (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for [[Australia]], while many others went into television-related works.

==Main melody dramas==
In 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes "the main melody" (主旋律) to "invigorate national spirit and national pride".&lt;ref&gt;Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2008, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; These "main melody" films (主旋律电影), still produced regularly nowadays, try to emulate the commercial mainstream by the use of Hollywood-style music and special effects.
They are often subsidized by the state and have free access to government and military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yomi. "Contemporary Mainstream PRC Cinema" in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'' (2011), edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward, BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August 1st Film Studio]], the film and TV production arm of the [[People's Liberation Army]], is a studio which produces "main melody" cinema. "Main melody" films, which often depict past military engagements or are biopics of first-generation CCP leaders, have won several Best Picture prizes at the [[Golden Rooster Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2008, p. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more famous "main melody" dramas include the ten-hour epic ''[[Decisive Engagement]]'' (大决战, 1991), directed by Cai Jiawei, Yang Guangyuan and Wei Lian; ''[[The Opium War (film)|The Opium War]]'' (1997), directed by [[Xie Jin]]; and ''[[The Founding of a Republic]]'' (2009), directed by [[Han Sanping]] and Fifth Generation director [[Huang Jianxin]].&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yomi. "Contemporary Mainstream PRC Cinema" in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'' (2011), edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward, BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixth Generation==
The post-1990 era has seen what some observers{{Who|date=July 2011}} term the "return of the amateur filmmaker" as state [[censorship]] policies after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square demonstrations]] produced an edgy underground film movement loosely referred to as the Sixth Generation. Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like [[16 mm film]] and [[digital video]] and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to [[Italian neorealism]] and [[cinéma vérité]] than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation.&lt;ref name=Greatfall&gt;Rose, S. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/01/china.film "The great fall of China"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2002-08-01. Retrieved on 2007-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Fifth Generation, the Sixth Generation brings a more individualistic, anti-romantic life-view and pays far closer attention to contemporary urban life, especially as affected by disorientation, rebellion&lt;ref name="Stephen Teo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/feature-articles/li_yang/|title= "There Is No Sixth Generation!"

The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation's concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society. For example, [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]]'s hand-held ''[[Beijing Bastards]]'' (1993) focuses on youth [[punk rock|punk]] [[subculture]], featuring artists like [[Cui Jian]], [[Dou Wei]] and [[He Yong (rock musician)|He Yong]] frowned upon by many state authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/1993/film/reviews/beijing-zazhong-1200433948/|title= Review: ‘Beijing Zazhong’|author= Deborah Young
|date= October 4, 1993|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work= Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Jia Zhangke's debut film ''[[Xiao Wu]]'' (1997) concerns a provincial [[pickpocket]].

As the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'' (2000) was funded in part by [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s production house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2014/05/16/a-touch-of-sin-interview-with-jia-zhangke/|title= A Touch of Sin: Interview with Jia Zhang-ke|author= Pamela Jahn |date= May 16, 2014|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work= Electric Sheep}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''[[Still Life (2006 film)|Still Life]]'' was shot on [[High Definition video|HD video]]. ''Still Life'' was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 [[Venice International Film Festival]]. ''Still Life'', which concerns provincial workers around the [[Three Gorges]] region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.

Many Sixth Generation films have highlighted the negative attributes of China's entry into the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[market economy|market]]. [[Li Yang (director)|Li Yang]]'s ''[[Blind Shaft]]'' (2003) for example, is an account of two murderous con-men in the unregulated and notoriously dangerous mining industry of northern China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/movies/filming-the-dark-side-of-capitalism-in-china-578819.html | title = Filming the Dark Side Of Capitalism in China | accessdate = 2008-04-10 | author = Kahn, Joseph|date= 2003-05-07| publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Li refused the tag of Sixth Generation, although admitted he was not Fifth Generation).&lt;ref name="Stephen Teo"/&gt; While Jia Zhangke's ''[[The World (film)|The World]]'' (2004) emphasizes the emptiness of [[globalization]] in the backdrop of an internationally themed amusement park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/festival-reports/new_york2004/ | title = Minimalism and Maximalism: The 42nd New York Film Festival | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | author = Rapfogel, Jared |date= December 2004| publisher = Senses of Cinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913090619/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/05/34/new_york2004.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more prolific Sixth Generation directors to have emerged are [[Wang Xiaoshuai]] (''[[The Days (film)|The Days]]'', ''[[Beijing Bicycle]]''), [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]] (''[[Beijing Bastards]]'', ''[[East Palace West Palace]]''), [[Jia Zhangke]] (''[[Xiao Wu]]'', ''[[Unknown Pleasures (film)|Unknown Pleasures]]'', ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'', ''[[The World (film)|The World]]''), [[He Jianjun]] (''[[Postman (film)|Postman]]'') and [[Lou Ye]] (''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[Summer Palace (2006 film)|Summer Palace]]''). One young director who does not share most of the concerns of the Sixth Generation is [[Lu Chuan]] (''[[Kekexili: Mountain Patrol]]'', 2004; ''[[City of Life and Death]]'', 2010).

==dGeneration Independent Movement==
There is a growing number of independent post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment. They are the so-called dGeneration (for digital).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1219/719 |title=From D-Buffs to the D-Generation: Piracy, Cinema, and an Alternative Public Sphere in Urban China |website=Talari.com |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films, like those from Sixth Generation filmmakers, are mostly made outside the Chinese film system and are shown mostly on the international film festival circuit. [[Ying Liang]] and [[Jian Yi]] are two of these dGeneration filmmakers. Ying's ''[[Taking Father Home]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Other Half (2006 Chinese film)|The Other Half]]'' (2006) are both representative of the dGeneration trends of feature film. [[Liu Jiayin]] made two dGeneration feature films, ''[[Oxhide]]'' (2004) and ''[[Oxhide II]]'' (2010), blurring the line between documentary and narrative film. ''Oxhide'', made by Liu when she was a film student, frames herself and her parents in their claustrophobic Beijing apartment in a narrative praised by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutbeijing.com/features/Books__Film-Interviews__Features/28696/100-best-Chinese-Mainland-Films-the-countdown/9/30-21.html |title=100 best Chinese Mainland Films: the countdown |website=Timeoutbeijing.com |date=2014-04-04 |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Documentary Movement==
Two decades of reform and commercialization have brought dramatic social changes in mainland China, reflected not only in fiction film but in a growing documentary movement. [[Wu Wenguang]]'s 70-minute ''[[Bumming in Beijing: The Last Dreamers]]'' (1990) is now seen as one of the first works of this "[[New Documentary Movement]]" (NDM) in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/28/chinas_new_documentary/|title=Dancing with Myself,Drifting with My Camera: The Emotional Vagabonds|publisher=Senses of Cinema|author=Reynaud, Berenice|date=September 2003|accessdate=2007-12-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202811/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/03/28/chinas_new_documentary.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1998/03/05/STYLE6967.dtl|author=Krich, John|publisher=''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]''|date=March 5, 1998|title=China's New Documentaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bumming'', made between 1988 and 1990, contains interviews with five young artists eking out a living in [[Beijing]], subject to state authorized tasks. Shot using a [[camcorder]], the documentary ends with four of the artists moving abroad after the 1989 Tiananmen Protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chu | first = Yingchu| year = 2007 | title = Chinese Documentaries: From Dogma to Polyphony | publisher = Routledge| pages = 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dance with the Farm Workers]]'' (2001) is another documentary by Wu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zhang | first = Yingjin| year = 2010 | title = Cinema, Space, and Polylocality in a Globalizing China | publisher = [[University of Hawai'i Press]]| page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another internationally acclaimed documentary is [[Wang Bing (director)|Wang Bing]]'s nine-hour tale of deindustrialization ''[[Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks]]'' (2003). Wang's subsequent documentaries, ''[[Fengming: A Chinese Memoir|He Fengming]]'' (2007), ''[[Crude Oil (film)|Crude Oil]]'' (2008), ''[[Man with no name (film)|Man with no name]]'' (2009), ''[[Three Sisters (2012 film)|Three Sisters]]'' (2012) and ''[[Til madness do us part|Feng ai]]'' (2013), cemented his reputation as a leading documentarist of the movement.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Li Hong (filmmaker)|Li Hong]], the first woman in the NDM, in ''[[Out of Phoenix Bridge]]'' (1997) relates the story of four young women, who moving from rural areas to the big cities like millions of other men and women, have come to Beijing to make a living.

The New Documentary Movement in recent times has overlapped with the dGeneration filmmaking, with most documentaries being shot cheaply and independently in the digital format. [[Xu Xin (filmmaker)|Xu Xin]]'s ''[[Karamay (film)|Karamay]]'' (2010), [[Zhao Liang (filmmaker)|Zhao Liang]]'s [[Behemoth (film 2015)|Behemoth]], [[Huang Weikai]]'s ''[[Disorder (2009 film)|Disorder]]'' (2009), [[Zhao Dayong]]'s ''[[Ghost Town (2009 film)|Ghost Town]]'' (2009), [[Du Haibing]]'s ''[[1428 (film)|1428]]'' (2009), [[Xu Tong]]'s ''[[Fortune Teller (2010 film)|Fortune Teller]]'' (2010) and [[Li Ning (filmmaker)|Li Ning]]’s ''[[Tape (2010)|Tape]]'' (2010) were all shot in digital format. All had made their impact in the international documentary scene and the use of digital format allows for works of vaster lengths.

==New models and the new Chinese cinema==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chinese national film museum painting.jpg|thumb|A painting from the [[China National Film Museum]]]] --&gt;

===Commercial successes===
With China's liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's ''[[The Horse Thief]]'' (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a [[Tibet]]an horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;''Celluloid China: cinematic encounters with culture and society'', Harry H. Kuoshu, Southern Illinois University Press (2002), p 202&lt;/ref&gt;
Tian's later ''[[The Warrior and the Wolf]]'' (2010) was a similar commercial failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zx.dy.com.cn/content/2009-10-12/20091012185758575,1.shtml 《狼灾记》票房低迷出乎意料 导演的兽性情挑_第一电影网&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905133933/http://zx.dy.com.cn/content/2009-10-12/20091012185758575%2C1.shtml |date=September 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to these, there were examples of successful commercial films in the post-liberalization period. One was the romance film ''[[Romance on Lushan Mountain|Romance on the Lu Mountain]]'' (1980), which was a success with older Chinese. The film broke the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the longest-running film on a [[first run (film)|first run]]. [[Jet Li]]'s cinematic debut ''[[Shaolin Temple (1982 film)|Shaolin Temple]]'' (1982) was an instant hit at home and abroad (in [[Japan]] and the [[Southeast Asia]], for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Celebrity in China |authors= Louise Edwards, Elaine Jeffreys |publisher= Hong Kong University Press |year=2010 |page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another successful commercial film was ''[[Murder in 405]]'' (405谋杀案, 1980), a murder thriller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctv.com/program/ljsy_new/14/56/index.shtml|title=CCTV-电影频道-相聚——《流金岁月》|website=Cctv.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feng Xiaogang]]'s ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) was heralded as a turning point in Chinese movie industry, a ''[[hesui pian]]'' ([[Chinese New Year]]-screened film) which demonstrated the viability of the commercial model in China's [[socialist market economy|socialist market]] society. Feng has become the most successful commercial director in the post-1997 era.

In the decade following 2010, owing to the influx of Hollywood films (though the number screened each year is curtailed), Chinese domestic cinema faces mounting challenges. The industry is growing and domestic films are starting to achieve the box office impact of major Hollywood blockbusters. However, not all domestic films are successful financially. In January 2010 [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' was pulled out from non-3D theaters for [[Hu Mei]]'s biopic ''[[Confucius (2010 film)|Confucius]]'', but this move led to a backlash on Hu's film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-01/29/content_9396402.htm |title=Confucius loses his way |author= Raymond Zhou|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Yang (director)|Zhang Yang]]'s 2005 ''[[Sunflower (2005 film)|Sunflower]]'' also made little money, but his earlier, low-budget ''[[Spicy Love Soup]]'' (1997) grossed ten times its budget of ¥3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Companion to Chinese Cinema |author= Yingjin Zhang (ed.) |publisher= Blackwell Publishing |year=2012 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the 2006 ''[[Crazy Stone (film)|Crazy Stone]]'', a [[sleeper hit]], was made for just 3 million HKD/US$400,000. In 2009–11, Feng's ''[[Aftershock (2010 film)|Aftershock]]'' (2009) and [[Jiang Wen]]'s ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010) became China's highest grossing domestic films, with ''Aftershock'' earning ¥670 million (US$105 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/feng-xiaogang-remembering-1942-shanghai-338567 |title=Feng Xiaogang Unveils Epic 'Remembering 1942' at the Shanghai Film Festival |author= Karen Chu |date=2012-06-17|accessdate= 2012-07-07|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Let the Bullets Fly'' ¥674 million (US$110 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/so-young-enters-chinas-all-time-top-ten|title=So Young enters China's all-time top ten|author=Stephen Cremin|date=18 May 2013|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|accessdate=April 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319110551/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/so-young-enters-chinas-all-time-top-ten|archivedate=19 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach [[Renminbi|¥]]1 billion at the Chinese box office and ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) became the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}.

===Other directors===
[[He Ping (director)|He Ping]] is a director of mostly [[Western film|Western]]-like films set in Chinese locale. His ''[[Swordsmen in Double Flag Town]]'' (1991) and ''[[Sun Valley (film)|Sun Valley]]'' (1995) explore narratives set in the sparse terrain of West China near the [[Gobi Desert]]. His [[historical drama]] ''[[Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker]]'' (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.

Recent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, [[Lü Yue]] made ''[[Mr. Zhao]]'' (1998), a [[black comedy]] film well received abroad. [[Gu Changwei]]'s [[minimalism|minimalist]] epic ''[[Peacock (2005 film)|Peacock]]'' (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-[[Cultural Revolution]] era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. [[Hou Yong (cinematographer)|Hou Yong]] is another cinematographer who made films (''[[Jasmine Women]]'', 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. [[Xu Jinglei]], a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film ''[[Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004 film)|Letter from an Unknown Woman]]'' (2004) landed her the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]] Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is [[Zhao Wei]], whose directorial debut ''[[So Young (film)|So Young]]'' (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.

The most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly [[Jiang Wen]], who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, ''[[In the Heat of the Sun]]'' (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the [[Golden Horse Film Awards]] held in [[Taiwan]]. His other films, like ''[[Devils on the Doorstep]]'' (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010), were similarly well received. By the early 2011, ''Let the Bullets Fly'' had become the highest grossing domestic film in China's history.&lt;ref name="fba-resurrection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/resurrection-takes-china-bo-record|work=Film Business Asia|title=Resurrection takes China BO record|accessdate=April 3, 2015|author=Cremin, Stephen|date=July 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730010234/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/resurrection-takes-china-bo-record|archive-date=July 30, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.qq.com/a/20110216/000002.htm|title=《让子弹飞》票房7.3亿 姜文成国内第一导演_娱乐_腾讯网|website=Ent.qq.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese international cinema and successes abroad===
[[File:Jia Zhang-Ke Skipcity DCF 2005.jpg|thumb|150px|Director [[Jia Zhangke]] at the Skip City International D-Cinema Festival in Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan, 22 July 2005]]

Since the late 1980s and progressively in the 2000s, Chinese films have enjoyed considerable box office success abroad. Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of [[Ang Lee]]'s period [[wuxia|martial arts]] film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' which won [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the [[wuxia]] genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date ''Crouching Tiger'' remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.

Similarly, in 2002, Zhang Yimou's ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from the Mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including [[Jet Li]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Maggie Cheung]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]]. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, ''Hero'' was a phenomenal success in most of [[Asia]] and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.

Other films such as ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'', ''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' were critically acclaimed around the world. The [[Hengdian World Studios]] can be seen as the "Chinese Hollywood", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the [[Forbidden City]].

The successes of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' and ''Hero'' make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between "Mainland Chinese" cinema and a more international-based "Chinese-language cinema". ''Crouching Tiger'', for example, was directed by a [[Taiwan]]-born American director ([[Ang Lee]]) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include Mainland Chinese ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), Hong Kong ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]), Taiwan ([[Chang Chen]]) and [[Malaysia]]n ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language ''[[Lust, Caution]]'' (2007) drew a crew and cast from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]]. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader [[East Asia]] and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005), ''[[The Banquet (2006 film)|The Banquet]]'' (2006), ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'' (2006), ''[[The Warlords]]'' (2007), ''[[Bodyguards and Assassins]]'' (2009) and ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'' (2008-9). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like [[Hu Jun]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Tang Wei]] and [[Zhou Xun]], obtained Hong Kong residency under the [[Quality Migrant Admission Scheme]] and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |title=Zhou Xun Obtains Hong Kong Citizenship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2016-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402064516/http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |archive-date=2012-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clara Beranger.jpg|thumb|Clara Beranger]]
'''Clara Beranger''' (also '''Berenger''', née ''Strouse'', January 14, 1886 – September 10, 1956) was an American screenwriter of the silent film era and a member of the original faculty of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]].

==Biography==
She was born '''Clara Strouse''' in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], to Benjamin and Fannie (Kahn) Strouse.  Benjamin and his brothers had emigrated from [[Germany]] and opened a dry-goods store in [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;DeMille. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from The Baltimore Women's College, now known as [[Goucher College]], with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907,&lt;ref name="whowho"&gt;Who Was Who in America. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Clara moved to New York City and went into journalism, writing for various popular magazines and devoting time to study the stage. She married Albert Berwanger with whom she had a daughter, Frances Berwanger in 1909.  When she began to write, Frances would change her name to Beranger.

===Freelance===
Using the pseudonym of Charles S. Beranger, her first screen employment was as a [[freelancer]], writing for the [[Motion Picture Patents Company|Edison]], [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph]] and [[Kalem Company|Kalem]] companies, to whom she furnished many originals as well as continuities. Her success attracted some attention and she was appointed as a staff writer for the [[20th Century Fox#Fox Film Corporation|Fox Corporation]].  She wrote several scripts for the popular child star [[Baby Marie Osborne]] as well as a much-praised adaptation of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''. Beranger also wrote ''The Interloper'' for Kitty Gordon, ''The Bluffer'' for June Elvidge and ''The Mirror'' for Marjorie Rambeau, though many of these films are considered lost.&lt;ref name="lowrey"&gt;Lowrey. 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;  With [[Forrest Halsey]], Beranger wrote the stage play, ''His Chinese Wife'', which received good reviews and became one of the successes of the 1919–1920 season.&lt;ref name="lowrey"/&gt;

===Famous Players-Lasky===
In 1921, Clara took Frances, then twelve, and migrated to [[Hollywood]] to write for motion pictures,&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt; where she signed a long contract with [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s [[Famous Players-Lasky]]; the outfit with whom she is most associated.  She wrote or contributed to more than 24 DeMille productions, and produced both ''Come Out of the Kitchen'' and ''Girls'' for [[Marguerite Clark]]; ''[[Sadie Love]]'' and ''[[Wanted: A Husband]]'' for [[Billie Burke]]; ''[[Judy of Rogue's Harbor]]'' for [[Mary Miles Minter]]; ''The Fear Market'' for [[Alice Brady]]; ''The Cost'' for [[Violet Heming]]; ''Half an Hour'' for [[Dorothy Dalton]]; ''Civilian Clothes'' for [[Thomas Meighan]], ''Notoriety'' for [[Bebe Daniels]], and the classic ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' for [[John Barrymore]].&lt;ref name="lowrey"/&gt;

From an interview with Louella Parson in 1922:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I will be out in California when Mr. DeMille begins operations.  Under my old contract I furnished eight continuities a year; now that I work only for William DeMille I only write four.  That gives me an opportunity to see my work through from the story to the screen.  It makes it possible for me to go over my script scene by scene with the producer, so he can make the picture with almost no changes.  In the old days I had to keep my nose to the grindstone continually so as to finish the eight pictures in time for the different directors for whom I was writing.&lt;ref name="loella"&gt;Parsons. 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===William DeMille===
In 1921 Beranger met her future husband William DeMille  and work on the adaptation of ''[[Miss Lulu Bett (play)|Miss Lulu Bett]]'', the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play about a young woman who discovers that she’s married to a man who is already married. Not as famous today as Cecil, and though most of his silents have been lost, William is still considered one of the silents' most respected directors. ''Miss Lulu Bett'' shows a delicate touch in the telling of an impoverished spinster's misfortunes in a small town.&lt;ref name="cripps"&gt;Cripps. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

William had other affairs including [[Lorna Moon]] who had borne him a son out of wedlock, and with another screenwriter, [[Olga Printzlau]];  but he genuinely fell in love with Clara who had tolerated it all.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;Edwards. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1926, William to the surprise of his wife, announced that he wanted a divorce.  Anna refused him and took their daughters, [[Agnes de Mille|Agnes]] and Margaret, to Europe for a long trip.  When the family returned, William announced that he had given up Beranger and would try again with his wife, but this arrangement only lasted about a year.&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt; Anna never recovered from the divorce, and took the children to live in New York permanently.&lt;ref name="agnes"&gt;Easton. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; William DeMille (50) and Clara Beranger (42) would be married in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] on August 14, 1928 in the drawing room aboard "The Chief", a transcontinental special train.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[[Time (magazine)|Time]]. August 27, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; William de Mille states that Beranger wrote all of his screen plays from 1921 - 1928. He writes in his book, ''Hollywood Saga'' ; "In April, 1928, I had just finished ‘Tenth Avenue,’ my forty - fifth product ion and was working on ‘Craig’s Wife’ with Clara Beranger , who had written the screen plays of all my pictures for seven years and continued to do so even after our marriage." .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Saga|last=deMille|first=William|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc|year=1939|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After marrying into the DeMille dynasty, Beranger would continue to write, including ''Craig's Wife'' (1928) for [[Irene Rich]] and ''This Mad World'' (1930) for [[Kay Johnson]].  William would lose everything in the Depression and unhappily rely on Beranger to support him, until Beranger asked Cecil DeMille to employ him to write scenarios.

===USC School of Cinematic Arts===
Baranger would retire from writing pictures in 1934, though she remained a frequent contributor to magazines such as [[Liberty (1924–1950)|Liberty]] and [[Good Housekeeping]], and writer of inspirational books. Beranger's largest impact would be as one of the original faculty of [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] which had begun in 1929 as a collaboration between the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name="usc"&gt;USCCA HomePage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also among the original faculty were actors [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]], directors [[D.W. Griffith]] and [[Ernst Lubitsch]], and producers [[Irving Thalberg]] and [[Darryl Zanuck]].  Cecil would endow the Drama Department, to which William would be appointed as Director, at last allowing him to exploit his education and skills as a teacher and director.&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt;

Beranger was a large proponent of the idea that Hollywood had a responsibility to teach the next generation of artists, and would write a much-used text ''Writing for the Screen'' in 1950 and continue to lecture on screenwriting for the rest of her life.  She suffered a heart attack and died in 1956.

'''The Colonial Theatre''' is located at 111 South Street, [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], in the [[Berkshire Mountains]] of [[western Massachusetts]]. Built in 1903, the theater was host to many theater greats including [[George M. Cohan]], [[Sara Bernhardt]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Eubie Blake]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Sr.]], [[Billie Burke]], [[John Phillips Sousa]] and the [[Ziegfeld Follies]].

The theater was designed by Pittsfield architect Joseph McArthur Vance along with J.B. McElfatrick. Its ornate turn-of-the 20th century interior has been well preserved by its various owners.

Although the theater was closed in 1951, its grandeur had been protected through the years by George Miller and his son, Steven. Miller preserved many features of the Colonial during its conversion from a theater to the Miller's Art Supply Store, making it possible to eventually restore the theater back to its earlier grandeur, a process documented in photographer [[Nicholas Whitman]]'s ''The Colonial Theatre: A Pittsfield Resurrection''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/061520287XM&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colonial Theatre was named by [[First Lady]] [[Hillary Clinton]] as a National Historic Treasure in 1998, who would later visit the theatre as a [[U.S. Senator]] in 2000.

Following this announcement, the community invested more than $22 million to refurbish the 100-year-old Colonial Theatre, one of the only theaters of its kind from the Vaudeville age, described as the "one of the finest acoustical theaters in the world."

The Colonial Theatre Restoration completed work in 2006 and it is now open to the public.

Many notable performers have since graced the stage, including [[James Taylor]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], and other musical and theater acts.

'''Counter-''Maniera''''' or '''Counter-Mannerism''' (variously capitalized and part-italicized) is a term in art history for a trend identified by some art historians in 16th-century Italian painting that forms a sub-category or phase of [[Mannerism]], the dominant movement in Italian art between about 1530 and 1590.  Counter-''Maniera'' or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the [[The_Reformation_and_art#Council_of_Trent|vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity]] in art issued by the [[Council of Trent]] in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of [[High Renaissance]] art, with "clarity in formal order and legibility in content".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; his longest passage explaining his term is on pp. 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was devised by the art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians.  Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his ''Painting in Italy, 1500–1600'', first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: "First ''Maniera'', High ''Maniera'', Counter-''Maniera'' and Late ''Maniera''".&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, 17; Freedberg had used the terms in earlier articles.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High ''Maniera'' remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-''Maniera'' in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high ''maniera'' style.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedberg's contemporary [[Federico Zeri]] had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term ''arte sacra'' ("sacred art") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-''Maniera'' may be in decline, as impatience with such "[[Style (visual arts)|style]] labels" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and characteristics==
The definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex,&lt;ref&gt;The subject of both Cropper and Smyth, and Shearman's Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so.  Many parts of Italy, led by [[Venice]] and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of ''maniera'' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 563, and many passages on specific artists&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded ''maniera'', without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as "counterpart" and "[[counterpoint]]", explaining that he intends "implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429 quoted, and ''passim'' on individual artists; Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characteristics of the ''maniera'' often retained in counter-''maniera'' works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedländer, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the ''maniera'' that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a [[decorum]] suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; Shearman, 168–169, 178–179; Friedländer, 6–10, and Part 1 generally&lt;/ref&gt; In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 657–660&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term counter-''maniera'' is not usually applied to the more radical [[Bologna|Bolognese]] reaction of the [[Carracci family|Carraccis]] from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was "a new and un-Maniera attitude to art";&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 566; Shearman, 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-''Maniera'' with "anti-Maniera", apparently reflecting "Anti-Mannerism", the term used by [[Walter Friedländer]] for the "palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting" that occurred "sometime around 1590".&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Part II, p. 47 quoted; Freedberg 606; for more on the "anti-Maniera" of [[Antonio Campi]] see 585–587, and for that of [[Scipione Pulzone]] see 658, and "non-Maniera" is also used; &lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term has not been extended to [[Northern Mannerism]].

Deciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in [[John Shearman]]'s ''Mannerism'' (1967), he picks [[Santi di Tito]]'s ''Vision of St Thomas Aquinas'' (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 624&lt;/ref&gt; Shearman's other main example of Counter-Mannerism is [[Federigo Barocci]], who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 632–640&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Many painters looked to revive the styles of [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of [[Michelangelo]]'s late work was important for many artists.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine biographer and critic [[Raffaello Borghini]], author of ''Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura'' published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Conclusion"; Borghini is not mentioned by Freedberg&lt;/ref&gt; but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: "Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 499, when discussing [[Girolamo Muziano]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period—even today—tended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of [[Gian Pietro Bellori]]'s ''Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a "pro-Bolognese" artistic account of Counter-''Maniera'' reform.&lt;ref&gt;Giovan Pietro Bellori, The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architect: A New Translation and Critical Edition, ed. Alice Sedgwick Wohl, Helmut Wohl and Tomaso Montanari (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Craigmillar Festival Society''' ('''CFS''') was a [[Community art|Community Arts]] organisation that existed in the [[Craigmillar]] area of [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] from 1962 to 2002. It is regarded as important contributor to the [[Community Arts Movement]]. Starting in 1967, many of its productions involved [[Craigmillar Castle]].

== Inception ==
The Craigmillar Festival Committee was established in 1962, when a mothers group at Peffermill Primary School, south-east side of Edinburgh, created a Festival to celebrate local talent with the aid of then local councillor [[Jack Kane (Lord Provost)|Jack Kane]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12210123.Jack_Kane/&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1962, Craigmillar was suffering from all the social ills of 20th century urban living and decay. The crunch came when the school’s reply to a request for music lessons for her son from local mother [[Helen Crummy]] was … "it takes us all our time to teach these children the [[The three Rs|3Rs]] far less music." Biting their tongues the frustrated mothers in Peffermill School Mothers Club responded by knocking on doors, pulling out local talent and staging a People’s Festival of music, drama, and the arts. The Festival was an instant success which brought joy, colour and fun to a drab and grey environment.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The festival married fun with passion for intensive political action. This led to politicians working not just for, but WITH, the local people. Combining culture with satirical criticism, the people wrote and produced their own community musicals and historical productions, basing them on the area’s multitude of social concerns and issues.

== Growth and development ==
In 1970 the Craigmillar Festival Committee gained official recognition, charitable status and changed its name to the Craigmillar Festival Society (CFS).  By 1976 the Society was employing 600 people and involving 1500 volunteers.  That year, 17000 people either took part or attended the annual festival. By this time, it had received a major anti-poverty research grant from The [[European Community]].

A prime example of what the CFS did in the community was through the tireless work of the Bingham neighbourhood worker Claire Elder. In 1970, she persuaded some neighbours to go dressed as a gypsy tribe to the Mediaeval Fayre. Later calling themselves the Bingham Belles, they formed a drama and music group and became stars of the Festival's Old Tyme Musical Hall. Entertaining in and beyond Craigmillar, they successfully campaigned to obtain much needed amenities for Bingham, including their own community centre and youth facilities.

Several CFS workers AND volunteers who came from AND lived in the community went on to become teachers and trainers of the CFS ethic in their later lives with other organisations and even government quangoes. But they were first and foremost at the heart of the CFS activities in the community.

The CFS created and developed many concepts including Communiversity, Arts As The Catalyst, Creative Shared Government, Neighbourhood Workers Scheme and the hugely influential planning document "The Comprehensive Plan for Action" where Art and culture were the catalyst in all aspects of regeneration.

One of the CFS founders, [[Helen Crummy]] created an MBE in 1973 (later awarded an honorary doctorate), produced a book called "Let The People Sing" that provides an account of the background and development of the CFS.

== Achievements ==

Many artists, politicians and researchers came to Craigmillar, either to see or become involved in the community activities. Each of these have taken the seed and rooted it worldwide, from The Easterhouse Festival Society, [[Notting Hill Carnival]] and also in the work of Neil Cameron and [[Reg Bolton (clown)|Reg Bolton]] in Australia. Craigmillar Festival Society helped create many things, amongst them; The Mermaid Sculpture by Pedro Silva; The Gentle Giant Sculpture by [[Jimmy Boyle (artist)|Jimmy Boyle]]; The [[Bill Douglas]] Trilogy, in particular "My Childhood" (funded by [[British Film Institute]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The Craigmillar Festival Society was the recognised leader in the production of The Community [[Musical theatre]] productions, where professional actors worked very closely with local people. In effect, since 1962, local people came together and produced well over 100 productions. From 1973's first Community Musical "The Time Machine", 1974's "Castle, Cooncil &amp; Curse, 1975's "Time and Motion Man", 1976's "Willie Wynn", 1977's Culture Vultures" and 1978's "Oh Gentle Giant", to the 1980s with "Shoo", "For A' That &amp; A' That", "Dampbusters" and "Watch It", the 1990s and "Fit For Heroes", "Kicking Up A Stink" and "In Your Dreams" and the more recent "Grease Niddrie Style". All included songs such  as "Craigmillar Now", "When People Play Their Part", "Arled Bairn", "Candy Barrie" and "He Promised Me".

Many local people who began performing in Community productions went on to become successful professional performers, Alice Henderson and Johnni Stanton, who went on to form their own companies, but most notably, Faye Milligan (The Steamie), and James (Micky) MacPherson, whose company Plum Films won a BAFTA award. Both returned to Craigmillar and directed local productions.

Craigmillar was at the forefront of the Golden Age of artistic expansion in Edinburgh in the early 70s and helped to create several lasting institutions, among them, Theatre Workshop Edinburgh.

It also has links with Professor [[Eric Trist]] and The [[Tavistock Institute]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Richard Demarco]], [[Anne Lorne Gillies]], [[Joan Bakewell]], [[Michael Marra]] and [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]].

The effectiveness of the Society’s work began to be noticed from both near and far with distinguished commentators making reference to it.

== Into the future  ==
By 2002 after a public investigation into alleged improper use of funding, funding was cut off and the remaining CFS projects were made independent organizations. Although the original CFS organization is now defunct, its spirit lives on within the community and it continues to attract attention through the "Arts As A Catalyst" Exhibition at The City Arts Centre, [[Edinburgh]] in 2004 and an award-winning documentary, which won The Saltire Award at The [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in 2005.
The local arts scene is also kept alive by two community organisations currently existing within the community, Craigmillar Community Arts, who provide a variety of arts based projects at Craigmillar Arts Centre on Newcraighall Road and the Greater Craigmillar Archives who are devoted to recording and preserving a physical and digital record of the Craigmillar community through the years.

[[File:Culture Factory Polymer.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Culture Factory Polymer|Culture Factory Polymer]]
'''Culture Factory Polymer''' ({{lang-et|Kultuuritehas Polymer}}) is a multidisciplinary centre for artistic creation and diffusion in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. Located in [[Lilleküla]], [[Kristiine|Kristiine District]], on the fringes of the [[Kesklinn, Tallinn|Tallinn city centre]], this former toy factory became in 2003 one of the main strong points for alternative un-institutionalized culture in Tallinn.

==History==
During the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet era]], Polymer was a [[toy]] factory. In 1993, closed this branch of activities, leaving a large building in a state of abandonment. 

A few years after, a group of artists, intrigued by this big empty space, decided to turn a room into a rehearsal place. Step-by-step, other artists wished to enjoy different spaces to create, to rehearse. The new owner of the building gave its agreement for necessary rearrangements and renovations.

Nowadays, the factory disposes of {{convert|3000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of space, dedicated to creation and diffusion. The building aesthetics of Polymer are typical Soviet industrial style. Concrete production facilities were transferred over time to incorporate new space for living, artistic use and events, with the old flair and keeping its authenticity. The conservation of the old factory's name, "Polymer", perpetuates the memory of this historic past.&lt;ref&gt;Polymer website&lt;/ref&gt;

==The different spaces==
Polymer, it is nowadays:
*studios for artists,
*rehearsals rooms for music bands,
*a center for art courses,
*two exhibition galleries,
*a Media Lab,
*two concert halls,
*two spaces which can be converted for several kinds of events,
*a bar,
*and two studios for guest artists.

A traditional letterpress print shop was also installed in the building; it's kept alive through realisation of posters for different organizations and animation of workshops for different publics.

==Activities &amp; events==
Gradually, Polymer became a place for residencies and diffusion with multiple spaces, where live together about 30 artists and organizations, working on diverse artistic fields. 
Constituted as a non profit organization, Polymer works as a platform, as a venue for different events and activities, offering thus a new space for alternative culture in Tallinn. Public events take place every week, involving [[artist in residency]] and guest artist also, from Tallinn, Estonia and Europe.

Every year in August, Polymer organizes its own festival, "Culture Factory Festival"; during 2 weeks, artists of the house open their studios and hang their art out to take some fresh air, and artists and a multitude of events from diverse universes take possession of the place: exhibition openings, concerts, film screenings, dance performances. Important is involving the audience in action through the workshops during the festival.

Polymer is an organization involved in local life and open to outwards contacts. Polymer leads different cultural and social actions at a local level, and develops its partnerships in Tallinn, in Estonia and in Europe.

Polymer was a member of the Trans Europe Halles network in years 2005-2013.&lt;ref&gt;Trans Europe Halles website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daprato Rigali Studios''' (formerly '''Daprato Statuary Company''') is an [[renovation|interior restoration and renovation]] company in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dmoz.org/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Historic_Preservation/Materials_and_Supplies/&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1860&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=OY_o8YXKg8QC&amp;pg=PA627&amp;lpg=PA627&amp;dq=%22john+e.+rigali%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XpYZ6OTyiD&amp;sig=3OgDB0qe-R9KkQ_MiL4kqfZN1PQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG04763KHPAhVFPz4KHeV9Dg4Q6AEIQzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20e.%20rigali%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; by the Daprato brothers, Italian immigrants from the town of [[Barga]]. The company specializes in decorative [[painting]], [[stained glass]] and [[marble]] fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-08-14/news/0308140128_1_papal-altar-furnishings&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1881, [[John E. Rigali]], the great-grandfather of the firm’s current family members, completed his training in [[Florence]] and immigrated to Chicago to work with the Daprato brothers. Rigali became a partner in 1884 and, in 1890, president of Daprato Statuary Company.&lt;ref name=ndm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butterman|first1=Eric|title=Church restoration a family reunion|url=http://magazine.nd.edu/news/65256-church-restoration-a-family-reunion/|website=Notre Dame magazine|accessdate=29 August 2016|date=Spring 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Pope Pius X|Pope Saint Pius X]] bestowed on Daprato Studios the title of "Pontifical Institute of Christian Art."&lt;ref name="ol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Daprato Rigali Studios - Our Legacy|url=http://dapratorigali.com/our-legacy/|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1920s they operated locations in Chicago, [[Montreal]], [[New York City]] and [[Pietrasanta]].  
 
In 1960, under the guidance of Robert Rigali, the organization took on the name, Daprato Rigali Studios.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brachear|first1=Manya A.|title=Renovated Holy Name shines in debut mass|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-holyname-080209-story.html|accessdate=29 August 2016|publisher=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is currently managed by 4th generation Rigali family members Bob, John, Mike and Elizabeth.

The tombs take the form of [[tumuli]] or earthen mounds piled over stone chambers as well as caves excavated from the living rock. The decoration may be on the inner walls, on stone screens, on [[sarcophagi]] or, in the case of cave tombs, around the entrance on the exterior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21564">"'''Eeny, meeny, miny, moe'''" — which can be spelled a number of ways — is a children's [[counting rhyme]], used to select a person in games such as [[tag (game)|tag]]. It is one of a large group of similar rhymes in which the child who is pointed to by the chanter on the last syllable is either "chosen" or "counted out". The rhyme has existed in various forms since well before 1820.&lt;ref&gt;I. &amp; P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery rhymes'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 1952), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and is common in many languages with similar-sounding nonsense syllables.

Since many similar counting rhymes existed earlier, it is difficult to ascertain this rhyme's exact original.

== Current versions ==
A common modern version is:&lt;ref name="Donna Wood"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donna Wood|title=Move, Sing, Listen, Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCeIvb1PA14C&amp;pg=PA75|year=1971|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |isbn=1-4574-9680-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
:Catch a tiger by the toe.
:If he hollers, let him go, &lt;!-- This is the version given in the 1971 source above; don't change it to "yells" or "squeals" without updating the source. --&gt;
:Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

There are many common variations, such as replacing tiger with "piggy", "tinker", "tigger",  a two-syllable name, etc.; and changing the verb in the third line to "screams", "wiggles", "squeals" or another verb.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

Sometimes additional lines are added at the end of the rhyme to draw out or manipulate the selection process or make it seem less predetermined, such as:

:My mother told me/says to pick the very best one, and that is Y-O-U&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

Or alternatively:

:O-U-T spells out, you are not it.
:Pig snout you are out. ([[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]]s only)
:Out goes Y-O-U.&lt;ref name=bauer2002&gt;L. and W. Bauer, {{cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/research/projects/language-in-the-playground-project/publications/lip17.pdf |title=Choosing Who's In/It |year=2002 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the line copies '[[Ip dip]]':
:Not because you're dirty,
:Not because you're clean,
:Just because you kissed a boy and girl behind the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Abrahams and L. Rankin, ''Counting-out Rhymes: a Dictionary'' (University of Texas Press, 1980), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The first record of a similar rhyme, called the "Hana, man," is from about 1815, when children in [[New York City]] are said to have repeated the rhyme:

:Hana, man, mona, mike;
:Barcelona, bona, strike;
:Hare, ware, frown, vanac;
:Harrico, warico, we wo, wac.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

[[Henry Carrington Bolton]] discovered this version to be in the US, Ireland and Scotland in the 1880s but was unknown in England until later in the century.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt; Bolton also found a similar rhyme in German:

:Ene, tene, mone, mei,
:Pastor, lone, bone, strei,
:Ene, fune, herke, berke,
:Wer? Wie? Wo? Was?&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

Variations of this rhyme, with the nonsense/counting first line have been collected since the 1820s, such as this Scottish one:
:Hickery Pickery, pease scon
:Where will this young man gang?
:He'll go east, he'll go west,
:he'll go to the crow's nest.
:Hickery Pickery, Hickery Pickery&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor ''Chatterings of the Pica'' (1820)&lt;/ref&gt;

More recognizable as a variation, which even includes the 'toe' and 'olla' from Kipling's version, is:
:Eenie, Meenie, Tipsy, toe;
:Olla bolla Domino,
:Okka, Pokka dominocha,
:Hy! Pon! Tush!
This was one of many variants of "counting out rhymes" collected by Bolton in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;H. Bolton, H., ''The Counting-Out Rhymes of Children: Their Antiquity, Origin and Wide Distribution'' (1888)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Cornish language|Cornish]] version collected in 1882 runs:
:Ena, mena, mona, mite,
:Bascalora, bora, bite,
:Hugga, bucca, bau,
:Eggs, butter, cheese, bread.
:Stick, stock, stone dead – OUT.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Jago ''The Glossary of the Cornish Dialect'' (1882)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that the opening to this counting rhyme, "ena mena", is almost identical to the Greek for "one by one" ("ena m'ena").

One theory about the origins of the rhyme is that it is descended from [[Old English]] or [[Celtic languages|Welsh]] counting, similar to the old Shepherd's count "[[Yan Tan Tethera]]" or the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] "Eena, mena, mona, mite".&lt;ref name="opie1997" /&gt;

Another possibility is that British colonials returning from the Sub-Continent introduced a [[doggerel]] version of an Indian children's rhyme used in the game of [[carom billiards]]:
:ubi eni mana bou,
:baji neki baji thou,
:elim tilim latim gou.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;Nihar Ranjan Mishra, ''From Kamakhya, a socio-cultural study''  (New Delhi: D.K. Printworld, 2004), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhyme inspired the song "Eena Meena Deeka" in the 1957 Bollywood film [[Aasha (1957 film)|Aasha]].

Another possible origin is from a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] poem brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans: ''Iino ya mmiini maiini mo''.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, P.R. (1974). Remarks on a little-known Africanism. ''Ba Shiru'', 6(1), 69-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most likely the origin is a centuries-old, possibly Old Saxon diviner rhyme, as was shown in 1957 by the Dutch philologist dr. Jan Naarding, supported by prof. dr. Klaas Heeroma at the Nedersaksisch Instituut (Low Saxon Institute) at the University of Groningen. They published their findings in an article called ''Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten'' (An old diviner rhyme and its relatives).&lt;ref&gt;J. Naarding en K.H. Heeroma, ''Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten'', in: ''Driemaandelijkse Bladen'', 1957, p. 37-43. Online at the [http://www.twentsetaalbank.nl/media/teksten/13722.html, Twentse Taalbank].&lt;/ref&gt; In part I of the article Naarding explains, why the counting rhyme he found in ''Twents-Achterhoeks woordenboek'' (1948), a dictionary by G.H. Wanink, stands close to an early mediaeval or even older archetype. That same version was recorded in 1904 in Goor in Twente by [[Nynke van Hichtum]]:

:Anne manne miene mukke,
:Ikke tikke takke tukke,
:Eere vrouwe grieze knech,
:Ikke wikke wakke weg.

Naarding calls its origin 'a heathen priest song, that begs the highest goddess for an oracle while divining, an oracle that may decide about life and death of a human'. The first lines can be translated as 'foremother of mankind, give me a sign, I take the cut off pieces of a branch (= the rune wands)."
This explanation was revived and extended in 2016 by Goaitsen van der Vliet, founder of the Twentse Taalbank (Twents Language Bank).&lt;ref&gt;Goaitsen van der Vliet, ''Germaans uit Goor'', in: ''Aold Hoksebarge'', nummer 49.2 (juli 2016), p. 4216-4218. Online at [http://historiek.net/iene-miene-mutte-komt-voort-uit-een-oud-oostnederlands-wichellied/60599/ Historiek] (titled: '' 'Iene miene mutte' komt voort uit oud Oostnederlands wichellied'').&lt;/ref&gt; The last line of the rhyme (in the Netherlands degenerated to 'iet wiet waait weg') can be translated as 'I weigh it up' (in Dutch 'ik wik en weeg').

== American and British versions ==
Some American versions of this rhyme use the word "[[nigger]]" instead of "[[tiger]]":

:Eeny, meena, mina, mo,
:Catch a nigger by the toe;
:If he hollers let him go,
:Eena, meena, mina, mo.&lt;ref name=opie1997&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 156-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

This version was similar to that reported by [[Henry Carrington Bolton]] as the most common version among American schoolchildren in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;H. Bolton, H., ''The Counting-Out Rhymes of Children: Their Antiquity, Origin and Wide Distribution'' (1888, Kessinger Publishing, 2006), pp. 46 and 105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the chorus of [[Bert Fitzgibbon]]'s 1906 song "Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo":

:Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo,
:Catch a nigger by his toe,
:If he won't work then let him go;
:Skidum, skidee, skidoo.
:But when you get money, your little bride

It was also used by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his "A Counting-Out Song", from ''Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides'', published in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kipling, R. T. Jones, G. Orwell, eds ''The Works of Rudyard Kipling'' (Wordsworth Editions, 1994), p. 771.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have helped popularise this version in the United Kingdom where it seems to have replaced all earlier versions until the late twentieth century.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

[[Iona and Peter Opie]] pointed out in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' that the word "nigger" was common in American folk-lore, but unknown in any English traditional rhyme or proverb.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt; This, combined with evidence of various other versions of the rhyme in the British Isles pre-dating this post-slavery version, would seem to suggest that it originated in North America, although the apparently American word "[[Wikt:holler|holler]]" was first recorded in written form in England in the fourteenth century, whereas according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the words "Niger" or "'nigger" were first recorded in England in the sixteenth century with their current disparaging meaning. The 'olla' and 'toe' are found as nonsense words in some nineteenth century versions of the rhyme, and it could possibly be that the original 'Where do all the Frenchmen Go?' (probably originating during one of the periods of Anglo-French warfare) was later on replaced by the earlier version in the United States, using some of the nonsense words.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL VERSIONS TO THIS PAGE UNLESS THEY ARE: clearly related to the original, make some important point (more than just here's also another version) and are fully sourced.--&gt;
There are considerable variations in the lyrics of the rhyme, including from early twentieth century in the United States of America:
:Eeny, meeny, miny moe,
:Catch a tiger by the toe.
:If he hollers make him pay,
:Fifty dollars every day.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

During the Second World War, an AP dispatch from [[Atlanta, Georgia]] reported: "Atlanta children were heard reciting this wartime rhyme: 
:Eenie, meenie, minie, moe,
:Catch the emperor by his toe.
:If he hollers make him say:
:'I surrender to the USA.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1S8XwCM-EYcC&amp;pg=PA1438|title=Black and African-American Studies: American Dilemma, the Negro Problem and Modern Democracy|last=Myrdal|first=Gunnar|date=1944|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412815116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
* In 1993, a high school teacher in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], provoked a student walkout when she asked her students about their poor test scores, "What did you do? Just go eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a nigger by the toe?" The school's district superintendent recommended the teacher "lose three days of pay, undergo racial sensitivity training, and have placed in her personnel file" along with a disciplinary pay cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sink |first=Lisa |date=1993-01-19 |title=Longer suspension for teacher urged |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A jocular use of a form of the rhyme by a [[Southwest Airlines]] [[flight attendant]], encouraging passengers to sit down so the plane could take off, led to a 2003 lawsuit charging the airline with [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] and [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]]. Two versions of the rhyme were attested in court; both "Eeny meeny miny mo, Please sit down it's time to go" and "Pick a seat, it's time to go". The passengers in question were [[African Americans|African American]] and stated that they were humiliated due to what they called the "racist history" of the rhyme. A jury returned a verdict in favor of Southwest and the plaintiffs' appeal was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca10.washburnlaw.edu/cases/2005/08/04-3109.htm |title=Sawyer v.

[[File:Wimpernzange.jpg|alt=The picture shows a metal eyelash curler laying on its side|thumb|An unheated metal eyelash curler]]
An '''eyelash curler''' is a hand-operated mechanical device for curling [[Eyelash|eyelashes]] for cosmetic purposes. Usually only the upper eyelashes are curled. 

==History==
There were different patents of this invention between 1923 and 1940. The first known patent for the eyelash curler states that it was filed by Charles Stickel and William McDonell from Rochester, New York. However, William Joseph Beldue is recognized as one the first inventors while he was working in Kurlash Co., in Rochester, NY. [[William Beldue]] and his Kurlash Company held patents in [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] for the eyelash curler and improvements to it.

In the 1930s and in 1940s, at the top of the make up fashion, these curlers were very popular and not expensive. The eyelash curler was patented April 7, 1931 and the images drawn in the patent application look very much the same as the eyelash curlers seen on the market today. Originally named Rodal, the brand smartly changed the product’s name to Kurlash. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eyelashesinhistory.com/20th_century_IV.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quailbellmagazine.com/the-real/history-of-the-eyelash-curler|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyelash curlers are usually made of metal, and often have rubber pads where the curlers make contact with the lashes. The general design of these devices remains the same from 1940s. Manufacturers include ForteBellezza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortebellezza.com|title=Eyelash curler manufacturer|last=Robinson|first=Mary|work=Wed, Aug 13, 2014 06:37 AM EDT}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiseido]] and [[Shu Uemura]].

== Types ==
The two most common types of eyelash curlers are heated curlers and traditional eyelash curlers. Heated eyelash curlers deliver a more intense curl that lasts longer. However a simpler step to add to an eye makeup routine includes a more traditional, unheated eyelash curler. An unheated curler that is curved for the natural shape of an individual's eye includes a plentiful enough pad to press against eyelashes. Before using, an unheated curler can be heated for a short time with a [[hair dryer]], but not to the extent to burn the delicate skin above the eyes. Self-heating, battery-operated units are available.

==Usage==

For traditional eyelash curlers, start by holding the curler like a pair of scissors and opening it completely. Keep your eyes open and bring the tool towards your upper lashes. Place your lashes in between the top and padded base, stopping as close to the root of your eyelashes as possible without pinching skin. For the first round of curling, keep your tool upright by the roots of your lashes. Check that all of your lashes are inside the curler.

To avoid a sharp bend and to create a natural curled look, gently release the curler and move it up the lash, away from the lid, by one or two millimeters, and again clamp the lashes for five to 10 seconds. Gently release the curler and repeat the process one or two more times, moving the curler up the lashes, closer to the end of the lashes each time. Continue avoiding a sharp bend by moving the curler slightly up the lashes away from the roots for another clamp. Lastly, wiggle the curler up towards the tip of your lashes and close down softly with the same pulsating pressure to complete the curl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southernliving.com/fashion-beauty/beauty-makeup/how-to-use-eyelash-curler|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easy trick is to start with the lash curler at the base of your lashes and then do a slow blink. The pressure of the blink helps curl your lashes as they move through the curler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-and-beauty/eyelash-curler.aspx|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you're using a clamp-style heated curler, start crimping at the base of your lashes and then slowly ease the curler toward the ends. One swoop - from the base to upwards takes around 10 to 15 seconds, gently holding in certain areas to set the curl. It is the combination of heat and holding the position that creates the style of curl. Take time to bend the lashes back and push back to create the curl you want. Move slowly and experiment with the angles at which you hold it.

In order to create the effects of a heated eyelash curler with only the accessibility of a traditional one, a user can warm it up with a [[hair dryer]]. To get the best results, it is recommended to use it directly after warming up with a hair dryer because it lasts longer. When using heated eyelash curlers, it is very important to be cautious of the temperature the curler is heated to. To avoid the risk of burning the eyelid with the hot metal curlers, many companies have introduced plastic based curlers. Some companies are looking into introducing self-heated curlers to control the temperature and completely eliminate the risk of a burn.

To begin, warm up the curler and then curl the [[Eyelash|eyelashes]] for 10 to 15 seconds. Continue curling them until you have the desired shape. Next, apply more coats of [[mascara]] and curl the eyelashes once more for the final look. Repeat the application of mascara and curling of the lashes until the desired length is reached. Due to varying eyelash length, some users may need to apply mascara and curl the eyelashes multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shine.yahoo.com/shine-beauty/eyelash-curler-way-153700337.html|title=How to use an eyelash curler - the RIGHT way!|last=Ducharme|first=Andrea|date=July 20, 2012|publisher=GALTime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Advantages==
An eyelash curler is a good [[makeup]] kit tool because it gives the illusion of bigger and brighter eyes and helps lengthen the eyelashes. When it is applied using different tactics such going heavier on the outer corner eyelashes, it gives a different and well-defined shape to the eyes. It is easy to use without professional training and is not very expensive to purchase. Additionally, it is not a very big tool, so it can be comfortably placed in the makeup bag.

A heated eyelash curler makes the curling process easier and an eyelash curl to last significantly longer. The heated element of the curler saves time and unnecessary pressure for a user, creating an easily curl without the need to hold the clamp down for long periods of time. Alongside this, the majority of heated curlers are wand-like, which means there's nothing pulling or pinching at your eyes. If a user has fragile lashes or lashes that are falling out, a heated eyelash curler will lift up eyelashes for a gentle curl without applying any force whatsoever. Heated eyelash curlers also tame and even out eyelashes that stick out in different directions, creating a flawless look for a user. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://belashed.org/best-heated-eyelash-curler/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Disadvantages==
Among many advantages, there are some disadvantages to the eyelash curler. If not used with care, pulling on the eyelashes while curling can lead to weakening of the roots. Many people can damage their eyelashes by holding down the clamp on their lashes for increased lengths of time, leading to their lashes either being pulled out or falling out due to the stress of continuous clamping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buydeestore.com/tag/advantages-of-eyelash-curler/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in the eyelashes becoming weak and eventually lead to shedding which can be very bad for an eye because they protect the eye from wind and dust and don’t grow back quickly.&lt;p&gt;If not used carefully, eyelash curlers can lead to accidents where a user pinches the eyelid. Depending on the amount of pressure they apply, this can cause a serious injury to the eye. Similarly, when used warm, an eyelash curler, especially those made of metal, can cause serious burns to the eyelid. Also, some heated eyelash curlers require batteries to run, which will require maintenance to run in terms of replacement on time for smooth functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

'''Frank Osmond Carr''' (23 April 1858 – 29 August 1916), known as '''F. Osmond Carr''', was an English [[composer]] who wrote the music for several [[Victorian burlesques]] before turning to the new genere of [[Edwardian musical comedy]], and also composing some [[comic opera]]s.  He often worked with the lyricist [[Adrian Ross]], and several of his pieces were created for the producer [[George Edwardes]].

==Life and career==

Carr's first produced work (with lyricist [[Adrian Ross]]) was the [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] ''Faddimir, or the Triumph of Orthodoxy'' at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in London in 1889, which gained the attention of producer [[George Edwardes]].  Edwardes began to commission songs from Carr and Ross, including a song for his next [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] burlesque ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;  They next wrote the score for a burlesque of ''Joan of Arc, or, The merry maid of Orleans'' (1891), and then the songs for what many historians consider the first British musical comedy, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Carr also composed another burlesque that year, ''Blue Eyed Susan'', for the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]].  Carr next composed two successful musicals for producer Fred Harris: ''[[Morocco Bound]]'' (1893), a model for the music-hall-influenced "variety musicals" to come, and ''[[Go-Bang]]'' (1894), both with lyrics by Ross.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

1n 1894, Edwardes engaged Carr to write the music for ''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'', a [[comic opera]] with a libretto by [[W. S. Gilbert]].  This was a moderate success and enjoyed international productions.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;  Carr's musicals in the late 1890s, included ''Billy'' (1895), ''My Girl'' (1896 with Ross), ''Biarritz'' (1896 with Ross and [[Jerome K Jerome]]), a vehicle for [[Little Tich]] called ''Lord Tom Noddy'' (1896, with [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]]), ''Thrillby'' (1897) and ''The Maid of Athens'' (1897, produced by Carr).  All were unsuccessful, although a number of individual songs from these musicals became popular, and some toured the British provinces.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Carr's post-1900 pieces included ''The Southern Belle'' (1901), ''The Rose of the Riviera'' (1903), ''Miss Mischief'' (1904) and ''The Scottish Bluebells'' (1906), all of which had at least a provincial success, but he never regained his early popularity.  Carr also wrote many separate songs and some instrumental pieces.  He also produced the score for a [[ballet]] produced at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]] in 1907 called ''Sir Roger de Coverley''.

He retired to the country in 1916 but almost immediately died of a heart attack in [[Uxbridge]], [[Middlesex]], England, at the age of 58.

'''FriendsWithYou''' (FWY) is an art collaborative based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]],&lt;ref name="Inside FriendsWithYou's Incredible Los Angeles Studio"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.complexmag.ca/art-design/2013/04/inside-friendswithyous-incredible-los-angeles-studio|publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Inside FriendsWithYou's Incredible Los Angeles Studio |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in Miami, [[Florida]], by Samuel Albert Borkson (b.1979, Plantation, Florida)&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/info/biography/|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Biography|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arturo Sandoval III (b. 1976, Havana, Cuba) &lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; in 2002, which seeks to redesign [[spirituality]], rituals, and religious acts for modern day usage and connectivity.&lt;ref name="FRIENDSWITHYOU"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://theholenyc.com/2011/06/10/friendwithyou|publisher= The Hole|title= FRIENDSWITHYOU |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; FriendsWithYou’s mission coincides with their motto "Magic, Luck, and Friendship."&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou's 'Inner Space': Art After Basel"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/friendswithyou-inner-space_n_1151062.html|publisher= The Huffington Post|title= FriendsWithYou's 'Inner Space': Art After Basel|accessdate=July 12, 2013|first=Amanda|last=McCorquodale|date=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaborative began by creating soft sculptures as a means to spread more accessible art like plush and wood toys,&lt;ref name="Friends With YOU in NYC"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://textileartscenterblog.com/friends-with-you-in-nyc/|publisher= Textile Arts Center|title= Friends With YOU in NYC|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as immersive art installations, fine art works including sculpture and painting, and are best known for their public art spectacles such as large-scale art installations, playgrounds, and performance pieces.&lt;ref name="Friends With You opens its Design District Studio for Art Basel Exhibition called “Inner Space, the Secrets of the Unknown"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://the305.com/2011/11/25/friends-with-you-opens-its-design-district-studio-for-art-basel-exhibition-called-inner-space-the-secrets-of-the-unknown/#ixzz2TzX4Br6B|publisher= The305.com|title= Friends With You opens its Design District Studio for Art Basel Exhibition called "Inner Space, the Secrets of the Unknown |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have described the creation of their art as a healing process intended to increase relatability and connection to each other and the world around them.&lt;ref name="Interview: FriendsWithYou Discusses Their Artists Talk with MOCAtv and the Art of Positivity"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.complex.com/art-design/2013/02/interview-friendswithyou-discusses-their-artists-talk-with-mocatv-and-the-art-of-positivity|publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Interview: FriendsWithYou Discusses Their Artists Talk with MOCAtv and the Art of Positivity|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, they have become internationally recognized with public exhibits and artworks in Europe, Asia, Australia, and The Americas.

FriendsWithYou Fine Art has been exhibited and/or included in the permanent collections of [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MOCA), the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|Haus der Kulturen der Welt Museum Berlin]], and [[Galerie Perrotin|Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin]] among others.&lt;ref name="Magic, Luck and Friendship (TM)"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://sites.moca.org/thecurve/2013/02/15/magic-luck-and-friendship/ |publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Magic, Luck and Friendship (TM)|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2006, the [[Germany|German]] art press Die Gestalten Verlag published a FriendsWithYou [[monograph]] titled ''Friends With You Have Powers!''

==Evaluation and influence==
FriendsWithYou have explained that their art is meant to "activate the social interaction of people as exploded and refracted by the Internet and elaborate new modes of interpersonal relationships."&lt;ref name="FRIENDSWITHYOU"/&gt;
 
They use play as an artistic means to foster these relationships.&lt;ref name="Artists: FriendsWithYou"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://iloveoffset.com/stage/friendswithyou |publisher= iloveoffset.com |title= FriendsWithYou |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many FriendsWithYou works look like toys because they are meant for play as a means of interactive unstructured free association. FWY hopes that "through their artwork, the buried, neglected urges and yearnings that a seasoned art viewer may not expect to have activated; playfulness, laughter and inquisitiveness are triggered, with an end result of feeling connected."&lt;ref name="Artists Statement"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://friendswithyou.com/info|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Artists Statement|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FWY inverts the practice and usage of religious traditions, symbols, and spiritual practices through play to open a connection to the divine.&lt;ref name="FRIENDSWITHYOU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview: FriendsWithYou Discusses Their Artists Talk with MOCAtv and the Art of Positivity"/&gt;

Conceptually, FriendsWithYou’s experiential artwork is in conversation with [[Relational Aesthetics]] and the work of Jeff Koons, [[Takashi Murakami]], and [[Damien Hirst]].  The collective has been compared to Takashi Murakami for their "[[superflat]]" approach to art.&lt;ref name="Friends With You"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/arts-and-entertainment/article/friends-you|publisher= Broadsheet|title= Friends With You|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork and installations==
===Solo shows===
'''Inner Vision in Between''' was featured at the MCLEMOI Gallery in Sydney, Australia from February 15 to April 11, 2013. The exhibition themes ran from the playful to the spiritual. It was also described as a minimal, peaceful, stoic and occasionally foreboding journey from one chapter to another.&lt;ref name="Inner Vision In Between"/&gt;

'''In The Beginning''', featured at the Colette in Paris from August 29 to September 24, 2011. It consisted of bronze sculptures, a series of prints, including two exclusive edition prints solely for Colette, an animation video piece and limited run products, in addition to limited edition inflatable Malfi heads and Rainbow Mr. TTT bop bags.&lt;ref name="IN THE BEGINNING"/&gt;

''''Happy Rainbow''', installed at the Tuen Mun Town Plaza, in Hong Kong from July 22 to September 2, 2012 was a colorful interactive bounce house which also featured fiberglass, plush and resin sculpture installations.&lt;ref name="Happy Rainbow – Friends With You"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.myplasticblog.com/art-shows/happy-rainbow-fwy/|publisher= myplasticblog.com|title= Happy Rainbow – FriendsWithYou|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Happy Rainbow – Friends With You"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friends With You ‘Happy Rainbow’ Exhibition in Hong Kong"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.acclaimmag.com/arts/friends-with-you-happy-rainbow-exhibition-in-hong-kong/|publisher= Acclaim Magazine|title= Friends With You ‘Happy Rainbow’ Exhibition in Hong Kong|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; FWY designed the installation as a modern shrine which also embodies their themes of play and spirituality. "FWY hopes to evoke a spiritual connectivity that will enlighten all visitors. Each piece in the exhibition is charged with so much color and power that it brings great harmony to all who look upon it," the group wrote.&lt;ref name="Happy Rainbow"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/fwys-first-hong-kong-exhibition-happy-rainbow|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Happy Rainbow|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friendswithyou Blows Up Happy Rainbow In Hong Kong"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://knstrct.com/2012/08/13/friendswithyou-blows-up-happy-rainbow-in-hong-kong|publisher= knstrct.com|title= Friendswithyou Blows Up Happy Rainbow In Hong Kong|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''':)''' at the Hole from June 10 to August 6, 2011 &lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; was FriendsWithYou’s first solo exhibition in New York and the inaugural show at the Hole’s new location. The show featured 22 FriendsWithYou artworks including a series of anthropomorphic figures created largely out of geometric abstractions made from Lasercut MDF, car paint and acrylic.  The show was described as "relentlessly cheerful," and “an interactive, experiential wonderland of pop-straction and participation.”
Much like Murakami, [[Arturo Herrera]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], and others FWY take a spiritual and serene approach to form and figure in the :) exhibition. The artists consider these works to be part of the “service art” movement, allowing for the viewer to easily understand their message and not be categorized as “pretentious art”. FWY feels art is for everyone and can aid in connecting humankind.&lt;ref name="Building a Rainbow City"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/inner-space-the-secrets-of-the-unknown| publisher= Artlog|title= Building a Rainbow City|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inner Space, The Secrets of the Unknown''' featured bright wooden sculptures, introspective metal beings and FriendsWithYou's signature inflatable artwork. The installation ran at The Hole NYC annex in Miami from December 1, 2011 to January 28, 2012.&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou's 'Inner Space': Art After Basel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friends With You opens its Design District Studio for Art Basel Exhibition called “Inner Space, the Secrets of the Unknown"/&gt; FWY explained that “the pieces on display are figurative self reflective treasures, levitating in a space continuum, revealing something otherwise inaccessible."&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou's 'Inner Space': Art After Basel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friendswithyou At Art Basel Miami 2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://knstrct.com/2011/12/04/friendswithyou-at-art-basel-miami-2011/|publisher= knstrct.com|title= Friendswithyou At Art Basel Miami 2011|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INNER SPACE , THE SECRETS OF THE UNKNOWN"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/inner-space-the-secrets-of-the-unknown|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= INNER SPACE , THE SECRETS OF THE UNKNOWN|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Building Blocks''', featured at Art Basel in Miami from December 2, 2010 to January 8, 2011, featured FriendsWithYou's trademark playful inflatables as well as prints.&lt;ref name="BUILDING BLOCKS"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/building-blocks/|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= BUILDING BLOCKS|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation consisted of paintings created over the course of a decade. The paintings were meant to be flat extensions of FriendsWithYou's existing sculptural, graphical and experiential installation works and were created to allow or encourage viewers to project their own emotions onto.. The pieces were presented alongside the series of paintings, FWY exhibited select sculptural pieces, meant to illustrate the progression between their installation and the “portraiture.”&lt;ref name="BUILDING BLOCKS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou Building Blocks Opening Reception"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.soflanights.com/?p=2502|publisher= soflanights.com|title= FriendsWithYou Building Blocks Opening Reception|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Rainbow City}}
'''Rainbow City''' was an interactive installation containing minimalist inflatable forms from 8' to 50' borrowing their aesthetics from toy-like geometries and designs.&lt;ref name="AOL Artists: Rainbow City"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.aolartists.com/initiatives/rainbow-city|publisher= AOL Artists|title= Rainbow City|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally commissioned in 2010 by the Luminato Arts Foundation in Toronto, Canada, Rainbow City was then exhibited at Art Basel Miami 2010 presented by Paper Magazine, Pharrell Williams, and Aol. About 20,000 people visited the installation and were able to participate by bouncing about inside the inflatable structures and wandering in and around the surreal landscape.&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou Converts Art Basel 2010 Into A Rainbow City"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/friendswithyou-converts-art-basel-2010-into-a-rainbow-city |publisher= The Creators Project|title= FriendsWithYou Converts Art Basel 2010 Into A Rainbow City |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 2010 to open section 2 of the High Line in New York City, a collection of 40 air-filled sculptures filled 16,000 square feet of outdoor space in Chelsea.&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou's Rainbow City at the High Line Park"/&gt; It was FWY's first large scale interactive installation in New York City.&lt;ref name="RAINBOW CITY: AOL &amp; FRIENDSWITHYOU'S URBAN PLAYGROUND"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.psfk.com/2011/05/rainbow-city-aol-friendswithyous-urban-playground.html|publisher= psfk|title= RAINBOW CITY: AOL &amp; FRIENDSWITHYOU'S URBAN PLAYGROUND|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://culturereport.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/art-collective-friendswithyou-bring-color-and-joy-to-new-york|publisher= The Culture Report|title= ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the artists, Rainbow City was created to allow the viewer to reinterpret spirituality.  The large totems represented self-reflective portraits, in line with FWY’s goal of evoking visitors to see their emotions and own self within the sculptural pieces. Visitors were encouraged to come and “be in awe of these large, reduced shaped and simple totems,” stated Arturo Sandoval III. By evoking play through very simple form, FriendsWithYou feels an almost religious scenario of connectivity is created in this interactive installation.&lt;ref name="ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friends with Safewalls"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.safewalls.org/news/friendswithsafewalls/|publisher= Safewalls|title= Friends with Safewalls |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fun House''', described as "a giant, anthropomorphic bounce house intended to help unleash the visitors’ inner brats and in doing so, take advantage of the healing power of fun,&lt;ref name="Friends With You - Miami"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.thecoolhunter.net/article/detail/1446 |publisher= The Cool Hunter|title= Friends With You - Miami|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;" was originally commissioned by 944 magazine and the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas in 2008.

It was commissioned as a part of the mall’s “Turnberry for the Arts” program, which was founded to help promote the arts by “displaying world class artwork created by both celebrated contemporary artists and talented local artists in Aventura and the surrounding Miami area.” Other artists in the collection include: Daniel Arsham, Louise Bourgeois, Julian Opie, Tom Otterness, Gary Hume, Lawrence Weiner and Jorge Pardo&lt;ref name="The amazing art of Aventura Mall"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://cityofaventurablog.com/2012/07/23/the-amazing-art-of-aventura-mall/|publisher= cityofaventurablog.com|title= The amazing art of Aventura Mall|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on December 21, 2006 and was their first permanent installation.

[[File:FriendsWithYou's Cloud City 3.jpg|thumb|right|'''Cloud City''']]'''Cloud City''' opened in 2005 at the MOCA warehouse during the annual Art Basel in Miami. It was set up as an interactive playground composed of geometric shapes such inflatable spheres, padded 10 foot cones on casters, and pillowed cylinders. The oversized geometric forms and colors invited participation on the part of the viewers in Cloud City, "an adventurous dream world playground designed to reinvigorate audiences with childlike energy and optimism."&lt;ref name="Friends With You Cloud City Exhibition"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://news.gestalten.com/news/friends-you-cloud-city-exhibition|publisher= gestalten|title= Friends With You Cloud City Exhibition|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the objects replicated the facial design of their character The boy. The central figure in this installation, The boy is an archetype that embodies youth and naïve creation.&lt;ref name="FRIENDS WITH YOU: CLOUD CITY"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://mocanomi.org/2005/07/friends-with-you/|publisher= mocanomi.org|title= FRIENDS WITH YOU: CLOUD CITY |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). With the start of Cloud City FriendsWithYou also released a CD music album of the same name featuring music artists such as PonPoko, Phoenicia, Otto VaN Shirach, and Sam.

'''Cloudy''' is a video installation that launched exclusively on "'[[Pharrell Williams]]'"'s "'[[i am OTHER]]'" "'[[YouTube]]'" channel. "Cloudy" is a short by artists Samuel Borkson and Arturo Sandoval III. The animated piece is an exploration into the clouds; a sweet, visual soundscape that takes the viewer through a personal journey into the sky. It invites viewers to follow a cast of clouds and raindrops through an entrancing adventure. FriendsWithYou explores animism, giving the main cast of characters a soul. The purpose of the piece is to transcend the viewer to a peaceful and joyous state.

'''Get Lucky''' was an installation located in the Miami based art space The Box which ran from August 28th to September 25th, 2004. It featured six different altars, with a focus on pyramid, conical, or triangular shapes, covering different aspects of human life and death. The Fur Liaison was a furry monster character who accompanied guests around the installation. The Installation aimed to be an "adventure into a modern ritual that empowers us to realize the significant effect we can pose on the world and a chance to alter it to a more balanced state to achieve happiness."&lt;ref name="GET LUCKY INTERACTIVE INSTALLATION"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://news.gestalten.com/news/get-lucky-interactive-installation |publisher= Gestalten|title= GET LUCKY INTERACTIVE INSTALLATION|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It also was featured at the Merry Karnowsky Gallery in Los Angeles November 20, 2004 from January 15, 2005.)&lt;ref name="GETLUCKY"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/get-lucky|publisher= FriendsWiithYou|title= GET LUCKY|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters and toys==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GWGGroup.jpg|thumb|The ''Good Wood Gang'' from 2005]] --&gt;
FriendsWithYou refers to its toy-like characters as "friends."&lt;ref name="Friends with Safewalls"/&gt;

The friends include:
* Malfi
* Mr. TTT burger
* The boy
* Rainbow King

As one of their first projects, FWY created a soft sculptural toy line using their friends characters that was intended to empower collectors with interactive "pseudo-amulets" at an accessible price. Each toy or soft sculpture is produced in a small edition, typically not re-released, and given a persona described in a booklet-style tag affixed to it.&lt;ref name="Friends"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/plush/|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Friends|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hanger''''' is a 2009 [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Ryan Nicholson]], and co-written by Patrick Coble. Film is banned in Australia and Germany.

== Plot ==

Unable to bring in anymore money for Leroy, her abusive pimp, the pregnant Rose tries to run away in the middle of the night, but is caught by Leroy. Using a clothes hanger, Leroy performs an impromptu abortion on Rose, unintentionally killing her in the process. Leroy disposes of Rose's baby in a dumpster, where its cries attract the attention of a homeless man, who raises the disfigured child as "Hanger".

On his eighteenth birthday, the vagrant sends Hanger off to live with John, his biological father, who the man had earlier met at a junkyard. John informs Hanger that he has gotten him a job at the junkyard, and that he will be working there and living with Russell, an acquaintance with [[Down syndrome]]. As he drives away with Hanger, John runs over the homeless man (who was defecating in his tent) and joyously tells his long-lost son "Welcome to the rest of your life!" John gives Hanger a picture of Rose, and picks up a prostitute for him to have sex with, but upon seeing Hanger's mutilated face, the woman goes into hysterics, so John crushes her head in his truck door.

While Hanger is watching pornography with Russell in their home, a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] visits, and Hanger mauls and partially eats her while being cheered on by Russell. Later, John drops by, and reveals to Hanger that he has a plan to get revenge on Leroy for what he did to Rose. On his way out, John is approached by Foxy White, Leroy's girlfriend, who offers to help John kill Leroy. John turns down Foxy's offer, but says he will make Leroy suffer "a little extra" if Foxy watches over Hanger.

While Hanger is at work, John is captured by Leroy and a prostitute named Trashy, who disfigure him with a [[blow torch]], and a hanger. Foxy finds John and tries to release him, but Leroy walks in on this, and shoots Foxy in the head. As that occurs, Russell and Hanger are drugged by Phil, a co-worker, who rapes them while wearing a [[Santa suit]]; at one point, Phil inserts his penis into Hanger's leaking [[colostomy]]. Russell and Hanger get their revenge on Phil at the junkyard, knocking him out, and placing him under a pile of garbage. Russell goes home and drinks tea made from used [[tampon]]s, but after getting a call from Hanger, Russell goes to the junkyard, and finds Nicole (the owner's daughter) unconscious in her office, Hanger having knocked her out with Phil's drugs.

Russell takes Nicole's tampon, and she is later found by Leroy, who rapes her while she is unconscious, and threatens her into luring away Russell so Leroy can be alone with Hanger. Once he is in Nicole's office, Russell is seemingly killed by Leroy, who chokes him with one of Nicole's tampons. Outside, Hanger stomps Phil's head in, and is confronted by Leroy, but John (who was left for dead, but recovered and killed Trashy by shoving a [[douche]] up her nose) appears and calls Leroy out. Leroy and John fatally shoot each other, and a distraught Hanger runs off with the hysterical Nicole.

''Hanger'' was released [[Direct-to-Video]] by Breaking Glass Pictures on Nov 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hanger (2009) Ryan Nicholson|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/hanger-v505807/releases|website=AllMovie.com|publisher=AllMovie|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Reception ==

Film Bizarro found ''Hanger'' to be "a great entertaining trash-fest that has come the closest to being a true throwback to [[grindhouse]] cinema that any movie has so far" despite the ending feeling erratic and anticlimactic. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.filmbizarro.com/view_review.php?review=hanger.php|title = Hanger|last = Carnell|first = Preston|publisher = Film Bizarro|date = |website = filmbizarro.com|accessdate = 11 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; A three and a half was awarded by Severed Cinema, which wrote that "''Hanger'' is as entertaining as it is repulsive" and "the film is a fun campy horror comedy". &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://severed-cinema.com/h-reviews/hanger-plotdigger-films-breaking-glass-pictures|title = Hanger - Plotdigger Films - Breaking Glass Pictures|last = Mayo|first = Chris|publisher = Severed Cinema|date = 25 April 2010|website = severedcinema.com|accessdate = 17 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; Independent Flicks commended the camerawork, editing, gore, and Dan Ellis's performance, but gave a four and half out of seven after deeming the film "a bit too bizarre" and "something of a let down" due to the "cartoonish style" that lessened its impact. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://daydreamer-theplayground.blogspot.se/2012/07/dvd-review-hanger-video-2009.html?zx=361a78d199d6e35b|title = Hanger (Video 2009)|last = Lundin|first = Jorgen|publisher = Independent Flicks|date = 21 July 2012|website = daydreamer-theplayground.blogspot.se|accessdate = 17 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A three out of five was awarded by Digital Retribution, which stated "''Hanger'' is hard to rate because it sets out to offend and will probably do so for virtually everyone, but that doesn't make it good" and "I found ''Hanger's'' [[padding]] and surrealism distracting and a bit boring". &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.digital-retribution.com/reviews/dvd1/313.php|title = Hanger (2009)|last = Bertsch|first = Devon|publisher = Digital Retribution|date = 5 April 2010|website = digital-retribution.com|accessdate = 17 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; The film was called "Nicholson's nastiest piece of work yet" by The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre, which deemed it "worthless" and one of the most "vile" films the website has covered. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://thelastexit.net/cinema/nicholson.html#Hanger|title = Ryan Nicholson|last = |first = |publisher = The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre|date = |website = thelastexit.net|accessdate = 7 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://thelastexit.net/cinema/special.html|title = Special Mention (Most Extreme Movies)|last = |first = |publisher = The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre|date = |website = thelastexit.net|accessdate = 7 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tilla Jogian.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tilla Jogian]], [[Pakistan]] where Ranjha came]]
'''''Heer Ranjha''''' is one of several popular tragic romances of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The others are ''[[Mirza Sahiba]]'' and ''[[Sohni Mahiwal]]''. There are several poetic narrations of the story, the most famous being 'Heer' by [[Waris Shah]] written in 1766. It tells the story of the love of Heer and her lover Ranjha.&lt;ref&gt;http://apnaorg.com/research-papers/english/paper-9/page-1.shtml, Heer Ranjha, research paper on epic poem written by Waris Shah in 1766 on Academy of the Punjab in North America website, Retrieved 1 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Heer Ranjha's tombstone.jpg|thumb|250px|Heer Ranjha's tombstone]]

''Heer Ranjha'' was written by Waris Shah. Some historians say that the story was the original work of Shah, written after he had fallen in love with a girl named Bhag Bhari.&lt;ref name="hanif"&gt;{{citation|title=Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: South Asia|author=N. Hanif|page=387|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that Heer and Ranjha were real personalities who lived under the [[Lodi dynasty]] and that Waris Shah later utilised these personalities for his story. Shah states that the story has a deeper meaning, referring to the unrelenting quest that man has towards God.&lt;ref name="pirzada"&gt;{{citation|title=Chasing Love Up against the Sun|page=12|author=Waqar Pirzada|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example from the epic poem==
Rag Heer Ranjha. The invocation at the beginning,&lt;ref&gt;In Waris Shah's version there is an added invocation to the famous [[Panj peer]] or five saints&lt;/ref&gt; in one version:

:Awal-akhir naam Allah da lena, duja dos Muhammad Miran
:Tija naun maat pita da lena, unha da chunga dudh sariran
:Chautha naun unn paani da lena, jis khaave man banhe dhiran
:Panjman naun Dharti Maata da lena, jis par kadam takiman
:Chhewan naun Khwaja Pir da lena, jhul pilave thande niran
:Satwan naun Guru Gorakhnath de lena, pataal puje bhojan
:Athwan naun lalaanwale da lena, bande bande de tabaq zanjiran

:First take the name of Allah and second the Great Muhammad, the prophet [of God]
:Third, take the name of father and mother, on whose milk my body thrived
:Fourth, take the name of bread and water, by eating which my heart is gladdened
:Fifth, take the name of Mother Earth, on whom I place my feet.
:Sixth, take the name of Khwaja (Khizr, the Saint), who gives me cold water to drink
:Seventh, take the name of Guru Gorakh Nath who is worshipped with a platter of milk and rice
:Eighth, take the name of Lalanwala who breaks the bonds and the chains of captives

(The Legends of the Panjab by RC Temple, Rupa and Company, Volume two, page 606)

==Summary of the love story==
[[File:Luddan ferries Ranjha across the Chenab.jpg|left|thumb|Luddan ferries Ranjha across the Chenab]]
Heer is an extremely beautiful woman, born into a wealthy family of the [[Sial tribe]] in [[Jhang]] which is now [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], Pakistan. Ranjha (whose first name is Dheedo; Ranjha is the surname,his caste is Ranjha[Jatt]), a Jat of the [[Ranjha (tribe)|Ranjha]] tribe, is the youngest of four brothers and lives in the village of [[Takht Hazara]] by the river [[Chenab]]. Being his father's favorite son, unlike his brothers who had to toil in the lands, he led a life of ease, playing the flute ('Wanjhli'/'[[Bansuri]]'). After a quarrel with his brothers over land, Ranjha leaves home. In Waris Shah's version of the epic, it is said that Ranjha left his home because his brothers' wives refused to give him food. Eventually he arrives in Heer's village and falls in love with her. Heer's father offers Ranjha a job herding his cattle. Heer becomes mesmerised by the way Ranjha plays his flute and eventually falls in love with him. They meet each other secretly for many years until they are caught by Heer's jealous uncle, Kaido, and her parents Chuchak and Malki. Heer is forced by her family and the local priest or '[[Maulvi]]' to marry another man named Saida Khera.

Ranjha is heartbroken. He wanders the countryside alone, until eventually he meets a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] [[Jogi]] (ascetic). After meeting [[Gorakhnath]], the founder of the "Kanphata" (pierced ear) sect of jogis at [[Tilla Jogian]] (the 'Hill of Ascetics', located 50 miles north of the historic town of [[Bhera]], [[Sargodha District]], Punjab), Ranjha becomes a jogi himself, piercing his ears and renouncing the material world. While reciting the name of the Lord, he wanders all over Punjab, eventually finding the village where Heer now lives.

The two return to Heer's village, where Heer's parents agree to their marriage - though some versions of the story state that the parent's agreement is only a deception. On the wedding day, Kaido poisons her food so that the wedding will not take place, in order to punish the girl for her behaviour. Hearing this news, Ranjha rushes to aid Heer, but is too late, as she has already eaten the poison and has died. Brokenhearted once again, Ranjha eats the remaining poisoned ''[[Laddu]]'' (sweet) which Heer has eaten and dies by her side.

Heer and Ranjha are buried in Heer's hometown, Jhang. Love-smitten couples and others often pay visits to their mausoleum.&lt;ref&gt;Tomb of Heer Ranjha in Jhang.Pakistan Geotagging website link:http://pakgeotagging.blogspot.com/2014/05/tomb-of-heer-ranjha-in-jhang-takht.html, Retrieved 1 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
==Legacy and influence==
Because its plot involves a romance opposed by family members and ends with the two lovers dying, the story is often compared to the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirhandi|first=Marcella C.|date=1999-09-01|title=Manipulating Cultural Idioms|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043249.1999.10791952|journal=Art Journal|volume=58|issue=3|pages=40–47|doi=10.1080/00043249.1999.10791952|issn=0004-3249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/27353/689057.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The epic poem has been made into several feature films between 1928 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citwf.com/listFilms.asp?filmName=Heer+Ranjha, List of many films made on the love story of Heer Ranjha on Complete Index To World Film website, Retrieved 1 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Varley''' (17 August 1778{{snd}}17 November 1842) was an English [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[astrologer]], and a close friend of [[William Blake]]. They collaborated in 1819–1820 on the book ''[[Visionary Heads]]'', written by Varley and illustrated by Blake.  He was the elder brother of a family of artists: [[Cornelius Varley]], William Fleetwood Varley, and Elizabeth, who married the painter [[William Mulready]].

==Life and work==

John Varley was born at the ''Old Blue Post Tavern'', [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], on 17 August 1778. His father, Richard Varley, born at [[Epworth, Lincolnshire|Epworth]] in [[Lincolnshire]], had settled in [[London]] after the death of his first wife in [[Yorkshire]]. His parents discouraged his leanings towards art, and placed him under a silversmith.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Varley, John|volume=27|page=922}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on their death he was for a brief time employed by a portrait painter in [[Holborn]] and then, at the age of 15 or 16, he became a pupil of Joseph Charles Barrow ([[floruit|fl.]] 1789–1802) who had an evening drawing school twice a week at 12 Furnival's Inn Court, Holborn. It was Barrow who took Varley on a sketching tour to [[Peterborough]] from which he emerged as a professional painter. In 1798 he exhibited a highly regarded sketch of [[Peterborough Cathedral]] at the [[Royal Academy]] and became a regular exhibitor at the RA until the foundation of the ''[[Royal Watercolour Society|Old Watercolour Society]]'' in 1805.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1799 he visited [[North Wales]], and in its wild mountain scenery found the subjects best suited to his brush. He returned to the same district in 1800, and again in 1802, and the impressions then received powerfully influenced the whole course of his art.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

As one of the founders of the OWS, Varley exhibited largely there over 700 drawings. He also became a highly successful drawing master with pupils including [[Copley Fielding]], [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]] and [[William Turner (artist)]] of Oxford. Despite his success, his growing family meant he was constantly in financial difficulties, "since he was both a hopeless businessman and by temperament something of a [[Wilkins Micawber|Micawber]]". (Mallalieu). Varley was particularly skilled at the laying of flat washes of watercolour which suited the placid, contemplative mood that he often sought to evoke.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Varley published ''A Treatise on the Principles of Landscape Drawing'', 1816–21 and ''A Practical Treatise on the Art of Drawing in Perspective''. He also wrote an [[astrological]] text (with illustrations) entitled ''A Treatise on [[Zodiac]]al [[Physiognomy]]'' in 1828.

He is buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Paths&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=101|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''A Practical Tratise on the Art of Drawing in Perspective: adapted for the study of those who draw from nature; by which the usual errors can be avoided'' (printed for Sherwood, Gilbert, and Piper,...and R.Ackermann, ..., London ?1815/1820?).

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], "Varley's landscapes are graceful and solemn in feeling, and simple and broad in treatment, being worked with a full brush and pure fresh transparent tints, usually without any admixture of body-colour. Though his works are rather mannered and conventional, they are well considered and excellent in composition. Some of his earlier water-colours, including his "Views of the Thames," were painted upon the spot, and possess greater individuality than his later productions, which are mainly compositions of mountain and lake scenery, produced without direct reference to nature."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''Karl Marx'''&lt;ref name="his_name group=note"&gt;The name "Karl Heinrich Marx", used in various lexicons, is based on an error. His birth certificate says "Carl Heinrich Marx", while elsewhere "Karl Marx" is used. "K. H. Marx" is used only in his poetry collections and the transcript of his dissertation; since Marx wanted to honour his father, who had died in 1838, he called himself "Karl Heinrich" in three documents.[https://archive.org/stream/handwrterbuchder04conr#page/1130/mode/1up The article] by Friedrich Engels "Marx, Karl Heinrich" in ''Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften'' (Jena, 1892, column 1130 to 1133 see ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works|MECW]]'' Volume 22, pp. 337–345) does not justify assigning Marx a middle name.

Born in [[Trier]], Germany, to a [[History of Jews in Germany|Jewish]] middle-class family, Marx studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]] at university. Due to his political publications, Marx became [[Statelessness|stateless]] and lived in exile in [[London]] for decades, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker [[Friedrich Engels]] and publish his writings, researching in the [[British Museum Reading Room|reading room of the British Museum]]. His best-known titles are the 1848 [[pamphlet]], ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', and the three-volume ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]''. His political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual, economic and political history and his name has been used as an adjective, a noun and a school of social theory.

Marx's theories about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as [[Marxism]]—hold that human societies develop through [[class struggle]]. In [[capitalism]], this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the [[bourgeoisie]]) that control the [[means of production]] and the working classes (known as the [[proletariat]]) that enable these means by selling their [[labour power]] in return for wages.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt; Employing a critical approach known as [[historical materialism]], Marx predicted that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and [[crisis theory|crisis-prone nature]], would eventuate the working class' development of [[class consciousness]], leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, [[communist]] society constituted by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm ''Critique of the Gotha Program'']&lt;/ref&gt; Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised [[Revolution|revolutionary action]] to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic [[emancipation]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24" /&gt;

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and [[Criticisms of Marxism|criticised]].&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt; His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and subsequent economic thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]].

==Biography==

===Childhood and early education: 1818–1836===
Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to [[Heinrich Marx]] (1777–1838) and [[Henriette Pressburg]] (1788–1863). He was born at Brückengasse 664 in [[Trier]], a town then part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]'s [[Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine|Province of the Lower Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=8, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was ethnically [[Jewish]]. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch [[rabbi]], while his paternal line had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–5}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=7–9, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education. He became a lawyer and lived a relatively wealthy and middle-class existence, with his family owning a number of [[Moselle wine|Moselle]] vineyards. Prior to his son's birth, and after the abrogation of [[Jewish emancipation]] in the Rhineland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q0OHHNyFeEC&amp;pg=PA419|title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews – A History|last=Carroll|first=James|date=1 April 2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0547348889|location=|pages=419|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herschel converted from [[Judaism]] to join the state [[Prussian Union of Churches|Evangelical Church of Prussia]], taking on the German forename Heinrich over the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] Herschel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–6}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was a third cousin once removed of German Romantic poet [[Heinrich Heine]], also born to a German Jewish family in the [[Rhineland]], with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Raddatz ''Karl Marx: A Political Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Trier BW 2014-06-21 11-11-49.jpg|thumb|[[Karl-Marx-Haus|Marx's birthplace]], now Brückenstraße 10, in Trier.

Largely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], interested in the ideas of the philosophers [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Voltaire]]. A [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]], he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, at that time being an [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=5, 8–12}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=11}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, Heinrich Marx began working as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near  the [[Porta Nigra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=10}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, [[Henriette Pressburg]], was a Dutch Jewish woman from a prosperous business family that later founded the company [[Philips Electronics]]. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both [[Gerard Philips|Gerard]] and [[Anton Philips]] and great-grandmother to [[Frits Philips]]. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and [[Jenny von Westphalen|Jenny Marx]] would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.&lt;ref&gt;''Francis Wheen, Karl Marx: A Life'', (Fourth Estate, 1999), {{ISBN|1-85702-637-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Marx's childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The third of nine children, he became the eldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Marx and his surviving siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie and Caroline, were [[baptism|baptised]] into the Lutheran Church in August 1824 and their mother in November 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karl Marx: Dictionary of National Biography. Volume 37|pp=57–58 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0198613873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Marx was privately educated by his father until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, was a friend of his father. By employing many [[Liberal humanism|liberal humanists]] as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=12–15}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=13}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=7–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1835 at the age of 17, Marx travelled to the [[University of Bonn]] wishing to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=15–16}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=14}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a condition referred to as a "weak chest",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was excused from military duty when he turned 18. While at the University at Bonn, Marx joined the Poets' Club, a group containing political radicals that were monitored by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=20}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society (''Landsmannschaft der Treveraner''), at one point serving as club co-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=16}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Marx was involved in certain disputes, some of which became serious: in August 1836 he took part in a duel with a member of the university's Borussian Korps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his grades in the first term were good, they soon deteriorated, leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegelianism and early journalism: 1836–1843===
Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to [[Jenny von Westphalen]], an educated baroness of the Prussian ruling class who had known Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father [[Ludwig von Westphalen]] (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fedoseyev|1973|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=23–30}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–21, 33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=15, 20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 they got married in a Protestant church in [[Bad Kreuznach|Kreuznach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=70–71}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=52–53}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=61–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1836, Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse.  &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=31}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first term, Marx attended lectures of [[Eduard Gans]] who represented the progressive Hegelian standpoint, elaborated on rational development in history by emphasizing particularly its libertarian aspects, and the importance of social question, and lectures of [[Karl von Savigny]] who represented the [[Historical School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that "without philosophy nothing could be accomplished".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=32–34}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During a convalescence in Stralau, he joined the Doctor's Club (''Doktorklub''), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas and through them became involved with a group of [[Political radicalism|radical thinkers]] known as the [[Young Hegelians]] in 1837. They gathered around [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]], with Marx developing a particularly close friendship with Adolf Rutenberg. Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] assumptions, but adopted his [[Marxist dialectic|dialectical method]] in order to criticise established society, politics and religion from a leftist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=34–38}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=25–27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=44,69–70}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=17–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx had been emotionally close to his father and treasured his memory after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sperber|2013|pp=55–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jenny-von-Westphalen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jenny von Westphalen]] in the 1830s]]

By 1837, Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction, having completed a short novel, ''[[Scorpion and Felix]]'', a drama, ''[[Oulanem]]'', as well as a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen, though none of this early work was published during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=18–19}}. These love poems would be published posthumously in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975) pp. 531–632.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, [[art history]] and the translation of Latin classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He began co-operating with [[Bruno Bauer]] on editing Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion|Philosophy of Religion]]'' in 1840. Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Marx's thesis was posthumously published in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975) pp. 25–107.&lt;/ref&gt; which he completed in 1841. It was described as "a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal [[University of Jena]], whose faculty awarded him his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in April 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=28–29, 33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://willamette.edu/cla/classics/careers/marx/index.html | title=Classics: Karl Marx}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Marx and Bauer were both [[atheism|atheists]], in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled ''Archiv des Atheismus'' (''Atheistic Archives''), but it never came to fruition. In July, Marx and Bauer took a trip to [[Bonn]] from Berlin. There they scandalised their class by getting drunk, laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=38–45}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=32–33, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx was considering an academic career, but this path was barred by the government's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=49}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx moved to [[Cologne]] in 1842, where he became a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' (''Rhineland News''), expressing his early views on socialism and his developing interest in economics. Marx criticised both right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought ineffective or counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=50–51}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=34–36, 42–44}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=35–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper attracted the attention of the Prussian [[censorship|government censors]], who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, as Marx lamented: "Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=47}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=48–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] requested it be banned and Prussia's government complied in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=60–61}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=47–48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=50–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris: 1843–1845===
In 1843, Marx became co-editor of a new, radical leftist Parisian newspaper, the ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'' (''German-French Annals''), then being set up by the German socialist [[Arnold Ruge]] to bring together German and French radicals&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=68–69, 72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus Marx and his wife moved to Paris in October 1843. Initially living with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 [[Rue Vaneau]], they found the living conditions difficult, so moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=77–79}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=62–66}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=73–74, 94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the ''Jahrbücher'' was dominated by the latter and the only non-German writer was the exiled Russian [[Collectivist anarchism|anarchist collectivist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=64–65}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=71–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx contributed two essays to the paper, "[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|Introduction to a Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]"&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[On the Jewish Question]]",&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, "On the Jewish Question", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  the latter introducing his belief that the [[proletariat]] were a revolutionary force and marking his embrace of communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=65–70, 74–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one issue was published, but it was relatively successful, largely owing to the inclusion of [[Heinrich Heine]]'s satirical odes on King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig of Bavaria]], leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies (Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and his friendship with Marx broke down).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=72, 75–76}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=65}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=88–90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the paper's collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, ''[[Vorwärts!]]'' (''Forward!''). Based in Paris, the paper was connected to the [[League of the Just]], a [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] secret society of workers and artisans. Marx attended some of their meetings, but did not join.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=66–67, 112}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=79–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Vorwärts!'', Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Engels 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Engels]], whom Marx met in 1844; the two became lifelong friends and collaborators]]

On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist [[Friedrich Engels]] at the [[Café de la Régence]], beginning a lifelong friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels showed Marx his recently published ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, Philip: ''Paris Between Empires'', p. 390 (St. Martin Press, NY) 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "The Condition of the Working Class in England", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 4'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295–596.&lt;/ref&gt; convincing Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, [[Bruno Bauer]]. This work was published in 1845 as ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Holy Family", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 4'', pp. 3–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young Hegelians [[Max Stirner]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.&lt;ref name="et"/&gt;

N. Fedoseyev (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Marx engaged in an intensive study of [[political economy]] ([[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]], ''etc.'')'',''&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'' ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; the French socialists (especially [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri St. Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]])&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' (Oxford University Press: London, 1963) pp. 90–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of France.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of political economy is a study that Marx would pursue for the rest of his life&lt;ref&gt;Larisa Miskievich, "Preface" to Volume 28 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; and would result in his major economic work{{mdash}}the three-volume series called ''Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', ''Volume 36'' and ''Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996, 1997 and 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism]] is based in large part on three influences: [[Hegel]]'s dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics. Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of "Marxism" were in place by the autumn of 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'', pp. 35–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economy{{mdash}}not only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally by editing a radical newspaper and later by organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings of the citizenry. Still Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies:  he sought "to understand the inner workings of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

An outline of "Marxism" had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844. Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world's political economy had been worked out in great detail, but Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind.&lt;ref&gt;Note 54 contained on page 598 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3''.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Marx wrote ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844" ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 229–346.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx's concept of [[alienated labour]].&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; However, by the spring of 1845 his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new political economic theory that he was espousing—scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' had been written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx recognised that the ''Manuscripts'' had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach.  Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 3–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Theses on Feuerbach" are best known for Thesis 11, which states that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it".&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach," contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This work contains Marx's criticism of [[materialism]] (for being contemplative), [[idealism]] (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's [[historical materialism]], an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engels1999"/&gt; In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down ''Vorwärts!'', with the interior minister, [[François Guizot]], expelling Marx from France.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90"/&gt; At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.

===Brussels: 1845–1848===
[[File:Communist-manifesto.png|thumb|upright|The first edition of ''[[The Communist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', published in German in 1848]]

Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, to stay in Belgium he had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90"/&gt; In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including [[Moses Hess]], [[Karl Heinzen]] and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]]. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild ["New Book Publishing House"]: Dresden, 1972) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Mary Burns]], Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the [[Chartism|Chartists]], a socialist movement in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild [New Book Publishing House]: Dresden, 1972) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; to August 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did Engels already know the English language,&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"/&gt; Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"/&gt; Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of [[historical materialism]], ''[[The German Ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "German Ideology" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 19–539.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Marx broke with [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Max Stirner]] and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while he also broke with [[Karl Grun]] and other "true socialists" whose philosophies were still based in part on "idealism". In ''German Ideology'', Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; ''German Ideology'' is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. Like so many other early writings of his, ''German Ideology'' would not be published in Marx's lifetime and would be published only in 1932.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing ''German Ideology'', Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding "the theory and tactics" of a truly "revolutionary proletarian movement" operating from the standpoint of a truly "scientific materialist" philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See Note 71 on p. 672 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847)&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6''(International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 105–212.&lt;/ref&gt; and offered it as a response to the "petty bourgeois philosophy" of the French anarchist socialist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as expressed in his book ''[[The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marx+Family and Engels.jpg|thumb|Marx, Engels and Marx's daughters]]

These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation [[League of the Just]].&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1973) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 671–672.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its "secret" or "underground" orientation and operate in the open as a political party.&lt;ref&gt;Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'', p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open "above ground" political society that appealed directly to the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev,''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt; This new open political society was called the Communist League.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing up the programme and organisational principles of the new [[Communist League]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "Principles of Communism" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers, New York, 1976) pp. 341–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work — a programme of action for the [[Communist League]]. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was first published on 21 February 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "The Communist Manifesto" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'', pp. 477–519.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Communist Manifesto'' laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref name="ShillingMellor2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Shilling|author2=Philip A Mellor|title=The Sociological Ambition: Elementary Forms of Social and Moral Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CdgJe9Jx0UC&amp;pg=PA114|year=2001|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-6549-7|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the [[bourgeoisie]] (the wealthy capitalist class) and the [[proletariat]] (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the ''Manifesto'' presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar48|Marx and Engels 1848]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that became known as the [[Revolutions of 1848]].&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 125"/&gt; In France, [[French Revolution of 1848|a revolution]] led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the [[French Second Republic]].&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 125"/&gt; Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000&lt;ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/&gt; or 5,000 francs&lt;ref&gt;Saul Kussiel Padover, ''Karl Marx, an intimate biography'', McGraw-Hill, 1978, page 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; he allegedly used a third of it to arm [[Belgium|Belgian]] workers who were planning revolutionary action.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,&lt;ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David McLellan 1973 ''Karl Marx: His life and Thought''. New York: Harper and Row. pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Felix |first1=David |year=1982 |title=Heute Deutschland!

===Cologne: 1848–1849===
Temporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a [[German Workers' Club]] with various German socialists living there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the ''Demands of the Communist Party in Germany'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "Demands of the Communist Party" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 7'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) pp. 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the ''Communist Manifesto'', believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the [[feudalism|feudal]] monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June, Marx started publication of a daily newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father. Designed to put forward news from across Europe with his own Marxist interpretation of events, the newspaper featured Marx as a primary writer and the dominant editorial influence. Despite contributions by fellow members of the Communist League, according to [[Friedrich Engels]] it remained "a simple dictatorship by Marx".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DL-Marx"/&gt;

Whilst editor of the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police and Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Splichal2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehring2003"/&gt; although each time he was acquitted.&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehring2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in [[Prussia]] collapsed and the king, [[Frederick William IV]], introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Consequently, the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May.&lt;ref name="DL-Marx"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 137–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a [[cholera]] epidemic and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson2010"/&gt;

===Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860===
Marx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life. The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London. However, in the winter of 1849–1850 a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by [[August Willich]] and [[Karl Schapper]] began agitating for an immediate uprising. Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise "spontaneously" to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe. Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was "adventuristic" and would be suicide for the Communist League.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 233"&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe. Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the Communist League itself, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of a handful of men.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 233"/&gt; They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development. In the present stage of development (''circa'' 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 he felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage. In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.

After a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.&lt;ref&gt;Note 269 contained on page 674 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society held their meetings in [[Great Windmill Street]], [[Soho]], central London's entertainment district.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 151–155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harriss2006"/&gt; This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Note 269 on page 674 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''New-York Daily Tribune'' and journalism ===
In the early period in London, Marx committed himself almost exclusively to revolutionary activities, such that his family endured extreme poverty.&lt;ref name="DusselMoseley2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="egsbio"/&gt; His main source of income was Engels, whose own source was his wealthy industrialist father.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; In Prussia as editor of his own newspaper, and contributor to others ideologically aligned, Marx could reach his audience, the working classes. In London, without finances to run a newspaper themselves, he and Engels turned to international journalism.  At one stage they were being published by six newspapers from England, the United States, [[Prussia]], Austria and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's principal earnings came from his work as European correspondent, from 1852 to 1862, for the ''[[New-York Daily Tribune]]'',&lt;ref name="Kluger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kluger|first=Richard|title=The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

Marx had his articles translated from German by {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Pieper (revolutionary)|de|3=Wilhelm Pieper (Revolutionär)|lt=Wilhelm Pieper}}, until his proficiency in English had become adequate.&lt;ref name="Dispatches"/&gt;

The ''New-York Daily Tribune'' had been founded in April 1841 by  [[Horace Greeley]].&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Its editorial board contained progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers, among them [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] and the journalist [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]], who was editor-in-chief.  Dana, a [[fourierist]] and an [[abolitionist]], was Marx's contact. 

The ''Tribune'' was a vehicle for Marx to reach a transatlantic public to make a "hidden war" to [[Henry Charles Carey]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perelman : How Karl Marx Helped Shape the Republican Party [https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/12/25/how-karl-marx-helped-shape-the-republican-party] - More : Karl Mary and Henry Carey in the New-York Tribune [https://michaelperelman.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/political-economy-and-the-press-karl-marx-and-henry-carey-at-the-new-york-tribune/]&lt;/ref&gt;. The journal had wide working-class appeal from its foundation;  at two cents, it was inexpensive;&lt;ref&gt;Taken from a picture on page 327 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and, with about 50,000 copies per issue, its circulation was the widest in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kluger"/&gt;{{rp|14}} Its editorial ethos was progressive and its anti-slavery stance reflected Greeley's.&lt;ref name="Kluger"/&gt;{{rp|82}}  Marx's first article for the paper, on the British parliamentary elections, was published on 21 August 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Elections in England – Tories and Whigs" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 327–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 1857 Dana informed Marx that, due to the economic recession, only one article a week would be paid for, published or not; the others would be paid for only if published. Marx had sent his articles on Tuesdays and Fridays, but, that October, the ''Tribune'' discharged all its correspondents in Europe except Marx and B. Taylor, and reduced Marx to a weekly article. Between September and November 1860, only five were published. After a six-month interval, Marx resumed contributions in September 1861 until March 1862, when Dana wrote to inform him that there was no longer space in the ''Tribune'' for reports from London, due to American domestic affairs.&lt;ref name="MECW"&gt;[https://ia801605.us.archive.org/29/items/MarxEngelsCollectedWorksVolume10MKarlMarx/Marx%20%26%20Engels%20Collected%20Works%20Volume%2041_%20Ka%20-%20Karl%20Marx.pdf Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works, vol.41]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1868, Dana set up a rival newspaper, the ''New York Sun'', at which he was editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knopf Publishing, New York, 1986) p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1857, Dana invited Marx to contribute articles, mainly on military history, to the ''[[New American Cyclopedia]]'', an idea of George Ripley, Dana's friend and literary editor of the ''Tribune''. In all, 67 Marx-Engels articles were published, of which 51 written by Engels, although Marx did some research for them in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1850s, American popular interest in European affairs waned and Marx's articles turned to topics such as the "slavery crisis" and the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, in the "War Between the States".&lt;ref&gt;Note 1 at page 367 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 19'' (International Publishers: New York, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;
Between December 1851 and March 1852, Marx worked on his theoretical work about the [[French Revolution of 1848]], titled  ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon" contained in the ''Collected Works of KarlMarx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 99–197.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he explored concepts in [[historical materialism]], [[class struggle]], [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], and victory of the proletariat over the [[bourgeois]] state.&lt;ref name="Marx2008"/&gt;

The 1850s and 1860s may be said to mark a philosophical boundary distinguishing the [[young Marx]]'s [[Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and the more [[mature Marx]]'s&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2000"/&gt; scientific ideology associated with [[structural Marxism]];&lt;ref name="Johnston2000"/&gt;  however, not all scholars accept this distinction.&lt;ref name="Hook1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GeorgeScanlan1975"/&gt; For Marx and Engels, their experience of the [[Revolutions of 1848]] to 1849 were formative in the development of their theory of economics and historical progression. After the "failures" of 1848, the revolutionary impetus appeared spent and not to be renewed without an economic recession. Contention arose between Marx and his fellow communists, whom he denounced as "adventurists". Marx deemed it fanciful to propose that "will power" could be sufficient to create the revolutionary conditions when in reality the economic component was the necessary requisite.

Recession in the United States' economy in 1852 gave Marx and Engels grounds for optimism for revolutionary activity. Yet, this economy was seen as too immature for a capitalist revolution. Open territories on America's western frontier dissipated the forces of social unrest. Moreover, any economic crisis arising in the United States would not lead to revolutionary contagion of the older economies of individual European nations, which were closed systems bounded by their national borders. When the so-called "[[Panic of 1857]]" in the United States spread globally, it broke all economic theory models,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first truly global economic crisis.

Financial necessity had forced Marx to abandon economic studies in 1844 and give thirteen years to working on other projects. He had always sought to return to economics.

===The First International and ''Capital''===

Marx continued to write articles for the ''New York Daily Tribune'' as long as he was sure that the ''Tribune's'' editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; No longer was the ''Tribune'' to be a strong [[abolitionist]] paper dedicated to a complete [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the ''Tribune.''&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, Marx became involved in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (also known as the First International),&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt; to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864.&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007-267"/&gt; In that organisation, Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876).&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.&lt;ref name="JessopWheatley1999-526"/&gt; The most important political event during the existence of the International was the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months. In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, "[[The Civil War in France]]", a defence of the Commune.&lt;ref name="Curtis1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Civil War in France" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 22'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 307–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand capitalism and spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the [[British Museum]] studying and reflecting on the works of [[political economy|political economists]] and on economic data.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20"/&gt; By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, [[landed property]], wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title ''[[Grundrisse|''Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy'']]''.&lt;ref name="Segrest2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 5–537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the Preparatory Materials section of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) pp. 421–507.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally in 1859, Marx published ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', pp. 257–417.&lt;/ref&gt; his first serious economic work. This work was intended merely as a preview of his three-volume ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (English title: ''Capital: Critique of Political Economy''), which he intended to publish at a later date. In ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', Marx expands on the [[labour theory of value]] advocated by [[David Ricardo]]. The work was enthusiastically received, and the edition sold out quickly.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl-Marx.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Marx in the 1870s]]

The successful sales of ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' stimulated Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life's work—''Das Kapital'' and the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', which discussed the theoreticians of political economy, particularly [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]].&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; ''Theories of Surplus Value'' is often referred to as the fourth volume of ''Das Kapital'' and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the [[history of economic thought]].&lt;ref name="Rockmore2002"/&gt; In 1867, the first volume of ''Das Kapital'' was published, a work which analysed the capitalist process of production.&lt;ref name="BrewerMarx1984-15"/&gt; Here Marx elaborated his [[labour theory of value]], which had been influenced by [[Thomas Hodgskin]]. Marx acknowledged Hodgskin's "admirable work" ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' at more than one point in ''Capital.''&lt;ref&gt;See footnote #2 on the bottom of page 360 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35''.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production. No longer was there any "natural reward of individual labour. Each labourer produces only some part of a whole, and each part having no value or utility of itself, there is nothing on which the labourer can seize, and say: 'This is my product, this will I keep to myself'".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hodgskin, ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' (London, 1825) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first volume of ''Capital'', Marx outlined his conception of [[surplus value]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Demand for a Russian language edition of ''Capital'' soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German language edition of ''Capital'' had been sold out and a second edition was published.

Volumes II and III of ''Capital'' remained mere manuscripts upon which Marx continued to work for the rest of his life. Both volumes were published by Engels after Marx's death.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; Volume II of ''Capital'' was prepared and published by Engels in July 1893 under the name ''Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital" embodying the whole volume of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 36'' (International Publishers: New York, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Volume III of ''Capital'' was published a year later in October 1894 under the name ''Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole" embodying the whole volume of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theories of Surplus Value'' derived from the sprawling ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861-1863'', a ''second'' draft for ''Capital'', the latter spanning volumes 30-34 of the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels''.  Specifically, ''Theories of Surplus Value'' runs from the latter part of the ''Collected Works' '' thirtieth volume through the end of their thirty-second volume;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30'' (International Publishers: New York, 1988) pp. 318–451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) pp. 5–580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 32'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) pp. 5–543.&lt;/ref&gt; meanwhile, the larger ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861-1863'' run from the start of the ''Collected Works' '' thirtieth volume through the first half of their thirty-fourth volume.  The latter half of the Collected Works' thirty-fourth volume consists of the surviving fragments of the ''Economic Manuscripts of 1863-1864'', which represented a ''third'' draft for Capital, and a large portion of which is included as an appendix to the Penguin edition of ''Capital'', volume I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/introduction.htm |title=Economic Works of Karl Marx 1861-1864 |website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German language abridged edition of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London, but the complete unabridged edition of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was published as the "fourth volume" of ''Capital'' in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;See note 228 on page 475 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marx old.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx in 1882]]

During the last decade of his life, Marx's health declined and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' opposed the tendency of his followers [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and [[August Bebel]] to compromise with the [[state socialism]] of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] in the interests of a united socialist party.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; This work is also notable for another famous Marx quote: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref name="CGP P1"/&gt;

In a letter to [[Vera Zasulich]] dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village ''[[mir (social)|mir]]''.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works Volume 46'' (International Publishers: New York, 1992) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; While admitting that Russia's rural "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides".&lt;ref name="k72"/&gt; Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that "normal conditions of spontaneous development" of the rural commune could exist.&lt;ref name=k72/&gt; However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that "at the core of the capitalist system&amp;nbsp;... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production".&lt;ref name=k72/&gt; In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation". He added that "the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, ''etc''. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies".&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, First draft of letter to Vera Zasulich [1881]. In Marx-Engels 'Collected Works', Volume 24, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''.

==Personal life==

===Family===
[[File:Jenny laura marx.jpg|thumb|upright|Jenny Carolina and Jenny Laura Marx (1869): all the Marx daughters were named Jenny in honour of their mother, Jenny von Westphalen.]]

Marx and von Westphalen had seven children together, but partly owing to the poor conditions in which they lived whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer (2000).'' Marx a very short introduction''. p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-285405-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children were: [[Jenny Longuet|Jenny Caroline]] (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); [[Laura Marx|Jenny Laura]] (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy ("Guido"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances ("Franziska"; 1851–1852); [[Eleanor Marx|Jenny Julia Eleanor]] (1855–1898) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy,&lt;ref name=Montefiore&gt;{{cite news |last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|title=The Means of Reproduction|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/love-and-capital-by-mary-gabriel-book-review.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of wedlock by his housekeeper, [[Helene Demuth]].&lt;ref name="Karl Marx"/&gt;

Marx frequently used pseudonyms, often when renting a house or flat, apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down. While in Paris, he used that of "Monsieur Ramboz", whilst in London he signed off his letters as "A. Williams". His friends referred to him as "Moor", owing to his dark complexion and black curly hair, while he encouraged his children to call him "Old Nick" and "Charley".&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 152"/&gt; He also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on his friends and family as well, referring to Friedrich Engels as "General", his housekeeper Helene as "Lenchen" or "Nym", while one of his daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as "Qui Qui, [[Emperor of China]]" and another, Laura, was known as "[[Cockatoo|Kakadou]]" or "the [[Khoikhoi|Hottentot]]".&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 152"/&gt;

===Health===
Marx was afflicted by poor health (what he himself described as "the wretchedness of existence")&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and various authors have sought to describe and explain it. His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterwards free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics. The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, "none of which are good for liver patients", but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount "and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars". From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: "These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes".&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The illness emphasised certain traits in his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind faith in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Princeton historian J.E. Seigel, in his late teens Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on ''Capital'' (which he never completed),&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 98; Siegel, 494.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, bad diet and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, "was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Marx's style of life — alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep — all contributed. Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime". In Professor Siegel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, 495-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a [[retrodiagnosis]] of Marx's skin disease was made by [[dermatologist]] Sam Shuster of [[Newcastle University]] and for Shuster the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from [[hidradenitis suppurativa]], a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of [[apocrine]] ducts opening into [[hair follicles]]. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions. To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the ''Marx/Engels Collected Works''. There, "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncules', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, [[perianal]], [[genital]] ([[Human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]]) and [[suprapubic]] regions and inner thighs, "favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa". Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis "can now be made definitively".&lt;ref&gt;Shuster, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuster went on to consider the potential [[psychosocial]] effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood and well-being, feelings for which Shuster found "much evidence" in the Marx correspondence. Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx's work and even helped him to develop [[Marx's theory of alienation|his theory of alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;Shuster, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|[[Tomb of Karl Marx]], East [[Highgate Cemetery]], London]]

Following the death of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx developed a [[catarrh]] that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the [[bronchitis]] and [[pleurisy]] that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a [[Statelessness|stateless person]].&lt;ref name="stateless"/&gt; Family and friends in London buried his body in [[Highgate Cemetery]] (East), London, on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists ([[George Eliot]]'s grave is nearby). There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&amp;pg=PA382 p. 382].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt;

Several of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and Friedrich Engels. Engels' speech included the passage: {{quote|On the 14th&amp;nbsp;of March, at a quarter to three in the afternoon, the greatest living thinker ceased to think. He had been left alone for scarcely two minutes, and when we came back we found him in his armchair, peacefully gone to sleep—but forever.&lt;ref name="1883: The death of Karl Marx"/&gt;}}

Marx's surviving daughters [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]] and [[Laura Marx|Laura]], as well as [[Charles Longuet]] and [[Paul Lafargue]], Marx's two French socialist sons-in-law, were also in attendance.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; He had been predeceased by his wife and his eldest daughter, the latter dying a few months earlier in January 1883. Liebknecht, a founder and leader of the German Social Democratic Party, gave a speech in German and Longuet, a prominent figure in the French working-class movement, made a short statement in French.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Two [[telegram]]s from workers' parties in France and Spain were also read out.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Together with Engels's speech, this constituted the entire programme of the funeral.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Non-relatives attending the funeral included three communist associates of Marx: Friedrich Lessner, imprisoned for three years after the Cologne communist trial of 1852; G. Lochner, whom Engels described as "an old member of the Communist League"; and [[Carl Schorlemmer]], a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and a communist activist involved in the 1848 [[Revolution in Baden|Baden revolution]].&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Another attendee of the funeral was [[Ray Lankester]], a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt;

Upon his own death in 1895, Engels left Marx's two surviving daughters a "significant portion" of his considerable estate (valued in 2011 at US$4.8m).&lt;ref name=Montefiore /&gt;

The Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] remarked: "One cannot say Marx died a failure" because although he had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, his writings had already begun to make an impact on the leftist movements in Germany and Russia. Within 25 years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Marx's influence on their politics were each gaining between 15 and 47 per cent in those countries with [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] elections.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hob11|Hobsbawm 2011]]. pp. 03–04.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
{{Main article|Influences on Karl Marx}}
Marx's thought demonstrates influences from many thinkers including, but not limited to:
* [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus']] philosophy, including the forceful and equal redistribution of resources (land) and the equality of all citizens&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html Biography of Lycurgus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophy&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;
* The classical [[political economy]] (economics) of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt;, as well as [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]'s critique of laissez-faire economics and analysis of the precarious state of the proletariat&lt;ref name="Paresh" /&gt;
* [[History of the Left in France|French socialist thought]],&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; in particular the thought of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]&lt;ref name="Beilharz1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;
* Earlier German philosophical materialism among the [[Young Hegelians]], particularly that of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]],&lt;ref name=et/&gt; as well as the French materialism of the late 18th century, including [[Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and [[d'Holbach]]
* The working class analysis by [[Friedrich Engels]],&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt; as well as the early descriptions of class provided by French liberals and Saint-Simonians such as [[François Guizot]] and [[Augustin Thierry]]
* Marx's Judaic legacy has been identified as formative to both his moral outlook&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry ''Why Marx Was Right''  Yale University Press, 2011, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; and his materialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, Jerrold  ''Marx's Fate'' Princeton University Press, 1978, pp.  112–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's view of history, which came to be called [[historical materialism]] (controversially adapted as the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]] by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) [[dialectic]]ally.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; However, Hegel had thought in [[idealist]] terms, putting ideas in the forefront, whereas Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in [[materialist]] terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Where Hegel saw the "spirit" as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Despite his dislike of mystical terms, Marx used [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] language in several of his works: in ''The Communist Manifesto'' he proclaims "A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre", and in ''The Capital'' he refers to capital as "[[necromancy]] that surrounds the products of labour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf|author=Mark Neocleous|title=THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEAD: MARX's VAMPIRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought,&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; Marx criticised [[utopian socialists]], arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the [[economic system]] can bring about real change.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

The other important contributions to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of [[class conflict]] and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt;, as well as from the social democrat [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz]], who in ''Die Bewegung der Produktion'' described the movement of society as "flowing from the contradiction between the forces of production and the mode of production."&lt;ref name="Levine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that he could study history and society scientifically and discern tendencies of history and the resulting outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Marx therefore concluded that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]" that "philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it" and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wh1"/&gt;

===Philosophy and social thought===
Marx's polemic with other thinkers often occurred through [[critique]] and thus he has been called "the first great user of [[critical method]] in social sciences".&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; He criticised speculative philosophy, equating [[metaphysics]] with ideology.&lt;ref name="Bannerji2001"/&gt; By adopting this approach, Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases.&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; This set him apart from many contemporary philosophers.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;

Instead, Marx set out to analyse "the despotism of capital".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx. ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy'', vol. 1, trans. Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling (New York: Modem Library, 1906), 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally, Marx assumed that [[human history]] involves transforming [[human nature]], which encompasses both human beings and material objects.&lt;ref name="Ollman1973"/&gt; Humans recognise that they possess both actual and potential selves.&lt;ref name = "Marx_labour"&gt;Marx K (1999).

Original work published 1844.&lt;/ref&gt; For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] agent, renders its potential counterpart an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] to be apprehended.&lt;ref name = "Marx_critique"/&gt; Marx further argues that by moulding nature&lt;ref name = "Lefever"&gt;See also Lefever DM; Lefever JT (1977).

Marx had a special concern with how people relate to their own labour power.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].&lt;ref name="Mészáros2006"/&gt; As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; Marx described this loss as [[commodity fetishism]], in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.&lt;ref name="Balibar1995"/&gt;

[[Commodity fetishism]] provides an example of what Engels called "[[false consciousness]]",&lt;ref name="KołakowskiFalla2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Leszek Kołakowski|author2=Paul Stephen Falla|title=Main currents of Marxism: the founders, the golden age, the breakdown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUCxpznbkaoC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=29 October 2005|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-06054-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By "ideology", Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal.&lt;ref name="Hernadi1989"/&gt; Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths, as they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods, but also the production of ideas (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests).&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson1990"/&gt; An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm Introduction] to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, in: ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'', February 1844&lt;/ref&gt; to his 1843 ''Contribution to the [[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'': {{quote|Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering.

To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.&lt;ref name="MarxO'Malley1977"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Whereas his [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] senior thesis at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Trier)|de|3=Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Trier)|lt=Gymnasium zu Trier}} argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic ''status quo'' and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref name="SwatosKivisto1998"/&gt;

====Economy, history and society====
{{further information|Marxian economics}}
[[File:Murales Rivera - Treppenhaus 7 Marx.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Diego Rivera]] showing Karl Marx. In the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in [[Mexico City]].]]
Marx's thoughts on labour were related to the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also [[economic determinism]]).&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; [[Accumulation of capital]] shapes the [[social system]].&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; For Marx, [[social change]] was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; In his [[sociocultural evolution|evolutionary]] model of history, he argued that [[human history]] began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

The organisation of society depends on [[means of production]]. The means of production are all things required to produce material goods, such as land, natural resources and technology but not human labor.  The [[relations of production]] are the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Together, these compose the [[mode of production]] and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of modes of production. Marx differentiated between [[base and superstructure]], where the base (or substructure) is the economic system and superstructure is the cultural and political system.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Marx regarded this mismatch between economic base and social [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] as a major source of social disruption and conflict.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;

Despite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new [[communist society]] that should replace it, his explicit critique is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones ([[slavery]] and [[feudalism]]).&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Marx never clearly discusses issues of [[morality]] and [[justice]], but scholars agree that his work contained [[Logical implication|implicit]] discussion of those concepts.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;
[[File:Karl Marx - Moscow - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Karl Marx in Moscow, whose inscription reads: "[[Workers of the world, unite!|Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]"]]

Marx's view of capitalism was two-sided.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt; On one hand, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system he noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical [[economic depressions|depressions]] leading to mass unemployment. On the other hand, he characterized capitalism as "revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity" (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, [[technological progress]], increased [[productivity]] and growth, [[rationality]] and [[scientific revolution]]) that are responsible for progress.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of [[feudalism]].&lt;ref name="Clark1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010" /&gt; Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and [[capital equipment]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt;

According to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference "[[surplus value]]" and argued that it was based on [[surplus labour]], the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Although Marx describes capitalists as [[vampire]]s sucking worker's blood,&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; he notes that drawing profit is "by no means an injustice"&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; and that capitalists cannot go against the system.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; The problem is the "cancerous cell" of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

At the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable and prone to [[crisis theory|periodic crises]].&lt;ref name=wk/&gt; He suggested that over time capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies and less and less in labour.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Since Marx believed that profit derived from surplus value appropriated from labour, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall as the economy grows.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this [[business cycles|cycle]] of growth and collapse.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would enrich and [[empowerment|empower]] the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; In section one of ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx describes [[feudalism]], capitalism and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:
{{quote|We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged&amp;nbsp;... the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class. A similar movement is going on before our own eyes&amp;nbsp;... The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring order into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[File:MandK Industrial Revolution 1900.jpg|thumb|Outside a factory in [[Oldham]]. Marx believed that industrial workers (the [[proletariat]]) would rise up around the world.]]

Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:
{{quote|The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.&lt;ref name="manifesto"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop [[class consciousness]], in time realising that they can and must change the system.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx argued in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: {{quote|Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.&lt;ref name="Elster1985"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In this new society, the alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by the labour market.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; In such a [[utopia]]n world, there would also be little need for a state, whose goal was previously to enforce the alienation.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Marx theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, would exist a period of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; As he wrote in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', "between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;ref name="Karl Marx:Critique of the Gotha Programme"/&gt; While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries in which workers cannot "attain their goal by peaceful means" the "lever of our revolution must be force".&lt;ref&gt;"You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries – such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland – where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means. This being the case, we must also recognise the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labour."

Marx and Engels published in the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' in February 1849:

{{quote|To the sentimental phrases about brotherhood which we are being offered here on behalf of the most counter-revolutionary nations of Europe, we reply that hatred of Russians was and still is the primary revolutionary passion among Germans; that since the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolution]] [of 1848] hatred of Czechs and Croats has been added, and that only by the most determined use of terror against these Slav peoples can we, jointly with the Poles and Magyars, safeguard the revolution. We know where the enemies of the revolution are concentrated, ''viz''. in Russia and the Slav regions of Austria, and no fine phrases, no allusions to an undefined democratic future for these countries can deter us from treating our enemies as enemies.

Marx and Engels sympathised with the [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] revolutionaries of the 1860s and 1870s. When the [[Narodnaya Volya|Russian revolutionaries]] assassinated Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], Marx expressed the hope that the assassination foreshadowed ‘the formation of a Russian commune’.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to the Chairman of the Slavonic Meeting, 21 March 1881. Source: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Selected Correspondence'' (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Marx supported the [[Polish–Russian Wars|Polish uprisings]] against tsarist Russia.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; He said in a speech in London in 1867:

{{quote|In the first place the policy of Russia is changeless... Its methods, its tactics, its manoeuvres may change, but the polar star of its policy – world domination – is a fixed star. In our times only a civilised government ruling over barbarian masses can hatch out such a plan and execute it. ... There is but one alternative for Europe. Either Asiatic barbarism, under Muscovite direction, will burst around its head like an avalanche, or else it must re-establish Poland, thus putting twenty million heroes between itself and Asia and gaining a breathing spell for the accomplishment of its social regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Speech delivered in London, probably to a meeting of the International’s General Council and the Polish Workers Society on 22 January 1867, text published in ''Le Socialisme'', 15 March 1908; ''Odbudowa Polski'' (Warsaw, 1910), pp. 119–23; ''Mysl Socjalistyczna'', May 1908.

Marx supported the cause of [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish independence]]&lt;!--The quote shows he meant more than Home Rule. He also seemed to be confusing England and Great Britain.--&gt;. In 1867, he wrote Engels: "I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable. The English working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid of Ireland. ... English reaction in England had its roots ... in the subjugation of Ireland."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/01/archives/karl-marx-and-the-irish.html Karl Marx and the Irish]". ''The New York Times.'' December 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx spent some time in [[French Algeria]], which had been [[French conquest of Algeria|invaded]] and made a [[French colonial empire |French colony]] in 1830, and had opportunity to observe life in colonial North Africa. He wrote about the colonial justice system, in which "a form of torture has been used (and this happens ‘regularly’) to extract confessions from the Arabs; naturally it is done (like the English in India) by the ‘police’; the judge is supposed to know nothing at all about it."&lt;ref name="alahram"/&gt; Marx was surprised by the arrogance of many [[Pied-Noir|European settlers]] in Algiers and wrote in a letter: "when a European colonist dwells among the ‘lesser breeds,’ either as a settler or even on business, he generally regards himself as even more inviolable than handsome William I [a Prussian king]. Still, when it comes to bare-faced arrogance and presumptuousness vis-à-vis the ‘lesser breeds,’ the British and Dutch outdo the French."&lt;ref name="alahram"/&gt; 

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'': "Marx’s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing modernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent rationalization for foreign domination. His account of British domination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows towards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the immense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to bourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both necessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration of foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colonialism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marx discussed [[British Empire|British]] [[British Raj|colonial rule]] in [[Colonial India|India]] in the ''New York Herald Tribune'' in June 1853: 

{{quote|There cannot remain any doubt but that the misery inflicted by the British on Hindostan [India] is of an essentially different and infinitely more intensive kind than all Hindostan had to suffer before. England has broken down the entire framework of Indian society, without any symptoms of reconstitution yet appearing... [however], we must not forget that these idyllic village communities, inoffensive though they may appear, had always been the solid foundation of Oriental despotism, that they restrained the human mind within the smallest possible compass, making it the unresisting tool of superstition.&lt;ref name="alahram"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marx in Algiers |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/24784.aspx |work=Al-Ahram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marx on India under the British |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/marx-on-india-under-the-british/article3209143.ece |work=The Hindu |date=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Marx's ideas have had a profound impact on world politics and intellectual thought.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, Francis (17 July 2005). [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,1530250,00.html "Why Marx is man of the moment"]. ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan2010"/&gt; Followers of Marx have often debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world.&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt; The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include [[Leninism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Trotskyism]], [[Maoism]], [[Luxemburgism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]].&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt; Various currents have also developed in [[Marxism#Academic Marxism|academic Marxism]], often under influence of other views, resulting in [[structuralist Marxism]], historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, [[analytical Marxism]] and Hegelian Marxism.&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt;

From an academic perspective, Marx's work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the 19th century's three masters of the "school of suspicion" alongside [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Ricoeur, Paul. ''Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1970, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of the three principal architects of modern [[social science]] along with [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt; Both Marx and [[Auguste Comte]] set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European [[secularisation]] and new developments in the [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]] and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean [[sociological positivism]] in attempt to develop a ''science of society''.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-19"/&gt; [[Karl Löwith]] considered Marx and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors.&lt;ref&gt;Löwith, Karl. ''From Hegel to Nietzsche''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1991, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[sociological theory]], [[Marxist sociology]] is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives. [[Isaiah Berlin]] considers Marx the true founder of modern sociology "in so far as anyone can claim the title".&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah. 1967. ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment''. Time Inc Book Division, New York. pp130&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond social science, he has also had a lasting legacy in philosophy, literature, the arts and the humanities.&lt;ref name="Singer 1980. p. 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridget O'Laughlin (1975) ''Marxist Approaches in Anthropology'', ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' Vol. 4: pp. 341–70 (October 1975) {{doi|10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.002013}}.&lt;br /&gt;William Roseberry (1997) ''Marx and Anthropology'' Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 26: pp. 25–46 (October 1997) {{doi|10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = S.

Social theorists of the 20th and 21st centuries have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx. One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as analytical Marxism. Another, more common, move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and emphasise the "relative autonomy" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the "forces of production" and the succession of "modes of production". Such has been for example the neo-Marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory, such as [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like [[Antonio Gramsci]] who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kołakowski, Leszek.

''Marxism and the History of Art: From William Morris to the New Left.'' Pluto Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Marx's legacy is more complex. Throughout the 20th century, revolutions in dozens of countries labelled themselves "Marxist"{{mdash}}most notably the [[Russian Revolution]], which led to the founding of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="April Thesis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenin|first1=VI|title=The Tasks of the Proletariat in the Present Revolution|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/04.htm|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major world leaders including [[Vladimir Lenin]],&lt;ref name="April Thesis" /&gt; [[Mao Zedong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of People – Ma|url=https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/m/a.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fidel Castro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savioli|first1=Arminio|title=L'Unita Interview with Fidel Castro:  The Nature of Cuban Socialism|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/cuba/archive/castro/1961/02/01.htm|publisher=Marxists|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Allende]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allende|first1=Salvador|title=First speech to the Chilean parliament after his election|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/allende/1970/september/20.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josip Broz Tito]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tito|first1=Josef|title=Historical Development in the World Will Move Towards the Strengthening of Socialism|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/tito/1959/04/19.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kwame Nkrumah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkrumah|first1=Kwame|title=African Socialism Revisited|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nkrumah/1967/african-socialism-revisited.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jawaharlal Nehru]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/nehrus-economic-philosophy/article18589548.ece Nehru’s economic philosophy ]".

Two centuries after his birth Marx remains both controversial and relevant, as the unveiling of a 4.5m statue of him (given by China, sculpted by [[Wu Weishan]]) in his birthplace of [[Trier, Germany]] in 2018 demonstrates. &lt;ref name="Trier Statue"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44009621 |title=Karl Marx statue from China adds to German angst |date=5 May 2018 |access-date=5 May 2018|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 a feature film, ''[[The Young Karl Marx]]'', featuring Marx, his wife [[Jenny Marx]], and his collaborator Friedrich Engels, among other revolutionaries and intellectuals prior to the [[revolutions of 1848]] received good reviews both for its historical accuracy and its brio in treating the intellectual life. &lt;ref name="Review: In ‘The Young Karl Marx,’ a Scruffy Specter Haunts Europe"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/movies/the-young-karl-marx-review.html |title=Review: In 'The Young Karl Marx,' a Scruffy Specter Haunts Europe |last=Scott |first=A.O. |date=22 February 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list includes both authors whose entire literary production was officially banned in [[Nazi Germany]] and authors who were only partially banned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://verbrannte-und-verbannte.de/person?person=all&amp;sort=name%3Aasc  ''Verbrannte und verbannte'']&lt;/ref&gt; These authors are from the prohibitions lists in Nazi Germany and come from the following lists and others:
# List of damaging and undesirable writing, ''Liste des schädlichen und unerwünschten Schrifttums'', December 31, 1938
# ''Jahreslisten 1939-1941''. Unchanged new printing of the Leipzig edition, 1938-1941, Vaduz 1979

The official list was published by the ''[[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda]]''. Authors, living and dead, were placed on the list because of [[Judaism|Jewish]] descent, or because of [[pacifism|pacifist]] or [[communism|communist]] sympathies or suspicion thereof. 

In May and June 1933, in the first year of the Nazi government, there were [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]]s. These book bans compose a part of the history of [[censorship]] and a subset of the [[list of banned books]].

After [[World War II]] started, Germans created indexes of prohibited books in countries they occupied, of works in languages other than German. For example, in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]], an index of 1,500 prohibited authors was created.&lt;ref&gt;Czesław Madajczyk, ''Polityka III Rzeszy w okupowanej Polsce, Tom II'' (Politics of the Third Reich in Occupied Poland, Part Two), Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1970, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Madonna with the Long Neck''''' ({{lang-it|Madonna dal collo lungo}}), also known as '''''Madonna and Child with Angels and St. Jerome''''', is an [[Italian Renaissance|Italian]] [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] oil painting by  [[Parmigianino]], dating from c. 1535-1540 and depicting [[Madonna and Child]] with [[angel]]s. The painting was begun in 1534 for the funerary chapel of Francesco Tagliaferri&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-www.oxfordartonline.com.helin.uri.edu/subscriber/article/grove/art/T065539?q=Madonna+of+the+long+neck&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1|title=Parmigianino [Mazzola, Girolamo Francesco Maria]|website=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|last1=Eskerdjan|first1=David|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Parma]], but remained incomplete on Parmigianino's death in 1540. [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]], purchased it in 1698 and it has been on display at the [[Uffizi]] since 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualuffizi.com/uffizi1/Uffizi_Pictures.asp?Contatore=324 Virtual Uffizi]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The painting depicts the [[Virgin Mary]] seated on a high pedestal in luxurious robes, holding a rather large baby [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] on her lap. 
Six angels crowded together on the Madonna's right adore the Christ-child. 

In the lower right-hand corner of the painting is an enigmatic scene, with a row of marble columns and the emaciated figure of [[St. Jerome]]. A depiction of St. Jerome was required by the commissioner because of the saint's connection with the adoration of the Virgin Mary. 

The painting is popularly called ''Madonna of the Long Neck'' because "the painter, in his eagerness to make the Holy Virgin look graceful and elegant, has given her a neck like that of a swan."&lt;ref name=Gombrich&gt;''The Story of Art'', E.H. Gombrich. 1950&lt;/ref&gt; On the unusual arrangement of figures, Austrian-British art historian [[E. H. Gombrich]] writes:

{{quote|Instead of distributing his figures in equal pairs on both sides of the Madonna, he crammed a jostling crowd of angels into a narrow corner, and left the other side wide open to show the tall figure of the prophet, so reduced in size through the distance that he hardly reaches the Madonna's knee. There can be no doubt, then, that if this be madness there is method in it. The painter wanted to be unorthodox. He wanted to show that the classical solution of perfect harmony is not the only solution conceivable ... Parmigianino and all the artists of his time who deliberately sought to create something new and unexpected, even at the expense of the 'natural' beauty established by the great masters, were perhaps the first 'modern' artists.&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt;}}

Parmigianino has distorted nature for his own artistic purposes, creating a typical [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] [[figura serpentinata]]. Jesus is also extremely large for a baby, and he lies precariously on Mary's lap as if about to fall at any moment. The Madonna herself is of hardly human proportions—she is almost twice the size of the angels to her right.&lt;ref name=Hundred&gt;''100 Masterpieces'', Hamlyn Publishing, 1986. {{ISBN|0-86136-692-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her right foot rests on cushions that appear to be only a few inches away from the [[picture plane]], but the foot itself seems to project beyond it, and is thus on "our" side of the canvas, breaking the conventions of a framed picture.&lt;ref name=Hundred/&gt; Her slender hands and long fingers have also led the Italian medical scientist Vito Franco of the [[University of Palermo]] to diagnose that Parmigianino's model had the genetic disorder [[Marfan syndrome]] affecting her connective tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/05/leonardo-da-vinci-mona-lisa|publisher=The Guardian|date=6 January 2010|first=John|last=Hooper|title=Enigmatic smile of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa a sign of ill health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www3.lastampa.it/arte/sezioni/news/articolo/lstp/111992/|title=Il colesterolo di Monna Lisa|first=Laura|last=Anello|date=5 January 2010|publisher=''[[La Stampa]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a recent restoration of the painting, the unfinished face of an angel just below the Madonna's right elbow can be seen more clearly. Also the angel in the middle of the bottom row now looks at the vase held by the angel on his right, in which can be seen the faint image of a cross. Before the restoration this angel looked down at the Christ child. The changes made during the restoration likely reflect the original painting, which must have been altered at some time in its history. The angel who faces the viewer has a resemblance to Parmigianino's ''[[Antea (Parmigianino)|Antea]]'' portrait.

'''Paulette de Vere McDonagh''' (1901–1978), was an Australian film director, who often worked in collaboration with her sisters [[Phyllis McDonagh|Phyllis]] and [[Marie Lorraine|Isabella]]. In 1933 it was claimed she was one of only five female film directors in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48203190 |title=PRIVATE VIEWS. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=28 October 1933 |accessdate=28 March 2012 |page=32 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one stage they had offers to go to Hollywood. "Fox Films offered to send us," said [[Phyllis McDonagh]], "But we were sensible girls. We sat down and talked and decided we would end up very small fish in a big pond. At home we had work and a reputation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48566044 |title=WHEN THREE DASHING SISTERS MADE A MOVIE. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=21 April 1971 |accessdate=28 March 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Paulette McDangh was born on 11 June 1901 in Sydney and one of seven children born to Annie Jane (Anita) Amora and John Michael McDonagh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Joan|date=June 1976|title='The Two of Us, the Camera and Three Little Legs' Part One of a Historian Survey of Women in Australian Film Production|url=|journal=Cinema Papers|volume=|issue=9|pages=34–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was educated at the Catholic [[Kincoppal School]] in Rose Bay, Sydney.

She collaborated alongside her sisters Isabel and [[Phyllis McDonagh|Phyllis]] to create and produce films.  They were business partners, working together in the Australian film industry during the 1920s and 1930s.  Paulette, was the youngest, and known to be the writer and director of their films while Phyllis acted as publisher and promoter, and Isabel was the star actress. Growing up in a bohemian and wealthy family, their home was a lavish back drop for most of their films, filled with antique furniture and rich colors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The McDonagh Sisters – Women Film Pioneers Project|url = https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-the-mcdonagh-sisters/|website = wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first silent film, ''Those Who Love'' (1926), was funded privately by their family.  Paulette took over the position of directing the screenplay when creative differences with [[P.J. Ramster]] broke out.  The sisters' risk taking attempt at film making paid off when the publication, ''Everyone's'', gave them a rave review,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The result is a dazzling triumph and which is said to be the best Australian film that has yet graced the screen. A Sydney girl whose histrionic ability is remarkable. Her splendid performance ranks with some of the best characterizations ever given to the screen by the world’s greatest stars.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the wake of the financial success of ''Those Who Love'', the McDonagh sisters followed up with further silent films including ''[[The Far Paradise]]'' (1928), and ''[[The Cheaters (1930 film)|The Cheaters]]'' (1930).

''The Far Paradise'' was a box office hit and acclaimed for its fine art techniques that were influenced not just by Australian film, but also Hollywood melodrama and German expressionism.

The melodramatic influences allowed for overacting on Isabel’s part while Phyllis and Paulette were able to create longer screen time for her to perform on her own. Isabel acted as a more interesting heroine than was common in most films of its time. Paulette the director had Isabel acting in different situations such as breaking and entering, cracking safes, and even in the arms of a lover.  During this time period it was outside of the norm to show a woman on screen performing such roles, but this gave their silent films depth and a following of a greater and more appreciative crowd.

Despite their small budget, the sisters, and especially Paulette, were able to create society melodramas involving romance, sacrifice, and parental opposition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = McDonagh, Paulette de Vere (1901–1978)|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcdonagh-paulette-de-vere-7792|publisher = National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location = Canberra|first = Andrée|last = Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
When Isabel and Phyllis retired from the film industry for various reasons, Paulette found it difficult to continue her work alone despite her efforts to persevere. In 1934 she took a job to work on a romantic epic based on the life of the Reverend John Flynn. With a budgetary shortfall and having no one to act or produce the film, Paulette was forced to drop the job.

With her film career ending, she continued to live with her younger siblings. Paulette died in Sydney on 30 August 1978.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The high visibility of the star cluster [[Pleiades]] in the [[night sky]] has guaranteed it a special place in many cultures, both ancient and modern. The [[heliacal rising]] of Pleiades often marks important calendar points for ancient peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Brad Schaefer (Yale University). ''Heliacal Rising: Definitions, Calculations, and some Specific Cases'' (''Essays'' from Archaeoastronomy &amp; Ethnoastronomy News, the Quarterly Bulletin of the Center for Archaeoastronomy, Number 25.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== North Africa ==

=== Berber people ===
The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg Berbers]] living in the desert of North Africa call the Pleiades '''Cat iheḍ''' (pronounced: ''shat ihedd''), or '''Cat ahăḍ''' (pronounced: ''shat ahadd''). The name means in [[Berber language|Berber]]: "daughters of the night". Other Berbers call this star cluster: '''Amanar''' (meaning: "the guide") or '''Tagemmunt''' (meaning: "the group").{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A Tuareg Berber proverb says:

''Cat ahăḍ as uḍănăt, ttukayeɣ ttegmyeɣ, anwar daɣ ttsasseɣ. As d-gmaḍent, ttukayeɣ ttegmyeɣ tabruq ttelseɣ.''

Translation: When the Pleiades fall, I wake up looking for my goatskin bag to drink. When (the Pleiades) rise, I wake up looking for a cloth to wear.

Meaning: When the Pleiades "fall" with the sun on the west, it means the hot season is coming, which implies the heat and the thirst of the summer. When the Pleiades rise from the east with the sun, it means the cold and rainy season is coming, and thus one does well to prepare for the cold.&lt;ref&gt;Étoiles et constellations chez les nomades, Edmond Bernus &amp; Ehya ag-Sidiyene, Awal magazine, 1989, Édition de la maison des sciences de l'homme, Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_20-21/27329.pdf Étoiles et constellations chez les nomades, Edmond Bernus &amp; Ehya ag-Sidiyene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6btoFb1gzwsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Essai sur les origines des Touaregs]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle East ==

=== Bible ===

In the [[Bible]], the Pleiades are mentioned as כימה ("Khima") three times, always in conjunction with [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]—Amos 5:8; Job 9:9; and Job 38:31. The first two verses are references about their creation, but the third (taken in the context of the following verses) may be more about their ongoing appearance in the night sky. In Job 38:31, the Lord is speaking directly to Job and challenges him, asking if he can bind the chains of the Pleiades—the implication being that Job cannot, but the Lord can. [[Talmud]] ([http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8:%D7%91%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%A3_%D7%A0%D7%97 Bavli, Berakhot, 58b]) says that it has about 100 stars, understanding the word כימה as כמאה ''ke' me-ah,'' "about one hundred" in Hebrew.

They are known as [[Biblical cosmology|kimah]] in Jewish culture.

Like most other astronomical findings in the Talmud, rabbinic tradition claims to have gotten such knowledge from Moses when he descended down from [[Mount Sinai]], and hence, from God Himself.

Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki ("[[Rashi]]", 1040-1105), suggested that there were even more stars within the Pleiades Cluster when he expanded on the Talmud's question, "What is meant by Kimah?” which is understood by the modern Orthodox community to mean that there are more than a hundred stars. Therefore, Rashi was saying that the passage in the Talmud only mentioned the most important stars, this numbering to about a hundred, while leaving out the less important ones (which could be hundreds more).

Amazingly, the [[Pleiades]] are at max, 500 light years away, and here were the rabbis, commenting on the number of stars where other cultures could only detect 6-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hidabrut.com/article/171581/The-Pleiades-Star-Cluster|title=The Pleiades Star Cluster|access-date=2017-05-21|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabia and the Levant ===

In [[Arabic]] the Pleiades are known as ''al-Thurayya'' الثريا, and mentioned in Islamic literature. Muhammad is noted to have counted twelve stars in the constellation as reported in [[Ibn Ishaq]] (this was in the time before telescopes when most could only see six).
The name was borrowed into [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as a female given name, and is in use throughout the [[Middle East]] (for example [[Princess Soraya of Iran]] and [[Thoraya Obaid]]). It is also the name of the [[Thuraya]] satellite phone system based in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

[[Muhammad]] made mention of the [[Pleiades]]. A [[Hadith]] recalled by Imam [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], states:

{{quote|A companion of The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) relates: One day we were sitting with The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when this chapter*&lt;ref name="alislam.org"&gt;http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=1135&amp;region=EN&lt;/ref&gt; was revealed. I enquired from Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Who are the people to whom the words "and among others of them who have not yet joined them"** refer? Salman (may Allah be pleased with him), a Persian was sitting among us. The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put his hand on Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) and said. If faith were to go up to the Pleiades, a man from among these would surely find it. ([[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/topics/messiah/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''*The chapter talked about above is Chapter 62&lt;ref name="alislam.org"/&gt; - Surah Al-Jummah&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=1136&amp;region=EN&lt;/ref&gt; - from the [[Qur'an]].''

''**The verse quoted here is verse 3 from the aforementioned chapter.''

=== Turkey ===

In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] the Pleiades are known as ''Ülker''. According to the [[Middle Turkic]] lexicographer [[Kaşgarlı Mahmud]], writing in the 11th century, ''ülker çerig'' refers to a military [[ambush]] (''çerig'' meaning 'troops in battle formation'): "The army is broken up into detachments posted in various places," and when one detachment falls back the others follow after it, and by this device "(the enemy) is often routed." Thus ''ülker çerig'' literally means 'an army made up of a group of detachments', which forms an apt [[simile]] for a star cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clauson|first=Gerard|title=An Etymological Dictionary of Pre-Thirteenth-Century Turkish|date=1972|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=143|authorlink=Gerard Clauson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ülker is also a unisex given name, a surname and the name of [[Ülker|a food company]] best known for its chocolates.

=== Iran ===

In the [[Persian language]] Pleiades is known as ''Parvin''. Parvin is also a very popular given name in [[Iran]] and neighbouring countries (for example [[Parvin E'tesami]]).

== Europe ==

The word has acquired a meaning of "multitude", inspiring the name of the French literary movement [[La Pléiade]] and an earlier group of [[Alexandria]]n poets, the [[Alexandrian Pleiad]].

=== Greek mythology ===

{{main article|Pleiades (Greek mythology)}}

In [[Greek mythology]], the stars of Pleiades represented the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Seven Sisters]].

=== Norse mythology ===

To the [[Viking]]s, the Pleiades were [[Freyja]]'s hens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rediscovering Vinland : evidence of ancient Viking presence in America|date=2007|publisher=iUniverse|location=New York|isbn=0595436803|pages=128|author=Fred N. Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their name in many old European languages such as Hungarian compares them to a hen with chicks.

=== Western astrology ===
[[File:Pleiades (Agrippa 1531).svg|thumb|Kabbalistic "[[Pleiades]]" symbol from ''Libri tres de occulta philosophia'' (1531) by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]].]]
The [[astrological]] Pleiades were described in ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'' by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (Köln, 1533, but published manuscript as early as 1510).

In [[Western astrology]] they represent coping with sorrow&lt;ref&gt;Morse, Eric (1988). ''The Living Stars''. London: Amethyst Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and were considered a single one of the [[medieval]] [[Behenian fixed stars|fixed stars]]. As such, they are associated with [[quartz]] and [[fennel]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In [[esoteric astrology]] the seven solar systems revolve around Pleiades.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice (1934). ''Esoteric Astrology''. New York: Lucis Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celtic mythology ===

[[File:Nebra Scheibe.jpg|thumb|right|A bronze disk, 1600 BC, from Nebra, Germany, is one of the oldest known representations of the cosmos. The Pleiades are top right. See [[Nebra sky disk]]]]
To the [[Bronze Age]] people of Europe, such as the [[Celts]] (and probably considerably earlier), the Pleiades were associated with mourning and with funerals, since at that time in history, on the [[cross-quarter day]] {{Dubious|date=October 2011}} between the [[autumn equinox]] and the [[winter solstice]] (see [[Samhain]], also [[Halloween]] or [[All Souls Day]]), which was a festival devoted to the remembrance of the dead, the cluster rose in the eastern sky as the sun's light faded in the evening. It was from this [[heliacal rising|acronychal rising]] that the Pleiades became associated with tears and mourning. As a result of [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] over the centuries, the Pleiades no longer marked the festival, but the association has nevertheless persisted, and may account for the significance of the Pleiades astrologically.

=== Baltic mythology ===

In [[Baltic languages]] the name for this constellation is '''Sietynas''' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and '''Sietiņš''' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] which is derived from ''sietas'' meaning "[[sieve|a sieve]]". In Lithuanian folk songs this constellation is often [[personification|personified]] as a benevolent brother who helps orphan girls to marry or walks soldiers along the fields. But in Lithuanian folk tales as well as Latvian folk songs this constellation is usually depicted as an inanimate object, a sieve which gets stolen by the devil from the thunder god or is used to conjure light rain by thunder's wife and children.&lt;ref&gt;http://tautosmenta.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Laurinkiene_Nijole/Laurinkiene_LK_2002_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukrainian folklore ===

In [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] traditional folklore the Pleiades are known as Стожари (Stozhary), Волосожари (Volosozhary), or Баби-Звізди (Baby-Zvizdy).

'Stozhary' can be etymologically traced to "стожарня" (stozharnya) meaning a 'granary', 'storehouse for hay and crops', or can also be reduced to the root "сто-жар", (sto-zhar) meaning 'hundredfold glowing' or "a hundred embers".&lt;ref&gt;The Comprehensive Dictionary of the Contemporary Ukrainian Language. Perun Publishers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Volosozhary' (the ones whose hair is glowing), or 'Baby-Zvizdy' (female-stars) refer to the female tribal deities. According to the legend, seven maids lived long ago. They used to dance the traditional round dances and sing the glorious songs to honor the gods. After their death the gods turned them into water nymphs, and, having taken them to the Heavens, settled them upon the seven stars, where they dance their round dances (symbolic for moving the time) to this day. (see article in Ukrainian Wikipedia)

In [[Ukraine]] this asterism was considered a female talisman until recent times.

=== Hungarian folklore ===

The old name of the starcluster in Hungarian is "Fiastyúk", meaning 'a hen with chicks'. There is also a version of the story popularized by the song "A Nap és Szép háza" (House of Sun and Wind) of Hungarian folk metal band Dalriada speaking of a poor woman with seven sons who cursed her sons to turn into ravens after the sons wasted their only food. She failed to find them, but received a prophecy that an eighth brother could find the sons. Her eighth son thus went to look for his brothers, died and the brothers as ravens came to feast on his carcass, resulting in them dying as well and the eight of them getting a place in the sky as the Pleiades cluster. 

== Indigenous peoples of the Americas ==
(Alphabetical by people)

It was common among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] to measure keenness of [[visual perception|vision]] by the number of stars the viewer could see in the Pleiades, a practice which was also used in historical [[Europe]], especially in [[Greece]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Andean cultures ===

In the ancient [[Andes]], the Pleiades were associated with abundance, because they return to the [[Southern Hemisphere]] sky each year at harvest-time. In [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] they are called ''Qullqa'' (storehouse).

=== Aztec ===

The ancient [[Aztec]]s of Mexico and Central America based their calendar upon the Pleiades. Their year began when priests first remarked the asterism heliacal rising in the east, immediately before the sun's dawn light obliterated the view of the stars. Aztecs called the Pleiades [[Tianquiztli]] (meaning "marketplace").

=== Blackfoot ===

[[Paul Goble]], Native American storyteller, tells a [[Blackfoot]] legend that he says is told by other tribes as well. In the story, the Pleiades are orphans ("Lost Boys") that were not cared for by the people, so they became stars. Sun Man is angered by the mistreatment of the children and punishes the people with a draught, causing the buffalo to disappear, until the dogs, the only friends of the orphans, intercede on behalf of the people. Because the buffalo are not available while the Lost Boys are in the skies, the cosmical setting of the Pleaides was an assembly signal for Blackfoot hunter to travel to their hunting grounds to conduct the large-scale hunts, culminating in slaughters at buffalo jumps, that characterized their culture.

=== Cherokee ===

A [[Cherokee]] myth (similar to that of the [[Onondaga people]]) indicates that seven boys who would not do their ceremonial chores and wanted only to play, ran around and around the ceremonial ball court in a circle, and rose up into the sky. Only six of the boys made it to the sky; the seventh was caught by his mother and fell to the ground with such force that he sank into the ground. A pine tree grew over his resting place.&lt;ref name="Kingsolver, Barbara 1993 90–91"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kingsolver, Barbara|author-link=Barbara Kingsolver|title=[[Pigs in Heaven]]|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=1993|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cheyenne ===

A [[Cheyenne]] myth "The Girl Who Married a Dog", states that the group of seven stars known as the [[Pleiades]] originated from seven puppies which a Cheyenne chief's daughter gave birth to after mysteriously being visited by a dog in human form to whom she vowed "Wherever you go, I go".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/cheyennestory3.htm The Girl Who Married A Dog]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hopi ===

The [[Hopi]] had a relatively limited star lore, but determined the passage of time for nighttime rituals in the winter by observing the Pleiades (''Tsöösöqam'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hopi Dictionary Project (University of Arizona Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology)|date=1998|title=Hopi dictionary: Hopìikwa Lavàytutuveni: A Hopi-English Dictionary of the Third Mesa Dialect with an English-Hopi Finder List and a Sketch of Hopi Grammar|location=Tucson, Arizona|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=0-8165-1789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Orion through a [[kiva]] entrance hatch as they passed overhead. The Pleiades were depicted in a mural on one kiva wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stephen | first = Alexander M. | editor-last = Parsons | editor-first = Elsie Clews | editor-link = Elsie Clews Parsons | title = Hopi Journal of Alexander M.

=== Lakota ===

The [[Lakota people|Lakota Tribe]] of [[North America]] had a legend that linked the origin of the Pleiades to [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]]. According to the [[Seri people|Seris]] (of northwestern Mexico), these stars are seven women who are giving birth. The constellation is known as ''Cmaamc'', which is apparently an archaic plural of the noun ''cmaam'' "woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Mary B. |author2=Stephen A.

=== Mono ===

The [[Mono people|Monache people]] tell of six wives who loved onions more than their husbands and now live happily in "sky country".&lt;ref name="They Dance" /&gt;

=== Monte Alto Culture ===

The early [[Monte Alto Culture]], and others in [[Guatemala]] such as [[Ujuxte]] and [[Takalik Abaj]], made their early observatories using the Pleiades and ''Eta Draconis'' as reference; they were called ''the seven sisters'', and thought to be their original land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_astronomy.htm Maya Astronomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nez Perce ===

A [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] myth about this constellation mirrors the ancient Greek myths about the [[Electra (Pleiad)|Lost Pleiades]]. In the Nez Perce version the Pleiades is also a group of sisters, however the story itself is somewhat different. One sister falls in love with a man and, following his death, is so absorbed by her own grief that she tells her sisters about him. They mock her and tell her how silly it is of her to feel sad for the human after his death, and she in return keeps her growing sadness to herself, eventually becoming so ashamed and miserable about her own feelings that she pulls the sky over her face like a veil, blocking herself from view. This myth explains why there are only six of the seven stars visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Clark| first = Ella| title = Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest| publisher = University of California Press| date = 1953| location = Berkeley and Los Angeles, California| pages = 155–156| isbn = 0-520-00243-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navajo ===

The Pleiades (''dilγéhé'') play a major role in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] folklore and ritual. In the Navajo creation story, Upward-reachingway, ''dilγéhé'' was the first constellation placed in the sky by Black God. When Black God entered the [[hogan]] of creation, the Pleiades were on his ankle; he stamped his foot and they moved to his knee, then to his ankle, then to his shoulder, and finally to his left temple. The seven stars of ''dilγéhé'' are depicted on ceremonial masks of Black God, in sand paintings and on ceremonial gourd rattles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Haile | first = Berard | author-link = Berard Haile | title = Starlore Among the Navaho | place =  Santa Fe, NM | publisher = William Gannon | origyear = 1947 | date = 1977 | page =  | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Onondaga ===

The [[Onondaga people]]'s version of the story has lazy children who prefer to dance over their daily chores ignoring the warnings of the Bright Shining Old Man.&lt;ref name="They Dance" /&gt;

=== Pawnee ===

The [[Skidi]] [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] consider the Pleiades to be seven brothers. They observed the seven brothers, as well as Corona Borealis, the Chiefs, through the smoke hole of Pawnee lodges to determine the time of night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Chamberlain | first = Von Del | title = When Stars Came Down to Earth: Cosmology of the Skidi Pawnee Indians of North America | place = Los Altos, CA / College Park, MD | publisher = Ballena Press / Center for Archaeoastronomy | series = Ballena Press Anthropological Papers | volume = 26 | date = 1982 | pages = 166–7, 175–7, 226–7 | url = | isbn = 0-87919-098-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shasta ===

The [[Shasta people]] tell a story of the children of racoon killed by coyote avenging their father's death and then rising into the sky to form the Pleiades. The smallest star in the cluster is said to be coyote's youngest who aided the young racoons.&lt;ref name="They Dance"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monroe|first=[compiled by] Jean Guard|title=They dance in the sky : Native American star myths|date=1987|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0-395-39970-X|pages=1–14|author2=Stewart, Ray A. Williamson  |author3=illustrations by Edgar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia ==

=== Ban Raji mythology ===
Among the [[Ban Raji]] people, who live in semi-nomadic settlements scattered throughout western Nepal and northern India, the Pleiades are called the "Seven sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law" (''Hatai halyou daa salla''). Ban Rajis note that when the Pleiades rises up over the mountain each night, they feel happy to see their ancient kin (Fortier 2008: in press). On a more practical note, Ban Rajis can tell that evening has arrived, indicating that it is about eight o'clock by local time standards when their star-kin rise above the Nepali mountains bordering the Kali River.

=== China ===
In [[Chinese constellation]]s they are 昴 ''mao'', the ''[[Hairy Head (Chinese constellation)|Hairy Head]]'' of the white tiger of the West.

=== India ===
In [[Jyotisha|Indian astrology]] the Pleiades were known as the [[nakshatra]] {{IAST|[[Kṛttikā]]}} which in [[Sanskrit]] is translated as "the cutters".&lt;ref&gt;Dennis M. Harness.  ''The Nakshatras:  The Lunar Mansions of Vedic Astrology.''  Lotus Press (Twin Lakes WI, 1999.) {{ISBN|978-0-914955-83-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pleiades are called the ''star of fire,'' and their ruling deity is the fire god [[Agni]]. It is one of the most prominent of the nakshatra, and is associated with anger and stubbornness. Karthigai (கார்த்திகை) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] refers to the six wives of the six [[rishi]] (sages), the seventh being [[Arundhati (Hinduism)|Arundhati]] the wife of [[Vasistha]] which relates to the star [[Mizar and Alcor|Alcor]] in [[Ursa Major]]. The six stars in Pleiades correspond to six wives, while the faithful wife Arundhati stuck with Sage Vasistha in [[Ursa Major]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tamilandvedas.com/2014/06/25/chastest-woman-arundhati-in-literature/&lt;/ref&gt; The six wives fell in love with [[Agni]], hence the name Pleiades (star of fire).

=== Indonesia ===
In the island of [[Java]], the asterism is known in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''Lintang Kartika'' or ''Gugus Kartika'' ("[[Kṛttikā|Kartika]] cluster"), a direct influence from the ancient [[Hinduism in Java|Hindu Javanese]]. Influenced by Hinduism, the stars represent the seven princesses, which is represented in the court dance of [[Bedhaya|Bedhaya Ketawang]] of the royal palaces of [[Surakarta]]. The dance is performed once per year, on the second day of the Javanese month of [[Javanese calendar|Ruwah]] (during May) and is performed by the nine females, relatives or wives of the [[Susuhunan]] (prince) of Surakarta before a private audience in the inner circle of the Sultanate family.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Judith. ''Gamelan Stories: Tantrism, Islam, and Aesthetics in Central Java''. Arizona State University Program for Southeast Asian Studies, 1993. {{ISBN|1-881044-06-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another name for Pleiades in Java is ''Wuluh''.&lt;ref name="langitselatan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://langitselatan.com/2011/01/02/jejak-langkah-astronomi-di-indonesia/ |title=Jejak Langkah Astronomi di Indonesia |trans-title=Footsteps of Astronomy in Indonesia |author=Avivah Yamani |date=January 2, 2011 |website=Langit Selatan |language=Indonesian |publisher=Langit Selatan |access-date=January 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131075341/http://langitselatan.com/2011/01/02/jejak-langkah-astronomi-di-indonesia/ |archive-date=January 31, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern Java, its rising marks the arrival of the ''mangsa kapitu'' ("seventh season"), which marks the beginning of rice planting season.&lt;ref name="langitselatan"/&gt;

In [[Japan]], the Pleiades are known as 昴 ''[[Pleiades|Subaru]]'' which means "coming together" or cluster in Japanese, and have given their name to the [[Subaru|car manufacturer]] whose logo incorporates six stars to represent the five companies that merged into one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subaru.com/faq.html Subaru of America, Inc. FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Subaru (telescope)|Subaru Telescope]], located in Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii, is also named after the Pleiades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naoj.org/NAOJ/history.html A Brief History of Subaru]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]] the Pleiades are known as {{RTGS|Dao Luk Kai}} (ดาวลูกไก่) or the "Chick Stars", from a [[Thai folklore|Thai folk tale]]. The story tells that a poor elderly couple who lived in a forest had raised a family of [[chicken]]s: a mother hen and her six (or alternately seven) chicks. One day a monk arrived at the couple's home during his [[Dhutanga]] journey. Worried that they had no suitable food to offer him, the elderly couple contemplated cooking the mother hen. The hen overheard the conversation, and rushed back to the [[Chicken coop|coop]] to say farewell to her children. She told them to take care of themselves, and that her death would repay the kindness of the elderly couple, who had taken care of all of them for so long. As the mother hen's feathers were being burned over a fire, the chicks threw themselves into fire in order to die along with their mother. The deity, impressed by and in remembrance of their love, immortalized the seven chickens as the stars of the Pleiades. In tellings of the story in which there were only six chicks, the mother is included, but often includes only the seven chicks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prapayneethai.com/th/amusement/north/view.asp?id=0370 Thaiculture.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspg.org/fabel/doc3.htm rspg.or.th]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
Depending on the language group or clan, there are several Aboriginal stories regarding the origins of the Pleiades. Some [[Indigenous Australian]] peoples believed the Pleiades was a woman who had been nearly [[rape]]d by [[Kidili]], the man in the moon.

In a legend told by the [[Wurundjeri]] people of south-eastern Australia, the Pleiades were represented by the seven [[Karatgurk]] sisters. These women were the first to possess the secret of fire and each one carried live coals on the end of her [[digging stick]]. Although they refused to share these coals with anybody, they were ultimately tricked into giving up their secret by [[Crow (Australian Aboriginal mythology)|Crow]], who subsequently brought fire to mankind. After this, the Karatgurk sisters were swept into the night sky. Their glowing fire sticks became the bright stars of the Pleiades cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mudrooroo  | title =Aboriginal mythology: An A-Z spanning the history of the Australian Aboriginal people from the earliest legends to the present day  | publisher = Thorsons  | date = 1994  | location = London  | pages = 35–36  | isbn = 978-1-85538-306-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book |title=The Emu in the Sky: Stories about the Aboriginals and the day and night skies - The Emu |pages=15, 16 |author=Peter D'Arcy |editor=Margo Sutton |year=1994 |publisher=The National Science and Technology Centre|isbn=978-0-64618-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version, often painted by [[Gabriella Possum Nungurayyi]] as this is her [[Dreaming (story)|dreaming]] (or creation story), daughter of the late [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]] from the Central desert art movement of [[Papunya]], depicts the story of seven Napaltjarri sisters being chased by a man named Jilbi Tjakamarra. He tried to practice love magic on one of the sisters but the sister did not want to be with him, and ran away from him together with her sisters. They sat down at [[Uluru]] to search for honey ants but when they saw Jilbi, they went to Kurlunyalimpa and with the spirits of Uluru, transformed into stars. Jilbi transforms himself into what is commonly known as the [[Venus|Morning Star]]{{dubious|date=June 2017|Venus is a movable star and not in Orion's belt}} in [[Orion's belt]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}, thus continuing to chase the seven sisters across the sky.

=== Hawaii ===
There is an analogous holiday in [[Hawaiʻi]] known as [[Makahiki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/hawaiian/voyaging/files/t07-navigation/t07-01_glossary.html Hawaiian Voyaging Course&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
Occurring June 20 – June 22, the [[winter solstice]] (''Te Maruaroa o Takurua'') is seen by the New Zealand Māori as the middle of the winter season. It follows directly after the first sighting of ''[[Matariki]]'' (The Pleiades) and ''Puanga/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]])&lt;ref&gt;Rigel is ''Puanga'' in northern [[Māori language|Māori]], and ''Puaka'' in [[Māori language#South Island dialects|southern dialects]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the dawn sky, an event which marked the beginning of the New Year and was said to be when the Sun turned from his northern journey with his winter-bride ''Takurua'' ([[Sirius]]) and began his journey back to his summer-bride ''Hine Raumati''.

== Non-Saharan Africa ==

In the [[Swahili language]] of [[East Africa]] they are called "kilimia" ([[Proto-Bantu]] *'''ki-dimida''' in [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] areas E, F, G, J, L, and S) which comes from the verb ''-lima'' meaning "dig" or "cultivate" as their visibility was taken as a sign to prepare digging as the onset of the rain was near.

In the closely related [[Sesotho]] language of the [[Southern Africa]]'s [[Basotho]] people the Pleiades are called "Seleme se setshehadi" ("the female planter"). Its disappearance in April (the 10th month) and the appearance of the star [[Achernar]] signals the beginning of the cold season. Like many other Southern African cultures, Basotho associate its visibility with agriculture and plenty.

== Modern beliefs ==

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===

The 19th century astronomer [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler]] proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which all stars revolve around the star Alcyone, in the Pleiades. Based on this hypothesis, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religion taught until the 1950s that Alcyone was likely to be the site of the throne of God&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotes-watchtower.co.uk/god_s_throne_-_pleiades.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Theosophy ===
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it is believed the ''Seven Stars of the Pleiades'' focus the [[spiritual energy]] of the [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|Seven Rays]] from the ''Galactic Logos'' to the ''Seven Stars of the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]]'', then to [[Sirius]], then to the [[Sun]], then to the god of [[Earth]] ([[Sanat Kumara]]) and finally through the seven [[ascended master|Masters of the Seven Rays]] to us.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dr. Douglas ''The Seven Rays:Key to the Mysteries'' 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UFOs ===
In [[Ufology]] some believers describe [[Nordic alien]] extraterrestrials (called [[Pleiadeans]]) as originating from this system.

== New Age ==
In [[New Age]] lore, some believe that [[Sun]] and the [[Earth]] will pass through a [[Photon belt]] from the Pleiades, causing a cataclysm and/or initiating a spiritual transition (referred to variously as a "shift in consciousness," the "Great Shift," the "Shift of the Ages").

Barbara Marciniak, author of ''Bringers of the Dawn'', is one of the authors who contributes to the New Age mythos of Pleiadian ET beings who are linked to human ancestry.

'''Chumash rock art''' is a genre of paintings on caves, mountains, cliffs, or other living rock surfaces, created by the [[Chumash people]] of southern California. [[Pictograph]]s and [[petroglyph]]s are common through interior California, the rock painting tradition thrived until the 19th century. Chumash rock art is considered to be some of the most elaborate rock art tradition in the region.{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=129}}

The Chumash are probably best known for the pictographs. Which were brightly colored paintings of humans, animals, and abstract circles. They were thought to be part of a religious ritual.

==Chumash people==
{{main|Chumash people}}
The Chumash lived in the present-day counties of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], and [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] in southern California for 14,000 years. They were a maritime, [[hunter-gatherer]] society whose livelihood was based on the sea. They developed excellent skills for catching fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. Beyond fishing, however, they were also skilled in creating rock art. Hudson and Blackburn define rock art as "an aesthetic, symbolic representation of significant concepts and entities that is painted on or carved into a rock surface." Rock art may have been created by [[shamanism|shamans]] during [[vision quest]]s, most commonly in the form of [[pictogram|pictographs]] (paintings on rock), but sometimes [[petroglyph]]s (engravings on rock) as well. No one is absolutely certain about the meaning of the Chumash Rock art, but scholars generally agree that it is connected with religion and astronomy.

==Locations==
[[File:PaintedCaveParkCA.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of Painted Cave]]

Chumash rock art is almost invariably found in caves or on cliffs in the mountains, although some small, portable painted rocks have been recorded by [[Campbell Grant]]. The rock art sites are always found near streams, springs, or some other source of permanent water. In his research of southern California rock art, Grant recorded numerous sites from different areas that were all close to a water source. He found twelve painted sites in the highest parts of the mountainous Chumash territory, the [[Ventureno|Ventureño]] area. The [[Ventura River|Ventura]] and [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara]] Rivers and several coastal streams flow through this area. He also recorded forty-one painted rock art sites in the [[Cuyama Valley]] region (north of the Ventureño area), where the [[Sisquoc River]] flows between the [[San Rafael Mountains]] and the [[Sierra Madre Mountains (California)|Sierra Madre Mountains]]. The most easily accessible example is at [[Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park, California|Painted Cave State Historic Park]], which is located in canyons above [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=129}}

[[File:Aerial-OverPaintedRock.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Painted Rock]]
[[Painted Rock (San Luis Obispo County, California)|Painted Rock]] is a free-standing rock on the [[Carrizo Plain]] near the Sierra Madre Mountains at the southern tip of the [[Great Central Valley]].{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=129}} The interior alcove of the horseshoe-shaped rock features pictographs by Chumash, neighboring tribes, and non-Native Americans. 

The [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]] petroglyphs are located in the [[Simi Hills]] in [[Ventura County]]. They are on the private land of [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne's]] [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]] (SSFL), which has protected them from public harm since 1947. The SSFL is closed and in the initial stage of a significant toxins and radionuclides site investigation and cleanup. [[Boeing]], U.S. DOE, and NASA (current property owners and responsible parties) and the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] (DTSC) are responsible to protect Chumash and other historical elements during the extensive SSFL work.{{sfn|Guttenberg|Corbett|Knight|2010}}

==Religious aspects of art==
[[File:PaintedCaveArtCA.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Interior of Painted Cave]]
[[Chumash traditional narratives]] in oral history say that religious specialists, known as '''alchuklash'' created the rock art.{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=129}} Non-Chumash people call these practitioners [[medicine men]] or [[shaman]]s.{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=130}} 
According to David Whitley, shamanism is "a form of worship based on direct, personal interaction between a shaman (or medicine man) and the supernatural (or sacred realm and its spirits)." In Chumash territory, the sites for the vision quests were usually located near the shaman's village. The Chumash considered caves, rocks, and water sources quite powerful, and the shamans saw them as a "portal to the sacred realm...where they could enter the supernatural." The way a shaman interacted with the supernatural was by entering a hallucinogenic trance, or [[altered state of consciousness]]. In this altered state, brought on either by surprisingly potent native tobacco or [[jimsonweed]], shamans received visions and supernatural power from spirit helpers often in the forms of dangerous and powerful animals like rattlesnakes and grizzly bears. Spirit helpers almost never took the form of an animal that was an important source of food, because it was 'taboo for a shaman to eat meat from the species of his helper.'

==Subject matter and materials==
Chumash rock art depicts images like humans, animals, celestial bodies, and other (at times ambiguous) shapes and patterns. These depictions vary considerably and appear to be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an oil binder helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained [[hematite]] or [[iron oxide]], while yellow came from [[limonite]], blue and green from [[copper]] or [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], white from [[kaolin clay]]s or [[gypsum]], and black from [[manganese]] or [[charcoal]]. Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.

==Interpretations==
[[File:ChildAdultSun.jpg|thumb|Color enhanced Chumash glyphs]]
In the early 20th century, non-Natives began studying California rock art, including a number of archaeologists, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Alfred Kroeber]]. Because of some commonly occurring symbols in paintings, it was believed that at least portions of the rock art depicted themes of fertility, water, and rain; however, the Native California Indians are very reluctant to talk to anyone about the rock art and some deny any knowledge of it altogether. The natives' hesitancy to discuss the art led archaeologists to believe that they had no idea of the origin of the pictographs. Kroeber recorded some of his thoughts on the origins of the rock art in 1925.

"The cave paintings of [Southern California]...represent a particular art, or local style or cult. This can be connected, in all probability, with the technological art of the Chumash. [An] association with...religion is also to be considered, although nothing positive is known in the matter. Many of the pictures may have been made by shamans; and it is quite possible that medicine men were not connected with the making of any."{{sfn|Grant|1965|p=80}}

Kroeber was unsure about what specific associations could be made between the paintings and the artists. Julian Steward researched California rock art as well, and in 1929 he deduced that the only way to understand the meanings of the petroglyphs and pictographs was to compare them with the art and symbolism of the different Indian groups and their respective culture areas. In his book ''Petroglyphs of California'', Steward wrote: 
"It has frequently been stated that the petroglyphs and pictographs are meaningless figures made in idle moments by some primitive artist. The facts of distribution, however, show that this cannot be true. Since design elements and style are grouped in limited areas, the primitive artist must have made the inscriptions with something in mind. ... He executed, not random drawings, but figures similar to those made in other parts of the same area."{{sfn|Steward|1929|pp=224–225}}{{sfn|Grant|1965|p=91}}

At Painted Cave, a circle enclosing five spokes surrounded by other circles–some spoked, some rayed–is thought to represent the [[solar eclipse]] of November 24, 1677. Pinwheel shapes, dots, and concentric circles are believed to be celestial bodies. Figures combining human and animal features represent states of transformation the '''alchuklash'' experienced. Certain animals, such as rattlesnakes and frogs, are believed to represent spirit helpers.{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=130}}

== Arborglyph ==
{{Main|Arborglyph}}

In 2006, an arborglyph on an oak tree in the [[Santa Lucia Range]] in San Luis Obispo County was discovered to be Chumash art. The tree, locally known as the "scorpion tree," was originally believed to have been the work of cowboys. However, archaeologists believe it to be the only known Native American arborglyph in the western United States. The work on the tree is theorized to be correlated to the movement of celestial bodies. If true, it would demonstrate that Chumash art was likely used as astronomical calendars.{{sfn|Saint Onge|Johnson|Talaugon|2009}}

==Dating==
Concerning the age of the paintings, Grant says "a [[radiocarbon test]] on pigment from a Santa Barbara area pictograph site showed that the sample was 'not over 2,000 years old.'"{{sfn|Grant|1965|p=123}}

It is an important example of [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] architecture for its peculiarities, and was built in the 11th century, in what was then the frontier between [[Islam]]ic and [[Christian]] lands.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/eusi/ho_61.219.htm|title=Wall Painting of a Camel [From the hermitage of San Baudelio de Berlanga] (61.219) – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History – The Metropolitan Museum of Art|work=metmuseum.org|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dedicated to [[Baudilus|Saint Baudilus]] or Baudel.[[File:San Baudelio Frontal.jpg|thumb|273x273px|Frontal view of San Baudelio de Berlanga.]]

The construction of the hermitage is part of the period of the definitive consolidation of the Christian kingdoms throughout this area, which takes place around the year 1060, when the taking takes place, by [[Ferdinand I of León]], of several towns including Berlanga.

== History ==
Declared a national monument in 1917, The Hermitage of San Baudelio de Berlanga is thought to have been built to honor [[Baudilus|Saint Baudilus]], or San Baudelio as he is known in Spanish. Saint Baudilus was a monk who lived during the second or third century in [[Nîmes]] and is mentioned in two twelfth-century documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frinta|first=Mojmir S.|date=1964|title=The Frescoes from San Baudelio De Berlanga|url=|journal=Gesta 1/2|doi=10.2307/766616|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends about Saint Baudilus say that he earned the crown of [[martyr]]dom after preaching the gospel to local townspeople celebrating the birth of Jupiter, and that after his execution by decapitation with an axe, wells sprang up at the location of his death. It is unknown what direct connection San Baudelio had with this [[chapel]] made in his honor, if any, though the movement of the cult of San Baudelio into [[Spain]] was probably responsible for its creation. Saint Baudilus died in the late third or [[4th century|fourth century]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Walter W. S.|date=1930-01-01|title=Romanesque Spanish Mural Painting (II) San Baudelio De Berlanga|jstor=3050760|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=12|issue=1|pages=21–42|doi=10.2307/3050760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small adjoining [[cave]] is still accessible inside the southwestern wall of the [[sanctuary]], where a [[hermit]] may have lived at one point, and locals still make [[pilgrimage]] to a [[Spring (hydrology)|freshwater spring]] near the church each year on May 20 (his feast day) to pay respects to Saint Baudilus, who also had miraculous cures named after him in earlier centuries. An [[axe]] and a [[Arecaceae|palm tree]] are the symbols of his martyrdom, and the palm can be seen as a direct inspiration to the unique [[architecture]] of San Baudelio de Berlanga.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the tenth century as the power of the [[Moors]] was diminishing in the North, it is probable that a hermit monk took refuge in the lonely cave in the Spanish countryside. His status could have drawn visitors with offerings and companionship, which may have been the catalyst for the building of the hermitage church. At the approximate time of the building of the chapel, local craftsmen, mostly from [[Castile and León|Castile]], would have been [[Mozarabs]]. This would account for the heavy Mozarabic influence on the architecture. Also, San Baudelio closely correlates with a church pictured in the [[Codex Vigilanus]] (A. D. 976), approximating the construction of the hermitage to the late tenth or early eleventh century.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=C. H.|date=1928-01-01|title=Two Twelfth Century Frescoes from the Hermitage Church of San Baudelio de Berlanga, Spain|jstor=4170092|journal=Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts|volume=26|issue=153|pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most remarkable aspects is its pictorial decoration, as it is one of the important examples of Romanesque painting in Spain. Only a few remains of tempera painting remain, since the originals were torn and exported in 1926 to different museums of the [[United States]]. ([[Cincinnati Museum of Art]], [[The Cloisters|New York Cloisters Museum]], [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]). Some are also in the [[Prado Museum]], specifically six scenes.  Of the paintings that came out to United States we have: The Dromedary, The healing of the blind and The resurrection of Lazarus, The Temptation of Christ, The three Marys before the tomb, The Holy Supper, The wedding of Cana, Entrance to Jerusalem and the Falconer. In 1957 the Spanish government exchanged some of these paintings for [[the Fuentidueña Apse]] of the Romanesque church of San Martín of the Castilian town of [[Fuentidueña]], which today is preserved in the [[Metropolitan Museum of New York]], the paintings thus acquired were deposited in the Prado Museum. Among those found in Spain we have: Hunt deer, Hare hunting, The warrior, The elephant, The bear and The hunter. In 1965 the works of restoration of the paintings that were still in the church and that had not been removed were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Prado Museum|title= Wall paintings of San Baudelio from Casillas de Berlanga (Soria) [anonymous Spanish]| url =https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/pinturas-murales-de-san-baudelio-de-casillas-de/2d8a2b36-77b8-492d-880e-4274cb09d5ad

== Architecture and Construction ==
[[File:E San Baudelio de Berlanga PM 81370.jpg|left|thumb|Current view of the Central pillar of San Baudelio de Berlanga.]]
No records provide evidence of the construction of the church, but it is apparent that it belongs to the group of [[Mozarabs|Mozarabic]] churches built throughout northern Spain during the tenth and eleventh centuries. San Baudelio sets itself apart from the rest of the architecture in the [[Castile and León|Castile]] region because it is an uncommon example of the Mozarabic style, rather than the much more numerous examples of [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] influenced architecture from [[Andalusia]], which are found farther west in León.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The lack of information on the church force it to be dated based on its architectural influences and construction, as well as through the paintings that once lined the interior of the small chapel.

San Baudelio de Berlanga is a relatively plain building on the outside, being mostly square with a small, nearly square [[apse]] adjoining its east side. The walls of the entire structure are made of rough native stone, and its exterior offers no decoration whatsoever. The interior, however, is very distinctive, and has been described as “The most Mohammedan church in the whole of Spain.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:San Baudelio de Berlanga 22.JPG|thumb|Hollow lantern space with small oratory behind central pillar.]]
The entrance to San Baudelio de Berlanga is a single [[Horseshoe arch|horseshoe-arched]] door on the north wall of the building, which leads directly into the [[nave]] of the church. Upon entering the hermitage, visitors are greeted by a large circular [[Column|pillar]] that rises to the [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] of the apse. From the top of the pillar  project eight ribbed arches, which are supported at the four corners and middle of the walls of the church. These arches are horseshoe forms with corner ribs supported by small Moorish inspired [[squinch]]es.

Similar to the [[Arecaceae|palm tree]], which symbolizes Saint Baudilus, it is not unlikely that this central column was designed by an [[architect]] to represent a palm tree, attribute of the Saint. Atop the pillar, in between the sprouting arches, is a small cavity, which is believed to be a place where treasures of the church or [[relic]]s of its saint were once secured. The interior of this space is ribbed in Moorish style, with crisscrossing arches around a [[dome]]d top, similar to the vaulted dome of the nearby hermitage of [[:es:Iglesia de San Miguel (Almazán)|San Miguel Almazan]].

Another unusual feature of San Baudelio de Berlanga is its [[Tribune (architecture)|gallery]], which spans the interior side of the west wall. This tribune is constructed of a double row of horseshoe arches, which support a [[Choir|choir area]] on the second floor, accessible by the stairs on the south wall. Projecting into the nave, and supported by the tribune, is a small [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]], which sits directly against the nave’s central pillar. This small chapel is [[barrel vault]]ed, and has a window on either of its sides. It is no larger than a [[pulpit]].[[File:San Baudelio de Berlanga 06.JPG|thumb|244x244px|Current view of a loophole window on east wall.|left]]The [[Apse|apsidal]] chapel, which joins the main building on its eastern side, is accessible through another horseshoe arched doorway, and sits four steps higher than the floor of the nave. At its back wall is a small loophole shaped window, which until it was closed off, would have allowed morning light to enter the chapel. This room is also barrel vaulted, and almost identical in size and shape to the chapel of the hermitage of San Cruz at Maderuelo.
One other unique aspect of San Baudelio de Berlanga is its connection to a small cave that lies under the hill on which the church sits. Access to this cave is gained through a doorway under the tribune, against the south wall. This is the cave in which a hermit may have lived at one time, possibly before the construction of the church.

The only natural means of light in the church would have been through the open doorway on the North wall, a now closed up window also found on the North wall, or a small window on the West wall that was converted from a doorway, which would have been an alternate entrance into the oratory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Elements of San Baudelio, like the double rows of [[Column|pillars]] and [[arch]]es, recall the stylistic elements of the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Cordova]]. The ribbed arches, squinches or niches beneath the arches, and the method of construction in the lantern are all apparently derived from areas like [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Armenia]] in the Near East. It is important to note though, that not all the oriental aesthetics that occur in Spanish churches were introduced by the Moors. Many had already been introduced to Spain during [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] times through its commercial and ecclesiastical connections with the Near East.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The use of rectangular frames around arches and intersecting ribbed vaults at San Baudelio was originally inspired by the extension of the mosque of Cordoba by [[Al-Hakam II]], and it can also be seen in the church at [[Monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla|San Millan de La Cogolla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T060103|title=Mozarabic|last=Torviso|first=I.G.

==Wall paintings==
The hermitage housed many fine [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[fresco]]es from about 1125; most of these have been removed, but some have remained.  Two sections, transferred to canvas, are now in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], showing the ''[[Entry of Christ into Jerusalem (Master of Taüll)|Entry of Christ into Jerusalem]]'' and the ''Wedding at Cana''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/entry-christ-jerusalem-master-san-baudelio-de-berlanga Indianapolis Museum of Art], page on ''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sections, including ''The Healing of the Blind Man and the Raising of Lazarus'' and ''The Temptation of Christ'' are in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/70012398 ''The Healing of the Blind Man and the Raising of Lazarus''] and [http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/70012461 ''The Temptation of Christ by the Devil''], MMA.  In all the MMA database has 9 paintings from the church, best found by searching on "Berlanga"&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Prado]].  The paintings were done by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Master of Tahull]] (Taüll in Catalan), whose best known works are in [[Sant Climent de Taüll]] and the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] in [[Barcelona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=76f61c324e73b8b233635aa5d988473fd1cbca3b64e9f3ce652e4abaab14bd20?inventoryNumber=015966-000&amp;lang=en|title=Apse of Sant Climent de Taüll – Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|work=mnac.cat|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two other painters. The scenes of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' are unusual in Spanish painting at this period; these are in American museums, while smaller elements including scenes of hunting and [[falconry]] and decorative copies of textiles are in [[Madrid]] as well as New York.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 261&lt;/ref&gt;  The frescoes include that of a [[camel]] and of a [[war elephant]], which were inspired by Muslim motifs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Frescoes ===

[[File:Mary Magdalen and Jesus in the Garden, from the Ermita de San Baudelio, by the Master of San Baudelio and the Master of Maderuelo, Spain, c. 1125-1150, fresco transferred to canvas - Cincinnati Art Museum - DSC04460.JPG|thumb|Mary Magdalen and Jesus in the Garden, now in [[Ohio]]]]
Originally every part of the church was covered with some kind of decoration. We can still see some of the remaining art work even though it has been eroded because of neglect or water seeping through the walls and loosening the plaster. Twenty-two compositions were removed from the church and brought to the United States and the [[Museo del Prado|Museo del Prado Madrid]]. Compared to other churches in [[Western Europe]] with painted interiors, San Baudelio is one of the best preserved from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period. There are three main sections of decoration: the first two are [[narrative]]s and [[Secularity|secular]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]]; the large compositions from the vaults and the walls from the main body of the building; these have been largely removed. The third group, too damaged to be removed, are left inside the small oratory of the tribune.

Under the [[lunette]] of the apse, there are two figures sitting under arches: [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]] on the left of the window and Saint Baudilus at the right. We know it is Saint Baudilus because of the inscription BAVDILI(VS) even though some of the lower part of the image is missing. St. Nicholas is identified by the inscription (NICOL)AVS  and under him the words IN D€I NOMINE can be seen. St. Nicholas is depicted sitting on a pillowed chair with a luminous cloud or a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] surrounding him. Some of his features include [[tonsure]]d white hair and beard, an [[alb]], a red mantle over the alb, and sandals.  He is holding a [[Crosier|crozier]] in his left hand and his right palm is raised outward.  Both figures are placed against a striped background of what looks like faded teal green, pale red, forest green, yellow, and dark red. Under the window appears a long-legged, long necked bird, with a white body, and yellow and red wings. The [[ibis]] is painted against a dark red background, below it is inscribed: . . . E . . . AVLA DE(I).[[File:Raising Lazarus.jpg|left|thumb|Raising Lazarus. Now in The Cloisters Museum, New York.]]Around the [[17th century|seventeenth century]] the interior of the church was completely white washed due to the severe state of deterioration of the murals. But, a single piece was eventually found and transferred to canvas and it is still possible to identify the figure.

The north wall contains two scenes. They are separated by a tree, and the image on the right is better preserved. The image at the right of the tree appears to portray the meeting of [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Jesus]] in the [[Gethsemane|garden]] after the [[resurrection]], it might also be the instance "she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus," or "Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, [[Rabbi|Rabboni]]; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father:" (John 20:17) Mary Magdalene is depicted with a halo surrounding her, white headdress and [[tunic]], and red mantle. Jesus is dressed in a long white tunic and brown mantle and carries a book in his left hand (presumably the bible.) Of the image at the left of the tree only a single female figure is preserved. Dressed in a long white tunic and orange mantle, the female shrinks backward in astonishment and observes a figure to the left. Of the figure on her left only a small piece of orange red cloth is preserved. There is nothing to indicate what scene it is other than the adjoining figures to the right of the tree; it might represent another encounter of the meeting of Jesus and Mary Magdalene in the garden.

The murals in the vaulting of the church are almost all gone. There are a few fragments left that contained scenes from the life of the Christ and the Virgin: [[Adoration of the Magi|The Adoration of the Magi]], [[Adoration of the Shepherds]], [[Circumcision]], [[Flight into Egypt|The flight into Egypt]], and probably the [[Annunciation]] and [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation]] in the Temple.

On the south wall are some scenes of Jesus’s [[miracle]]s. One of these depicts him healing the blind man. Jesus, shown with short red hair and a beard, a large cross, and a halo surrounding him.  He wears an orange tunic and a blue mantle. He touches the eyes of the blind man that kneels before him. The blind man is wearing a long white tunic, red hose, and has short dark hair. His blindness is symbolized by closed eyes.
[[File:San baudelio de berlanga-cana.jpg|left|thumb|The Wedding at Cana. Now in Indianapolis.]]
Also appearing in the same space as the blind man is the [[Lazarus of Bethany|Resurrection of Lazarus]], one of the best preserved of the series.  Lazarus, is shown wrapped up like a [[mummy]] and placed in a black [[sarcophagus]]. Two seemingly holy women lift one end of the cover. Jesus touches the body of Lazarus with a long staff, which turns into a cross, and he is joined by a beardless figure with red hair, possibly [[John the Evangelist|St. John]], who is holding a green book in his left hand. Jesus is shown with a yellow-crossed nimbus, red hair, and pointed beard, and he wears an orange tunic with wide sleeves under a green mantle. The disciple at the left, also depicted with red hair, is wearing a long grey tunic and dark blue mantle. Both the women have halos and they wear pale green-orange headdresses that fall over the shoulders. The background is divided by wide stripes of dark blue, violet, red, and green.

The next miracle, the [[Marriage at Cana]], takes up half the space on the left on the west wall. The composition is disrupted by a doorway and is sectioned by a column. Jesus, the bridegroom and bride are seated at the feast. The table is shown covered with a white cloth and has circular loaves of bread and bowls of fruit. Jesus, at the left, is holding a knife in his left hand and blesses with his right hand.  As in the previous scene, Jesus is depicted with nimbus and dark red hair and beard, and is dressed in a long red tunic and dark blue mantle. The bearded bridegroom, who is holding a knife in his right hand and lifts his left hand in a gesture of speech, wears a tall hat, pale green tunic with an orange lining, brown mantle, light brown hose, and red sandals. The bride, who is seated at the right, is dressed in an orange headdress, a pale green robe with wide sleeves, and raises her right hand with her palm turned outward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Hunting with Crossbow.jpg|thumb|137x137px|Hunting with a crossbow. Remain inside the hermitage.]]The remaining piece of the west wall contains a portrayal of the [[Temptation of Christ|Temptation of Christ in the Wilderness]], and in this scene he appears twice. At the left he is shown at the moment when [[Satan]] states "If thou be the [[Son of God]], command that these stones be made bread." The devil, depicted with long horns, wings, and a human body with claw feet, drops three large stones to the ground. Jesus, wearing a long orange tunic and dark blue mantle, holds up his left hand with palm outward in a sign of refusal. In the following scene Jesus is portrayed on a [[pinnacle]] of the temple. Here the devil is shown with human feet, wings, and a bearded animal-like head with long locks. Jesus is dressed as before and the temple is symbolized by a small building with circular windows and a [[gable]] roof. On the right, one of the angels who came to minister unto him speaks with a third demon, who appears to be half animal and half human. The body of the last devil is yellow and he has long hair and a pointed beard. The ugliness of the demons strike a sharp contrast to the poetic portrayal of the figure of Jesus.[[File:Ermta S Baudelio Casillas de Berlanga f.jpg|thumb|Bovine. Remain inside the hermitage.]]The sequence of Christ’s [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] starts at the north wall with Christ’s entrance into [[Jerusalem]]. Jerusalem is symbolized at the right by a structure with an open door. Above are [[Battlement|crenelated]] walls with windows. Outside awaiting Christ are two boys in red and blue tunics holding olive branches in their hands. Jesus rides on the donkey side-saddle in eastern fashion, approaching from the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesus-story.net/painting_entry.htm|title=JESUS: ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM|website=www.jesus-story.net|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a halo with a cross, red hair, and beard, a teal tunic and a dark blue mantle. With his right hand he blesses as he holds a palm branch in his left hand. A baby horse accompanies the donkey Jesus is riding. Behind him follow the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]]. We can see seven full Apostles with [[Saint Peter|Peter]], who is depicted here with white hair and a beard, leading the group. The red-headed St. John follows him.[[File:A Spearman.jpg|thumb|339x339px|The Warrior of San Baudelio. Remain inside the hermitage.]]The [[Last Supper]] fills the rest of the north wall. Jesus is seated behind a table with a white cloth in the center of the composition. Many of the disciples are depicted holding knives and raising their hands as if to ask “is it me Lord?” when Jesus says “One of you will betray me.” We see St. John at Jesus’s bosom and Judas in the front of the composition. The food they are eating seem to be loaves and fish with Judas touching the fish in a bowl. As is customary, St. Peter is featured with a white beard and balding. St. Paul is also portrayed with white hair and a pointed beard, even though he was not one of the original disciples.

The [[Crucifixion]] itself appears to be missing from the walls of San Baudelio so it may have eroded with time. Logically it should follow after The Last Supper. It may well be that the Crucifixion was on the east wall near the Roman soldiers, since the Bible does mention them near the cross at the time of the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2027:54|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 27:54 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:A Horseman Hunting.jpg|left|thumb|A Horseman Hunting. Remain inside the hermitage.|165x165px]]The next surviving scene depicts the visit by the women to the tomb of Jesus early on Sunday. Originally this scene was on the left side of the south wall of the nave but was removed and currently is in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]. An angel with a green halo seems to be standing in front of the tomb itself so we do not see the stone rolled away as described in the bible. The guards stand, frightened, with bent knees, one covering his face as if to shield himself from the blinding light of the angel. At the very right of the composition, the three women approach wearing halos and holding large vases with [[Topical medication|ointment]]. An Angel is depicted wearing an orange headdress with a greenish mantle, as the three Maries approach from the right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:A Falconer.jpg|left|thumb|180x180px|A Falconer. Remain inside the hermitage.]]It seems originally that all four walls of the nave had eight large compositions, containing the life and passion of the Christ. It is highly possible at least four scenes may have included the [[Emmaus|Journey to Emmaus]], [[Doubting Thomas]], the [[Pentecost|Descent of the Holy Spirit]] on the side walls of the apse. Ideally the series would have concluded with the image of the enthroned Savior of the [[Last Judgment]]. It would have probably been similar to the apse of Saint Martin de Fenouillar with the Savior surrounded by the twelve evangelists (including Paul) and the twenty-four elders of [[Revelation]].[[File:Elephant and Castle (Fresco in San Baudelio, Spain).jpg|thumb|Elephant carrying a castle. Now in [[Museo del Prado]].|left|200x200px]]

==== Secular Frescoes ====
On the lower west wall of the Church is the scene of a wounded [[deer]] as it flees the hunter aiming at him with the loaded crossbow. The hunting of this animal is a subject very much in conformity with the iconography from ancient times and the Middle Ages. For the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]], the deer had a symbolic character of abstaining of the evil of the world. In Christian culture, this icon represents the soul. The deer is also associated with [[Christ]] triumphing over the [[Satan|dragon]], making it the metaphorical claim a hunt for souls.

Next to the wounded deer on the right is a hunter riding a [[horse]], helped by three [[dog]]s chasing [[hare]]s, which end up trapped in the forest. The hare is a symbol in Christian iconography of the fragility of the soul and strong sexual desire or lust, which must be harassed and overcome.[[File:The Camel.jpg|thumb|264x264px|Camel, now in [[The Cloisters]], New York]]Continuing to the right on the north wall is a Falconer. [[Falconry]] was considered, both in Islam and the Christian Middle Ages as one of the noblest of hunting. The falconer, exhibiting his noble [[Bird of prey|raptor]], stands in a victorious posture like a [[knight]] triumphing, with the help of faith (the Falcon), over corrupt and evil animals like hares.

Located on the north tribune of the Church, is what looks to be a [[warrior]] carrying a spear and a shield. To the right of the warrior is what looks like an [[elephant]].  The symbol of humility, the elephant is associated with the figure of Christ, who became the smallest and most obedient of humans to prevent his own death. The elephant of San Baudelio carries on its back a [[castle]], allegory of diseases and miseries that have to be borne in the course of earthly life and the weight of the sins of existence. Next to the elephant is a bear. The bear is sometimes associated with the sin of gluttony and the unknown of the caves he inhabits. Perhaps the warrior who shares the stage with him, can vanquish him.

Behind the warrior on the opposite side of the tribune a [[camel]] is depicted, an exotic animal, well known in the ancient world for their roles in the war, transport and the circus. The camel is associated with Early Christian art along with the [[Magi]] and other biblical stories. Judging by this camel’s deformations, the artist of San Baudelio did not know what a camel looked like. To the left of the camel, vegetation appears as ornaments as well as textile patterns. They are arranged in circles, organized in rows, starting with the smaller ones. On the wall near the central pillar are two [[greyhound]]s. On the east wall at the start of the staircase there is a two faced [[Bovinae|bovine]].

There is debate as to the origin of the paintings.

It is believed that the frescos were painted at the same time by two different painters. An older painter and a younger painter.  The apse painted by the Master of Baudelio would have been painted first, after the entire mural scheme had been decided. Assembling the pictorial program required painters to collect images into sections within the church structure and into registers along the wall. Although at San Baudelio the registers were painted at the same time, certainly the lower zone would have been painted first. Perhaps living under the [[Muslim]] regime longer, accounts for the [[Moors|Moorish]] influence on the older painter’s use of Islamic themes. The younger painter might have been more versed in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] Christian iconography, possibly, because San Baudelio was in the wilderness between the Christian and Muslim border. Also, those of San Baudelio is similar to the fresco found in the found in The Church of The Vera Cruz De Maderuelo ([[Segovia]]).

'''San Giacomo della Spada''' ("Saint James of the Sword") is a  [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church in [[Alcamo]], in the  [[province of Trapani]], adjoning it there was the ''Hospice of Pilgrims''.

== Historical hints ==
The church rose as a  chapel dedicated to the Saint who gave the name to one of the most ancient quarters in Alcamo; it is mentioned in two notorial deeds dating back to 1380&lt;ref name="catgui"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.36, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a document of the Episcopal [[Curia]] in 1435.

The church was built before 1529 and reconstructed in 1571 and in 1596, then widened between the years 1625-36. From the architectonic point of view, it is  beautiful: there was an altar with a painting of Saint James and some pilgrims on the way to the  [[Santiago de Compostela|Sanctuary of Compostela]]; on the sides of the altar there were placed two statues of Saint James and [[Saint Andrew]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/biblioteche/203-biblioteca-san-giacomo-de-spada.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1866 laws on the suppression of religious Corporations, the church was  confiscated and given to the town [[municipality]], which used it as a Civic Library from 1875 to 1968 .&lt;ref name="catgui"/&gt; 
Today (June 2018), after the last restoration works, it is the seat of the [[Ethnographic Museum of Musical Instruments "Gaspare Cannone"]].

== The Confraternity ==
Since 1569 it hosted a  [[Confraternity]] of Saint James of the Pilgrims, with the scope of assisting pilgrims, and the Confraternity of [[Saint Christopher]], founded 40 years before, joined it;&lt;ref name="catcon"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.89-90, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; both of them had the running of a [[hospice]] for pilgrims which had to be founded.

The two confraternities had the privilege of “Fiera franca”, that is any [[tax exemption]] during the period of the feast, so the money saved, together with that one saved in the following years, was to be used for the assistance of  pilgrims and the building of a hospice. As the periods were coincident for both Congregations, this provoked a quarrel between them and a fusion of the two [[institutions]] in one Confraternity, later elevated to a Company in 1619.

Its brethren had a deep blue [[sackcloth]], with mantles and hats, and they wore a red [[cross]] as [[emblem]] and  a cane on their hands, like pilgrims. After the change to a Company occurred in 1619 (as affirms the historian Ignazio de Blasi), they probably wore "a sackcloth and white [[visors]], with the emblem of the cross ending like a sword, the characteristic insignia of the glorious Saint James, on the shoulders" .
[[File:Biblioteca_Multimediale_(Alcamo)_01.jpg|thumb|The Interior today]]
In 1642 they were renewed the  privilege of ''Fiera franca'' and built, next to the church, a Hospice for pilgrims, working from  1649 to 1746,&lt;ref name="catgui"/&gt;  and that they had not completed in 1649 yet. These hospices were located in the town centres and carried out different activities, assisting poor or sick people, widows, orphans and [[foundlings]],&lt;ref&gt;Vincenzo Regina, Cavalieri ospedalieri e pellegrini per le antiche vie della provincia di Trapani, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; much more when the number of pilgrims on long distances decreased a lot.

In 1749 the Company did not run the hospice any longer, and probably it had been dissolved before; the Congregation of Charity, that  administered its financial incomes, as they did not host pilgrims going to the [[Holy Land]] or to the various sanctuaries, assigned those financial returns to the [[poorhouse]] (Ricovero di Mendicità) which had to be founded using the patrimony inherited from the De Blasi Mangione.

'''Service innovation''' is used to refer to many things. These include but not limited to:

# [[Innovation]] in [[Service (economics)|services]], in ''service products''&amp;nbsp;– new or improved service products (commodities or public services). Often this is contrasted with “[[technological innovation]]”, though service products can have technological elements. This sense of service innovation is closely related to [[service design]] and "new service development".
# Innovation in ''service processes''&amp;nbsp;– new or improved ways of designing and producing services. This may include innovation in service delivery systems, though often this will be regarded instead as a service product innovation. Innovation of this sort may be technological, technique- or expertise-based,or a matter of work organization (e.g. restructuring work between professionals and [[paraprofessional]]s).
# Innovation in ''service firms'', organizations, and industries&amp;nbsp;– organizational innovations, as well as service product and process innovations, and the management of innovation processes, within service organizations.

== Definitions ==
The [[Finland|Finnish]] research agency [[Tekes (agency)|TEKES]] defines service innovation as "a new or significantly improved service concept that is taken into practice. It can be for example a new customer interaction channel, a distribution system or a technological concept or a combination of them. A service innovation always includes replicable elements that can be identified and systematically reproduced in other cases or environments. The replicable element can be the service outcome or the service process as such or a part of them. A service innovation benefits both the service producer and customers and it improves its developer’s competitive edge. A service innovation is a service product or service process that is based on some technology or systematic method. In services however, the innovation does not necessarily relate to the novelty of the technology itself but the innovation often lies in the non-technological areas. Service innovations can for instance be new solutions in the customer interface, new distribution methods, novel application of technology in the service process, new forms of operation with the supply chain or new ways to organize and manage services."

Another definition proposed by Van Ark et al. (2003){{ref|vanark}} states it as a "new or considerably changed service concept, client interaction channel, service delivery system or technological concept that individually, but most likely in combination, leads to one or more (re)new(ed) service functions that are new to the firm and do change the service/good offered on the market and do require structurally new technological, human or organizational capabilities of the service organization." This definition covers the notions of technological and non-technological innovation. Non-technological innovations in services mainly arise from investment in intangible inputs.

== Service Innovation Research ==
Many literatures on what makes for successful innovations of this kind comes from the New Service Development research field (e.g. Johne and Storey, 1998;{{ref|Johne_Storey}} Nijssen et al., 2006{{ref|Nijssen}}). Service design practitioners have also extensively discussed the features of effective service products and experiences. One of the key aspects of many service activities is the high involvement of the client/customer/user in the production of the final service. Without this co-production (i.e. interactivity of service production), the service would often not be created. This co-production, together with the intangibility of many service products, causes service innovation to often take forms rather different from those familiar through studies of innovation in manufacturing. Innovation researchers have, for this reason, stressed that much service innovation is hard to capture in traditional categories like product or process innovation. The co-production process, and the interactions between service provider and client, can also form the focus of innovation. A growing number of professional association have service sections that promote service innovation research, including [[INFORMS]], [[ISSIP]], and others.

=== Areas of innovation – den Hertog's model ===
Thus den Hertog (2000){{ref|den Hertog}} who identifies four “dimensions” of service innovation, takes quite a different direction to much standard innovation theorizing.
# '''The Service Concept''' refers to a service concept that is new to its particular market&amp;nbsp;– a new service in effect, or in Edvardsson’s (1996,{{ref|Edvardsson1}} 1997{{ref|Edvardsson2}}) terminology, a “new value proposition”. Many service innovations involve fairly intangible characteristics of the service, and others involve new ways of organizing solutions to problems (be these new or familiar ones). Examples might include new types of bank account or information service.  In some service sectors, such as retail, there is much talk about “formats”, such as the organization of shops in different ways (more or less specialized, more or less focused on quality or cost-saving, etc.).
# '''The Client Interface''' refers to innovation in the interface between the service provider and its customers. Clients are often highly involved in service production, and changes in the way in which they play their roles and are related to suppliers can be major innovations for many services. Examples might include a greater amount of self-service for clients visiting service organizations. There is a French literature on service innovation that focuses especially on this type of innovation, identifying it as innovation in “servuction”.
# '''The Service Delivery System''' also often relates to the linkage between the service provider and its client, since delivery does involve an interaction across this interface. However, there are also internal organizational arrangements that relate to the ways in which service workers perform their job so as to deliver the critical services.  Much innovation concerns the electronic delivery of services, but we can also think of, for instance, transport and packaging innovations (e.g. pizza delivery). An emerging concept of SDP is the idea of taking a "factory" approach to Service Innovation. A [http://www.accenture.com/Global/Research_and_Insights/By_Industry/Communications/ServiceSolutions.htm "service factory" approach] is a standardized and [[industrialized]] environment for more effective service innovation, development and operations for the IP era.
# '''Technological Options''' resemble most familiar process innovation in manufacturing sectors. New information technology is especially important to services, since it allows for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the information-processing elements that are, as we have seen, prevalent to a great extent in services sectors. We also often see physical products accompanying services, such as customer loyalty cards and “smart” RFID cards for transactions, and a wide range of devices for communication services.

In practice, the majority of service innovations will almost certainly involve various combinations of these four dimensions. For instance:
* A new IT system (technology dimension) may be used to enable customer self-service (interface dimension) as in the case of a bank contacting its customers.
* The ability to track one’s order or the location of an item that one has posted or is expecting to receive.
* Services may be delivered electronically, as in the case of much online banking and cash withdrawals from ATMs.
* A new service allowing a client to examine various options and calculate what they would be paying with different types of accounts.
* A new service will often require a new service delivery system, and changes at the client interface.

An elaboration of this model to suggest six dimensions of innovation was developed in the course of work on creative sectors, by Green, Miles and Rutter. [http://www.nesta.org.uk/assets/pdf/hidden_innovation_creative_sectors_working_paper_NESTA.pdf] As well as Technology and Production process, four dimensions were specified whose linkages are very strong in creative sectors like videogames, advertising and design: Cultural Product, Cultural Concept, Delivery and User Interface.

The service innovation literature is surprisingly poorly related to the literature on new product development, which has spawned a line of study on new service development. This often focuses on the managerially important issue of what makes for successful service innovation.  See for example Johne and Storey (1998),{{ref|Johne_Storey|4|b}} who reviewed numerous New Service Development studies.

=== Services Features and Innovation Potential: Miles (1993) influential article on 'Service Innovation' ===

Ian Miles of the [[Manchester Institute of Innovation Research]] (MIoIR), The University of Manchester, is one of the scholars on the study of 'Service Innovation'. He coined the term in his 1993 article in the journal ''FUTURES'', (Vol. 25, No. 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;653–672,) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V65-45P15VV-7C&amp;_user=494590&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F1993&amp;_fmt=abstract&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=5805&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000024058&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=494590&amp;md5=8c83cb9d00e681e9af5eb61b70d80682&amp;ref=full]. He listed a series of characteristic features of services, and associated these with particular types of innovation.  Such innovations are often aimed at overcoming problems associated with service characteristics like the difficulty in demonstrating the service to the client, or the problems in storing and building up stocks of the service.

After Miles (1993), numerous studies were made, one of the more recent studies that reaches similar conclusions was from a qualitative survey of service organizations by Candi (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Candi (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;) Note that the “product” related innovations below have a lot in common with new service development as discussed above.  In the following list, features of services are linked to innovation strategies by the symbol &gt;&gt;&gt;.
# '''Features of services associated with service production'''
## Technology and Plant (Low levels of capital equipment; heavy investment in buildings &gt;&gt;&gt; Reduce costs of buildings by use of teleservices, toll-free phone numbers, etc.)
## Labor (Some services highly professional, esp. requiring interpersonal skills);  others relatively unskilled, often involving casual or part-time labor.  Specialist knowledge may be important, but rarely technological skills (other than Information Technology) &gt;&gt;&gt; Reduce reliance on expensive and scarce skills by use of expert systems and related innovations; Relocation of key operations to areas of low labor costs (using telecommunications to maintain coordination).
## Organization of Labor Process (Workforce often engaged in craft-like production with limited management control of details of work. &gt;&gt;&gt; Use IT to monitor workforce (e.g. tachometers and mobile communications for transport staff;  Aim for 'flatter' organizational structures, with data from field and front-office workers directly entering databases and thence Management Information Systems.)
## Features of Production (Production is often non-continuous and economies of scale are limited &gt;&gt;&gt; Standardize production (e.g. 'fast-food' chains), reorganize in more assembly-line-like feature with more standard components and higher division of labor.)
## Organization of Industry  (Some services state-run public services; Others often small-scale with high preponderance of family firms and self-employed &gt;&gt;&gt; Externalization and privatization of public services; combination of small firms using network technologies; IT-based service management systems.)
# '''Features of services associated with service product'''
## Nature of Product (Immaterial, often information-intensive;  Hard to store or transport; Process and product hard to distinguish. &gt;&gt;&gt; Add material components (e.g. client cards, membership cards).  Use telematics for ordering, reservation, and if possible&amp;nbsp;– delivery.  Maintain elements of familiar 'user-interfaces'.)
## Features of Product (Often customized to consumer requirements.&gt;&gt;&gt; Use of Electronic Data Interchange or Internet for remote input of client details; use software to record client requirements and match to service product.
# '''Features of services associated with services consumption'''
## Delivery of Product (Production and consumption coterminous in time and space; often client or supplier has to move to meet the other party. &gt;&gt;&gt; Telematics; Automated Teller Machines and equivalent information services.)
## Role of Consumer (Services are ''consumer-intensive'', requiring inputs from consumer into design/production process. &gt;&gt;&gt;  Consumer use of standardized ''menus and new modes of delivering orders''.)
## Organization of Consumption (Often hard to separate production from consumption; Self-service in formal and informal economies commonplace.&gt;&gt;&gt; Increased use of self-service, utilizing existing consumer (or intermediate producer) technology&amp;nbsp;– e.g. telephones, PCs&amp;nbsp;– and user-friendly software interfaces.)
# '''Features of services associated with services markets'''
## Organization of Markets (Some services delivered via public sector bureaucratic provision; Some costs are invisibly bundled with goods (e.g. retail sector).&gt;&gt;&gt; Introduction of ''quasi-markets'' and/or privatization of services; New modes of charging (''pay per'' society), new reservation systems; more volatility in pricing using features of EPOS and related systems.)
## Regulation (Professional regulation common in some services. &gt;&gt;&gt; Use of databases by regulatory institutions and service providers to supply and examine performance indicators and diagnostic evidence.)
## Marketing (Difficult to demonstrate products in advance.&gt;&gt;&gt; Guarantees; demonstration packages (e.g. ''demo'' software, shareware, trial periods of use).)

Additionally, a number of more general tendencies in the innovation process in services have been noted.  These include:

# The industrialization of services, involving efforts to standardize services, to yield service products of predictable characteristics and quality, with economies of scale and improved delivery times. This typically involves the introduction of high levels of division of labor, with the use of pre-packaged and automated elements (such as pre-prepared meals, word processed templates for form letters, and the like). Standardization of the service products has become a competitive strategy for many firms.
# Organizational is innovation. Survey data suggest that services place particular emphasis on organizational change. Many innovations in services involve combinations of specific new technologies together with organization change. The role of organizational innovations in services is very apparent&amp;nbsp;– developments such as supermarkets and other self-service facilities are significant in the development of modern service industries. Such organizational innovations will often have a technological dimension, whether this be very basic (e.g. shopping trolleys), or relatively high-tech (EPOS&amp;nbsp;– electronic point of sale&amp;nbsp;– equipment or ATMs linked into networks).
# An important trajectory of organizational change has been towards [[self-servicing]], without necessarily following this development all the way toward the vision of the client sitting at home interacting with the service provider via a remote terminal. Instead, reorganization of the facilities of the service provider permits customer self-service in the service establishment, saving on labor costs and often increasing user satisfaction as it is possible to make decisions anonymously and at one's own pace.
# Beyond self-servicing, the involvement of clients as coproducers is particularly important for knowledge-intensive business services, with the emphasis being laid upon clients' role in advancing the expertise of service suppliers, and identifying new avenues for its application. Web2.0 has brought “''user innovation''” to the fore in electronic services.

== Service Innovation Design Methodology ==
There have been many methods for service innovation design and one of these is Dominant Innovation methodology which is a systematic approach to discover the gaps of service value delivery through a [[Scenario planning|scenario-based]] mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dominantinnovation.com/english/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218220259/http://dominantinnovation.com/english/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-18|title=Dominant Innovation Official Website|website=www.dominantinnovation.com|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant Innovation methodology is based on a visible/ and invisible matrix to map the growth gaps of product value and further develop an innovation ecosystem between evidence and supply sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|last2=AbuAli|first2=Mohamed|date=2011-01-01|title=Innovative Product Advanced Service Systems (I-PASS): methodology, tools, and applications for dominant service design|journal=The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology|volume=52|issue=9–12|pages=1161–1173|doi=10.1007/s00170-010-2763-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design and service innovation have also been combined in the context of business acceleration using the Minimum Valuable Service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pinheiro|first=Tenny|date=2014-01-01|title=The Service Startup - Design Thinking gets Lean|url=http://www.theservicestartup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MVS is an open source methodology that integrates [[lean startup]] and Service Design and it has been largely adopted by startups and large organizations like [[General Electric|Ge]] and [[Cisco]] in Silicon Valley.

== Service Innovation using IoT and Big Data Analytics ==
In the traditional [[product-service system]] (PSS) business model, industries develop product with value-added service instead of single product itself, and provide their customers services that are needed. In this relationship, the market goal of manufacturers is not one-time product selling, but continuous profit from customers by total service solution, which can satisfy unmet customers’ needs.   Most of PSS systems focus on ‘human-generated or human-related data’ instead of ‘machine-generated data or industrial data’, which may include machine controllers, sensors, manufacturing systems, etc.  Early work using web-based product monitoring for remote product services including GM OnStar Telematics, Otis Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM), and GE Medical InSite during 1990s.  Service innovation using web-based system was further developed for e-service applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|date=2003-01-01|title=Smart products and service systems for e-business transformation|journal=International Journal of Technology Management|volume=26|issue=1|pages=45–52|doi=10.1504/IJTM.2003.003143|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.530}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, more advanced approaches using predictive analytics and cyber physical systems (CPS) can harvest  large amounts of data of a variety of types to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations and other useful information from industrial and manufacturing systems and integrate with business automation software for improved productivity and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|last2=Kao|first2=Hung-An|last3=Yang|first3=Shanhu|date=2014-01-01|title=Service innovation and smart analytics for industry 4.0 and big data environment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827114000857|journal=Procedia CIRP|volume=16|pages=3–8|doi=10.1016/j.procir.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imscenter.net/|title=Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems             —                  IMS Center|website=www.imscenter.net|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service innovation and public policy ==
In recent years policy makers have begun to consider the potential for promoting services innovation as part of their economic development strategies. Such consideration has, in part, been driven by the growing contribution that services activities make to national and regional economies. It also reflects the emerging recognition that traditional policy measures such as R&amp;D grants and technology transfer supports have been developed from a manufacturing perspective of the innovation process.

The [[European Commission]] and the [[OECD]] has been particularly active in seeking to generate reflection on services innovation and its policy implications. This has resulted in studies such as the OECD’s reports into knowledge intensive services,{{ref|OECD}} and the European Commission Expert Group report on services innovation&amp;nbsp;– the report of the group, "Fostering Innovation in Services"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europe-innova.org/servlet/Doc?cid=7550&amp;lg=EN Europe Innovatiob] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021052443/http://www.europe-innova.org/servlet/Doc?cid=7550&amp;lg=EN |date=2007-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various TrendChart studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proinno-europe.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&amp;topicID=104&amp;parentID=52 Pro-innovation Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924232640/http://www.proinno-europe.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&amp;topicID=104&amp;parentID=52 |date=2009-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission has also launched a number of Knowledge Intensive Services Platforms designed to act as laboratories for new public policies for services innovation. Few economic development agencies at the member state level, and fewer still at the regional level, have translated this new thinking on services innovation into policy action.  Finland is an exception, where [[knowledge intensive business services]] have been a focus of much regional work (esp. the [[Uusimaa]] region).

Finland has been active in thinking about the policy implications of services innovation. This has seen '''TEKES'''&amp;nbsp;– the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation&amp;nbsp;– launch the ''SERVE'' initiative, designed to support ‘Finnish companies and research organisations in the development of innovative service concepts that can be reproduced or replicated and where some technology or systematic method is applied .’{{ref|Tekes_definition|a}}  [[Germany]] has also undertaken initiatives for services R&amp;D, and [[Canada]] and [[Norway]] have programs as well.

Ireland has been considering a services-focused innovation policy, with ''Forfás''&amp;nbsp;– its national policy and advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation&amp;nbsp;– having undertaken a review of Ireland’s existing policy and support measures for innovation, and outlined options for a new policy and framework environment in support of service innovation activity.{{ref|Forfas}}

At the regional level, limited information is available on how Europe’s regions are responding to the challenges presented by service innovation. [CM International] has recently published a European survey on services innovation and regional policy responses. The results of this suggest that very few regions in France, the UK and Ireland have an explicit focus on services and innovation. Many do, however, express a desire to address this issue in the coming future.{{ref|CMInternational}}

[[File:Symbol of Signalism, an international neo-avant-garde movement.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol of Signalism]]
'''Signalism''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Сигнализам}} / Signalizam; from: [[Latin language|lat.]] Signum – ''sign, signal'') represents an international neo-[[avant-garde]] literal and art movement. It gathered wider support base both in former [[Yugoslavia]] and the world in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11166 "Signalism in lexicons"] (entries from Yugoslav editions, in English), Signalism @ Project Rastko, e-library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Živković, Živan. [http://www.rastko.org.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11292 "Quarter of century of Signalism"], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins and methods of Signalism ==

The beginning of Signalism dates back to 1959 when its founder and main theoretician [[Miroljub Todorović]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11297 Miroljub Todorović: Bio-bibliography], Signalism @ Project Rastko, e-library&lt;/ref&gt; started with his linguistic experiments. His main belief was that there can be no significant leap forward in poetry without revolutionizing its main medium – the language.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Daligand. [http://www.rastko.rs/rastko/delo/12312 Signalisme et pansemiotique] (2007), Signalism @ Project Rastko, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Pet., "Signalizam", an entry in: ''Enciklopedija srpskog naroda'', Belgrade, 2008, str. 1002; also: B.S-P-, ''Todorović Miroljub'' in: ''Enciklopedija srpskog naroda'', Belgrade, 2008, str. 1133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of Signalism in [[Serbian literature]] and [[Serbian culture|culture]], with its tendency to revolutionize other arts as well (visual, theater, comics,&lt;ref&gt;Branislav Miltojević. ''Antologija niškog stripa'', Prosveta, Niš, 2004, pp. 72, 265-268&lt;/ref&gt; music and movies),&lt;ref&gt;Pavle Levi. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVYIFprvPVkC&amp;pg=PA98 ''Cinema by Other Means''], Oxford University Press, 2012, pp 98-104&lt;/ref&gt; came from the need to eliminate the spent models carried on by poetic and cultural traditions, as well as from the necessity to take on the challenges and spirit of the modern technological and electronic civilization. In its program ("Manifesto" and other guiding texts)&lt;ref&gt;Miroljub Todorović. [http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11192 ''Manifestos and other Essays''] (1969-1975)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in its art pieces, Signalism made a clean break from the principles of neoromantism and late [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] still governing Serbian literature. Its goal was set to radically change poetry both through content and form, and make it compatible with the contemporary times.

Revolutionizing of the poetic language started with the introduction of the symbols, formulas and linguistic forms of the "hard" sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, biochemistry and astronomy). Furthermore, the language was made visual by dispersing words and sentences into syllables and letters forming visually recognizable patterns,&lt;ref&gt;Adriano Spatola, Brendan W. Hennessey, Guy Bennett. [https://books.google.com/books?id=h60aAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=signalism&amp;dq=signalism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXqlU9f8C8-M0wWh1ICoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Toward Total Poetry''], Otis Books/Seismicity Editions, 2008, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as by introducing non-verbal symbols into the text (drawings, photographs, graphs…) for the purpose of creating a collage of verbal and visual elements.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. dr Dagmar Burkhart, [http://signalizamusvetu.blogspot.com/2014/03/prof.html „Od Carmina figurata ka vizuelnoj poeziji"], ''Signal'', Belgrade, no. 25-26-27, 2003, 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt; This first phase of Signalism is often referred to as ''Scientism'', with the most prominent examples including the books "Planeta" (Planet, 1965) and "Putovanje u Zvezdaliju" (A trip to Starland, 1971) as well as poetry cycles "Belančevina" (Protein), "Kiseonik" (Oxygen), "Ožilište" (Nursery) and others in which the topics are Space, Time and Matter.

In their for decade long research and creative pursuit that followed, Signalists significantly expanded cognitive boundaries and genre profile of modern Serbian poetry. Signalist poetry can be divided into two main forms: verbal and non-verbal. Verbal poetry consists of scientist, aleatoric (random), stochastic, technological, phenomenological, slang and apeironistic poetry. Non-verbal poetry subtypes include visual, object, sound and gestual poetry.

Signalism made significant advances in prose (experimental novel and short story). There is also a number of significant Signalist children literature accomplishments. In visual art strides are made in [[body art]], [[mail art]],&lt;ref&gt;Džon Held. ''Mejl-Art signalizam'', ''Književni magazin'', broj 91-92, Belgrade, 2009, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; performance and [[conceptual art]].

Three manifestos helped define Signalism as a neo-avant-garde movement that negates literal, artistic and cultural heritage, poetic and aesthetic conventions and canonical ways of creativity by insisting on creative experimentation – "Manifesto of scientific poetry" (1968), "Signalist manifesto (Regulae poesis)" (1969) and "Signalism" (1970).

The movement was significantly boosted by the [[Signal, International Review of Signalist Research|international magazine "Signal"]], inaugurated in 1970. Nine issues of "Signal" appeared between 1970 and 1973, presenting a number of domestic and international artists, as well as printing bibliographical data about the avant-garde publications all around the world. From 1973 until 1995 magazine could not be published, mainly for financial reasons. From 1995 to 2004 another 21 issues of "Signal" appeared. The new release of "Signal" revitalized the Signalist movement and brought an army of young artists into the movement in 21st century.

On the work of Miroljub Todorović and Signalism movement that he had founded, three doctoral dissertations have been defended:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11296 "Three dissertations about Signalism" (Biserka Rajčić: 'Kornhauser's study'; Dragoljub P. Đurić: 'Dissertation on Signalism'; Radovan Vučković: 'Radical disproval of tradition)], Signalism @ Project Rastko&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Julian Kornhauser, Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland, 1980; Dr. Živan Živković, Faculty of Philology in Belgrade, 1991 and Dr. Milivoje Pavlović, University of Kosovska Mitrovica, 2002. Twenty monographs have also been published on the same subject.

== The most important authors and works of Signalism ==

Many poets, writers and painters accepted the basic concepts of Signalism, further developing and spreading the ideas of this Serbian (Yugoslav) neo-avant-garde movement.

Besides the founder of Signalism [[Miroljub Todorović]] (''Kyberno'', 1970; ''The Pig is an Excellent Swimmer'', 1971; ''Bumpkin Shows Off'', slang poetry, 1974; ''Insect on the Temple'', 1978; ''Algol'', 1980, ''Textum'', 1981; ''Chinese Erotism'', 1983; ''Knock-Out'', 1984; ''I Mount Rocinante Again'', 1987; ''Water-Snake Drinks Water'', 1988; ''The Diary of Avant-Garde'', 1990; ''Electric Chair'', slang poetry, 1998; ''I’ve Just Opened my Mail'', 2000; ''It Walked Into my Ear'', slang stories, 2005; ''Blue Wind'', 2006; ''Slang Stories'', 2007;) important contributors to the theory and practice of Signalism include [[Marina Abramović]], [[Vlada Stojiljković]], [[Zvonimir Kostić Palanski]], [[Slobodan Pavićević]] (''Flowers’ Silicates'', 1973; ''Roadworks'', 1984), [[Milivoje Pavlović]] (''White Book'', 1974; ''The World In Signals'', 1996), [[Zoran Popović (writer)|Zoran Popović]], [[Ljubiša Jocić]] (''Moonshine in Tetrapack'', 1975; ''What’s the Time'', 1976: ''Essays on Signalism'', 1994), [[Jaroslav Supek]], [[Zvonko Sarić]] (''Overcoat until the Dawn'', 2001; ''Soul Catcher'', 2003), [[Bogislav Marković]] (''Altai Dust'', 2006), [[Ilija Bakić]] (''Prenatal Life'', 1997; ''New Babylon'', 1998; ''Protoplasm'', 2003; ''The Autumn of Gatherers'', 2007; ''To be Continued'', 2009), [[Slobodan Škerović]] (''Indigo'', 2005; ''All Colors of Arcturus'', 2006; ''Chimera or Borg'', 2008), [[Žarko Đurović (writer)|Žarko Đurović]] (''The World of Signalism'', 2002), [[Dušan Vidaković]], [[Dobrivoje Jevtić]], [[Dejan Bogojević]], [[Andrej Tišma]], [[Dobrica Kamperelić]], [[Milivoj Anđelković]], [[Zoran Stefanović]] and others.

== Critical reception ==

Numerous domestic and international critics and theoreticians hold Signalism in high regard:

Prof. [[Miloš Bandić]]: "Signalism is – after [[Zenitism]], [[Surrealism]] and the movement of social literature – the next and autochthonous literary and artistic movement in Serbian literature of 20th century. At the same time, in contemporary Yugoslav literature and culture, Signalism is confirmed as an exclusive modern dimension and a separate artistic form and production. Without it all would probably be poorer and who knows how deprived."

[[Oskar Davičo]], famous writer: "For the first time from the appearance of Surrealism in the twenties, we can joyfully confirm that with exploration of Miroljub Todorović, Serbian poetry can again catch up with the genuine worldwide avant-garde explorations."

[[Zoran Markuš]], visual arts critic: "Signalism is our parallel phenomena within the brackets of the most extreme avant-garde and that explains its international expansion, approval and importance in certain artistic and intellectual circles."

[[Dave Oz]], Canadian multimedia artist: "True essence of Signalism is that it expects appearance of planetary consciousness."

[[Gillo Dorfles]], Italian arts theoretician: "Signalism means a step forward, in relation to concrete poetry, visual poetry and the art of the sign."

Prof. Milivoje Pavlović: "Thanks to Miroljub Todorović and the group that follows him, Signalism with its mainstream represents the arc which connects in a creative manner avant-garde aims from the period between wars with the contemporary epoch, bringing valuable innovations and connecting Serbian art with the modern world’s processes." (From the book ''The Keys of Signalist Poetics'')

The {{lang|it|'''Teatro Comunale di Firenze'''|italic=no}} is an [[opera house]] in [[Florence]], Italy. It was originally built as the open-air amphitheatre, the '''Politeama Fiorentino Vittorio Emanuele''', which was inaugurated on 17 May 1862 with a production of 
[[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and which seated 6,000 people. It became the focus on cultural life in the city. After closure caused by fire, it reopened in April 1864 and acquired a roof in 1882. By 1911 it had both electricity and heating.
[[Image:Teatro Comunale di Firenze 04.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Theatre: street view]]
In 1930 the building was taken over by the city authorities who renamed it the ''Teatro Comunale''.  Bombing during the [[Second World War]] damaged the building once again, and other problems closed it for three years in 1958.  Finally, in May 1961, the then-modernized theatre reopened with [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlo]]''. It had become a 2,000 seat elliptically shaped auditorium consisting of a large orchestra section, one tier of boxes, and two wide semicircular galleries, which betray the building's amphitheatre origins.

As the theatre became more closely associated with Italy's first and most important music festival, the annual [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]] which had begun in 1931 as a triennial festival and, except for the war years, became an annual one after 1937, so its name was changed once again for the festivals to the {{lang|it|'''Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino'''|italic=no}}.

'''Tina Yvonne Andrews''' (born April 23, 1951) is an [[United States|American]] [[Acting|actress]], [[television producer]], [[screenwriter]], [[author]] and [[playwright]]. She is known for writing the TV mini-series, ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal'' (2000), which was the first time that the Jefferson-Hemings relationship had been explored on TV, and with Hemings portrayed as a fully realized woman. In 2001, Andrews was the first [[African American]] to win the [[Writers Guild of America]] award for Original Long Form, for her script for this mini-series.&lt;ref name="TA website"/&gt; Andrews had earlier explored her interest in Hemings with a play, ''The Mistress of Monticello'', which was read at a workshop in Chicago in 1985.

==Biography==
Tina Yvonne Andrews was born and raised in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She attended [[New York University]], where her major studies were in [[Drama]].&lt;ref name="TA website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tinaandrews.com/Tina_Website/Biography.html |title=Official Tina Andrews website |publisher=Tina Andrews |accessdate=2008-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628005634/http://www.tinaandrews.com/Tina_Website/Biography.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent many years acting in such series as ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', where she originated the role of [[Valerie Grant]] from 1975 to 1977. Her character was part of the first interracial romance shown on daytime television.&lt;ref name="TA website"/&gt; She also acted in the influential TV mini-series, ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' (1977), as Aurelia, the girlfriend of the character Kunta Kinte.

From this role, she met and became professional partners with [[Alex Haley]], the author of the book on which it was based and the screenplay for the series. Haley hired Andrews to work with him on the miniseries ''Alex Haley's Great Men of African Descent'', which aired on [[PBS]]. Haley also mentored Andrews' literary work.&lt;ref name="TA website"/&gt;

Andrews is married to Stephen Gaines, an award-winning producer in theatre, and documentary filmmaker.&lt;ref name="Superiorpics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superiorpics.com/tina_andrews/ |title=The Tina Andrews Picture Pages |publisher=www.superiorpics.com |accessdate=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
Tina Andrews had been long interested in the story of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. She wrote a play, ''The Mistress of Monticello'', which was produced in Chicago in 1985 to good notices.&lt;ref name="connecting"&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/samneill/films/shhistory.txt Executive Producer Craig Anderson, Writer Tina Andrews, Director Charles Haid and Julia Jefferson Westerinen (Jefferson-Hemings descendant), "CONNECTING THE DOTS OF HISTORY: The Research and Points of View behind ''SALLY HEMINGS: AN AMERICAN SCANDAL''"], (part of CBS press kit for the mini-series), hosted at ibiblio, Sam Neill films, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; About ten years later, her play was brought to the notice of producer Craig Anderson, and he started working with Andrews on developing it as a script for TV.&lt;ref name="connecting"/&gt; Her play was produced in staged readings at the Southampton Cultural Center in February 2013.&lt;ref name="ctr"&gt;[http://www.southamptonculturalcenter.org/node/1141 ''The Mistress of Monticello''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011201431/http://www.southamptonculturalcenter.org/node/1141 |date=2014-10-11 }}, Southampton Cultural Center, accessed 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrews ended up working on the Hemings project for nearly 16 years. She did research, both on Hemings, about whom little is known, and Jefferson. Craig Anderson had optioned the rights to historian [[Fawn McKay Brodie]]'s 1974 biography of Jefferson, which had explored the possibility of the long-rumored relationship with Hemings. She concluded that they did have a liaison and children. While Andrews was working on her script, a [[DNA]] study in 1998 demonstrated a match between the male lines of descendants of Hemings and Jefferson, which shifted the consensus of major historians of Jefferson, such as [[Joseph Ellis]]. He announced that he believed that Jefferson had a long-term relationship with Hemings and fathered all her children. Andrews completed her script, and the team took it to production.&lt;ref name="connecting"/&gt;

In 2000, CBS aired ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal''. It was directed by [[Charles Haid]] and starred [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Hemings and [[Sam Neill]] as Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: 'Sally Hemings: An American Scandal'|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/sally-hemings-an-american-scandal-1117778671/|accessdate=August 22, 2014|publisher=Variety.com|date=February 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As PBS noted of the mini-series in a ''Frontline'' program, ''Jefferson's Blood'' (2000), about the Jefferson-Hemings controversy, "Though many quarreled with the portrayal of Hemings as unrealistically modern and heroic, no major historian challenged the series' premise that Hemings and Jefferson had a 38-year relationship that produced children."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/ "The History of a Secret"], Frontline: ''Jefferson's Blood'', PBS, 1995–2011, accessed 5 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrews has also written screenplays, including the movie, ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' (1998).

==Other literary works==
Following the production of the mini-series in 2000, Andrews published the non-fiction book ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal: The Struggle to Tell the Controversial Truth'' (2001). It recounts her work over 16 years to bring Hemings' story to a larger audience. The book was published by Malibu Press.

She wrote an essay for ''The First Time I Got Paid For It: Writers Tales From the Hollywood Trenches'' (2002).

*Andrews novel, ''The Hollywood Dolls'' (2009), was published by Malibu Press.&lt;ref name="TA website"/&gt;
*Her ''Charlotte Sophia: Myth, Madness, and the Moor'' (2010) is a historical novel about [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg]], the wife of King [[George III]] of England. A paperback edition was published in 2013. She explores the life of the queen, building on a 21st theory that she had a black ancestor in the 13th century. Historians do not agree on this theory, and also argue that an ancestor so far removed means little, as Charlotte was raised in the Germanic culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/race-monarchy Stuart Jeffries, 'Was this Britain's first black queen?'], ''The Guardian'', 11 March 2009, accessed 9 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdrawing was used extensively by 15th century painters like [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. These artists "underdrew" with a brush, using hatching strokes for shading, using water-based black paint, before [[underpainting]] and [[overpainting]] with oils.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Cennino D'Andrea Cennini]] (14th century most likely) describes a different type of underdrawing, made with graded tones rather than hatching, for [[egg tempera]].

In some cases, underdrawing can be clearly visualized using [[infrared]] reflectography because [[carbon black]] pigments absorb infrared light, whereas opaque pigments such as lead white are transparent with infrared light.  Underdrawing in many works, for example, the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)]] or the [[Arnolfini Portrait]], reveals that artists made [[pentimento|alterations]], sometimes radical ones, to their compositions.

The history of '''Western painting''' represents a continuous, though disrupted, tradition from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] until the present time.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Bruce ''Art of the Western World: From Ancient Greece to Post Modernism''. Simon and Schuster, 1981, [http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=25&amp;pid=403665 Simonsays.com] accessed 27 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-19th century it was primarily concerned with [[Representational art|representational]] and [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] modes of production, after which time more [[Modern art|modern]], [[Abstract art|abstract]] and [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] forms gained favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Aest/AestCrod.htm |title=Explaining Modernism W.

Initially serving imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Baroque]] era artists received private commissions from a more educated and prosperous middle class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/artistic-patronage History 1450–1789: Artistic Patronage], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of "[[art for art's sake]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125149/art-for-arts-sake Britannica.com], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; began to find expression in the work of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J. M. W. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/decadence/artsake.html Victorianweb.org], ''Aesthetes, Decadents, and the Idea of Art for Art's Sake''; George P.

The [[history of painting]] reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. The oldest known paintings are at the [[Grotte Chauvet]] in France, claimed by some historians to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc. There are many common themes throughout the different places that the paintings have been found; implying the universality of purpose and similarity of the impulses that might have inspired the artists to create the imagery. Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the artists who made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily, or the paintings may represent an [[animism|animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]], or they may be the result of a basic need of [[Emotional expression|expression]] that is [[essence|innate]] to human beings, or they may be recordings of the life experiences of the artists and related stories from the members of their circle.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colors), had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s.  Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language—called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].  Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today.
Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the dead to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to those of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style.
[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]

Around 1100 BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and its art took a new direction. The culture of [[ancient Greece]] is noteworthy for its outstanding contributions to the visual arts. Painting on [[pottery of ancient Greece]] and [[ceramic]]s gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in ancient Greece functioned. Many fine examples of [[black-figure vase painting]] and [[red-figure vase painting]] still exist. Some famous Greek painters who worked on wood panels and are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis]] and [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]]; however, with the single exception of the [[Pitsa panels]], no examples of ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in the 5th century BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and is noted for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color, and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.

In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as [[International Gothic]] style and was dominant from 1375–1425 with and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gaining importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, was driven by [[Renaissance humanism]] and the study of classical sources. In painting, in the 1420s and 1430s leading painters in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] separately developed new ways of painting which allowed the paintings to appear more realistic than in the works of established painters, whose style is referred to as [[International Gothic]], or in some cases as Proto-Renaissance (mainly in Italy).  This period, lasting until about 1495, became known as the [[Early Renaissance]].  

In the Flanders area of the Low Countries, following developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], who died in 1416, artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430–437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose first use on [[panel painting]]s was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]] (who died in 1409), but [[Robert Campin]] (previously known as [[the Master of Flémalle]]) and van Eyck brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism for which they were aiming. With this new medium, the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; 
[[File:La Anunciación, de Fra Angelico.jpg|thumb|[[Fra Angelico]], 1425–1428]]

Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of ancient Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism).  Another important Netherlandish painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], a pupil of Campin, whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists were [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].  Collectively, the advances in painting in Europe north of the Alps is known as the [[Northern Renaissance]].    

In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. [[Masaccio]] is credited with making advances in linear perspective, the depiction of volume in his figures, and in portraying emotions on the faces of his figures in the 1420s.  Then, artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[Early Renaissance]] period lasting to about 1495, and then [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] during the [[High Renaissance]] from about 1495 to 1520, took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic High Renaissance style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.  

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern High Renaissance]] such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] had a different approach than their Italian counterparts, one that is more realistic and less idealized. Some northern painters, beginning with Dürer in the 1490s, traveled to Italy to see works of the Italian High Renaissance and they incorporated the features of the Italian art into their own to varying degrees.A generation later, the start of [[genre painting]] as a subject for large works began with [[Peter Aertsen]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]. A later generation of Northern Renaissance painters who traveled to Rome and adopted much of the idealized approach of the Italian Renaissance became known as [[Romanists]].
[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], 1520–1523]]

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]].  [[Printmaking]] became increasingly important, and practiced by many painters. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] in Italy gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]] after 1520, although some painters, such as Titian and [[Paolo Veronese]], continued painting in a High Renaissance style late into the century. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The calm Virgins of Raphael and serene expressions of Leonardo's subjects are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows with the purpose of the art being to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. The earliest Baroque painters included the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque painters and an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque was the dominant style of painting beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Le Nain]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Georges de la Tour|Tour]],  and [[Claude Lorraine]], who focused on landscape painting.  Poussin, Claude and La Tour, all French, adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the outine of the figures in the painting than on colour.  Most of these painters traveled to Italy as part of their training and would then take the Baroque style back to their homelands, although in some cases they remained in Italy for large portions of their career (Claude and Poussin).  In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.  Dutch Baroque painting is often referred to as [[Dutch Golden Age Painting]].

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] painting followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic and using light pastel colours. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]], whose imposing history paintings depicting both historical and contemporary events embodied the ideals of the [[French Revolution]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].

By the mid-19th century, painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. Art became more purely a means of personal expression in the work of painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Romantic painters turned [[landscape painting]] into a major genre, considered until then as a minor genre or as a decorative background for figure compositions.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], J. M. W. Turner, [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and John Constable. Francisco Goya's late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery, the work of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in England combines assiduous devotion to nature with nostalgia for medieval culture, and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] evoke sophistication, [[decadent movement|decadence]], and the philosophy of "art for art's sake". In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |title=Novack, Barbara '&amp;#39;American Sublime'&amp;#39; Artforum, 2002, retrieved 30 October 2008 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the Hudson River School.
[[File:Johan Barthold Jongkind - Overschie bij maneschijn.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Johan Jongkind]], 1871, a prefiguration of impressionism]]
A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]], whose unidealized paintings of common people offended viewers accustomed to the conventional subject matter and [[licked finish]] of [[academic art]], but inspired many younger artists. The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-François Millet]] also painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life. Loosely associated with the Barbizon School was [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], who painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as did the paintings of [[Johan Jongkind]] and [[Eugène Boudin]] (who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors). Boudin was an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[plein air]] painting.

In the latter third of the century Impressionists such as [[Édouard Manet]], Claude Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic palette. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the traditional purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, David, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, Ashok Roy, and Raymond White (1990). ''Impressionism''. London: National Gallery. pp. 21–27. {{ISBN|0-300-05035-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they developed a lighter and brighter manner of painting.
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].

[[Post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Paul Cézanne]] and the slightly younger [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]. For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called [[Divisionism]], attracted many followers such as [[Paul Signac]], and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.

The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms.  The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Ferdinand Hodler]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustav Klimt]], and the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

Symbolist painters mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Delvaille|Delvaille, Bernard]], ''La poésie symboliste: anthologie'', introduction. {{ISBN|2-221-50161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Henri Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. [[Greenwood Press]], 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907),  Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own Cubist inventions. [[Cubism]] was jointly developed from about 1908 through 1912 by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], whose ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'' (1910) is shown here. The first clear manifestation of Cubism was practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Robert Delaunay]]. [[Juan Gris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and others soon joined.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent |title=Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque and Picasso, is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fauvism]]. The group gained their name after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after cubism, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (Kandinsky and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] (Kandinsky and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]).  Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to [[advertising|advertising art]] and fashion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Fauvism]] was a loose grouping of early 20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] – friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers.  Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. They had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''[[Green Stripe|The Green Stripe]]'', caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight, and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings including ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, and [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]] said of Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]] and [[Otto Mueller]]. This seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], [[Brücke-Museum (Berlin)|Brücke Museum]]. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'' (1909) is seen here, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the Der Blaue Reiter group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved. The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the color of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. [[Marc Chagall]]'s painting ''[[I and the Village]]'' tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and some Americans abroad such as [[Marsden Hartley]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as a Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

American painters during the period between World War I and World War II tended to go to Europe for recognition. [[Modernist]] artists like Marsden Hartley, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce&lt;ref&gt;Agee and Rose, 1979, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; created [[cubist]] related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American [[pop art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=New Yorker article, accessed online 11 November 2008 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and Culture,'' p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm Jasonkaufman.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017051233/http://jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm |date=17 October 2008 }}, accessed online 28 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism.

====Pioneers of abstraction====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] is generally considered one of the first important painters of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]],  he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color and his experimentation of both depth and tone.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became a cause célèbre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''Large Glass'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design to advance its antiwar politic and rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. Other artists associated with the Dada movement include [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]]. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.
[[File:Duchamp - Nude Descending a Staircase.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', 1912, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]
In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was decisive in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in Surrealist painting. Miró's ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' (1923–1924) verges on abstraction while suggesting a complex of objects and figures and arrangements of sexually active characters; it was Miró's first Surrealist [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Max Ernst, whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'' is seen here, studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=From the Tate Modern |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]].

During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. [[Edinburgh University Press]]. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.
[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1937, [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]], protest against Fascism]]
''Guernica'' is an immense black-and-white, 3.5 metre (11&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Laura (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBHWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75 Art and War]''. I.B. Tauris. {{ISBN|0857732811}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia and London, and in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. Finally in accord with Picasso's wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s through the years of World War II, [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]]. [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists such as [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics assumed it was satirical in intent; it was thought to be part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America exemplified by [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

A renaissance of the arts in Latin America included the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]], the Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], artists of the Mexican [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painter [[Frida Kahlo]]. The muralists conveyed historic and political messages. Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff.

Frida Kahlo's works relate to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. Her works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are self-portraits, which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. "Frida Kahlo". Oxford Art Online.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a movement that combined lessons learned from European Modernists via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.
 [[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]
Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/156 Abstract Expressionism, NY, MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("American-Type Painting"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:208–229, {{ISBN|978-0807066812}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppaessay.html|title=Post Painterly Abstraction|author=|date=|website=www.sharecom.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, [[Woman III]], and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He finished work on Woman I by November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 NGA.gov.au], [[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'' (1950), who was labelled an action painter because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color field painting.

During the 1950s ''Color Field painting'' initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]]  and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction.

During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post-painterly Abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery in landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects. They include artists as varied as [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], and [[Elaine de Kooning]].

In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still-life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Arshile Gorky's portrait of Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Melissa (2009). "Chronology", in: Michael R. Taylor (ed.), Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective. Philadelphia, Pa.: Philadelphia Museum of Art. {{ISBN|9780876332139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rachel (2003). ''Abstract Expressionists''. Chicago: Heinemann Library. {{ISBN|9781588106445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X]]'', 1953 is a painting by the Irish-born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Wieland (1996). ''Francis Bacon: Commitment and Conflict''. (Munich) Prestel. {{ISBN|3-7913-1664-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt, Michael, ''Anatomy of an Enigma''. Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-3520-5}} (1996), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud, Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a realist painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's tempera painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455 ''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist) and de Staël abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël's return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël's late work – in particular his abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s – predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Milton Avery as well through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueck |first=Grace |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery |title=NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; '&amp;#39;Milton Avery – Onrushing Waves'&amp;#39; |publisher=New York Times |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilton Kramer |url=http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ |title=Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, '&amp;#39;Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'&amp;#39; |publisher=Observer.com |date=2002-05-13 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s foreshadow the style and subject matter of Pop art. 

In New York City during the mid-1950s, Rauschenberg and Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works, and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion of mundane materials into their work. Johns' use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers' paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]]; and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]], gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by the artists [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in works such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963; [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]]), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83.&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] reproduce the appearance of commercial printing. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] work of art that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases of equal size, each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from [[popular culture]].

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by [[W. W. Norton and Company]], NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of English artist [[David Hockney]], such as ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'', and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.
In New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]], Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

====Art Brut, New Realism, Bay Area Figurative Movement, Neo-Dada, Photorealism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] {{en icon}} ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, pp. 31–33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1)'' (1963), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'' (1963) is a typical example, were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Christo]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started in the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. This trend, in which manufactured items are combined with artist materials, is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Rauschenberg's "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. Rauschenberg, Johns, [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others created new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Craft, ''An Audience of Artists: Dada, Neo-Dada, and the Emergence of Abstract Expressionism'', University of Chicago, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hapgood, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–62'', Universe Books and American Federation of Arts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], Colorfield painting, and [[Minimal Art]].  Two influential teachers, [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]], introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Albers is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas.  Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists.  His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art.

Josef Albers, Hans Hofmann, [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton, online essay about [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[acrylic paint]], [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials Sharecom.ca], accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-22/entertainment/ca-25065_1_geometric-shapes | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Cathy | last=Curtis | title=Wilshire Center | date=22 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. [[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and Hard-edge painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s.

[[File:Gardenofdelight.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Ronnie Landfield]], 1971, [[Lyrical Abstraction]]]]
Color Field painting pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web&lt;/ref&gt; Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat'' is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.
[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Barnett Newman, [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s.

From 1960 Frank Stella produced paintings in aluminum and copper paint and his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (1967), for example. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (1971) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''.

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Lyrical Abstraction (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Action Painting, where emphasis is on brushstrokes and high compositional drama, in Lyrical Abstraction—as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight''—there is a sense of compositional randomness, relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], Ronnie Landfield, [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007" /&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], Postminimalism, [[Earth Art]], Video, [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker.

[[File:Ring of Ronald Davis.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Ronald Davis]], ''Ring'', 1968, [[Abstract Illusionism]]]]
One of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was [[Frank Stella]], whose early "stripe" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, "16 Americans", organized by Dorothy Miller at the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York]]. The widths of the stripes in Stella's stripe paintings were not entirely subjective, but were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and leaned more toward less gestural coloristic field paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]].

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]] [http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman], who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.
This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2015/01/24/less-is-more-ad-reinhardts-twelve-rules-for-pure-art/ ''Less Is More: Ad Reinhardt's 12 Rules for Pure Art''], The Editors of ARTnews, 24 January 2015 (based on a paper read at the 45th annual meeting of the College Art Association at the Detroit Institute of Art, 26 January 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], Joan Snyder, [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[Monochrome painting]] and [[Hard-edge painting]] inspired by [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and Ellsworth Kelly. Artists as diversified as [[Al Held]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, Minimal art, Hard-edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and Postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in Abstract expressionism, [[Neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and Postminimal painting.

====Neo-expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
In the late 1960s the abstract expressionist painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story]&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' is an example of Guston's return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 80s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination.  All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]].

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner) in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colors and banal color harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with the slightly younger artists [[Damien Hirst]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], the Americans [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], the Italians [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"/&gt;

Anselm Kiefer is a leading figure in European Neo-expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kiefer-anselm.htm The Art Story, Artist Anselm Kiefer]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and [[collective memory]], but also [[occult]] symbolism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/anselm-kiefer-1406 Fiefer, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Rothhorse2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Susan Rothenberg]], 1979, [[Neo-expressionism]]]] --&gt;

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Esmann, F. Scott Hess, ''21st Century Figurative Art: The Resurrection of Art'', BookBaby Print, Nov 5, 2016, {{ISBN|1483582590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Hyman, ''The World New Made: Figurative Painting in the Twentieth Century'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2016, {{ISBN|0500239452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Figure and abstraction in contemporary painting'', Rutgers University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
