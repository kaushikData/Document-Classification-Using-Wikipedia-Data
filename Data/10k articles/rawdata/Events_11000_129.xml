The '''Australian Hillclimb Championship''' is a [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]] sanctioned motor sport competition which determines Australia's annual [[hillclimbing]] champion. The championship has traditionally been awarded to the driver setting fastest time at a single meeting &lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Pedr Davis, The Macquarie Dictionary of Motoring, 1986, page 215&lt;/ref&gt; however the 1958 title was awarded based on the combined results of two meetings &lt;ref name=Shepherd&gt;Jim Shepherd, A History of Australian Motor Sport, 1980, pages 235-253&lt;/ref&gt; and a multi round pointscore series was employed from 1972 to 1975.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

The championship has been sanctioned by the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] since 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Past Title Winners, 1980 CAMS Manual of Motor Sport, page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this it was sanctioned by the [[Australian Automobile Association]],&lt;ref&gt;Jim Shepherd, A History of Australian Motor Sport, 1980, page 235&lt;/ref&gt; with two events having national championship status in 1949.&lt;ref name=CAMS/&gt;

The '''background of the Spanish Civil War''' dates back to the end of the 19th century, when the owners of large estates, called ''[[latifundia|latifundios]]'', held most of the power in a land-based oligarchy. The landowners' power was unsuccessfully challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors. In 1868 [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|popular uprisings]] led to the overthrow of Queen [[Queen Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] of the [[House of Bourbon]]. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] of the [[House of Savoy]], abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed. After the [[Spain under the Restoration|restoration of the Bourbons]] in December 1874, [[Carlists]] and [[anarchists]] emerged in opposition to the monarchy. [[Alejandro Lerroux]] helped bring [[republicanism]] to the fore in [[Catalonia]], where poverty was particularly acute. Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in [[Barcelona]] in 1909. After the [[First World War]], the working class, the industrial class, and the military united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful. Fears of communism grew. A military [[coup d'√©tat|coup]] brought [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] to power in 1923, and he ran Spain as a military dictatorship. Support for his regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities, and [[King Alfonso XIII]] abdicated; the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was formed, whose power would remain until the culmination of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Monarchists would continue to oppose the Republic.

The revolutionary committee headed by [[Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora]] became the provisional government, with [[Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora|Zamora]] as the President and Head of State.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006. p. 23"&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic had broad support from all segments of society; elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the government attempted to assist rural Spain by instituting an [[eight-hour day]] and giving tenure to farm workers. Land reform and working conditions remained important issues throughout the lifetime of the Republic. [[Fascism]] remained a reactive threat, helped by controversial reforms to the military. In December a new reformist, liberal, and democratic [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] was declared. The [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] secularised the government, and this, coupled with their slowness to respond to a wave of anti-clerical violence prompted committed Catholics to become disillusioned with the incumbent [[coalition government]].&lt;ref&gt; Beevor (2006). pp. 25‚Äì26&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1931 [[Manuel Aza√±a]] became Prime Minister of a minority government. The Right won the [[Spanish general election, 1933|elections of 1933]] following an unsuccessful uprising by General [[Jos√© Sanjurjo]] in August 1932, who would later lead the coup that started the civil war.

Events in the period following November 1933, called the "black two years", seemed to make a civil war more likely. [[Alejandro Lerroux]] of the [[Radical Republican Party]] (RRP) formed a government with the support of [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups|CEDA]] and rolled back all major changes made under the previous administration, he also granted amnesty to General [[Jos√© Sanjurjo]], who had attempted an unsuccessful [[coup d'etat|coup]] in 1932. Some monarchists moved to the Fascist [[Falange Espa√±ola]] to help achieve their aims. In response,the socialist party ([[PSOE]]) became more extreme, setting up a revolutionary committee and training the socialist youth in secret.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2009). pp. 31‚Äì32&lt;/ref&gt; Open violence occurred in the streets of Spanish cities and militancy continued to increase right up until the start of the civil war, reflecting a movement towards radical upheaval rather than peaceful democratic means as a solution to Spain's problems. In the last months of 1934, two government collapses brought members of the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA) into the government, making it more right-wing. Farm workers' wages were halved, and the military was purged of republican members and reformed. A [[Popular Front]] alliance was organised, which won the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 elections]]. Aza√±a led a weak minority government, but soon replaced Zamora as president in April. Prime Minister Casares failed to heed warnings of a military conspiracy involving several generals, who decided that the government had to be replaced if the dissolution of Spain was to be prevented. They organised a [[Spanish coup of July 1936|military coup in July]], which started the Spanish Civil War.

===19th century===
The 19th century was a turbulent time for Spain.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006 8"&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in favour of reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms from taking place. Some [[liberalism|liberal]]s, in a tradition that had started with the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], sought to limit the power of the [[monarchy of Spain]] and to establish a liberal state.&lt;ref name="Fraser38"&gt;Fraser (1979). pp. 38‚Äì39.&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms of 1812 did not last after King [[Ferdinand VII]] dissolved the Constitution and ended a [[Trienio Liberal|short-lived liberal government]] with [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|French royalist military assistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006 8"/&gt; There were several attempts to realign the political system to match social reality.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a [[bourgeois]] industrial or commercial class. The land-based [[oligarchy]] remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates (called ''[[latifundia]]'') as well as all the important government positions. The landowners' power was challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors, largely unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amadeo I, rey de Espa√±a.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Amadeo I of Spain]]]]
In 1868 popular uprisings led to the overthrow of Queen [[Queen Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] of the [[House of Bourbon]]. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots, and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by General [[Joan Prim]]),&lt;ref name="thomas13"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; who were concerned about the ultra-conservatism of the monarchy.&lt;ref name="preston21"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] of the [[House of Savoy]], [[abdication|abdicated]] due to increasing political pressure, and the [[First Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed.&lt;ref name="thomas13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preston21"/&gt; However, the intellectuals behind the Republic were powerless to prevent a descent into chaos.&lt;ref name="thomas13"/&gt; Uprisings were crushed by the military. The old monarchy returned with the [[Spain under the Restoration|restoration of the Bourbons]] in December 1874,&lt;ref name="preston22"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; as reform was deemed less important than peace and stability.&lt;ref name="preston22"/&gt; Despite the introduction of [[universal male suffrage]] in 1890, elections were controlled by local political bosses (''[[caciques]]'').&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most traditionalist sectors of the [[Politics of Spain|political sphere]] systematically tried to prevent liberal reforms and to sustain the [[patrilineal]] monarchy. The [[Carlists]] ‚Äì supporters of [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Infante Carlos]] and his descendants ‚Äì fought to promote Spanish tradition and [[Catholicism]] against the liberalism of successive Spanish governments.&lt;ref name="Fraser38"/&gt; The Carlists attempted to restore the historic liberties and broad regional autonomy granted to the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] and [[Catalonia]] by their ''[[fuero]]s'' (regional charters). At times they allied with nationalists (separate from the [[National Faction (Spanish Civil War)|National Faction]] during the civil war itself), including during the [[Carlist Wars]].&lt;ref name="Fraser38"/&gt;

Periodically, [[anarchism]] became popular among the working class, and was far stronger in Spain than anywhere else in Europe at the time.&lt;ref name="Fraser38"/&gt; Anarchists were easily defeated in clashes with government forces.&lt;ref name="preston24"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Angiolillo-assassinato.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michele Angiolillo]] kills [[Antonio C√°novas del Castillo|C√°novas]] in a health resort in 1897]]
In 1897 an Italian anarchist assassinated Prime Minister [[Antonio C√°novas del Castillo]], motivated by a growing number of arrests and the use of torture by the government. The loss of [[Cuba]], Spain's last valuable colony, in the [[Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War]] of 1898 hit exports from [[Catalonia]] hardest; there were acts of terrorism and actions by ''[[agents provocateurs]]'' in Barcelona.&lt;ref name="preston24"/&gt; In the first two decades of the 20th century, the industrial working class grew in number. There was a growing discontent in the Basque country and Catalonia, where much of Spain's industry was based. They believed that the government favoured [[agrarianism]] and therefore failed to represent their interests.&lt;ref name="preston25"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The average illiteracy rate was 64%, with considerable regional variation. Poverty in some areas was great and mass emigration to the New World occurred in the first decade of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain's [[socialist]] party, the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] ({{lang-es|Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol}}, PSOE) and its associated [[trade union]], the ''[[Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT), gained support. The UGT grew from 8,000 members in 1908 to 200,000 in 1920. Branch offices (''[[Casa del pueblo|Casas del pueblo]]'') of the unions were established in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The UGT was constantly fearful of losing ground to the anarchists. It was respected for its discipline during strikes. However, it was [[centrism|centrist]] and anti-Catalan, with only 10,000 members in Barcelona as late as 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The PSOE and the UGT were based on a simple form of [[Marxism]], one that assumed an inevitable revolution, and were [[isolationist]] in character.&lt;ref name="preston25"/&gt; When the UGT moved their headquarters from Barcelona to [[Madrid]] in 1899, many industrial workers in Catalonia were no longer able to access it.&lt;ref name="preston25"/&gt; Some elements of the PSOE recognised the need for cooperation with republican parties.

In 1912 the [[Reformist Party (Spain)|Reformist Party]] was founded, which attracted intellectuals. Figures like its leader, [[Alejandro Lerroux]], helped attract wide support from the working class. His advocacy of [[anti-clericalism]] made him a successful [[demagogue]] in Barcelona. He argued that the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. It was around this time that [[republicanism]] came to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The military was keen to avoid the break-up of the state and was increasingly inward-looking following the loss of Cuba. Regional [[nationalism]], perceived as [[separatism]], was frowned upon. In 1905 the army attacked the headquarters of two satirical magazines in Catalonia believed to be undermining the government. To appease the military, the government outlawed negative comments about the military or Spain itself in the Spanish press. Resentment of the military and of [[conscription]] grew with the disastrous [[Rif War (1909)|Rif War]] of 1909 in [[Spanish Morocco]].&lt;ref name="beevor13"&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerroux's support of the army's aims lost him support.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Events culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] ({{lang-es|Semana Tr√°gica}}) in Barcelona in 1909, when working class groups rioted against the call-up of reservists.&lt;ref name="thomas15"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 48 churches and similar institutions were burned in anti-clerical attacks.&lt;ref name="thomas15"/&gt; The riot was finally ended by the military; 1,725 members of such groups were put on trial, with five people sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="preston29"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  These events led to the establishment of the National Confederation of Labour ({{lang-es|Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo}}, CNT), an anarchist-controlled trade union committed to [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref name="preston29"/&gt; It had over a million members by 1923.&lt;ref name="thomas16"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09414, Primo de Rivera.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Prime Minister [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]]]
Increasing exports during the [[First World War]] led to a boom in industry and declining living standards in the industrial areas, particularly Catalonia and the Basque country.&lt;ref name="preston30"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; There was high inflation.&lt;ref name="beevor13"/&gt; The industrial sector resented its subjugation by the agrarian central government. Along with concerns about antiquated promotion systems and political corruption, the war in Morocco had caused divisions in the military.&lt;ref name="preston30"/&gt; [[Regenerationism]] became popular, and the working class, industrial class, and the military were united in their hope of removing the corrupt central government. However, these hopes were defeated in 1917 and 1918 when the various political parties representing these groups were either appeased or suppressed by the central government, one by one. The industrialists eventually backed the government as a way to restore order.&lt;ref name="preston32"&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 32‚Äì33.&lt;/ref&gt; After the formation of the [[Communist International]] in 1919, there was a growing fear of [[communism]] within Spain and growing repression on the part of the government through military means. The PSOE split, with the more [[left-wing]] members founding the [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist Party]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="preston34"&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 34‚Äì35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Restoration government failed to cope with an increasing number of strikes amongst the industrial workers in the north and the agricultural workers in the south.&lt;ref name="preston34"/&gt;

[[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] came to power in a military coup in 1923 and ran Spain as a military dictatorship.&lt;ref name="thomas16"/&gt; He handed monopolistic control of trade union power to the UGT, and introduced a sweeping programme of public works.&lt;ref name="preston34"/&gt; These public works were extremely wasteful, including [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams and highways causing the deficit to double between 1925 and 1929. [[Spain|Spain's]] financial situation was made far worse by the pegging of the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] to the [[gold standard]] and by 1931 the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] had lost nearly half its value.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006. p. 20"&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The UGT was brought into the government to set up industrial arbitration boards, though this move was opposed by some in the group and was seen as opportunism by anarchist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to defend the agrarian‚Äìindustrial monarchist coalition formed during the war.&lt;ref name="preston34"/&gt; No significant reform to the political system (and in particular the monarchy) was instituted.&lt;ref name="preston34"/&gt; This made forming a new government difficult, as existing problems had not been rectified. Gradually, his support faded because his personal approach to political life ensured he was personally held accountable for the government's failings,&lt;ref name="preston34"/&gt; and due to an increasing frustration over his interference in economic matters he didn't understand.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006. p. 20"/&gt; [[Jos√© Calvo Sotelo]], his finance minister, was one person to withdraw support,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and de Rivera resigned in January 1930.&lt;ref name="preston36"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little support for a return to the pre-1923 system, and the monarchy had lost credibility by backing the military government.&lt;ref name="preston36"/&gt; [[D√°maso Berenguer]] was ordered by the king to form a replacement government, but his [[dictablanda]] dictatorship failed to provide a viable alternative.&lt;ref name="preston37"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of Berenguer annoyed another important general, [[Jos√© Sanjurjo]], who believed himself to be a better choice.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the municipal elections of 12 April 1931, little support was shown for pro-monarchy parties in the major cities, and large numbers of people gathered in the streets of Madrid. [[King Alfonso XIII]] abdicated to prevent a "fratricidal civil war".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). pp. 18‚Äì19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;His statement included the sentence "I am determined to have nothing to do with setting one of my countrymen against another in a fratricidal civil war." from Thomas (1961). pp. 18‚Äì19.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Spanish Republic]] was formed.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006. p. 20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preston37"/&gt;

==Second Republic==
[[File:Niceto Alcal√° Zamora, presidente de la II Rep√∫blica Espa√±ola.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora]] in 1931]]
The Second Republic was a source of hope to the poorest in Spanish society and a threat to the richest, but had broad support from all segments of society.&lt;ref name="preston38"&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 38‚Äì39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora]] was the first prime minister of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthier landowners and the middle class accepted the Republic because of the lack of any suitable alternative.&lt;ref name="preston38"/&gt; Elections to a constituent [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists, with the PSOE gaining 116 seats and Lerroux's Radical Party 94.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerroux became foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). pp. 21‚Äì22.&lt;/ref&gt; The government was controlled by a Republican‚ÄìSocialist coalition, whose members had differing objectives. Some more conservative members believed that the removal of the monarchy was enough by itself, but the Socialists and leftist Republicans demanded much wider reforms.&lt;ref name="preston38"/&gt;

The state's financial position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy.&lt;ref name="preston41"&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 41‚Äì42.&lt;/ref&gt; The redistribution of wealth supported by the new government seemed a threat to the richest, in light of the recent [[Wall Street Crash]] and the onset of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="preston41"/&gt; The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beevor22"&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on the skill of the local governance, which was often badly lacking.&lt;ref name="preston43"/&gt; Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions also needed to be decided.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective opposition was led by three groups. The first group included Catholic movements such as the [[Asociaci√≥n Cat√≥lica de Propagandistas]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See also: [[:es:Asociaci√≥n Cat√≥lica de Propagandistas]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had influence over the judiciary and the press.&lt;ref name="preston43"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Rural landowners were told to think of the Republic as godless and communist.&lt;ref name="preston44"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The second group consisted of organisations that had supported the monarchy, such as the [[Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola]] and Carlists, who wished to see the new republic overthrown in a violent uprising.&lt;ref name="preston44"/&gt; The third group were [[Fascist]] organisations, among them supporters of the dictator's son, [[Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera]]. Primo de Rivera was the most significant leader of fascism in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The press often editorialised about a foreign [[Jewish]]‚Äì[[Masonic]]‚Äì[[Bolshevik]] plot.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the CNT willing to cooperate with the Republic were forced out, and it continued to oppose the government.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The deeply unpopular [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] ({{lang-es|Guardia Civil}}), founded in 1844, was charged with putting down revolts and was perceived as ruthless. Violence, including at [[Castilblanco]] in December 1931, was usual.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). pp. 48‚Äì49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties in opposition to Alcal√°-Zamora's government gained the support of the church and the military.&lt;ref name="preston46"&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 46‚Äì47.&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the church in Spain, Cardinal [[Pedro Segura]], was particularly vocal in his disapproval.&lt;ref name="preston46"/&gt; Until the 20th century, the Catholic Church had proved an essential part of Spain's character, although it had internal problems.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Segura was expelled from Spain in June 1931.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006. p. 23"/&gt; This prompted an outcry from the Catholic right, who cited oppression.&lt;ref name="preston46"/&gt; A series of church-burning incidents occurred in major Spanish cities throughout May 1931. When the government refused to call out the Guardia Civil, Minister for War [[Manuel Aza√±a]] came under heavy criticism from the rightist press. The military were opposed to reorganisation, including an increase in regional autonomy granted by the central government, and reforms to improve efficiency were seen as a direct attack. Officers were retired and a thousand had their promotions reviewed, including [[Francisco Franco]], who served as director of the General Military Academy in [[Zaragoza]], which was closed by Manuel Aza√±a.&lt;ref name="beevor22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 47‚Äì48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitution of 1931===
[[Spanish Constitution of 1931|A new constitution]] was approved on 9 December 1931.&lt;ref name="preston53"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The first draft, prepared by [[√Ångel Ossorio y Gallardo]] and others, was rejected, and a much more daring text creating a "democratic republic of workers of every class" was promulgated.&lt;ref&gt;Lannon (1987). p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; It contained much in the way of emotive language and included many controversial articles, some of which were aimed at curbing the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="thomas46"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beevor24"&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution was reformist, liberal, and democratic in nature, and was welcomed by the Republican‚ÄìSocialist coalition. It appalled landowners, industrialists, the organised church, and army officers.&lt;ref name="preston53"/&gt;

As the government believed it was necessary to break the control the church had over Spanish affairs, the new constitution removed any special rights held by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="preston53"/&gt; The constitution proclaimed religious freedom and a complete [[separation of Church and State]]. Catholic schools continued to operate, but outside the state system; in 1933 further legislation banned all monks and nuns from teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent (2007). p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic regulated church use of property and investments,&lt;ref name="thomas46"/&gt; provided for recovery and controls on the use of property the church had obtained during past dictatorships, and banned the Vatican-controlled [[Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="preston53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beevor24"/&gt; The controversial articles 26 and 27 of the constitution strictly controlled Church property and prohibited religious orders from engaging in education.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2009). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the church and even [[Jose Ortega y Gasset]], a liberal advocate of the separation of church and state, considered the articles overreaching.&lt;ref&gt;Paz (2001). p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Other articles legalising divorce and initiating agrarian reforms were equally controversial,&lt;ref name="preston53"/&gt; and on 13 October 1931, [[Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles y Qui√±ones|Gil Robles]], the leading spokesman of the parliamentary right, called for a Catholic Spain to make its stand against the Republic.&lt;ref name="preston54"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Commentator [[Stanley Payne]] has argued that "the Republic as a democratic constitutional regime was doomed from the outset", because the far left considered any moderation of the anticlerical aspects of the constitution as totally unacceptable.&lt;ref name="payne 632"&gt;Payne (1973). p. 632.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1931 Alcal√° Zamora and his interior minister, [[Miguel Maura]], resigned. Manuel Aza√±a became Prime Minister. Desiring the job for himself, Lerroux became alienated, and his Radical Party switched to the opposition,&lt;ref name="thomas47"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Aza√±a dependent on the Socialists for support. The Socialists, who favoured reform, objected to the lack of progress. The reforms that were made alienated the land-holding right.&lt;ref name="preston545"&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 54‚Äì55.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions for labourers remained dreadful; the reforms had not been enforced.&lt;ref name="preston57"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Rural landowners declared war on the government by refusing to plant crops.&lt;ref name="preston58"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, several agricultural strikes were harshly put down by the authorities.&lt;ref name="preston57"/&gt; Reforms, including the unsuccessful attempt to break up large holdings, failed to significantly improve the situation for rural workers.&lt;ref name="preston58"/&gt; By the end of 1931, King Alfonso, in exile, stopped attempting to prevent an armed insurrection of monarchists in Spain, and was tried and condemned to life imprisonment ''in absentia''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aza√±a declared that Spain had "ceased to be Catholic"; although to an extent his statement was accurate,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to Thomas (1961). p. 31., it was estimated that around two-thirds of Spaniards were not practising Catholics.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a politically unwise thing to say.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; An assault of a taxi driver supposedly due to his left-wing views sparked a wave of anti-clerical violence throughout south west urban Spain beginning on 11 May 1931; the government's reluctance to declare martial law in response and a comment attributed to [[Manuel Aza√±a|Aza√±a]] that he would "rather all the churches in Spain be burnt than a single Republican harmed" prompted many Catholics to believe that the Republic was trying to prosecute Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on Christian iconography in schools and hospitals and the ringing of bells came into force in January 1932. State control of cemeteries was also imposed. Many ordinary Catholics began to see the government as an enemy because of the educational and religious reforms.&lt;ref name="thomas47"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 59‚Äì60.&lt;/ref&gt; Government actions were denounced as barbaric, unjust, and corrupt by the press.&lt;ref name="preston61"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1932 there was an unsuccessful uprising by General [[Jos√© Sanjurjo]], who had been particularly appalled by events in Castilblanco.&lt;ref name="thomas62"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of the insurrection were vague,&lt;ref name="thomas62"/&gt; and it quickly turned into a fiasco.&lt;ref name="thomas63"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the generals tried and sent to Spanish colonies were four men who would go on to distinguish themselves fighting against the Republic in the civil war: the [[Duke of Seville]], [[Martin Alonso]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See also: [[:es:Pablo Mart√≠n Alonso]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ricardo Serrador Sant√©s]], and [[Heli Rolando de Tella y Cantos]].&lt;ref name="thomas63"/&gt;

The political left became fractured, whilst the right united.&lt;ref name="preston61"/&gt; The Socialist Party continued to support Aza√±a but headed further to the political left.&lt;ref name="thomas67"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Gil Robles set up a new party, the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] ({{lang-es|Confederati√≥n Espanola de Derechas Aut√≥nomas}}, CEDA) to contest the 1933 election, and tacitly embraced Fascism. The right won an overwhelming victory, with the CEDA and the Radicals together winning 219 seats.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 66. allocates 207 seats to the political right.&lt;/ref&gt; They had spent far more on their election campaign than the Socialists, who campaigned alone.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 63‚Äì65.&lt;/ref&gt; The roughly 3,000 members of the Communist Party were at this point not significant.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "two black years"===
{{See also|Asturian miners' strike of 1934}}
Following the elections of November 1933, Spain entered a period called the "two black years" ({{lang-es|bienio negro}}).&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Radicals became more aggressive and conservatives turned to paramilitary and vigilante actions. Official statistics state that 330 people were assassinated in addition to 213 failed attempts, and 1,511 people wounded in political violence. Those figures also indicate a total of 113 general strikes were called and 160 religious buildings were destroyed, typically by arson.&lt;ref&gt;Brincat (2005). p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=queabc&gt;[http://www.abc.es/fotos-abc/20120510/quema-iglesias-durante-segunda-98412.html abc.es: "La quema de iglesias durante la Segunda Rep√∫blica" 10 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the election, the Socialists alleged [[electoral fraud]]; they had, according to the PSOE, needed twice as many votes as their opponents to win each seat. They identified the lack of unity in the left as another reason for their defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 66‚Äì67.&lt;/ref&gt; The Socialist opposition began to propagate a revolutionary ideal.&lt;ref name="preston67"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The CEDA had won a plurality of seats, but not enough to form a majority. President [[Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora]] declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government, and instead invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so.&lt;ref name="preston67"/&gt; The RRP, with the backing of CEDA, set about removing price controls, selling state favours and monopolies, and removing the land reforms‚Äîto the landowners' considerable advantage. This created growing malnourishment in the south of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 67‚Äì68.&lt;/ref&gt; The agrarian reforms, still in force, went tacitly unenforced.&lt;ref name="thomas75"&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first anarchist protest came on 8 December 1933, and was easily crushed by force in most of Spain; Zaragoza held out for four days before the [[Spanish Republican Army]], employing tanks, stopped the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The Socialists stepped up their rhetoric, hoping to force Zamora to call new elections.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlists and [[Alfonsist monarchist]]s continued to prepare, with Carlists undergoing military drills in Navarre;&lt;ref name="thomas75"/&gt; they received the backing of Italian Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]]. Gil Robles struggled to control the RRP's youth wing, which copied Germany and Italy's youth movements. Monarchists turned to the Fascist [[Falange Espa√±ola]], under the leadership of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, as a way to achieve their aims.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 69‚Äì70.&lt;/ref&gt; Open violence occurred in the streets of Spanish cities.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerroux resigned in April 1934, after President Zamora hesitated to sign an Amnesty Bill which let off the arrested members of the 1932 plot. He was replaced by [[Ricardo Samper]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The Socialist Party ruptured over the question of whether or not to move towards [[Bolshevism]]. The youth wing, the [[Federation of Young Socialists]] ({{lang-es|Federaci√≥n de Juventudes Socialistas}}), were particularly militant.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The anarchists called a four-week strike in Zaragoza.&lt;ref name="preston72"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Gil Robles' CEDA continued to mimic the German [[Nazi Party]], staging a rally in March 1934, to shouts of "Jefe" ("Chief", after the Italian "Duce" used in support of Mussolini).&lt;ref name="thomas67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preston72"/&gt; Gil Robles used an anti-strike law to successfully provoke and break up unions one at a time, and attempted to undermine the republican government of the [[Esquerra]] in Catalonia, who were attempting to continue the republic's reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 73‚Äì74.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to remove local councils from socialist control prompted a general strike, which was brutally put down by Interior Minister [[Salazar Alonso]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See also: [[:es:Rafael Salazar Alonso]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the arrest of four deputies and other significant breaches of articles 55 and 56 of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Socialist Landworkers' Federation ({{lang-es|Federaci√≥n Nacional da Trabajadores de la Tierra}}, FNTT), a trade union founded in 1930, was effectively prevented from operating until 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September, the CEDA announced it would no longer support the RRP's minority government. It was replaced by an RRP cabinet, again led by Lerroux, that included three members of the CEDA.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; A UGT general strike was unsuccessful in most of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Llu√≠s Companys]] (leader of the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] and the [[President]] of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]]) saw an opportunity in the [[general strike]] and declared [[Catalonia]] an independent state inside the federal republic of Spain;&lt;ref name="beevor30"&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; the Esquerra, however, refused to arm the populace, and the head of the military in Catalonia, [[Domingo Batet]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See also: [[:es:Domingo Batet]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; charged with putting down the revolt, showed similar restraint. In response, [[Llu√≠s Companys]] was arrested and Catalan autonomy was suspended.&lt;ref name="beevor30"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggrieved Franco, who was directing the military from Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Franco was put in informal command of the military effort against the revolt in [[Asturias]], the only place where it had succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 78‚Äì79.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30,000 workers were called to arms in ten days.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Atrocities were carried out by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Payne (1973) pp. 637‚Äì638.&lt;/ref&gt; Franco's men, some brought in from Spain's [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; killed men, women and children and carried out summary executions after the main cities of Asturias were retaken.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). pp. 31‚Äì32.&lt;/ref&gt; About 1,000 workers were killed, with about 250 government soldiers left dead.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The failed rising in Asturias marked the effective end of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 79‚Äì80.&lt;/ref&gt; Months of retaliation and repression followed; torture was used on political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). pp. 84‚Äì85.&lt;/ref&gt; Even moderate reformists within the CEDA became sidelined. The two generals in charge of the campaign, Franco and [[Manuel Goded Llopis]], were seen as heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Aza√±a was unsuccessfully made out to be a revolutionary criminal by his right-wing opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Gil Robles once again prompted a cabinet collapse, and five positions in Lerroux's new government were conceded to CEDA, including one awarded to Gil Robles himself. Farm workers' wages were halved, and the military was purged of republican members and reformed. Those loyal to Robles were promoted, and Franco was made Chief of Staff.&lt;ref name="preston81"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Aza√±a and Indalecio Prieto started to unify the left and to combat its extreme elements. They staged large, popular rallies of what would become the [[Popular Front]].&lt;ref name="preston81"/&gt; Lerroux's Radical government collapsed after two major scandals, including the [[Straperlo]] affair.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, instead calling elections. The [[Spanish general election, 1936|elections of 1936]] were won by the Popular Front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right who followed [[Nazi propaganda]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). pp. 82‚Äì83.&lt;/ref&gt; The right began to plan how to best overthrow the Republic, rather than taking control of it.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government was weak, and the influence of the revolutionary [[Largo Caballero]] prevented socialists from being part of the cabinet. The republicans were left to govern alone; Aza√±a led a minority government.&lt;ref name="Preston 2006. p. 84"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacification and reconciliation would have been a huge task.&lt;ref name="Preston 2006. p. 84"/&gt; Largo Caballero accepted support from the Communist Party (with a membership of around 10,000).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of violence and reprisals increased.&lt;ref name="preston85"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1936, Aza√±a found that the left was using its influence to circumvent the Republic and the constitution; they were adamant about increasingly radical changes.&lt;ref&gt;Payne (1973). p. 643.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament replaced Zamora with Aza√±a in April. Zamora's removal was made on specious grounds, using a constitutional technicality.&lt;ref&gt;Payne (1973). p. 642.&lt;/ref&gt; Aza√±a and Prieto hoped that by holding the positions of Prime Minister and President, they could push through enough reforms to pacify the left and deal with right-wing militancy.&lt;ref name="preston85"/&gt; However, Aza√±a was increasingly isolated from everyday politics; his replacement, [[Casares Quiroga]], was weak. Although the right also voted for Zamora's removal, this was a watershed event which inspired conservatives to give up on parliamentary politics.&lt;ref name="Preston1999"&gt;Preston (1999). pp. 17‚Äì23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote that Zamora had been Spain's "stable pole", and his removal was another step towards revolution.&lt;ref name="Trotsky"&gt;Trotsky (1936). pp. 125‚Äì126.&lt;/ref&gt; Largo Caballero held out for a collapse of the republican government, to be replaced with a socialist one as in France.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army plotter [[Emilio Mola]].  Monarchist [[Jos√© Calvo Sotelo]] replaced CEDA's Gil Robles as the right's leading spokesman in parliament.&lt;ref name="Preston1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The Falange expanded rapidly, and many members of the [[Juventudes de Acci√≥n Popular]] joined. They successfully created a sense of militancy on the streets to try to justify an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Prieto did his best to avoid revolution by promoting a series of public works and civil order reforms, including of parts of the military and civil guard. Largo Caballero took a different attitude, continuing to preach of an inevitable overthrow of society by the workers.&lt;ref name="preston90"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Largo Caballero also disagreed with Prieto's idea of a new Republican‚ÄìSocialist coalition.&lt;ref name="preston92"&gt;Preston (2006). p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; With Largo Caballero's acquiescence, communists alarmed the middle classes by quickly taking over the ranks of socialist organisations.&lt;ref name="preston90"/&gt; This alarmed the middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The division of the Popular Front prevented the government from using its power to prevent right-wing militancy.&lt;ref name="preston92"/&gt; The CEDA came under attack from the Falange, and Prieto's attempts at moderate reform were attacked by the Socialist Youth. Sotelo continued to do his best to make conciliation impossible.&lt;ref name="preston92"/&gt;

Casares failed to heed Prieto's warnings of a military conspiracy involving several generals who disliked professional politicians and wanted to replace the government to prevent the dissolution of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006). p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish coup of July 1936|military coup of July]] that started the [[Spanish Civil War]] was devised with Mola as director and Sanjurjo as a figurehead leader.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Six-Day War}}

The '''Battle of [[Abu-Ageila]]''' was a military confrontation between the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli]] and [[Egyptian Army|Egyptian]] militaries in the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. The decisive defeat of the Egyptians was critical to the eventual loss of the entire [[Sinai Peninsula]] to Israel. Leading Israeli forces was Major General [[Ariel Sharon]], later a prominent politician and [[prime minister of Israel]].

==Background==
The Israeli attack at [[Abu-Ageila]] was part of the Israeli offensive into the [[Sinai Desert]]. [[Southern Command (Israel)|Southern Command's]] offensive consisted of 3 divisions: [[Israel Tal]]'s [[84th Division (Israel)|84th Division]], [[Avraham Yoffe]]'s [[31st Division (Israel)|31st Division]], and [[Ariel Sharon]]'s [[38th Division (Israel)|38th Division]]. Sharon was tasked with the capture of the road junction at Abu-Ageila, in order to gain access to the central route into the Sinai Desert. The Egyptians had taken considerable preparations to prevent a breach there. Egyptian defences had focused on the [[Um-Katef]] (or Umm-Qatef) plateau to the east of Abu-Ageila, roughly 25 kilometers from the Israeli border. The defences were an important part of the overall defence plan, called ''Qahir'', in the preparations for the expected war, later known as the Six-Day War.

==Opposing Forces==
Israeli troops numbered about 14,000. Egyptian troop strengths have been estimated at 8,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; More importantly, the Israelis had significant advantage in [[Armoured forces|armour]]: against 66 Egyptian [[World War II]]-era [[T34/85]] with 85&amp;nbsp;mm guns, and 22 [[SU-100]] with 100&amp;nbsp;mm guns, the Israelis pitted a total of 150 modern tanks: [[AMX-13]]'s with 75&amp;nbsp;mm guns, as well as a hundred [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] and [[M50 Super Sherman|Super Shermans]], armed with 105&amp;nbsp;mm guns.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The guns used by the Centurions were the [[Royal Ordnance L7]] tank guns, specifically made to defeat the [[T-54]], a tank more modern than both types of tanks used by the Egyptians in this battle. On the other side, the best tank gun available for the Egyptians, used by the 22 [[SU-100]] tank destroyers, was a late-WW2 artillery piece overmatched by Centurion's front armor. As a result, in addition to numerical superiority, the Israeli tanks also had a greater effective range than their opponents.

==Egyptian Defences==
The Egyptian defence was constructed as follows: the 2nd infantry Division prepared defenses in the area between [[Abu-Ageila]] and [[Kusseima]], with the center placed at the area [[Um-Katef]] Plateau - [[Ruafa Dam]], with the [[12th Infantry Brigade (Egyptian)|12th Infantry Brigade]] defending Um-Katef and the 10th Infantry Brigade Kusseima. Um-Katef made a good position, because it was bordered by an area of [[dune|sand dunes]] to the north and rocky mountains to the south. On this plateau, the Egyptians constructed three parallel [[Trench warfare|trenches]] of about five kilometers each, reinforced by concrete [[bunker]]s. Every trench was defended by an infantry battalion, with the forward trench reinforced by a dug-in tank squadron. To the rear were two supporting artillery battalions (330th, 334th), behind them the balance of 288th Tank Battalion ready to [[counterattack]]. To the north, blocking the Batur Track at Position 181, were 38th Infantry Battalion, 299th Artillery Battalion and an antitank company of ten SU-100. They were to protect the flank of the main position to the southeast.

Five kilometers to the West of the Um-Katef Plateau perimeter was the Ruafa Dam. Dug in here were the 352nd Infantry Battalion, and the 332nd and 336th Artillery Battalions. Five kilometers to the northwest of Abu-Ageila, at the well and logistic center at Awlad Ali, the balance of the 6th Tank Regiment (one tank battalion) was positioned to block enemy forces coming from the northeast or against the positions of the 12th Brigade to the east or southeast.

To the east in front of the 12th Brigade positions on the ridge at Umm Tarafa was an outpost manned by an infantry company of 38th Battalion, a squadron of tanks from 288th Battalion, and two B-10 recoilless guns. At Position 239, south of Umm Tafara was a platoon of 37th Infantry Battalion, with two B-10 recoilless guns and two antitank weapons. Further east at Tarat Umm Basis near the Israeli border was the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, which was to give warning of any Israeli attack.

==Battle==
The Israeli attack-plan was based on intelligence gathered two days before the war started, which indicated Um-Katef was defended by only one infantry battalion. Based on this information, the Israelis planned a frontal attack by their reinforced independent tank battalion. After aerial bombardments, this tank battalion started its attack on Um-Katef on the 5th of June at 0815 hours. The attack came to a halt however, due to resistance from an unknown Egyptian formation and an unknown [[minefield]], causing the loss of seven Israeli [[Centurion tank|Centurions]]. New orders for the independent tank battalion were to break off the attack and to attack from the north, through the sand dunes. Now the 14th armoured brigade (two tank battalions Super Shermans and two armoured infantry battalions in [[halftrack]]s) was ordered to attack frontally further south. After a short [[bombardment|aerial bombardment]], this attack commenced at 1230, but was forced to a halt as well.

Now that strength and positions of the Egyptians were known, General Sharon changed his plans. The independent tank battalion was ordered to drive through the sand dunes following a camel-path and attack the Egyptian armour at the Ruafa Dam. At the same time, the 14th armoured brigade would attack from the East. However, before this could happen, Um-Katef would have to be taken, a task given to Sharon's infantry brigade, held in reserve up till then. This infantry attack was to occur under the cover of darkness, following a secondary approach to Um-Katef through the sand dunes. Meanwhile, the Israeli armour would provide support and all Israeli artillery would be used in support of this attack. This meant there would be no [[suppressing fire]] on the Egyptian artillery, making the Israeli infantry extremely vulnerable. It was decided that the Egyptian artillery would be taken out of action prior to the attack using the brigade of [[paratroopers]]. However, with only six [[helicopters]] available, only a limited number of units could be used. Meanwhile, the independent tank battalion was engaged by the Egyptian defenders in the sand dunes by 1600 and were able to continue to their positions near Abu-Ageila and the Ruafa Dam at 1800. The infantry brigade was in place at around 2300, while the paratroopers, after being discovered and fired upon by Egyptian artillery, made it to their attack positions at 2300.

The attack started at June 5, 2400 hours, after the Israeli artillery had been firing from 2330 ‚Äì 2400 hours with Israeli tanks moving into position under the noise of the artillery. After heavy fighting, the Israeli infantry battalions broke through the trenches at Um-Katef, with one-third of them cleared by 0230. Now the engineers started clearing a way through the minefield which was completed at 0400, allowing the 14th armoured brigade to roll on to the Ruafa Dam. On 6 June at 0700, the Israelis attacked the Egyptian tank battalions and antitank battalions from two sides, with the Centurion tanks of the 14th from the east and the Super Sherman tanks from the west. After three hours of fighting, these Egyptian units were destroyed, after which remnants of the [[12th Egyptian Brigade]] were cleared. At around 1200, the road junction at Abu-Ageila was in Israeli hands and the road to the Sinai was open. The battle ended with 40 [[Killed in action|KIA]] and 19 tanks lost for the Israelis,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070216051431/http://www.ariel-sharon-life-story.com/06-Ariel-Sharon-Biography-1967-Six-Day-War.shtml ''Ariel Sharon - Life Story, A Biography''], Chapter 6 ''1967 Six-Day War'' says that the Israelis suffered "40 dead, and about 120 wounded."&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,000 [[Killed in action|KIA]] and 60 tanks lost on the Egyptian side.

==Aftermath==
The victory at Abu-Ageila meant the road to the Central Sinai was open for the Israelis in general, Sharon and his forces in particular. Many of the Egyptian units remained intact and could have tried to prevent the Israelis from reaching the [[Suez Canal]]. However, when the Egyptian Minister of Defense, Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] heard about the fall of Abu-Ageila, he panicked and ordered all units in the Sinai to retreat to the west bank of the Suez canal within a single day. There was no plan for the retreat, so the units left behind heavy equipment, and sometimes even outpaced their commanders. This resulted in the Israelis racing to capture abandoned sites, and obtaining significant amounts of abandoned tanks and equipment. So much was captured intact that after the war 3 mechanized and 2 armored brigades were created from this abandoned equipment.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The withdrawal order effectively meant the defeat of Egypt. By June 8, 1967, most of the Sinai area had been occupied by Israeli forces.

== Accessibility ==
From the small farming community of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]], the Big Tree Interpretive Site can be accessed via Forest Road 80 and 8020. The interpretive site offers the opportunity to view or picnic at the base of the tree.&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt;

==Age==
Its age was unknown, partially because of rot in its center sections.&lt;ref name="Pesanti"/&gt;

Despite having immense tracts of old growth conifers, the State of Washington is one of two states that lacks a state coordinator to find, track and keep current records on important trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hYnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=Big+Tree+Washington&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZu4yz5MbQAhVq0YMKHVGUDK0Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Big%20Tree%20Washington&amp;f=false |title=Keepers of the Trees: A Guide to Re-Greening North America |date=April 30, 2010 |first1=Ann |last1=Linnea |first2=Lyanda Lynn |last2=Haupt |isbn=9781616080075 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |accessdate=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design draws upon Boeing's experience with NASA's [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Space Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station|ISS]] programs as well as the [[Orbital Express]] project sponsored by the Department of Defense.&lt;ref name=sfn_21_7_10/&gt;  The CST-100 has no Orion heritage, but it is sometimes confused with the earlier and similar Orion-derived [[Orion Lite]] proposal that Bigelow was reportedly working on with technical assistance from Lockheed Martin.&lt;ref name="MSNBCspace200908"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32418057/ns/technology_and_science-space/ |title=Company pitches 'lite' spaceship to NASA |work=NBC News |first=Amy |last=Klamper |date=August 14, 2009 |accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will use the [[NASA Docking System]] for docking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/08/nasa-outlines-plans-commercial-crew-certification/ |title=NASA Outlines its Plans for Commercial Crew Certification |work=NASA Spaceflight |first=Yves-A. |last=Grondin |date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGZWIR0Prhk&amp;t=26m57s |title=Commercial Space Flight Panel |work=YouTube.com |publisher=SpaceUp Houston |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2011/03/23/22339/ |title=Update on Boeing CST-100 Crew Program |work=Parabolic Arc |first=Doug |last=Messier |date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use the Boeing Lightweight Ablator for its heatshield.&lt;ref name="sfin20150728"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/commercial/boeings-cst-100-takes-shape-at-former-nasa-facility/ |title=Boeing's CST-100 takes shape at former NASA facility |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Joe |last=Latrell |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Starliner's solar cells  will provide more than 2,900 watts of electricity, will be placed on top of the micro-meteoroid debris shield located at the bottom of the spacecraft's service module.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compoundsemi.com/spectrolab-solar-cells-power-boeings-starliner-spacecraft/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2010}}, it was intended to be compatible with multiple launch vehicles, including the [[Atlas V]], [[Delta IV]], and [[Falcon 9]], as well as the planned [[Vulcan (rocket)|Vulcan]].&lt;ref name=lindermoyer201002&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.aiaa.org/pdf/industry/presentations/Lindenmoyer_C3PO.pdf |title=Commercial Crew and Cargo Program |conference=13th Annual FAA Commercial Space Transportation Conference.

Needs a more recent source. --&gt;

Unlike earlier U.S. space capsules, the CST-100 will make airbag-cushioned landings on the ground rather [[Splashdown|than into water]]. Five landing areas are planned in the [[Western United States]], which will give the CST-100 about 450 landing opportunities every year.&lt;ref name=sfn-20150922&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/09/22/boeing-identifies-cst-100-prime-landing-sites/ |title=Boeing identifies CST-100 prime landing sites |last=Clark |first=Stephen |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=22 September 2015 |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2014}}, the CST-100 was to include one [[spaceflight participant|space tourist]] seat, and the Boeing contract with NASA allows Boeing to price and sell [[space transport|passage]] to low-Earth orbit on that seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boeing-space-taxi-has-tourist-seat-1.2770088 |title=Boeing space taxi has tourist seat |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company |agency=Thomson Reuters |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===

The CST-100 name was first used when the capsule was revealed to the public by Bigelow Aerospace CEO [[Robert Bigelow]] in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.commercialspaceflight.org/2010/06/bigelow-aerospace-joins-the-commercial-spaceflight-federation/ |title=Bigelow Aerospace Joins the Commercial Spaceflight Federation |publisher=Commercial Spaceflight Federation |first1=John |last1=Gedmark |first2=Mike |last2=Gold |date=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters CST stand for Crew Space Transportation.&lt;ref name=boeing20110912/&gt; Although it has been reported that the number 100 in the name stands for 100&amp;nbsp;km, the height of the [[K√°rm√°n line]] which is one of several definitions of the boundary of space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=20295&amp;item=1323 |title=Boeing CST-100 Spacecraft to Provide Commercial Crew Transportation Services |publisher=Boeing |first1=Edmund G. |last1=Memi |first2=Adam K. |last2=Morgan |date=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/8785-spaceship-fly-people-private-space-stations.html |title=New Spaceship Could Fly People to Private Space Stations |work=Space.com |first=Denise |last=Chow |date=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the naming was in fact an arbitrary designation created by the corporate office.  The Rocketdyne [[RS-88]] (Bantam) engine will be used for its launch escape system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOv1ew1GPKc |title=Test of Rocketdyne abort motor for Boeing crew capsule |work=YouTube.com |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Receiving the full fixed-price payments for the CCDev Phase 1 [[Space Act Agreement]] required a set of specific milestones to be met during 2010:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/444144main_NNJ10TA03S_boeing_saa.pdf |title=Space Act Agreement Between National Aeronautics and Space Administration and The Boeing Company for Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) |publisher=NASA |date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2011|9|18}}

{{As of|2010|July}}, Boeing stated that the capsule could be operational in 2015 with sufficient near-term approvals and funding, but also indicated they would proceed with development of the CST-100 only if NASA implemented the commercial crew transport initiative that was announced by the Obama administration in its FY11 budget request. Boeing executive Roger Krone stated that NASA investment would allow Boeing to close the business case, while this would be very difficult without NASA. In addition a second destination besides the ISS would be needed to close the business case and Krone said that cooperation with Bigelow was crucial for this.&lt;ref name=sfn_21_7_10/&gt;

[[File:CST-100 pressure vessel.jpg|thumb|left|CST-100 pressure vessel at the former [[Orbiter Processing Facility|Orbiter Processing Facility 3]] in October 2011]]

Boeing was awarded a $92.3 million contract by NASA in April 2011 to continue to develop the CST-100 under [[Commercial Crew Development#CCDev 2|CCDev phase 2]].&lt;ref name="ft20110418"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://space.flatoday.net/2011/04/nasa-awards-270-million-for-commercial.html |title=NASA awards $270 million for commercial crew efforts |work=Florida Today |series=The Flame Trench |first=James |last=Dean |date=April 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419234227/http://space.flatoday.net/2011/04/nasa-awards-270-million-for-commercial.html |archivedate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 3, 2012, NASA announced the award of $460 million to Boeing to continue work on the CST-100 under the [[Commercial Crew Development#Commercial Crew integrated Capability|Commercial Crew Integrated Capability]] (CCiCap) Program.&lt;ref name="spacenews.com"/&gt;

[[File:Boeing‚Äôs Wind Tunnel testing of the CST-100.jpg|thumb|right|Wind tunnel testing of CST-100's outer mold line in December 2011]]

On October 31, 2011, NASA announced that through a partnership with [[Space Florida]], the [[Orbiter Processing Facility|Orbiter Processing Facility-3]] at Kennedy Space Center would be leased to Boeing for manufacture and test of CST-100 spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/oct/HQ_11-349_KSC_Agreement.html |title=NASA Signs Agreement with Space Florida to Reuse Kennedy Facilities |publisher=NASA |first1=David |last1=Weaver |first2=Michael |last2=Curie |first3=Amber |last3=Philman |first4=Tina |last4=Lange |first5=Paula |last5=Korn |date=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2014, NASA chose Boeing (CST-100) and [[SpaceX]] ([[Dragon V2]]) as the two companies that will be funded to develop systems to transport [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] crews to and from the International Space Station. Boeing won a $4.2 billion contract to complete and certify CST-100 spacecraft by 2017, while SpaceX won a $2.6 billion contract to complete and certify their crewed Dragon spacecraft. The contracts include at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once the Starliner achieves NASA certification, the contract requires Boeing to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.&lt;ref name="September2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/september/nasa-chooses-american-companies-to-transport-us-astronauts-to-international |title=NASA Chooses American Companies to Transport U.S. Astronauts to International Space Station |publisher=NASA |first1=Stephanie |last1=Schierholz |first2=Stephanie |last2=Martin |date=September 16, 2014 |accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's [[William H. Gerstenmaier]] considers the CST-100 proposal as stronger than the two others.&lt;ref name="avweek20141013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aviationweek.com/space/why-nasa-rejected-sierra-nevadas-commercial-crew-vehicle |title=Why NASA Rejected Sierra Nevada's Commercial Crew Vehicle |work=Aviation Week |first=Guy |last=Norris |date=October 11, 2014 |accessdate=October 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013135535/http://aviationweek.com/space/why-nasa-rejected-sierra-nevadas-commercial-crew-vehicle |archivedate=October 13, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the agreement with NASA allows Boeing to sell seats for [[Space tourism|space tourists]]. Boeing proposed including one seat per flight for a [[space flight participant]] at a price that would be competitive with what Roscosmos charges tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/17/boeing-space-idUSL1N0RI2XY20140917 |title=Boeing's 'space taxi' includes seat for a tourist |agency=Reuters |first=Irene |last=Klotz |date=September 17, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2015, Boeing announced that the CST-100 would officially be called the CST-100 Starliner, a name that follows the conventions of the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]] produced by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]].&lt;ref name="sfn20150904"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/09/04/boeing-names-its-commercial-spaceship-the-starliner/ |title=Enter the Starliner: Boeing names its commercial spaceship |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=September 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, NASA announced it had dropped Boeing from consideration in the multibillion-dollar [[Commercial Resupply Services]] second-phase competition to fly cargo to the International Space Station.&lt;ref name="sfinside20151106"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/commercial/nasa-delays-crs-2-awards-again-drops-boeing-from-consideration/ |title=NASA delays CRS 2 awards again, drops Boeing from consideration |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Jason |last=Rhian |date=November 6, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Boeing delayed its first scheduled CST-100 launch from 2017 to early 2018.&lt;ref name=ars20161011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/boeings-first-flight-slips-its-now-up-to-spacex-to-wean-nasa-off-russia/ |title=Boeing‚Äôs first crewed Starliner launch slips to 2018 |work=Ars Technica |first=Eric |last=Berger |date=May 11, 2016 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then in October 2016, Boeing delayed its program by six months, from early 2018 to late 2018, following supplier holdups and a production problem on the second CST-100.  By 2016, they were hoping to fly NASA astronauts to the ISS by December 2018.&lt;ref name=ars20161011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/10/boeing-delays-starliner-again-casting-doubt-on-commercial-flights-in-2018/ |title=Boeing delays Starliner again, casting doubt on commercial flights in 2018 |work=Ars Technica |first=Eric |last=Berger |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avweek20161010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aviationweek.com/new-space/boeing-delays-cst-100-still-targets-2018-iss-mission |title=Boeing Delays CST-100, Still Targets 2018 ISS Mission |work=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |first=Guy |last=Norris |date=October 10, 2016 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, NASA suggested the first planned two-person flight of the CST-100 Starliner, slated for November 2018, was now likely to occur in 2019 or 2020. If the delays are maintained it would be expected to carry one additional crew member and extra supplies. Instead of staying for two weeks as originally planned, NASA said the expanded crew could stay at the station for as long as six months as a normal rotational flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasa-boeing-signal-regular-missions-to-space-station-to-be-delayed-1522984513 |title=NASA, Boeing Signal Regular Missions to Space Station to Be Delayed |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Andy |last=Pasztor |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of validation tests have been underway on [[test article]]s since 2011.

In September 2011, Boeing announced the completion of a set of ground [[drop test]]s to validate the design of the airbag cushioning system. The airbags are located underneath the heat shield of the CST-100, which is designed to be separated from the capsule while under [[parachute]] descent at about {{convert|5000|ft}} altitude. The airbags are deployed by filling with a mixture of compressed nitrogen and oxygen gas, not with the pyro-explosive mixture sometimes used in automotive [[Airbag#Inflation|airbags]]. The tests were carried out in the [[Mojave Desert]] of southeast [[California]], at ground speeds between {{convert|10|and|30|mph}} in order to simulate crosswind conditions at the time of landing. Bigelow Aerospace built the mobile test rig and conducted the tests.&lt;ref name="boeing20110912"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boeing.com/Features/2011/09/bds_cst_100_airbag_09_12_11.html |title=Space capsule tests aim to ensure safe landings |publisher=Boeing |first=Edmund G. |last=Memi |date=September 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924163725/http://www.boeing.com/Features/2011/09/bds_cst_100_airbag_09_12_11.html |archivedate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Boeing dropped a mock-up of its CST-100 commercial crew capsule over the Nevada desert at the Delamar Dry Lake near Alamo, Nevada, successfully testing the craft's three main landing parachutes from {{convert|11000|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1204/03cst100drop/ |title=Parachutes for Boeing crew capsule tested over Nevada |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=April 3, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Boeing announced that two NASA astronauts evaluated communications, ergonomics, and crew-interface aspects of the CST-100, showing how future astronauts will operate in the spacecraft as it transports them to the International Space Station and other [[low Earth orbit]] destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nysebigstage.com/articles/boeing-aviationday |title=Boeing Space Capsule One Step Closer to Orbit |work=NYSE Big Stage |date=August 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212749/http://nysebigstage.com/articles/boeing-aviationday |archivedate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing reported in May 2016 that its test schedule would slip by eight months in order to reduce the mass of the spacecraft and aerodynamics issues anticipated during launch and ascent on the [[Atlas V]] rocket.&lt;ref name="spacenews-delay"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/boeing-delays-first-crewed-cst-100-flight-to-2018/ |title=Boeing delays first crewed CST-100 flight to 2018 |work=[[SpaceNews]] |first=Jeff |last=Foust |date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The booster for the Orbital Flight Test, an [[Atlas V]] N22 rocket, is being assembled at [[United Launch Alliance|ULA's]] facility at Decatur, Alabama, {{as of|2018|January|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/boeing/boeing-cst-100-starliner-one-step-closer-flight-completion-dcr/ |title=Boeing CST-100 Starliner one step closer to flight with completion of DCR |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Jason |last=Rhian |date=January 4, 2018 |accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first crewed flight ([[Boe-CFT]]) is scheduled for early 2019, depending on test results from Boe-OFT.

If this delay occurs the mission could be expected to carry one additional crew member and supplies. NASA said the expanded crew could stay at the station for as long as six months as a normal rotational flight. This is due to the ending of the agreement for Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station in late 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasa-boeing-signal-regular-missions-to-space-station-to-be-delayed-1522984513 |title=NASA, Boeing Signal Regular Missions to Space Station to Be Delayed |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Andy |last=Pasztor |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA has named its first Commercial Crew astronaut cadre of four veteran astronauts to work with SpaceX and Boeing: [[Robert Behnken]], [[Eric Boe]], [[Sunita Williams]], and [[Douglas Hurley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-070915a-commercial-crew-astronauts.html |title=NASA assigns 4 astronauts to commercial Boeing, SpaceX test flights |work=CollectSpace |first=Robert Z. |last=Pearlman |date=July 9, 2015 |accessdate=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018 Boeing announced the assignment of former NASA astronaut [[Christopher Ferguson|Chris Ferguson]] to the Boe-CFT mission.

In July 2018, a test anomaly was reported in which there was a [[hypergolic propellant]] leak due to several faulty abort system valves. Consequentially the first unpiloted orbital mission was delayed to March 2019, and the first crew launch rescheduled to August 2019.&lt;ref name="NASAblogcc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2018/10/04/nasas-commercial-crew-program-target-test-flight-dates-4/ |title=NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program Target Test Flight Dates |date=October 4, 2018 |access-date=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Broadway Bro Down'''" is the eleventh episode of the [[South Park (season 15)|fifteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 220th episode overall. It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on October 26, 2011. In the episode, Randy discovers that musicals contain subtext that encourage women to give [[oral sex]], meanwhile Shelly starts dating the [[vegan]] kid.

The episode was written by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Robert Lopez]] as an uncredited writer, who previously worked with Parker and [[Matt Stone]] on the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical,  ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. This episode is rated [[TV-MA-LS]] in the United States.

==Plot==
[[Randy Marsh (South Park)|Randy]] hears from his male co-workers that taking women to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows sexually arouses them into performing [[oral sex]]. Randy takes Sharon to [[Denver]] to see ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', but is confused and unimpressed with the lack of overt sexuality. He is informed by a fellow theatergoer at the theater's bar that women are aroused not by the production's explicit sexuality, but by its [[subtext]]. When Randy returns to the auditorium, he now hears the actors underhandedly referencing [[fellatio|blowjobs]] frequently in the songs' lyrics. On the ride home Sharon performs fellatio on him, and as a result, Randy decides to take her to [[New York City]] to see all the Broadway shows, leaving Stan and Shelley with the Feegans, South Park's resident life-preserver wearing [[vegan]]s. During their dinner with the Feegans, Shelly gets into a confrontation with Mr. Feegan over letting his son Larry decide for himself if he wants to be a vegan. This results in Larry developing greater confidence, falling in love with Shelly, and abandoning his life preserver.

Upon returning to South Park, Randy laments the fact that he does not live closer to a major theater venue like Broadway, as the Denver production of ''Wicked'', to which he has already taken Sharon 23 times, will soon move to [[Seattle]]. He decides to produce a local play, though he discards subtext by naming it ''Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen'', and not only makes the show about women giving oral sex, but includes direct commands to Sharon in it. This attracts the attention of [[Stephen Sondheim]], [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], and [[Elton John]]. The four are depicted as [[Hypermasculinity|hypermasculine]], beer drinking heterosexuals who hang out at [[Hooters]], and are called "Bros" (Sondheim and John are openly gay in real life). They chastise Randy for the overt use of sexuality in his play, explaining to him that the lack of any real subtext would expose the truth behind Broadway shows. Randy dismisses their criticisms, insisting that his play is filled with subtext, but after a "[[bro (subculture)|bro]]-down" with Sondheim in a parking lot, in which they confront each other with verbal challenges, Randy agrees to accept their assistance, and renames his play ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]''.

When Randy returns home and learns that Sharon gave Shelly two tickets to see ''Wicked'' with Larry, Randy is horrified, and races to Denver with Sharon, revealing to her the truth about Broadway shows, much to her own horror. Initially thrown out of the theater for being disruptive, Randy dons a [[Spider-Man]] costume and swings through the auditorium, knocking out several patrons and production personnel, before breaking open a [[Water supply network|water main]], forcing the play into an intermission and fatally drowning Larry, much to Shelly's grief. Shelly's grief is accentuated by the fact that Larry drowned because his budding self-confidence ‚Äì borne of his new relationship with Shelly ‚Äì had caused Larry to abandon his life-preserver. Randy apologizes to Sharon for taking her to the theater to get oral sex in return, though she expresses difficulty in faulting him for doing what all other men also do, pointing out that musicals must have value if they brought them closer together. When Sharon asks which show is coming to Denver next, an advertisement for Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Robert Lopez's musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' plays, with the narrator quickly muttering, "You'll get a blowjob!"

==Production==
Trey Parker and Matt Stone had just finished working with composer Robert Lopez in the Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' before this season of ''South Park'' commenced. During the collaboration, the duo offered Lopez a chance to come to their studio to create an episode with them and workshop ideas. He arrived on a Thursday at Halloween-time, so the notion of a generic Halloween-themed episode was tossed around. Broadway and musicals were never explicitly on the table until the idea of "trying to make Broadway cool for dudes" came up. They were anxious about the number of songs - albeit short ones - that they had to write. They kept on putting this off as they needed time to hash out the story. They ended up frantically writing songs on the following Tuesday. Trey and Matt thoroughly enjoyed the one-off experience and expressed an interest in collaborating with Lopez again, not necessarily in the context of a musical episode.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE1eMdyQzXw Broadway Bro Down commentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The episode has received positive reviews.

Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, writing, "When it comes down to it, it's the one-liners and the strength of the A-plot that make this episode work. Had it not been for the annoying repetition and the near-useless B-plot, this would have been one of my favorites of the season so far. But the episode accomplishes the neat trick of poking fun at a topic while still expressing love for it, and that makes up for a lot".&lt;ref&gt;http://au.ign.com/articles/2011/10/27/south-park-broadway-bro-down-review&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan McGee of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' graded the episode an A, stating, "The show has long featured the musical stylings of its co-creators, but rarely has that skill been deployed as effectively as tonight‚Äôs masterful half-hour ... It managed to be incredibly sweet while being ridiculously filthy. It mocked what it loved while never losing sight of that love in the process. In short, it was pure South Park."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=McGhee|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/broadway-bro-down,63893/|title=Broadway Bro Down|work=The A.V. Club|date=2011-10-26|accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic rated the episode 3/5 stars, commenting "There were definitely some fun theater references, including the most appropriate costume Randy could have grabbed to sabotage a play, Spider-Man, but was the one-note joke of the blow job really enough to sustain the full half hour of laughs? For me, not so much", and adding that the B plot "seemed to tie-in nicely with the Broadway adventure at the end, but it still felt undeveloped".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvfanatic.com/2011/10/south-park-review-broadway-bro-down/&lt;/ref&gt; Aly Semigram of Entertainment Weekly said "The episode could have just been a one-off about Broadway and worked just fine, but by bringing Spider-Man ‚Äî a show that‚Äôs been out of the spotlight for a while now ‚Äî into the mix, it felt somewhat outdated."&lt;ref&gt;http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/27/south-park-broadway-stephen-sondheim/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CMLL Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles 2017''' or "National Incredible Pairs Tournament 2017" was a [[tag team]] ''[[Lucha Libre]]'' tournament held by the Mexican wrestling promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL). The tournament is based on the Lucha Libre ''[[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Parejas Increibles Match|Parejas Incre√≠bles]]'' match concept, which pairs two wrestlers of opposite allegiance, one portraying a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]], referred to as a "''rudo''" in Lucha Libre wrestling terminology, and one portraying a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]], or "''t√©cnico''". The 2017 version of the tournament was the eight time in a row that CMLL held the tournament since the [[CMLL Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles (2010)|first tournament in 2010]]. The winners are presented with a trophy but not given any other tangible reward for the victory.

Sixteen teams competed in the three night tournament, with [[Volador Jr.]] and [[B√°rbaro Cavernario]] winning Block A held on February 10, 2017, and the team of [[√öltimo Guerrero]] and [[Valiente (wrestler)|Valiente]] winning Block B a week later on February 17, 2017. Finally Volador Jr. and B√°rbaro Cavernario won the finals on February 24, 2017 to take the entire tournament. It was B√°rbaro Cavernario's first Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles victory while Volador Jr. previously won the [[CMLL Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles (2013)|2013 tournament]] with [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]].&lt;ref name=Parejas13&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FBc9EJhT?url=http://cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm# | title=Resultados Arena M√©xico | archivedate=2013-03-17 | date=March 15, 2013 | accessdate=March 17, 2013 | work=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] | language=Spanish | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Volador Jr. 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Volador Jr.]], the ''tecnico'' winner of the 2017 tournament.]]
The Mexican [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL; "World Wrestling Council") held their first [[CMLL Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles|Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles]] ("National Incredible Pairs Tournament") in 2010, from January 22 through February 5, marking the beginning of an annual tournament.&lt;ref name=Parejas10&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/parajes.html#2010 | title= Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles | date= January 22 ‚Äì February 5, 2010 | accessdate= October 8, 2010 | publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMLL has previous held Parejas Incre√≠bles tournaments on an irregular basis and often promoted individual Parejas Incre√≠bles and Relevos Incre√≠bles ("Incredible Relay", with teams of three or more wrestlers). The Parejas Incre√≠bles concept is a long standing tradition in ''[[lucha libre]]'' and is at times referred to as a "strange bedfellows" match in English speaking countries, because a Pareja Increible consists of a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] (referred to as a ''t√©cnico'' in Lucha Libre, or a "good guy") and a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (a ''rudo'', those that portray "the bad guys") teamed up for a specific match, or in this case for a tournament.&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29‚Äì40 | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 tournament will be the eight annual Parejas Incre√≠bles tournament, and like its predecessors will be part of CMLL's regular Friday night [[CMLL Super Viernes]] ("Super Friday") shows to be held in [[Arena M√©xico]], CMLL's main venue in [[Mexico City, Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Parejas10&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/parajes.html#2010 | title= Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles | date= January 22 ‚Äì February 5, 2010 | accessdate= October 8, 2010 | publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parejas11&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/parajes.html#2011 | title= Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles 2011 | date= February 2‚Äì25, 2011 | accessdate= October 8, 2010 | publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parejas12&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/parajes.html#2012 | title= Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles 2012 | date= February 17 ‚Äì March 2, 2012 | accessdate= October 8, 2010 | publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parejas13/&gt;&lt;ref name=DosLeyendas2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OGEhC3VF?url=http://cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm# |title=Homenaje a Dos Leyendas |last=Salazar L√≥pez |first=Alexis |archivedate=2014-03-22 |date=March 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 22, 2014 |work=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Twitter&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/CMLL_OFICIAL/status/574069141323128833 | title=Dos ca√≠das al hilo!

==Tournament==
The tournament featured 15 [[professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers teaming up, some of whom were involved in pre-existing [[script (recorded media)|scripted]] feuds or [[narrative thread|storylines]] while others were simply paired up for the tournament. For the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles tournaments, CMLL often teamed up a ''t√©cnico'' (those that portray the "good guys" in wrestling, also known as [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]]) and a ''rudo'' (the "bad guy" or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]]) who are involved in a pre-existing storyline feud at the time of the tournament so that the tournament itself can be used as a storytelling device to help tell the story of escalating confrontations between two feuding wrestlers. The tournament format followed CMLL's traditional tournament formats, with two qualifying blocks of eight teams that competed during the first and second week of the tournament and a final match between the two block winners. The qualifying blocks were all one-fall matches while the tournament final was a best two-out-of-three-falls tag team match.

===Ongoing storylines===
One of the main CMLL feuds at the time of the 2017 Parejas Increibles tournament was the ongoing rivalry between [[Diamante Azul]] and [[Comandante Pierroth|Pierroth]], a feud that at the time of the tournament was expected to be the main event of the 2017 [[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2017)|Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]] ("Homage to two legends") show. The feud often saw Pierroth, with help from his [[Los Ingobernables]] partners Rush and La M√°scara, leave Diamante Azul beaten up and with his mask either torn or completely removed during matches.&lt;ref name=HDL2017&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2017/03/17/pierroth-perdio-la-mascara-con-diamante-azul | title=Diamante Azul se puli√≥ y 'destap√≥' a Pierroth | last=Vald√©s | first=Apolo | date=March 17, 2017 | accessdate=March 18, 2017 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish | trans-title=Diamante Azul polished off and unmasked Pierroth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Atlantis and Euforia were not directly involved in a feud the team had some history prior to the 2017 tournament. Originally Atlantis was part of [[Los Guerreros del Infierno]], which also included EUforia. He would later leave the team, turning ''tecnico'' to feud with √öltimo Guerrero, the leader of ''Los Guerreros''. Atlantis teamed with Euforia to win the [[CMLL Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles (2014)|2014 tournament]].&lt;ref name=DosLeyendas2014SL&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OGEhC3VF?url=http://cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm# | title=Homenaje a Dos Leyendas | last=Salazar L√≥pez | first=Alexis | archivedate=2014-03-22 | date=March 22, 2014 | accessdate=March 22, 2014 | work=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] | language=Spanish | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of the teams were put together because of ongoing storylines others were teamed up based on previous feuds. The team of [[Rey Cometa]] and [[Puma (luchador)|Puma]], played off a storyline rivalry between the two from 2012. During the fall of 2012 the two masked mid-card wrestlers developed a rivalry that led to both wrestlers putting their mask on the line as part of CMLL's [[CMLL 79th Anniversary Show|79th Anniversary Show]]. Rey Cometa was defeated by Puma and thus had to take off his mask and reveal his birth name.&lt;ref name=79thAnniversarySL/&gt; Following the mask loss Rey Cometa and Puma moved off in different directions, only crossing path on occasions. Another dormant story-line was the feud between Dragon Lee and La M√°scara that carried the main event match of the [[CMLL 83rd Anniversary Show]], which saw Dragon Lee defeating and unmasking La M√°scara at the end of the night. Following the match La M√°scara and Dragon Lee's brother Rush, reformed [[Los Ingobernables]] and actually attacked Dragon Lee.&lt;ref name=ESTO&gt;{{cite web | url=https://estoenlinea.oem.com.mx/202535-dragon-lee-saco-fuego-en-el-ring/ | title=En el Aniversario 83, Dragon Lee sac√≥ fuego en el ring | first=Diego | last=Hern√°ndez Ort√≠z | date=September 3, 2016 | accessdate=September 5, 2016 | publisher=ESTO Enlina | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=83rdSLLive&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2016/09/02/resultados-cmll-83-aniversario-la-mascara-vs-dragon-lee-mascara-contra-mascara/ | title=Resultados CMLL 83 Aniversario: La M√°scara vs. Dragon Lee, m√°scara contra m√°scara | first=Ernesto | last=Ocampo | date=September 2, 2016 | accessdate=September 2, 2016 | work=SuperLuchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team of Rush and El Terrible had teamed together in two previous Parejas Increibles tournaments, both as part of a long, heated storyline feud between the two that ran from 2011 through 2012. The storyline saw El Terrible defeat Rush to win the vacant [[CMLL World Heavyweight Championship]],&lt;ref name=CMLLWorldHeavy&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2012/01/01/imagen-el-terrible-nuevo-campeon-mundial-completo-del-cmll/ | title=Imagen: El Terrible, nuevo Campe√≥n Mundial Completo del CMLL | last=Mexicool | first=Rey | date=January 1, 2012 | accessdate=January 2, 2012 | publisher=''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were teamed up for the [[CMLL Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles (2012)|2012 ''Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles'']] as CMLL continued to build the feud.

==Aftermath==
The rivalry between Pierroth and Diamante Azul reached it's peak only a few weeks later as the two faced off in a ''Lucha de Apuestas''', or "bet match" on March 17, 2017 in the main event of the 2017 [[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2017)|Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]] show. Diamante Azul won the match and forced Pierroth to unmask afterwards per ''lucha libre'' traditions.&lt;ref name=HDL2017/&gt;

The '''Caribbean Football Union corruption scandal''' involved attempted bribery used to win the votes of national football associations from the [[Caribbean Football Union]] in the 2011 [[FIFA]] presidential election.

The bribes were offered on 20 May 2011, at a meeting of the CFU, held in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. The meeting had been arranged so that the president of the [[Asian Football Confederation]], Mohammed Bin Hammam, could address representatives of the CFU, in an attempt to persuade them to vote for him in the upcoming FIFA presidential elections. As it was a meeting for the Caribbean Football Union, the [[CONCACAF]] members from Central America ([[UNCAF]]) and North America ([[NAFU]]) were not present.

The vice president of the [[Bahamas Football Association]], Fred Lunn, reported that while attending the meeting, he had been given a brown envelope containing US$40,000, in exchange for which he was expected to vote for Bin Hammam.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA cash bribe revealed Bahamas FA|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1392559/FIFA-cash-bribe-revealed-Bahamas-FA.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent investigations, the CONCACAF president Jack Warner and various CFU officials were also implicated in the bribery.&lt;ref name="telegraph-video"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelso|first=Paul|title=Former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner is caught on tape offering 'gifts‚Äô of ¬£25,000 to Caribbean delegates|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8820948/Former-Fifa-vice-president-Jack-Warner-is-caught-on-tape-offering-gifts-of-25000-to-Caribbean-delegates.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pag√°n Rivera"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pag√°n Rivera|first=Esteban|title=Rompe el silencio Eric Labrador|url=http://www.primerahora.com/rompeelsilencioericlabrador-511213.html|publisher=Primera Hora|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Spanish|date=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Warner and Bin Hammam denied any involvement.

The incident resulted in Bin Hammam's suspension and Warner's resignation, as well as the suspension of over 30 CFU vice-presidents and staff, and the investigation of over 30 national football association officials.

== Background ==

It was a sensitive time for [[FIFA]], who had been criticised in the European press for their handling of corruption accusations, which extended to FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]]. The [[Nigeria Football Federation]] and [[West African Football Union]] leader [[Amos Adamu]] and the [[Oceania Football Confederation]] and [[Tahitian Football Federation]] President [[Reynald Temarii]] had been banned from football for requesting payments in kind in the run-up to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting bid vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifa provisionally suspend members caught up in World Cup vote claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/20/fifa-suspend-members-world-cup|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[BBC]] episode of [[Panorama]] had been featured showing various FIFA officials refusing to answer to allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also suspicions that Qatar (Bin Hammam's nation) had won the rights to the host the [[2022 World Cup]] by bribing FIFA Executive Officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millions paid in bribes for Qatar's 2022 World Cup votes, report claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/10/millions-bribes-qatar-2022-world-cup-claims|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the FIFA Presidency elections that would place at the [[61st FIFA Congress]], FIFA President Sepp Blatter and his electoral opposition Mohammed Bin Hammam were expected to meet with CONCACAF delegates to persuade them who to vote for.

Sepp Blatter met with all members of the CFU when they met on 3 May 2011 at the annual [[CONCACAF]] Congress at the JW Marriott hotel in [[Miami, Florida]] along with members of the [[North American Football Union|NAFU]] and [[UNCAF]].However, the [[Asian Football Confederation]] President and FIFA Presidential candidate [[Mohammed bin Hammam]] stated that he was unable to attend the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideworldfootball.biz/news/1-latest-news/9126-bin-hammam-denied-us-visa-to-attend-concacaf-congress |title=Exclusive: Bin Hammam denied US visa to attend CONCACAF Congress |publisher=Insider World Football |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=2 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505071327/http://www.insideworldfootball.biz/news/1-latest-news/9126-bin-hammam-denied-us-visa-to-attend-concacaf-congress |archivedate=5 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the congress, Jack Warner retained his position as CONCACAF President having been voted in, for his sixth consecutive four-year term.

As a result of Bin Hammam's absence, it was arranged for a second meeting to be held on 10 May 2011 in the Hyatt Regency hotel, [[Port-of-Spain]], [[Trinidad]] where Mohammed Bin Hammam could attend and address the CFU members as the majority of CONCACAF members are also members of the CFU.

== Incident ==

Anton Sealey, the President of the [[Bahamas Football Association]] was attending an event in the run-up to the [[61st FIFA Congress]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], as such, he was unable to attend a meeting in [[Port-of-Spain]], [[Trinidad]].

Bahamas FA's Vice President, Fred Lunn, attended the meeting, whilst there, Lunn was given brown envelope with the word "Bahamas" written on it containing US$40,000. Believing it to be a bribe in a cash-for-votes scandal, funded by bin Hammam, Lunn reported the incident to Sealey, who in turn reported it to CONCACAF General Secretary [[Chuck Blazer]]. Lunn took a photograph of the money and the envelope before returning them. He later gave journalists a digital copy of the photograph for publication.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt;

Bahamas-based newspaper ''The Tribune'' praised Sealey and Lunn for not accepting the envelope: "The attempted bribe was an insult to the whole Caribbean. Those seeking the Caribbean Football Federation's vote obviously saw its members as coming from poor island nations who would never have seen so much money as fell from the brown envelope that was offered them. Many proved to their tempters that poor they might be, but they had pride, they had integrity and although they might never see so much money again, under such tainted conditions they would never stoop so low as to pick it up. As was pointed out, $40,000 for the Caribbean's smaller islands would be the equivalent of several years' salary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Jack Hayward praises BFA as 'whistleblower' |url=http://www.tribune242.com/06012011_JackHayward_editorial_pg4 |publisher=The Tribune |accessdate=6 June 2011 |date=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605234328/http://www.tribune242.com/06012011_JackHayward_editorial_pg4 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2011, the day after the officials had been given the envelopes, a CFU meeting had been covertly recorded by somebody from within the CFU (Warner later alleged that this Angenie Kanhai, the CFU's general secretary). The video's audio included Warner telling CFU members that Bin Hammam offered to bring "silver plaques and wooden trophies and bunting and so on" as a gift for each member and that Warner suggested Bin Hammam should bring cash.&lt;ref name="telegraph-video"/&gt;

Warner said that he'd told Bin Hammam to pay the CFU directly and the CFU would distribute the cash to its members.&lt;ref name="telegraph-video"/&gt; Warner also told members that if they were uneasy about accepting the money, that they could return it to him and that "if you are pious go to a church friends, but the fact is that our business is our business"&lt;ref name="telegraph-video"/&gt;

== Investigation ==

Eric Labrador, President of the [[Puerto Rican Football Federation]] stated that he accepted the money as it came from a CFU official and not from Bin Hammam. Labrador also stated that he requested a letter from a CFU official to show the Trinidad customs division that the money was for footballing development in Puerto Rico. He reported the incident upon hearing that FIFA did not know about the incident.&lt;ref name="Pag√°n Rivera"/&gt;

CONCACAF general secretary, Chuck Blazer, asked Chicago-based US Federal Prosecutor John Collins of ''Collins and Collins'' to investigate into the events that took place at the Hyatt Regency hotel.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-2011-06-21"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Warner Says He‚Äôd Rather Die Than Meet FIFA Investigator Louis Freeh|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-21/jack-warner-says-he-d-rather-die-than-meet-fifa-investigator.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph-2011-05-28"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revealed: Fifa 's top secret bribery files on Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8544176/Revealed-Fifa-s-top-secret-bribery-files-on-Mohamed-Bin-Hammam-and-Jack-Warner.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interviews were to take place in Miami and be conducted by former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[Louis Freeh]] of the ''Freeh Group''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifa suspend Caribbean official Colin Klass over bribery allegations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/12/fifa-suspend-colin-klass|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several CFU members were uneasy about being interviewed in Miami and FIFA agreed to interview in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Rob|title=FIFA corruption investigation widens with Jack Warner on the brink|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2005310/FIFAs-Manilal-Fernando-Worwawi-Makudi-face-quiz-bribe-claims.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Warner refused to be interviewed: "I have not received any summons asking me to speak with them [the investigators] nor do I plan to do so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Warner will not meet Fifa investigators over bribery claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/09/jack-warner-fifa-investigation|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner suspected an American conspiracy as Chuck Blazer, John Collins and Louis Freeh are all American citizens: "I'm not going to back a complaint made by an American and investigated by Americans and an attempt to put it on American soil because the complaint is from Miami,"&lt;ref name="bloomberg-2011-06-21"/&gt;

The CFU general secretary, 28-year-old Trinidadian Angenie Kanhai, agreed to give evidence at the FIFA hearing. The evidence detailed Warner's instruction to deliver "gifts" of sealed envelopes, said to contain cash, to each of the delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bond|first=David|title=Jack Warner gave cash to official, document obtained by BBC claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14256797|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other members of the CFU had refused to do so.

Louis Giskus, president of the [[Surinaamse Voetbal Bond]] also stated that he had been given an envelope: "We went up to a room and were given $40,000 in a brown envelope with the name of Surinam on it,"&lt;ref name="la-times-2011-06-10"&gt;{{cite web|title=Surinam soccer chief describes alleged bribery attempt|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/06/surinam-soccer-alleged-bribery-attempt-fifa.html|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other CFU leaders, reportedly from the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands, also described attempts to give them identical amounts of money.&lt;ref name="la-times-2011-06-10"/&gt;

In his defence, Bin Hammam claimed that the $40,000 was to cover travel, 'accommodation expenses and "administrative costs" of the meeting'. Warner and 12 other member associations claimed that no money was given and that "the allegations are entirely false".&lt;ref name="telegraph-2011-05-28"/&gt;

=== Trinidadian police reaction ===

Transparency international and the political party 'People's National Movement' (Warner's political opponents) both called for the Trinidad police to launch an investigation into the bribery claims.&lt;ref name="texpress-2011-06-11"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibbs: Police to ask FIFA for bribery info|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Gibbs__Police_to_ask_FIFA_for_bribery_info-123675079.html|publisher=Trinidad Express|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=11 June 2011}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinidadian Police Commissioner Dwayne Gibbs was also expected to investigate the bribery claims.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-2011-06-21"/&gt; Gibbs stated that as there had been no official complaint, there was nothing to investigate, he stated that if there was an investigation to be made, it would be conducted by the Customs and Excise Division as according to Trinidadian law, only amounts up to $5,000 can be carried out of the country as baggage.&lt;ref name="texpress-2011-06-11"/&gt;

Keith Rowley, leader of the 'People's National Movement', accused Gibbs of sitting on his hands and "pandering to the political directorate".&lt;ref name="trinidad-express-2011-10-06"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowley writes PSC on Gibbs' handling of FIFA matter|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Rowley_writes_PSC_on_Gibbs__handling_of_FIFA_matter-131306779.html|publisher=Trinidad Express|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=6 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115140724/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Rowley_writes_PSC_on_Gibbs__handling_of_FIFA_matter-131306779.html#|archive-date=2012-01-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Warner resigned from his position as CONCACAF president after being reported to [[FIFA]] by the [[United States|American]] CONCACAF General Secretary [[Chuck Blazer]]. This automatically led to 71-year-old Barbadian [[Lisle Austin]] being installed as Acting President.

Austin's first act was to attempt to sack Blazer for his role in the removal of Warner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concacaf claims Acting President wrong in Blazer firing |url=http://www.ctntworld.com/LocalArticles.aspx?id=28152 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728181237/http://www.ctntworld.com/LocalArticles.aspx?id=28152 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2012 |publisher=ctntworld.com |accessdate=4 March 2012 |date=31 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement was published on the CONCACAF website stating that Austin did not have the authority to sack Blazer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAUTHORIZED ACTION TAKEN VERSUS CONCACAF GENERAL SECRETARY; BLAZER CONTINUES AS CONCACAF GENERAL SECRETARY|url=http://www.concacaf.com/page/ConfederationDetail/0,,12813~2369780,00.html|publisher=CONCACAF.com|accessdate=4 March 2012|date=31 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020043018/http://www.concacaf.com/page/ConfederationDetail/0,,12813~2369780,00.html#|archive-date=2011-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Austin quoted article 29 from the CONCACAF Statutes that states, "The President has the judicial and extrajudicial representation of CONCACAF." &lt;ref name="austin-statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Acting Concacaf President: Blazer's termination legal |url=http://www.ctntworld.com/LocalArticles.aspx?id=28170 |publisher=CTNT World |accessdate=3 March 2012 |date=1 June 2011 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As CONCACAF is a registered not-for-profit company in [[Barbados]],&lt;ref name="concacaf-statutes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutes of CONCACAF.com|url=http://www.concacaf.com/staticFiles/af/41/0,,12813~147887,00.pdf|publisher=CONCACAF.com|accessdate=3 March 2012|format=pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611072814/http://www.concacaf.com/staticFiles/af/41/0%2C%2C12813~147887%2C00.pdf#|archive-date=2011-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin sought an injunction from the Barbadian court which would prevent Chuck Blazer and the executive committee from becoming de facto head of CONCACAF.

The Bahamanian judge Stephen Isaacs granted an injunction which told CONCACAF to desist "from interfering with Lisle Austin in the discharge of his duties as acting president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More wrangling within CONCACAF|url=http://www.caribbeanfootballunion.org/home/component/content/article/663-more-wrangling-within-concacaf-.html|publisher=Caribbean Football Union|accessdate=4 March 2012|date=June 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120903174332/http://www.caribbeanfootballunion.org/home/component/content/article/663-more-wrangling-within-concacaf-.html#|archive-date=2012-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin also attempted to prevent the CONCACAF using counsel Michael Collins, who had helped put the investigation together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blazer refuses to cut ties with lawyers in bribery probe|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/31052011/2/blazer-refuses-cut-ties-lawyers-bribery-probe.html|publisher=Eurosport (Reuters)|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin was banned from CONCACAF office in New York and suspended from administrating in football in the CONCACAF region for doing so. The letter was signed by Collins, whom Austin had sought the removal of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice of provisional member |url=http://www.concacaf.com/staticFiles/f3/75/0,,12813~161267,00.pdf |publisher=CONCACAF.com |accessdate=3 March 2012 |date=13 June 2011 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chuck Blazer 'survives sacking attempt', says Concacaf|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13608081|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undeterred, Austin released a public statement stating that CONCACAF took pride in flouting the court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin says confederation disregarding court order|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/sports/06/26/austin-says-confederation-disregarding-court-order/|publisher=Stabroek News|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He complained that his suspension shouldn't be official, as "the presence of four (4) Executive Committee members in the hotel room of Mr. Blazer does not constitute an Executive Committee meeting."&lt;ref name="austin-statement"/&gt;

Austin was banned by [[FIFA]] from administrating in football for one year for attempting to challenge CONCACAF's decision in the Barbadian civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disciplinary Committee bans six match officials for life and Lisle Austin for one year|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=1490214/index.html|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin lasted just four days as president of CONCACAF and the CFU.

In October 2011, the second most influential member of the CFU; CFU's Vice-President and [[Jamaica Football Federation]] President [[Horace Burrell]] was suspended by FIFA for six months (three months of which were suspended).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Ethics Committee takes decisions on ethics proceedings against CFU officials|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/bodies/news/newsid=1527097/index.html|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Burrell's suspension, all three Caribbean members of CONCACAF had been suspended due to the scandal. Honduran [[Alfredo Hawit]] was appointed as acting President of CONCACAF, becoming the first non-Caribbean CONCACAF President since 1990.

=== CFU Presidency  ===

In addition to Austin and Burrell's suspensions, another CFU vice-president, Guyana FA's President Colin Klass was suspended for 26 months.&lt;ref name="klass-ban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethics Committee bans Guyana FA president Colin Klass for 26 months|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=1515457/index.html|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the additional suspension of Klass, and the resignation of [[Lionel Haven]], the [[Haitian Football Federation]] President [[Yves Jean-Bart]] became acting president of the CFU.

=== Relocation of headquarters ===

CFU general secretary [[Angenie Kanhai]] had been prevented from entering the CFU office (owned by Jack Warner) in Port-of-Spain due to her compliance at the FIFA Ethics Committee hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liburd|first=Lasana|title=Can FIFA spare change in the Caribbean?|url=http://www.playthegame.org/news/detailed/can-fifa-spare-change-in-the-caribbean-5304.html &lt;!--|title=CFU general secretary Kanhai resigns due to "pressures"--&gt;|publisher=Play the game|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She relocated and worked whilst stationed at the [[CONCACAF]] headquarters in [[Miami]], [[United States]], outside of the CFU's remit.

In an open letter Jack Warner made accusations of conspiracy in an open letter; "I will also give you detailed accounts of the conspiracy against the CFU by one of its own, who secretly videotaped that meeting for Chuck Blazer and was rewarded with an office in Miami and a higher salary and who unilaterally moved the CFU‚Äôs 33-year-old office from [[Port of Spain]] to Miami so that every Caribbean official wanting to do football business in the [[Caribbean]] had to get a [[United States visas|US visa]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Warner responds to London Telegraph video: Ingratitude worse than witchcraft|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2011/10/18/jack-warner-responds-london-telegraph-video-ingratitude-worse-witchcraft|publisher=Guardian (Trinidad and Tobago)|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harold Taylor, a Trinidadian CFU presidential candidate questioned the thought behind the moving the CFU headquarters to Miami. "The office of the Secretariat is in the territory where the General Secretary resides. The General Secretary is from Trinidad, so how can you have the Secretariat in Miami? It is unthinkable to have a CFU office in Miami ... too many members in the CFU must get a visa to go to Miami and some of them cannot even get visas and you have at least one permanent member of the Union who can‚Äôt even go to the US, so how could you put the office in Miami,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFU presidential candidate against the relocation of the union‚Äôs secretariat office|url=http://www.rjr94fm.com/news/cfu-presidential-candidate-against-relocation-union%E2%80%99s-secretariat-office|publisher=rjr94fm.com|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanhai resigned from her position in December 2011: "I regret to have taken this decision at a time such as now, a period of upheaval and change, but I was forced to face, like all of you, the emotional, psychological and physical toll paid over the last months," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Delayed congress ===

An [[extraordinary general meeting]] for the CFU was scheduled for 20 November 2011 in [[Montego Bay]], [[Jamaica]]. Four representatives expressed an interest in becoming the CFU president. These were the suspended [[Horace Burrell]] (Jamaica), [[Tony James (sports executive)|Tony James]] (Jamaica), former CFU secretary [[Harold Taylor (sports executive)|Harold Taylor]] (Trinidad) and [[Gordon Derrick]] (Antigua and Barbuda). It was also suggested that [[Yves Jean-Bart]] (Haiti) and Luis Fernandez (Cuba) may express an interest in the position.

As a result of his Burrell's suspension, it was questioned whether he was eligible to be a candidate for the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifa bans four Caribbean officials after cash-for-votes inquiry|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15315021|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrell's suspension would end on 16 January 2012.  The congress meeting was delayed and rescheduled for 15 February 2012, after Burrell's suspension had elapsed. The congress never took place.

Horace Burrell, the front-runner for the presidency position announced that he would not put his name forward for CONCACAF presidency and that he would prefer to become CFU president. He recommended the [[Cayman Islands Football Association]] president and his business partner [[Jeffrey Webb]] for the CONCACAF role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burrell not trying for CONCACAF job|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sports/Burrell-not-trying-for-CONCACAF-job-141058883.html|publisher=Trinidad Express|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=1 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124354/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sports/Burrell-not-trying-for-CONCACAF-job-141058883.html#|archive-date=2014-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrick was voted in as CFU president in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Derrick elected CFU president |url=http://www.concacaf.com/page/AssociationNewsDetail/0,,12813~2785783,00.html |publisher=CONCACAF.com |accessdate=24 June 2013 |date=22 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927180009/http://www.concacaf.com/page/AssociationNewsDetail/0%2C%2C12813~2785783%2C00.html |archivedate=27 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FIFA investigation outcome ==

In 2011, 31 members of the CFU were investigated by the 'FIFA Ethics Committee' due to the cash-for-votes scandal. The outcome of those investigations are shown in the table below.

The general secretary and whistleblower Chuck Blazer was also investigated by FIFA. An accusation of racism was made, a letter from the [[Jamaica Football Federation]] noted that Blazer only told Caribbean officials they were being investigated said that Blazer "discriminated against Capt Burrell and certain members of the Concacaf through his contemptuous and denigratory words since all the persons who were singled out were of a specific race". Blazer had also told Burrell he could not become Vice-President of CONCACAF as he was being investigated by FIFA.

In July 2012, the former Dominican prime minister Patrick John was banned from presiding over the [[Dominica Football Association]] for his part in the corruption scandal. A vote was carried out by the Dominican football club association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dominica Football Association president banned|url=http://www.caribbean360.com/index.php/news/dominica_news/593382.html#axzz20HygHJP7|publisher=Caribbean360.com|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warner's response ===

In August 2011, Warner stated that he saw the investigation  as an assault on the Caribbean nations asking "why is FIFA targeting the Caribbean, why is FIFA going after the Caribbean leadership."&lt;ref name="ctntworld-2011-08-14"&gt;{{cite web|title=Warner on FIFA's CFU investigation |url=http://www.ctntworld.com/LocalArticles.aspx?id=30452 |publisher=ctntworld.com |date=14 August 2011 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Warner described the rebuilding process as a "[[coup d'etat]]" and described the investigation as "unethical" and "immoral".&lt;ref name="ctntworld-2011-12-23"&gt;{{cite web |title=Warner breaks silence after CFU appointments |url=http://www.ctntworld.com/LocalArticles.aspx?id=36690 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121063041/http://www.ctntworld.com/LocalArticles.aspx?id=36690 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 January 2013 |publisher=ctntworld.com |date=23 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to the CFU members who had worked with FIFA as "cowardly men and women".&lt;ref name="ctntworld-2011-12-23"/&gt; During his time as CFU President, Warner had also acted as a [[whip (politics)|whip]] since 1983 priding himself on delivering a unified 'Caribbean-bloc' vote, he felt that the CFU were now ready to "accept the crumbs of the FIFA President when in the very recent past these same men and women used to dine at his table as equals".&lt;ref name="ctntworld-2011-12-23"/&gt;

He said: "In one fell swoop, the Caribbean football leadership has now undone its struggle of some 33 years and has disrespected the entire region!"&lt;ref name="ctntworld-2011-12-23"/&gt;

Warner described FIFA as arrogant and that they would "ride roughshod over duly appointed officials of both the CFU and the CONCACAF".&lt;ref name="ctntworld-2011-12-23"/&gt; He stated that those CFU members complying with FIFA would "destroy an entire region for their own selfish and self-serving motives"&lt;ref name="ctntworld-2011-12-23"/&gt;

=== Bin Hammam's legal challenge ===

On 29 May 2011, FIFA's ethics committee suspended Bin Hammam temporarily from all football-related activity pending the outcome of a full inquiry into accusations that they offered financial incentives to members of the [[Caribbean Football Union]].&lt;ref name=ESPN_1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/924368/sepp-blatter-escapes-as-jack-warner,-mohammed-bin-hammam-suspended|title=Blatter escapes, Bin Hammam banned|date=29 May 2011|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Hammam said that he would appeal against the committees decision to provisionally ban him from football related activity, saying that "The way these proceedings have been conducted is not compliant with any principles of justice."&lt;ref name="hammam-appeal"&gt;{{Cite news |date=30 May 2011|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13590264.stm|title=Bin Hammam to appeal against Fifa suspension|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also issued a statement calling for his reinstatement as well as responding to the claims in detail.

On 23 July 2011, Bin Hammam was banned for life from all football activities by a five-member panel of the [[FIFA]] Ethics committee chaired by [[Petrus Damaseb]]. The committee found that his actions violated the organization' ethics rules after studying the reports of investigators and hearing the testimony of witnesses from the May 2011 meeting who were also cross examined by Bin Hammam's legal representatives.&lt;ref name="fifa-2011-07-23"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peach|first=Simon|title=Bin Hammam handed lifetime ban from football|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/bin-hammam-handed-lifetime-ban-from-football-2319420.html|publisher=Independent|accessdate=6 March 2012|date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://streamstudio.world-television.com/CCUIv3/streamSelect.aspx?ticket=645-676-10049&amp;target=en-default-&amp;status=ondemand&amp;browser=ns-0-0-0-10-0 Video of Damaseb/Ethics Committee statement on Bin Hamman--FIFA], FIFA Video of bin Hammam Press Conference, 24 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Hammam appealed against his ban, his appeal was rejected by the FIFA Appeal Committee.&lt;ref name="fifa-2011-09-15"&gt;{{cite web|title=Appeal Committee confirms Ethics Committee decision on Bin Hammam|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/bodies/news/newsid=1511253/index.html|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=6 March 2012|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ban from football resulted in his loss of position as the President of the Asian Football Confederation, having been replaced by [[Zhang Jilong]] of China on a temporary basis, although Zhang Jilong has since announced that he'd like to remain as AFC Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warshaw |first=Andrew |title=China's Zhang Jilong wants permanent role as head of AFC |url=http://www.insideworldfootball.biz/worldfootball/asia/10342-chinas-zhang-jilong-wants-permanent-role-as-head-of-afc |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804224328/http://www.insideworldfootball.biz/worldfootball/asia/10342-chinas-zhang-jilong-wants-permanent-role-as-head-of-afc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2012 |publisher=World Football Insider |accessdate=6 March 2012 |date=10 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled in Mohammed Bin Hamman's favour, CAS referred to it as "...a situation of 'case not proven,'" because FIFA didn't have documentation of monies being transferred and thus "the investigation was not complete or comprehensive enough to fill the gaps in the record".&lt;ref name="reuters-2012-7-19"&gt;{{cite web|last=Homewood|first=Brian|title=Bin Hammam's life ban overturned by CAS|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/19/us-soccer-fifa-hammam-idUSBRE86I0N020120719|publisher=reuters|accessdate=20 July 2012|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court added that it "is not making any sort of affirmative finding of innocence in relation to Mr. Bin Hammam".&lt;ref name="reuters-2012-7-19"/&gt;

Bin Hammam said: "I'm very happy because I've been able to prove that all the allegations against me were false and were intended to tarnish my reputation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truth has prevailed, Bin Hammam tells AFP|url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/78818/Truth_has_prevailed_Bin_Hammam_tells_AFP.aspx|publisher=Sport.co.uk|accessdate=20 July 2012|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Facets Multi-Media]] founded the '''Chicago International Children's Film Festival''' (CICFF), the first competitive festival of films for children in the U.S. The impetus for the Festival came from a need to introduce new, culturally diverse films for children to American children's audiences, and to recognize excellence in children's filmmaking. In addition, the Festival sought to empower children by involving them directly in the jurying process. From its inception, the Festival has had independent juries of children and adult media professionals awarding prizes in multiple categories.

The Chicago International Children's Film Festival is the largest annual festival of films for children (ages 2‚Äì16) in the world{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, programming 250 films and videos from 40 countries. With 25,000 children, adults and educators and over 100 filmmakers, programmers and celebrities each year, the Festival  is one of the only{{clarify|date=February 2014}} [[Academy Award]]-qualifying children's film festivals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The Festival is held every October at various theatrical venues around [[Chicago, Illinois]].

==Activities==
*'''Facets Kids Film Camp'''
*'''Year-round Screenings'''
Facets Children's Programs feature year-round screenings for parents and groups, presenting unique multicultural short films for children as catalysts for improving fundamental skills such as literacy, writing, critical thinking and inference. 
*'''Dream Screen'''
Dream Screen is a workshop that teaches children to create their own stories and to animate them using drawn and cutout animation. Students from underserved communities participate in all aspects of video production: writing and storyboarding, drawing, art making, and camerawork.

'''Cobalt Networks''' was a maker of low-cost [[Linux]]-based [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[server appliance]]s. The company had 1,900 end user customers in more than 70 countries.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

During the [[dot-com bubble]], the company had a [[market capitalization]] of $6 billion despite only $22 million in annual revenue.

In 2000, the company was acquired by [[Sun Microsystems]] and in December 2003, Sun shut down the Cobalt product line.&lt;ref name=coffin/&gt;

Cobalt was the most successful web server appliance vendor of its time, and that success motivated the founding of blade server pioneer [[RLX Technologies]].&lt;ref name=coffin/&gt;

==History==
The company was founded in 1996 by Vivek Mehra as Cobalt Microserver. In June 1998, the company changed its name to Cobalt Networks, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=26637 | title=Company Overview of Cobalt Networks, Inc. | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Confederados''' ({{IPA-pt|k√µfedeÀà…æadus}}) were some 10,000 to 20,000 [[Confederate States of America|Confederate American]] refugees who fled to [[Brazil]], chiefly to the state of [[S√£o Paulo (state)|S√£o Paulo]], from the [[Southern United States]] after the [[American Civil War]]. Although many eventually returned to the United States after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], some remained and descendants of Confederados can be found in many cities throughout Brazil.

==Original Confederados==
In 1865 at the end of the American Civil War a substantial number of [[Southern United States|Southerners]] left the region; many moved to other parts of the United States, such as the [[American Old West|American West]], but a few left the country entirely. The most popular destination for emigration was the [[Brazilian Empire]], where slavery remained legal.&lt;ref name=Herbert&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/17/confederados-forge-new-cultural-identity/ |title=Confederados forge new cultural identity |first=Paul N |last=Herbert |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |date=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Dom Pedro II]] wanted to encourage the cultivation of [[cotton]]. After the American Civil War, Dom Pedro offered the potential immigrants subsidized transport to Brazil, cheap land, and tax breaks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Harter, Eugene C. ''The Lost Colony of the Confederacy''.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] and General [[Robert E. Lee]] advised Southerners against emigration, but many ignored their advice and set out to establish a new life away from the destruction of war and Northern rule under [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].

Many Southerners who took the Emperor's offer had lost their lands during the war, were unwilling to live under a conquering army, or simply did not expect an improvement in the South's economic position. In addition, [[Slavery in Brazil|Brazil still had slavery]] (and did not abolish it until 1888). Most of the immigrants were from the states of [[Alabama]], [[Texas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]].

No one has determined how many Americans immigrated to Brazil in the years following the end of the American Civil War. As noted in unpublished research, Betty Antunes de Oliveira found in port records of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] that some 20,000 Americans entered Brazil from 1865 to 1885.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Other researchers have estimated the number at 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1998/2/1998_2_84.shtml |title=The Deepest South |first=Alan M |last=Tigay |journal=American Heritage |volume=49 |issue=2 |date=April 1998 |pages=84‚Äì95 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216024122/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1998/2/1998_2_84.shtml |archivedate=2011-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown number returned to the United States when conditions in the [[Southern United States|South]] changed, as Reconstruction ended and the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow era]] began. Most immigrants adopted Brazilian citizenship.

The immigrants settled in various places, ranging from the urban areas of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S√£o Paulo]] to the northern [[Amazon basin|Amazon region]], especially [[Santar√©m, Par√°|Santar√©m]], and [[Paran√° (state)|Paran√°]] in the south. Most of the Confederados settled in the area to the north of S√£o Paulo, around present-day [[Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste]] and [[Americana, S√£o Paulo|Americana]]. The latter name was derived from ''Vila dos Americanos'', as the natives called it. The first Confederado recorded was Colonel [[William H. Norris]] of [[Alabama]], who left the U.S. with 30 Confederate families and arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 27 December 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Gage|first=Leighton| title=Brazilian Confederacy |url=http://sleuthsayers.blogspot.com/2012/01/brazilian-confederacy.html |publisher=Sleuthsayers| accessdate=18 January 2012| location=S√£o Paulo, Brasil| date=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colony at Santa B√°rbara D'Oeste is sometimes called the ''Norris Colony''.

Dom Pedro's program was judged a success for both the immigrants and the Brazilian government. The settlers quickly gained a reputation for honesty and hard work.&lt;ref name=Herbert/&gt; The settlers brought modern agricultural techniques for cotton, as well as new food crops, which spread among native Brazilian farmers. Some dishes of the American South were also adopted in general Brazilian culture, such as [[chess pie]], vinegar pie, [[southern fried chicken]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and [[Texas caviar]] (known as {{lang|pt|salada de feij√£o-fradinho}} in Portuguese).

The early Confederados continued many elements of American culture, for instance, establishing the first [[Baptist]] churches in Brazil. In a change from the South, the Confederados also educated slaves and black freedmen in their new schools.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A few newly freed slaves in the United States emigrated alongside their Confederate counterparts and in some cases with their previous owners. One such former slave, Steve Watson, became the administrator of the sawmill of his former owner, Judge Dyer of Texas. When Dyer returned to the US, due to homesickness and financial failure, Dyer deeded his remaining property, the sawmill and 12 acres, to Watson. In the area of the [[Juqui√°|Juquia]] valley there are many Brazilian families with the surname Vass√£o, the Portuguese pronunciation of Watson.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Descendants of the immigrants==
[[File:Confedarado.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Jimmy Carter at Confederado monument|In 1972, Georgia Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] visited Brazil and remarked on the similarity between American Southerners and Confederados, descendants of Confederates who immigrated to Brazil after the Civil War. The youngsters with him are fifth-generation Confederados. The Rev. Ballard S. Dunn (top) of [[New Orleans]] led a large contingent of Southerners to Brazil. Flags of Brazil, the Confederacy and the U.S. in a church speak to the descendants' mixed heritage.]]
The first generation of ''Confederados'' remained an insular community. As is typical, by the third generation, most of the families had intermarried with native Brazilians or immigrants of other origins. Descendants of the ''Confederados'' increasingly spoke the [[Portuguese language]] and identified themselves as Brazilians. As the area around [[Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste]] and [[Americana, S√£o Paulo|Americana]] turned to the production of [[sugar cane]] and society became more mobile, the ''Confederados'' moved to cities for urban jobs. Today, only a few descendant families still live on land owned by their ancestors. The descendants of the ''Confederados'' are mostly scattered throughout Brazil. They maintain the headquarters of their descendant organization at the Campo center in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste, where there is a cemetery, chapel and memorial.

The descendants foster a connection with their history through the ''Associa√ß√£o Descend√™ncia Americana'' (American Descendants Association), a descendant organization dedicated to preserving their unique mixed culture. The ''Confederados'' also have an annual festival, called the ''Festa Confederada'', dedicated to fund the Campo center. The festival is marked by [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flags]], [[Uniforms of the Confederate States Armed Forces|Confederate uniforms]] and [[hoop skirt]]s, food of the American South with a Brazilian flair, and dances and music popular in the American South during the antebellum period. The descendants maintain affection for the Confederate flag even though they completely identify as Brazilian. Many ''Confederado'' descendants have traveled to the United States at the invitation of the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], an American descendants' organization, to visit Civil War battlefields, attend re-enactments, or see where their ancestors lived.

The Confederate flag in Brazil has not acquired the same political symbolism as it has in the United States. Many descendants of the ''Confederados'' are of mixed race and reflect the varied ethnic groups of Brazilian society in their physical appearance. In the wake of then-Governor [[Jimmy Carter]]'s visit to the region in 1972, [[Americana, S√£o Paulo|Americana]] incorporated the Confederate flag into the municipal coat of arms (though the largely [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]]-descended population removed it some years later, reasoning that descendants of ''Confederados'' now comprise but a tenth of the municipal population). While in Brazil, Carter also visited the city of Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste and the grave at the Campo of a great-uncle of his wife [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]]. Her relative was one of the original Confederados. Carter remarked that the Confederados sounded and seemed just like Southerners.&lt;ref name=Herbert/&gt;

Campo Cemetery with its chapel and memorial, in [[Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste]], is a site of memory, as most of the original Confederados from the region were buried there. Because they were [[Protestantism|Protestant]] rather than [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], they were excluded from the local cemeteries and had to establish their own. The Confederado descendants' community has also contributed to an Immigration Museum at Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste to present the history of immigration to Brazil.

==In fiction==
[[Yale University]] history professor [[Rollin G. Osterweis]] penned ''Santarem'', a novel about Confederados.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=John B.|title=Retired Yale History Professor, Rollin G.

Confederados are also featured in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20614">The [[War of the Pacific]] had profound consequences on the involved countries.

==Diplomatic changes==
After the war Chile had obtained military hegemony at the Pacific coast of South America. Chile's expansion was seen with concern across the continent and Chilean diplomats responded to this by fomenting rivalries between Chile's neighbors and other South American countries while promoting friendly relationships between countries with disputes with Chile's neighbors. Examples of this are the Chilean attempts to establish friendly relationships between Ecuador and Colombia, both were countries that had serious territorial disputes with Peru in the Amazon. Military cooperation with Ecuador grew considerably with Chile sending instructors to the military academy in [[Quito]] and selling superfluous arms and munitions to Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;Burr , Robert N. 1955.

''The Hispanic American Historical Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Chile's over-all good relations with Ecuador both countries had a minor diplomatic crisis resulting from the capture of the Peruvian torpedo boat [[Torpedo boats in the War of the Pacific|''Alay'']] in Ecuadorian territorial waters during the war.&lt;ref name=tromben2002&gt;{{Citation| last  = Tromben| first = Carlos| title = Naval Presence: The Cruiser Esmeralda in Panama| journal = International Journal of Naval History | volume  = 1| issue   = 1| year    = 2002| pages   = | url     = http://www.ijnhonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pdf_tromben_english.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argentina]], the only country that didn't have war with Chile for border proximity, also had tensions with Chile since, but unlike Peru and Bolivia, Argentina successfully maintained status quo with Chile and remained not involved, despite how they almost fought a war over the [[Falklands War]] controversies.

==Chilean economic boom and decline==
{{see also|Economic history of Chile}}
As the victor and possessor of a new coastal territory following the War of the Pacific, Chile benefited by gaining a lucrative territory with significant mineral income. The national treasury grew by 900 percent between 1879 and 1902, due to taxes coming from the newly acquired lands.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, ''The Epic of Latin America'', p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; British involvement and control of the nitrate industry rose significantly,&lt;ref name="Foster_2003"&gt;Foster, John B. &amp; Clark, Brett.

==Rise of Bolivian/Peruvian Anti-Chilean sentiment==
[[File:BoliviaChile.jpg|thumb|[[Eduardo Abaroa]]'s statue [[irredentism|pointing to the sea]]. The mural reads: "''What once was ours, will be ours once again''," and, "''Hold on [[roto]]s [Chileans], because here come the Colorados of Bolivia''."]]
{{see also|Anti-Chilean sentiment}}

Historical and current anti-Chilean resentiment in Bolivia, Peru and Argentina was caused by the Chilean expansionism that took place during the 19th century. The War of the Pacific contributed decisively to it in the case of the first two countries.

In Bolivia, a common political discourse attributes that country's underdevelopment to its loss of seaports in the [[War of the Pacific]] becoming a [[landlocked country]].&lt;ref name=coha/&gt; Bolivia lost its [[Litoral Department]] and its outlet to the Pacific Ocean, following that war. Currently Chile's huge [[copper]] vein in the Atacama Desert‚Äîwhich makes Chile the largest copper exporter in the world‚Äîis held in the lands claimed by Bolivia; the same lands lost during the war.

In Peru, a strong anti-Chilean sentiment exists due to losing "a large chunk of its southern territory to Chile" in the [[War of the Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-01-16-3095036279_x.htm |title= Peru disputes boundary with Chile | newspaper= USA Today | date= 16 January 2008 | first= Edison |last= Lopez |agency= Associated Press | location= Lima, Peru| quote=There is strong anti-Chilean sentiment in Peru because the country lost a large chunk of its southern territory to Chile in a war in 1879.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peru lost its provinces of [[Tarapac√° Province (Peru)|Tarapaca]] and [[Arica]], and then suffered the indignity of having its capital, Lima, be not only occupied by Chile at the end of the war, but essentially ransacked.

For Argentina, since they didn't get involved in the conflict, and were also on the run to colonize the less inhabitated South, Chile's victory in the conflict stemmed tensions that Chile was trying to take land from the hand of the Argentines. Although this never happened and both finalized their border, the two countries remained belligerents, and even almost fought a war in 1982. On the other side, Argentina's unsupportive action for Bolivia and Peru also made their relationships very tense, and there is a sense of distrust towards Argentina among many Peruvians and Bolivians.

==Rise of superiority ideas==
During and after the war there was a rise of racial and national superiority ideas among the Chilean ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Ericka Beckman ''Imperial Impersonations: Chilean Racism and the War of the Pacific'' University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean historian [[Gonzalo Bulnes]] (son of president [[Manuel Bulnes]]) once wrote, "What defeated Peru was the superiority of a race and of a history".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farcau|2000|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the occupation of Tacna and Arica (1884‚Äì1929) the Peruvian people and nation were treated in racist and denigrating terms by the Chilean press.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Skuban ''Lines in the sand: nationalism and identity on the Peruvian-Chilean frontier'' page 79:
: "because it is undoubtedly preferable to be Chilean than Peruvian, because has a cleaner and more glorious history, and its better to belong to the phalanx of the conquerors than that of the conquered, because the Chilean race is more virile, valiant, prouder, nobler and more enterprising than the Peruvian race, which due to reasons of climate will always be enervated" Chilean newspaper ''El Corvo'' quote in page 80&lt;/ref&gt; During the war Peruvians were disrespectfully referred to as "[[Cholo#Historical_usage|cholos]]" (a slur for persons of mixed European and non-European ancestry) by Chilean officers.&lt;ref name=Vergara&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vergara |first=Jorge Iv√°n |last2=Gundermann |first2=Hans |year=2012 |title=Constitution and internal dynamics of the regional identitary in Tarapac√° and Los Lagos, Chile |url= |journal=[[Chungara (journal)|Chungara]] |language=Spanish |publisher=[[University of Tarapac√°]] |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=115‚Äì134 |doi= 10.4067/s0717-73562012000100009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences for indigenous peoples==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's newly acquired [[aymara people|Aymara]] population was seen after the war as a "foreign element" contrasting with the also newly conquered Mapuches who were seen as "primordial" Chileans.&lt;ref name=Vergara/&gt;

In the aftermath of the war, the [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous populations of Peru]] became scapegoats in the [[narrative]]s of Peruvian ''[[criollo people|criollo]]'' elites, exemplified in the writing of [[Ricardo Palma]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The principal cause of the great defeat is that the majority of Peru is composed of that wretched and degraded race that we once attempted to dignify and ennoble. The Indian lacks patriotic sense; he is born enemy of the white and of the man of the coast. It makes no difference to him whether he is a Chilean or a Turk. To educate the Indian and to inspire him a feeling for patriotism will not be the task of our institutions, but of the ages.''&lt;ref name="Larson196"&gt;Larson, Brooke. 2004. Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810‚Äì1910. Page 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Anti-Chinese sentiment in Peru==
Because the [[Chinese Peruvians|Chinese]] supported Chile in the conflict, it had stemmed a sense of [[Sinophobia]] in Peru, the first of its kind ever existed in [[Latin America]]. Armed [[indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous]] peasants sacked and occupied [[hacienda]]s of landed elite [[criollo people|criollo]] "collaborationists" in the central Sierra ‚Äì majority of them were of ethnic Chinese descent, while indigenous and [[mestizo]] Peruvians murdered Chinese shopkeepers in Lima in response to this Chinese [[coolie]]s revolted and even joined the Chilean Army.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, Lewis. Indigenous Peasant Rebellions in Peru during the 1880s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bonilla"&gt;Bonilla, Heraclio. 1978. The National and Colonial Problem in Peru. ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past and Present]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 20th century, memory of Chinese supports for Chile was so deep that [[Manuel A. Odr√≠a]], once dictator of Peru, issued ban against Chinese immigration as a punishment for their betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=OP-EBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=sinophobia+peru&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hJsiEwA8Xe&amp;sig=LVE_M83bDe-Mm2igEeTSldf_O4I&amp;hl=vi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4_L72g-vaAhWJurwKHb1ZBrIQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=sinophobia%20peru&amp;f=false/ Dragons in the Land of the Condor: Writing Tus√°n in Peru]&lt;/ref&gt; Although today, Sinophobia has been lesser relevant and the Chinese are widely accepted as Peruvian citizens, distrustful of China and Chinese still remains.

== Unrest and war trauma in Peru ==

The War of the Pacific also sparked an indigenous peasant guerrilla movement throughout the central Sierra against Chileans and collaborationist landlords. In 1884 C√°ceres turned against his former guerrilla allies in order to defend the old order. In 1886 and 1888 the C√°ceres sent troops to the central sierra to disarm the peasants. The lack of rule of law in central sierra was such that, in one particular case, a landowner was only able to recover his occupied estate in 1902 after a massive mobilization of military, police and gunmen.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, Lewis. Indigenous Peasant Rebellions in Peru during the 1880s&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall Consequences==
=== Bolivia ===
With the loss of sovereign access to the Pacific ocean in mind the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904)|1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship]] granted Bolivia the right to tax-free transport of goods, and duty-free access to northern Chilean ports. It also obliged the Chilean government to build two rail-lines linking [[La Paz]] to [[Antofagasta]] and [[Arica]].

Despite these concessions, the loss of the ''Litoral'' (the coast) remains a deeply emotional and political issue for Bolivians,&lt;ref name=coha&gt;http://www.coha.org/boliviachile-pacific-access&lt;/ref&gt; as was particularly evident during the 2003 [[Bolivian Gas War|natural gas riots]]. Undeterred by the seaport concessions granted to Bolivia via the 1904 treaty popular belief in Bolivia still see their problems attributed to its landlocked condition; getting a sovereign piece of the seacoast via Chilean land is often seen as the solution to their problems. Numerous Bolivian presidents pressured Chile for sovereign access to the sea. Diplomatic relations with Chile were severed on March 17, 1978, in spite of considerable commercial ties. The leading Bolivian newspaper ''[[El Diario (La Paz)|El Diario]]'' featured at least a weekly editorial on the subject, and the Bolivian people annually celebrated a patriotic "Dia del Mar" (Day of the Sea) to remember the crippling loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the war Chile dropped its claims on more than {{convert|1000000|km2|abbr=on}} of [[Patagonia]] in the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina|1881 Chile/Argentina treaty]], to ensure Argentina's neutrality. After the war, the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]] grew until 1899, since both Chile and Argentina claimed former Bolivian territories. On August 28, 1929, Chile [[Tacna‚ÄìArica compromise|returned the province of Tacna to Peru]]. In 1999, Chile and Peru at last agreed to fully implement the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)]], providing Peru with a port in [[Arica]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Jorge et al. 2003 ''Boundary Disputes in Latin America''. United States Washington, D.C.: Institute of Peace.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peru ===
According to Bruce W. Farcau, "in Peru, the wounds run less deep than in neighboring Bolivia".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farcau|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the War of the Pacific, Peru was left without saltpeter production, the Chilean controlled production decreased to 15%, and production controlled by British investors rose to 55%.&lt;ref name="sotocardenas"&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0000312.pdf ''British Influence on the Salt: The Origin, Nature and Decline''], Soto C√°rdenas, Alejandro. Santiago : Ed. University of Santiago de Chile, 1998. Page 50&lt;/ref&gt; According to military historian Robert L. Scheina, the Chilean plunder of Peruvian national literary and art treasures contributed to "demands of revenge among Peruvians for decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scheina|2003|p= 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Brooke Larson pointed out that the War of the Pacific was the ''"first time since independence wars"'' that ''"Peru was invaded, occupied and pillaged by a foreign army"'' and that ''"no other Andean republic experienced such a costly and humiliating defeat as Peru did in the hands of Chile"''.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Brooke. 2004. Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810‚Äì1910. Page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war and post-war period was one of profound political and social instability for Peru. The war shook the whole social order of Peru: armed [[indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous]] peasants sacked and occupied [[hacienda]]s of landed elite [[criollo people|criollo]] "collaborationists" in the central Sierra, Chinese [[coolie]]s revolted and even joined the Chilean Army, indigenous and [[mestizo]] Peruvians murdered Chinese shopkeepers in Lima, [[black|African slave]]s rose against their masters and fought equally the Chinese, Peruvian mobs sacked [[Chiclayo]] at the same time different criollo elite remained deeply divided in opposing camps.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bonilla"&gt;Bonilla, Heraclio. 1978.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13755">The '''Cornish language revival''' ({{lang-kw|dasserghyans Kernowek|lit='resurrection of Cornish'}}) is an ongoing process to revive the use of the [[Cornish language]] of [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom. The Cornish language's disappearance began to hasten during the 13th century, but its decline began with the Anglo-Saxon invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Last speaker of the Cornish language|The last reported person]] to have full knowledge of a traditional form of Cornish, John Davey, died in 1891. The revival movement started in the late 19th century as a result of [[antiquarian]] and academic interest in the language, which was already [[Language extinction|extinct]], and also as a result of the [[Celtic revival]] movement. In 2009, UNESCO changed its classification of Cornish from "extinct" to "critically endangered", seen as a milestone for the revival of the language.

==Revival==
{{refimprove-section|date=January 2016|small=yes}}
[[File:DSCN1082JennerPlaque.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque on Henry Jenner's home with bilingual inscription]]
During the 19th century the Cornish language was the subject of antiquarian interest and a number of lectures were given on the subject and pamphlets on it were published. In 1904, the Celtic language scholar and Cornish cultural activist [[Henry Jenner]] published ''A Handbook of the Cornish Language''. The publication of this book is often considered to be the start of the current revival movement. The spelling in this book was based on that used when Cornish was last a community language in the 18th century.

===Unified Cornish===
{{Main|Unified Cornish}}
The first project to codify Cornish spelling and provide a regular orthography for the revived language was that of [[Robert Morton Nance]] who outlined his work in ''Cornish for All'' in 1929. Unlike the Late Cornish-based work of Jenner, Nance's orthography, called [[Unified Cornish]], was based mainly on the Middle Cornish of the 14th and 15th centuries. Nance believed that this period represented a high point for Cornish literature. As well as presenting a standardised spelling system, Nance also extended the attested vocabulary with forms based largely on [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and published a dictionary of Unified Cornish in 1938. Nance's purist approach favoured older 'Celtic' forms rather than the historically more recent forms deriving from Middle and Early Modern English.

Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish and his orthography was the only one in use for most of the 20th century. However, as the focus shifted from written to spoken Cornish, Nance's stiff, archaic formulation of the language seemed less suitable for a spoken revival. Also, Nance's phonology lacked some distinctions which later research showed must have existed in traditional Cornish. Unified Cornish is still in use by some speakers who, while acknowledging its shortcomings, feel it has served well for the first decades of the revival.

===Kernewek Kemmyn===
{{Main|Kernewek Kemmyn}}
In 1986, in response to dissatisfaction with Unified Cornish, [[Ken George]] undertook a study of the sounds of Cornish and devised a new orthography, ''Kernewek Kemmyn'' or ''Common Cornish'', based on his research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ferdinand, Siarl (2-December-2013). "A Brief History of the Cornish Language, its Revival and its Current Status" (PDF). e-Keltoi 2: 199-227. Retrieved 18 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Like Unified Cornish, Kernewek Kemmyn retained a Middle Cornish base but implemented an orthography that aspired to be as [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]] as possible. George argued that this much closer relationship between sounds and writing would make Cornish much easier to teach and learn.

In 1987, after one year of discussion, the [[Cornish Language Board]] agreed to adopt it. Its adoption by the Cornish Language Board caused a division in the Cornish language community, especially since people had been using Nance's old system for many years and were unfamiliar with the new one. While it was adopted by a majority of Cornish speakers (various estimates put it at around 55‚Äì80%), it came under fierce criticism by academic linguists for its phonological base, as well as those who found its novel orthography too different from traditional Cornish spelling conventions.

===Unified Cornish Revised===
In 1995, ''Kernewek Kemmyn'' was itself challenged by [[Nicholas Williams]] who in his book ''Cornish Today'' listed 26 major flaws in ''Kernewek Kemmyn''. As an alternative, Williams devised and proposed a revision of Unified Cornish, called Unified Cornish Revised (or UCR). UCR built on Unified Cornish, making the spellings regular while keeping as close as possible to the orthographic practices of the medieval scribes. In common with Kernewek Kemmyn, UCR made use of Tudor and Late Cornish prose materials unavailable to Nance. A comprehensive English-Cornish dictionary of Unified Cornish Revised was published in 2000 and sold enough copies to merit a second edition. A response to the criticisms in ''Cornish Today'' appeared soon after in ''Kernewek Kemmyn ‚Äì Cornish for the Twenty First Century'' by Ken George and Paul Dunbar. A counter-reply to the latter appeared in 2007.

===Modern Cornish===
{{Main|Modern Cornish}}
In the early 1980s, [[Richard Gendall]], who had worked with Nance, published a new system based on the works of the later Cornish writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, just before to the language died out. This variety, called [[Modern Cornish]], also known as Late Cornish, uses later, somewhat simpler grammatical constructions and a vocabulary and spelling that was more influenced by English. The orthography has undergone a number of changes. The main body promoting Modern Cornish is [[Cussel an Tavas Kernuak]].

===Cornish Language Partnership===
{{Main|Cornish Language Partnership}}
In practice these different written forms did not prevent Cornish speakers from communicating with each other effectively. However, the existence of multiple orthographies was unsustainable with regards to using the language in education and public life, as no single orthography had ever achieved a wide consensus. Following the recognition in 2002 of Cornish under Part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and the subsequent establishment of the [[Cornish Language Partnership]], the need for consensus became more urgent. In response to this, the Partnership initiated a process to agree on a standard form for use in education and public life.

In 2007 an independent Cornish Language Commission consisting of sociolinguists and linguists from outside of Cornwall was formed to review the four existing forms (Unified, UCR, Late Cornish and Kemmyn) and consider whether any of these existing orthographies might be suitable for adoption as a standard form of Cornish, or whether a new fifth form should be adopted. Two groups made proposals of compromise orthographies:
* The ''UdnFormScrefys'' (''Single Written Form'') Group developed and proposed an orthography, [[Kernowak Standard]], based on traditional orthographic forms and having a clear relation between spelling and pronunciation, taking both Middle Cornish and Late Cornish dialects of Revived Cornish into account.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.kernowek.net Kernowek Standard website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the publication of the Standard Written Form, Kernowak Standard has evolved to become a set of proposed amendments to the SWF.
* Two members of the CLP's Linguistic Working Group, Albert Bock and Benjamin Bruch, proposed another orthography called ''Kernowek Dasunys'' (Cornish Re-unified) which endeavoured to reconcile UC, KK, RLC, and UCR orthographies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dasunys.net/ Kernowek Dasunys website]&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was used as a source of input for the SWF but is not being used as a separate orthography.
* Members of a group called ''Kaskyrgh Kernewek Kemmyn'' (Campaign for Kernewek Kemmyn) did not agree with the creation of a new standard, and argued that the existing Kernewek Kemmyn orthography should become the standard.

The SWF process eventually decided that the existing orthographies were too contentious to be considered and that a new compromise orthography that all groups could support was needed.

===Standard Written Form===
{{Main|Standard Written Form}}
On 9 May 2008, the Cornish Language Partnership met with the specification for the Standard Written Form as the main item on the agenda. All four Cornish language groups, Unified Cornish, Unified Cornish Revised, Kernewek Kemmyn and Modern Cornish were represented at this meeting. Reactions to the proposed orthography were mixed from the various language groups, Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek, Cussel an Tavaz Kern√ªak, Kesva an Taves Kernewek and Agan Tavas, but the majority wanted resolution and acceptance. The Cornish Language Partnership said that it would 'create an opportunity to break down barriers and the agreement marked a significant stepping stone in the Cornish language'.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The vote to ratify the SWF was carried and on 19 May 2008 it was announced that the orthography had been agreed on. Eric Brooke, chairman of the Cornish Language Partnership, said: ''"This marks a significant stepping-stone in the development of the Cornish language. In time this step will allow the Cornish language to move forward to become part of the lives of all in Cornwall."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7074487.stm BBC News 19 May 2008 ‚Äì Breakthrough for Cornish language]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7408686.stm BBC News 19 May 2008 ‚Äì Standard Cornish spelling agreed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=41352 Cornish Language Partnership ‚Äì Standard Written Form Ratified]&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth and final Standard Written Form draft was generated on 30 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kernowek.net/ Kernowek official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2009, the bards of the [[Gorseth Kernow]], under the leadership of [[Grand Bard]] Vanessa Beeman adopted, by overwhelming majority and after two decades of debate, to adopt the SWF for their ceremonies and correspondence. From the earliest days under Grand Bards [[Henry Jenner]] and Morton Nance, Unified Cornish had been used for the Gorseth ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/language-progress/article-1084119-detail/article.html "This is Cornwall" website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kernowek Standard===
{{Main|Kernowek Standard}}
''Kernowek Standard'' (Standard Cornish) is a proposed set of revisions to the SWF. It is based on the initial proposal (called ''Kernowak Standard'' and now designated KS1) for the SWF, developed by a group called UdnFormScrefys. After the publication of the SWF specification, members of this group established a new group, Spellyans, to identify shortcomings in the SWF and propose solutions for consideration when the SWF is reviewed in 2013. The orthography resulting from the application of these revisions, Kernowek Standard, has been used in a number of books, including an edition of the Bible and a comprehensive grammar, ''Desky Kernowek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Williams, Nicholas|title=Desky Kernowek: A complete guide to Cornish|publisher=Evertype|year=2012}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904808-99-2}} (hardcover), {{ISBN|978-1-904808-95-4}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Couple in a Cage: Two Amerindians Visit the West''''' was a 1992-1993 performance art piece by artists [[Guillermo G√≥mez-Pe√±a]] and [[Coco Fusco]] for their exhibition ''The Year of the White Bear and Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West--''which toured five countries and was performing in nine different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/760842/still-in-the-cage-thoughts-on-two-undiscovered-amerindians-20-years-later|title=Still in the Cage: Thoughts on "Two Undiscovered Amerindians," 20 Years Later|last=Fusco|first=Coco|date=2012|work=|newspaper=BlouinArtInfo|access-date=2018-06-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First performed in honor of the [[quincentenary]] anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival to the Americas, the work sought to make visible the history of abuse, captivity and exploitation of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.walkerart.org/visualarts/2014/10/14/a-history-of-revisionism-contemporary-art-and-columbusindigenous-peoples-day/|title=A History of Revisionism: Contemporary Art and Columbus/Indigenous People‚Äôs Day|last=Lopez|first=Mia|date=October 14, 2014|work=|newspaper=Walker Art Center (Blog)|access-date=2016-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their inspiration drew heavily upon the history of [[othering]], the [[human zoo]], and life stories of historical figures such as [[Ota Benga]] and [[Sarah Baartman]]‚Äîbeginning with the kidnapping of [[Arawak]] Indian by Columbus and his men to be displayed in the Spanish Court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Staging and performance==
Presenting themselves as previously undiscovered Amerindians from the fictional uncolonized island of Guatinau, Fusco and G√≥mez-Pe√±a presented a fabricated [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]] entry on "Amerindians" and a corresponding map of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] island of Guatinau as part of the staging of their performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This information was further supplemented both by plaques or pedestals alluding to the history of peoples placed on exhibit over the last 500 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Other texts provided also narrated their role as volunteer representatives of Guatinau, detailing the daily life activities of the Amerindians, and validating the habitat of the cage and its contents as their natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aided by the students of the University of California-Irvine, the artists erected a cage and filled it with a ghetto blaster, candles, Polaroid camera and film, bed pans, ritual artifacts, spray paint, body paint, a television and hammock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Students and institutional staff members served as guards and assistants to the caged couple: feeding them, educating the audience about their origins, and assisting audience members in taking commemorative Polaroids with the caged performers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those acting as docents or guards also were responsible for the daily disposal of cage waste, feeding the performers, and escorting them to the bathroom on a leash.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

G√≥mez-Pe√±a and Fusco were outfitted in primitive costumes:  designer sunglasses, a cheetah [[luchador]] mask, [[banda people|banda]] boots, face paint, long wigs, grass skirt, necklaces, a leopard bikini top and Converse low sneakers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The caged artists performed "traditional" Guatinau tasks:  watching television, sewing [[voodoo doll]]s, using a laptop computer, pacing back and forth, eating or being fed fruit, and drinking bottled water and Coca-Cola Classic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/10/20/performance/64a5c70e-d3db-4cd6-ad7f-62596334d1b9/|title=PERFORMANCE|last=Sommers|first=Pamela|date=1992-10-20|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark contrast to works from their own practices and from other collaborations, the artists remained silent during the performances, apart from G√≥mez-Pe√±a, who would recite traditional stories in a fictitious nonsensical language in return for donations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/1599/coco-fusco-and-guillermo-g-mez-pe-a|title=BOMB Magazine ‚Äî Coco Fusco and Guillermo G√≥mez-Pe√±a by Anna Johnson|website=bombmagazine.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the last performance, these "traditional stories" chronicled the Guatinaui tour of the West, with the nonsensical outpouring peppered with recognizable words like "Chicago", "Mexico", "Minnesota" and "America".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America|last=Chang|first=Jeff|publisher=St. Martin's Press|date=October 21, 2014|isbn=1250074894|location=New York, NY|pages=151|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contexts ==
===[[University of California-Irvine]]===
As "Take One" of ''The Year of the White Bear,'' held at the Fine Arts Gallery of UC-Irvine from February 24 - March 4, 1992, with performances held all day March 1, 2, 3 with "ritual events" at 7:30 on the 3rd and 4th&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ucisca.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/guillermo-gomez-pena-and-coco-fusco-in-1992/|title=Guillermo Gomez-Pena &amp; Coco Fusco The Year of the White Bear: Take One|last=Gomez-Pena|first=Guillermo|date=February 24, 1992|work=|access-date=October 11, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the performance the artists were contacted by the Health Department of UC-Irvine due to the misunderstanding that they were anthropologists bringing in "real aborigines" whose excrement could be hazardous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One woman went so far as to ask for a rubber glove in order to fondle G√≥mez-Pe√±a in a sexual manner.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Approximately 1,000 individuals saw these performances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Plaza de Col√≥n|Columbus Plaza]], Madrid  ===
Selected for the Edge Biennial, the artists took their performance to a much more public context in Columbus Plaza of May 1992.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Edge '92, taking place in both London and Madrid, was planned as a quincentennial celebration of Madrid as a hub of European culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Spanish businessmen reverted to childhood, mocking the performers with ape noises,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; while school children compared the performers to the wax [[Arawak]] figures housed in the museum across the street.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teenagers also attempted to burn G√≥mez-Pe√±a while handing him a beer bottle filled with urine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Men donated to see Fusco dance, explaining that they wanted to see her breasts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More than half of the people believed the performance to be a real display of Amerindians.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Covent Gardens]], London ===
Three days after Madrid, the pair performed in Covent Gardens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Covent Gardens as a venue has a history as a location where people of color have been exhibited, starting from the 17th century through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It was even the venue for the play [[Omai (play)|''Omai'']], inspired by the [[Omai]], a Tahitian native who embodied the idea of the [[noble savage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/the-savage-art-of-the-human-zoo/news-story/39b1994d89368a8dcad69f7161812a04|title=The savage art of the human zoo|last=Leetberg|first=Ilmar|date=2012-02-19|work=The Australian|access-date=2016-12-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the performance a group of neo-nazis attempted to rattle the cage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis ===
Exhibited as part of their show ''The Year of the White Bear'', the performance took place outside in the Sculpture Garden of the Walker Art Center in September 1992.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 15,000 visitors saw the performance and exhibition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many audience members believed the performance to be real.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the first of two instances in which the work was clearly presented in an art context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History]], Washington D.C. ===
On view from October 17-18th, 1992,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the performance reached approximately 120,000 visitors over a two-day period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The performance confused many museum goers who questioned the authenticity, and who were even more perplexed when docents continued to keep up the performance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One alarmed attendee even called the Humane Society to seek assistance in freeing the caged couple.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Australian Museum]] of Natural History, Sydney ===
In December 1992 the artists performed at the Australian Museum of Natural History, with approximately 5,000 visitors; staff members here became uneasy after Japanese tourists left the museum deeply disturbed, fearing this would result in negative press for the museum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One woman sat down with her young child to loudly apologize to the performers for having "taken [their] land away".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===[[Field Museum of Natural History]], Chicago ===
From January 16‚Äì17, 1993 G√≥mez-Pe√±a and Fusco performed at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, aided by Field Museum "docents" played by Paula Killen, Claire DeCoster and Pablo Helguera.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/specimens-from-the-new-world/Content?oid=881265|title=Specimens From the New World|last=Rago|first=Carmela|website=Chicago Reader|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a script written by the artists, DeCoster and Helguera encouraged the audience's questions and analysis while members of the museum's education department surveyed visitors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was a devastating experience for the docents, as they witnessed the large majority of the audience persistently ignore the plaques on either side of the cage and believe the Amerindians to be real.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Approximately 5,000 people attended, with the Field Museum receiving 48 phone calls regarding the misinformation the public believed was due to the Field Museum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Whitney Biennial]], New York ===
''The Couple in the Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West'' ended its tour as a selection of the 1993 Whitney Biennial, an exhibition noted to be one of the most consciousness-raising in the history of the Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspace.com/magazine/art_101/in_focus/history_whitney_biennial-52098|title=A Brief History of the Whitney Biennial, America's Most Controversial Art Show|website=Artspace|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the traditional Guatinaui tasks G√≥mez-Pe√±a and Fusco consistently performed, the artists offered views of G√≥mez-Pe√±a's genitals for donations of five dollars a view, and a native dance to hip hop music for fifty cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-10/entertainment/ca-1335_1_art-world|title=ART REVIEW :  Crushed by Its Good Intentions :  Under the banner of opening up the institutional art world to expansive diversity, the Whitney Biennial has in fact perversely narrowed its scope to an almost excruciating degree.|last=KNIGHT|first=CHRISTOPHER|date=1993-03-10|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the one of the two instances in which the work was clearly presented and contextualized as artwork during the entirety of its tour.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|date=1994-01-01|title=The Other History of Intercultural Performance|jstor=1146361|journal=TDR (1988-)|volume=38|issue=1|pages=143‚Äì167|doi=10.2307/1146361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some attendees assumed the artists were actors performing in a work by an artist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Criticism for ''The Couple in a Cage'' varied upon the location of the presentation, though what alarmed the artists most was the substantial public belief that their performances were reality and the substantial number of critics who critiqued their work as unethical due to its misrepresentation, rather than to fully discuss its cultural and institutional critique.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite a substantial number of intellectuals remaining critical towards the misinformation of the performances, performative scholar [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] points out that G√≥mez-Pe√±a's and Fusco's were not the first to fictionalize ethnography, but rather participate inside a previously established history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first=Barbara|year=Summer 1998|title=The Ethnographic Burlesque|url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/bkg/web/couple.PDF|journal=The Drama Review: A Journal of Performative Studies|volume=42| issue =  2|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance gained further recognition and criticism through its participation in the 1993 Whitney Biennial; despite reflecting the political times, art critic [[Roberta Smith]] disparaged that the exhibition lost sight of art as a visual experience in its motivations to further a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/arts/at-the-whitney-a-biennial-with-a-social-conscience.html|title=AT THE WHITNEY, A BIENNIAL WITH A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE|last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=1993-03-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark contrast to the Western response, people of color responded either in distaste due to the inauthenticity of the performance, discomfort in identifying with the experience, or solidarity in its symbolism:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"One Pueblo elder from Arizona who saw us in the Smithsonian went so far as to say that our display was more "real" than any other statement about the condition of Native peoples in the Museum." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;-Coco Fusco, ''The Other History of Intercultural Performance''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}

In [[computer]]s and [[computer network]]s an '''attack''' is any attempt to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an [[Asset (computer security)|Asset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c041933_ISO_IEC_27000_2009.zip|title=Publicly Available Standards|first=ISO (International Organization for|last=Standardization)|website=standards.iso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''cyberattack''' is any type of offensive maneuver that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, or personal computer devices. Depending on context, cyberattacks can be labeled as a [[cyber campaign]], [[cyberwarfare]] or [[cyberterrorism]]. A cyberattack can be employed by nation-states, individuals, groups, society or organizations. A cyberattack may originate from an anonymous source. 

A cyberattack may steal, alter, or destroy a specified target by [[Security hacker|hacking]] into a susceptible system.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2765010|title=Financial Weapons of War|first=Lin, Tom C.|last=W.|date=14 April 2016|website=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberattacks can range from installing [[spyware]] on a personal computer to attempting to destroy the infrastructure of entire nations. Legal experts are seeking to limit the use of the term to incidents causing physical damage, distinguishing it from the more routine [[data breach]]es and broader [[security hacker|hacking]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=SATTER|first1=RAPHAEL|title=What makes a cyberattack? Experts lobby to restrict the term|url=https://apnews.com/2c25d7da76f4409bae7daf063c071420/what-makes-cyberattack-experts-lobby-restrict-term|accessdate=7 July 2017|date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;S.

In:''37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IECON 2011), Melbourne, Australia'', 7-10 Nov 2011. Retrieved 20 Apr 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[User behavior analytics]] and [[Security information and event management|SIEM]] can be used to help prevent these attacks.

== Definitions ==

Since the late 1980s cyberattacks have evolved several times to use innovations in [[information technology]] as vectors for committing [[cybercrimes]]. In recent years, the scale and robustness of cyberattacks has increased rapidly, as observed by the [[World Economic Forum]] in its 2018 report: "Offensive cyber capabilities are developing more rapidly than our ability to deal with hostile incidents."&lt;ref name=WEF18&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GRR18_Report.pdf |title=The Global Risks Report 2018 13th Edition| last=World Economic Forum|first=|year=2018|website=World Economic Forum |archive-url=http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0SO8059UHNayxUAEERXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByM3V1YTVuBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMzBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1517535485/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fwww3.weforum.org%2fdocs%2fWEF_GRR18_Report.pdf/RK=2/RS=OjBArY0ogXUmTKL6f4S98iBGWh8- |archive-date=May 23, 2018 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] defined attack in RFC 2828 as:&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;{{cite IETF |rfc=2828 |title=Internet Security Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''an [[assault]] on system security that derives from an intelligent [[threat (computer)|threat]], i.e., an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade [[Security service (telecommunication)|security service]]s and violate the [[security policy]] of a system.''

CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 by [[Committee on National Security Systems]] of United States of America&lt;ref name="CNSSI4009"&gt;[https://www.ncsc.gov/nittf/docs/CNSSI-4009_National_Information_Assurance.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] dated 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  defines an attack as:

:''Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.''

&lt;/ref&gt; has led to new terms like ''cyber attack'' and ''[[cyberwarfare]]''.

CNSS Instruction No. 4009&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009/&gt; define a ''cyber attack'' as:

:''An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise‚Äôs use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.''

== Prevalence ==
&lt;!-- this is a section which is meant to cover the historical and "present" prevalence of cyberattacks, information which appears to be useful but not covered in article at the tims of this section creation. --&gt;In the first six months of 2017, two billion data records were stolen or impacted by cyberattacks, and [[ransomware]] payments reached {{US$|2 billion}}, double that in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/will-ai-save-us-from-the-next-cyber-attack/88428|title=Will Artificial Intelligence Save Us From the Next Cyberattack?|last=Fosco|first=Molly|date=30 October 2018|work=OZY|access-date=30 October 2018|department=Fast Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism ==
{{Main|Cyberwarfare|Cyberterrorism}}
Cyberwarfare utilizes techniques of defending and attacking information and computer networks that inhabit cyberspace, often through a prolonged [[cyber campaign]] or series of related campaigns. It denies an opponent's ability to do the same, while employing technological instruments of war to attack an opponent's critical computer systems. Cyberterrorism, on the other hand, is "the use of computer network tools to shut down critical national infrastructures (such as energy, transportation, government operations) or to coerce or intimidate a government or civilian population".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Assessing the Risks of Cyber Terrorism, Cyber War and Other Cyber Threats. Washington, D.C.: , 2002. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; That means the end result of both cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism is the same, to damage critical infrastructures and computer systems linked together within the confines of cyberspace.

== Factors ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
Three factors contribute to why cyber-attacks are launched against a state or an individual: the fear factor, spectacularity factor, and vulnerability factor.

=== Spectacularity factor ===
The spectacularity factor is a measure of the actual damage achieved by an attack, meaning that the attack creates direct losses (usually loss of availability or loss of income) and garners negative publicity. On February 8, 2000, a Denial of Service attack severely reduced traffic to many major sites, including Amazon, Buy.com, CNN, and eBay (the attack continued to affect still other sites the next day).&lt;ref name = "DOS_ex"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.garykessler.net/library/ddos.html|title=Distributed Denial-Of-Service|website=www.garykessler.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon reportedly estimated the loss of business at $600,000.&lt;ref name = "DOS_ex" /&gt;

=== Vulnerability factor ===
Vulnerability factor exploits how vulnerable an organization or government establishment is to cyber-attacks. An organization can be vulnerable to a denial of service attack, and a government establishment can be defaced on a web page. A computer network attack disrupts the integrity or authenticity of data, usually through malicious code that alters program logic that controls data, leading to errors in output.&lt;ref name=linden&gt;Linden, Edward. Focus on Terrorism. New York: [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], 2007. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional hackers to cyberterrorists ==
{{original research|section|date=March 2015}}
Professional hackers, either working on their own or employed by the government or military service, can find computer systems with vulnerabilities lacking the appropriate security software. Once found, they can infect systems with malicious code and then remotely control the system or computer by sending commands to view content or to disrupt other computers. There needs to be a pre-existing system flaw within the computer such as no antivirus protection or faulty system configuration for the viral code to work. Many professional hackers will promote themselves to cyberterrorists where a new set of rules govern their actions. Cyberterrorists have premeditated plans and their attacks are not born of rage. They need to develop their plans step-by-step and acquire the appropriate software to carry out an attack. They usually have political agendas, targeting political structures. Cyber terrorists are hackers with a political motivation, their attacks can impact political structure through this corruption and destruction.&lt;ref name=prichard&gt;Prichard, Janet, and Laurie MacDonald. "Cyber Terrorism: A Study of the Extent of Coverage in Computer Security Textbooks." Journal of Information Technology Education. 3. (2004): n. page. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also target civilians, civilian interests and civilian installations. As previously stated cyberterrorists attack persons or property and cause enough harm to generate fear.

== Types of attack ==
An attack can be ''active'' or ''passive''.&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;

: An "active attack" attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.
: A "[[passive attack]]" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources (e.g., [[telephone tapping|wiretapping]]).
An attack can be perpetrated by an ''insider'' or from'' outside'' the organization;&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;
: An "inside attack" is an attack initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an "insider"), i.e., an entity that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not approved by those who granted the authorization.
: An "outside attack" is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system (an "outsider"). In the Internet, potential outside attackers range from amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international terrorists, and hostile governments.

The term "attack" relates to some other basic security terms as shown in the following diagram:&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
      + - - - - - - - - - - - - +  + - - - - +  + - - - - - - - - - - -+

      + - - - - - - - - - - - - +  + - - - - +  + - - - - - - - - - - -+
&lt;/pre&gt;

A resource (both physical or logical), called an [[asset (computing)|asset]], can have one or more [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] that can be [[Exploit (computer security)|exploited]] by a [[Threat (computer)|threat]] agent in a threat action. As a result, the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] or [[availability]] of resources may be compromised. Potentially, the damage may extend to resources in addition to the one initially identified as vulnerable, including further resources of the organization, and the resources of other involved parties (customers, suppliers).

The so-called [[CIA triad]] is the basis of [[information security]].

The attack can be ''active'' when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A "''passive attack''" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources: so it compromises confidentiality.

A threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability. A threat can be either "intentional" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or "accidental" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an "act of God" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado).&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;

A set of policies concerned with information security management, the [[information security management system]]s (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to [[risk management]] principles, the [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.&lt;ref name=Vacca&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack should led to a ''security incident'' i.e. a ''security event'' that involves a ''security violation''. In other words, a security-relevant system event in which the system's security policy is disobeyed or otherwise breached.

The overall picture represents the [[Risk factor (computing)|risk factors]] of the risk scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf|title=ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required)|work=isaca.org|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization should make steps to detect, classify and manage security incidents. The first logical step is to set up an [[incident response]] plan and eventually a [[computer emergency response team]].

In order to detect attacks, a number of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] can be set up at organizational, procedural and technical levels. [[Computer emergency response team]], [[information technology security audit]] and [[intrusion detection system]] are example of these.&lt;ref name=Vacca1&gt;{{cite book

An attack usually is perpetrated by someone with bad intentions: [[Hacker (computer security)|black hatted]] attacks falls in this category, while other perform [[penetration test]]ing on an organization information system to find out if all foreseen controls are in place.

The attacks can be classified according to their origin: i.e. if it is conducted using one or more computers: in the last case is called a distributed attack. [[Botnet]]s are used to conduct distributed attacks.

Other classifications are according to the procedures used or the type of vulnerabilities exploited: attacks can be concentrated on network mechanisms or host features.

Some attacks are physical: i.e. theft or damage of computers and other equipment. Others are attempts to force changes in the logic used by computers or network protocols in order to achieve unforeseen (by the original designer) result but useful for the attacker. Software used to for logical attacks on computers is called [[malware]].

The following is a partial short list of attacks:

== Syntactic attacks ==
[[File:Intrusion Kill Chain - v2.png|thumb|right|350px|Intrusion [[kill chain]] for information security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Press/Documents/Publications/03.26.15_USSenate.pdf|title=U.S. Senate-Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation-A "Kill Chain" Analysis of the 2013 Target Data Breach-March 26, 2014|website=navy.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In detail, there are a number of techniques to utilize in cyber-attacks and a variety of ways to administer them to individuals or establishments on a broader scale. Attacks are broken down into two categories: syntactic attacks and semantic attacks. '''Syntactic attacks''' are straightforward; it is considered malicious software which includes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.

=== Viruses ===
A virus is a self-replicating program that can attach itself to another program or file in order to reproduce. The virus can hide in unlikely locations in the memory of a computer system and attach itself to whatever file it sees fit to execute its code. It can also change its digital footprint each time it replicates making it harder to track down in the computer.

=== Worms ===
A worm does not need another file or program to copy itself; it is a self-sustaining running program. Worms replicate over a network using protocols. The latest incarnation of worms make use of known vulnerabilities in systems to penetrate, execute their code, and replicate to other systems such as the Code Red II worm that infected more than 259 000 systems in less than 14 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Janczewski, Lech, and Andrew Colarik. Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism. Hershey, New York: Information Science Reference, 2008. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; On a much larger scale, worms can be designed for industrial espionage to monitor and collect server and traffic activities then transmit it back to its creator.

=== Trojan horses ===
A Trojan horse is designed to perform legitimate tasks but it also performs unknown and unwanted activity. It can be the basis of many viruses and worms installing onto the computer as keyboard loggers and backdoor software. In a commercial sense, Trojans can be imbedded in trial versions of software and can gather additional intelligence about the target without the person even knowing it happening. All three of these are likely to attack an individual and establishment through emails, web browsers, chat clients, remote software, and updates.

== Semantic attacks ==
'''Semantic attack''' is the modification and dissemination of correct and incorrect information. Information modified could have been done without the use of computers even though new opportunities can be found by using them. To set someone into the wrong direction or to cover your tracks, the dissemination of incorrect information can be utilized.

=== India and Pakistan ===
{{Main|India‚ÄìPakistan relations}}
There were two such instances between India and Pakistan that involved cyberspace conflicts, started in 1990s. Earlier cyber attacks came to known as early as in 1999.&lt;ref name=prichard /&gt; Since then, India and Pakistan were engaged in a long-term dispute over Kashmir which moved into [[cyberspace]]. Historical accounts indicated that each country's hackers have been repeatedly involved in attacking each other's computing database system. The number of attacks has grown yearly: 45 in 1999, 133 in 2000, 275 by the end of August 2001.&lt;ref name=prichard /&gt; In 2010, Indian hackers laid a cyber attack at least 36 government database websites going by the name "Indian Cyber Army".&lt;ref name="Express Tirbune"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cyber Indian Army|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/83967/36-government-websites-hacked-by-indian-cyber-army/|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=Express Tirbune|date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Indian hackers hacked the official website of [[Election Commission of Pakistan|Election Commission]] of Pakistan in an attempt to retrieve sensitive database information.&lt;ref name="The News International 2013" /&gt; In retaliation, Pakistani hackers, calling themselves "True Cyber Army" hacked and defaced ~1,059 websites of Indian election bodies.&lt;ref name="The News International 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waseem Abbasi|title=Pakistani hackers defaced over 1,000 Indian websites|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-22095-Pakistani-hackers-defaced-over-1000-Indian-websites|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=The News International 2013|date=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the media, Pakistan's has been working on effective [[cyber security]] system, in a program called the "Cyber Secure Pakistan" (CSP).&lt;ref name="The News International, April 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cyber Secure Pakistan' initiative launched|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-6-172840-Cyber-Secure-Pakistan-initiative-launched|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=The News International, April 2013|date=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was launched in April 2013 by Pakistan Information Security Association and the program as expanded to country's universities.

== China, United States and others ==
Within cyberwarfare, the individual must recognize the state actors involved in committing these cyber-attacks against one another. The two predominant players that will be discussed is the age-old [[East‚ÄìWest dichotomy|comparison of East versus West]], China's cyber capabilities compared to United States' capabilities. There are many other state and non-state actors involved in cyberwarfare, such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Al Qaeda; since China and the U.S. are leading the foreground in cyberwarfare capabilities, they will be the only two state actors discussed.

But in Q2 2013, [[Akamai Technologies]] reported that Indonesia toppled China with portion 38 percent of cyber attack, a high increase from 21 percent portion in previous quarter. China set 33 percent and US set at 6.9 percent. 79 percent of attack came from Asia Pacific region. Indonesia dominated the attacking to ports 80 and 443 by about 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2425836,00.asp |title=Indonesia Tops China as Cyber Attack Capital |date=October 16, 2013 | work=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{Main|Cyberwarfare in China}}
{{more citations needed|section, except for one footnote, | date= July 2013}}
China's [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) has developed a strategy called "Integrated Network Electronic Warfare" which guides computer network operations and [[cyberwarfare]] tools. This strategy helps link together network warfare tools and electronic warfare weapons against an opponent's information systems during conflict. They believe the fundamentals for achieving success is about seizing control of an opponent's information flow and establishing information dominance.&lt;ref name="krekel" /&gt; ''The Science of Military'' and ''The Science of Campaigns'' both identify enemy logistics systems networks as the highest priority for cyber-attacks and states that cyberwarfare must mark the start if a campaign, used properly, can enable overall operational success.&lt;ref name=krekel&gt;Krekel, Bryan. People's Republic of China. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Capability of the People's Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation . Virginia: Northrop Grumman, 2009. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on attacking the opponent's infrastructure to disrupt transmissions and processes of information that dictate decision-making operations, the PLA would secure cyber dominance over their adversary. The predominant techniques that would be utilized during a conflict to gain the upper hand are as follows, the PLA would strike with electronic jammers, electronic deception and suppression techniques to interrupt the transfer processes of information. They would launch virus attacks or hacking techniques to sabotage information processes, all in the hopes of destroying enemy information platforms and facilities. The PLA's ''Science of Campaigns'' noted that one role for cyberwarfare is to create windows of opportunity for other forces to operate without detection or with a lowered risk of counterattack by exploiting the enemy's periods of "blindness", "deafness" or "paralysis" created by cyber-attacks.&lt;ref name=krekel /&gt; That is one of the main focal points of cyberwarefare, to be able to weaken your enemy to the full extent possible so that your physical offensive will have a higher percentage of success.

The PLA conduct regular training exercises in a variety of environments emphasizing the use of cyberwarfare tactics and techniques in countering such tactics if it is employed against them.  Faculty research has been focusing on designs for rootkit usage and detection for their Kylin Operating System which helps to further train these individuals' cyberwarfare techniques. China perceives cyberwarfare as a deterrent to nuclear weapons, possessing the ability for greater precision, leaving fewer casualties, and allowing for long ranged attacks.

=== United States ===
{{See also|Office of Personnel Management data breach|Vault 7}}
In the West, the [[United States]] provides a different "tone of voice" when cyberwarfare is on the tip of everyone's tongue. The United States provides security plans strictly in the response to cyberwarfare, basically going on the defensive when they are being attacked by devious cyber methods. In the U.S., the responsibility of cybersecurity is divided between the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Defense. In recent years, a new department was created to specifically tend to cyber threats, this department is known as Cyber Command. Cyber Command is a military subcommand under US Strategic Command and is responsible for dealing with threats to the military cyber infrastructure. Cyber Command's service elements include Army Forces Cyber Command, the Twenty-fourth Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James, and Katrina Timlin. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Cybersecurity and Cyberwarfare: Preliminary Assessment of National Doctrine and Organization. Washington, D.C.: , 2011. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It ensures that the President can navigate and control information systems and that he also has military options available when defense of the nation needs to be enacted in cyberspace. Individuals at Cyber Command must pay attention to state and non-state actors who are developing cyberwarfare capabilities in conducting cyber espionage and other cyber-attacks against the nation and its allies. Cyber Command seeks to be a deterrence factor to dissuade potential adversaries from attacking the U.S., while being a multi-faceted department in conducting cyber operations of its own.

Three prominent events took place which may have been catalysts in the creation of the idea of Cyber Command. There was a failure of critical infrastructure reported by the CIA where malicious activities against information technology systems disrupted electrical power capabilities overseas. This resulted in multi-city power outages across multiple regions. The second event was the exploitation of global financial services. In November 2008, an international bank had a compromised payment processor that allowed fraudulent transactions to be made at more than 130 automated teller machines in 49 cities within a 30-minute period.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Review Team of Government Cybersecurity Experts. Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a Trusted and Resilient Information and Communications Infrastructure. Washington, D.C.: , Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The last event was the systemic loss of U.S. economic value when an industry in 2008 estimated $1 trillion in losses of intellectual property to data theft. Even though all these events were internal catastrophes, they were very real in nature, meaning nothing can stop state or non-state actors to do the same thing on an even grander scale. Other initiatives like the Cyber Training Advisory Council were created to improve the quality, efficiency, and sufficiency of training for computer network defense, attack, and exploitation of enemy cyber operations.

On both ends of the spectrum, East and West nations show a "sword and shield" contrast in ideals. The Chinese have a more offensive minded idea for cyberwarfare, trying to get the pre-emptive strike in the early stages of conflict to gain the upper-hand. In the U.S. there are more reactionary measures being taken at creating systems with impenetrable barriers to protect the nation and its civilians from cyber-attacks.

According to ''Homeland Preparedness News'', many mid-sized U.S. companies have a difficult time defending their systems against cyber attacks. Around 80 percent of assets vulnerable to a cyber attack are owned by private companies and organizations. Former New York State Deputy Secretary for Public Safety Michael Balboni said that private entities "do not have the type of capability, bandwidth, interest or experience to develop a proactive cyber analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/18834-expert-work-needed-get-private-sector-cyber-secure/|title=Expert: More work needed to get private sector cyber secure|last=Rozens|first=Tracy|date=2016-05-19|website=Homeland Preparedness News|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to cyber-attacks on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an Executive Order establishing the first-ever economic sanctions. The Executive Order will impact individuals and entities ("designees") responsible for cyber-attacks that threaten the national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability of the US. Specifically, the Executive Order authorizes the Treasury Department to freeze designees' assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/sanctions-cyber-crime.pdf |title= Sanctions: U.S. action on cyber crime |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, April, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ted Koppel]]'s book, in 2008, the United States in collaboration with Israel, ran a cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program, becoming "the first to use a digital weapon as an instrument of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910424314|title=Lights out : a cyberattack, a nation unprepared, surviving the aftermath|last=8-|first=Koppel, Ted, 1940 February|isbn=9780553419962|edition= First |location=New York|oclc=910424314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
{{Main|2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine}}
A series of powerful cyber attacks began 27 June 2017 that swamped websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers and electricity firms.

=== Russia ===
During [[2018 FIFA World Cup|FIFA world cup 2018]], Russia countered and stopped around 25 million cyber attacks on IT Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/433300-russia-world-cup-cyber-attacks/|title=Russia blocked 25mn cyber attacks on IT infrastructure during World Cup ‚Äì Putin|work=RT International|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequence of a potential attack ==
A whole industry is working trying to minimize the likelihood and the consequence of an information attack.

For a partial list see: [[:Category:Computer security software companies|Computer security software companies]].

They offer different products and services, aimed at:

* study all possible attacks category
* publish books and articles about the subject
* discovering vulnerabilities
* evaluating the risks
* fixing vulnerabilities
* invent, design and deploy countermeasures
* set up [[contingency plan]] in order to be ready to respond

Many organizations are trying to classify vulnerability and their consequence: the most famous vulnerability database is the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]].

[[Computer emergency response team]]s are set up by government and large organization to handle computer security incidents.

== Infrastructures as targets ==
Once a cyber-attack has been initiated, there are certain targets that need to be attacked to cripple the opponent. Certain infrastructures as targets have been highlighted as critical infrastructures in time of conflict that can severely cripple a nation. Control systems, energy resources, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and water facilities are seen as critical infrastructure targets during conflict. A new report on the industrial cybersecurity problems, produced by the British Columbia Institute of Technology, and the PA Consulting Group, using data from as far back as 1981, reportedly{{weasel inline|date=May 2013}} has found a 10-fold increase in the number of successful cyber-attacks on infrastructure Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems since 2000.&lt;ref name=linden /&gt; Cyberattacks that have an adverse physical effect are known as cyber-physical attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loukas|first1=George|date = June 2015|title=Cyber-Physical Attacks A growing invisible threat|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2818550|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=Butterworh-Heinemann (Elsevier)|page = 65 |isbn= 9780128012901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control systems ===
Control systems are responsible for activating and monitoring industrial or mechanical controls. Many devices are integrated with computer platforms to control valves and gates to certain physical infrastructures. Control systems are usually designed as remote telemetry devices that link to other physical devices through internet access or modems. Little security can be offered when dealing with these devices, enabling many hackers or cyberterrorists to seek out systematic vulnerabilities. Paul Blomgren, manager of sales engineering at cybersecurity firm explained how his people drove to a remote substation, saw a wireless network antenna and immediately plugged in their wireless LAN cards. They took out their laptops and connected to the system because it wasn't using passwords. "Within 10 minutes, they had mapped every piece of equipment in the facility," Blomgren said. "Within 15 minutes, they mapped every piece of equipment in the operational control network. Within 20 minutes, they were talking to the business network and had pulled off several business reports. They never even left the vehicle."&lt;ref name=lyons&gt;Lyons, Marty. United States. Homeland Security. Threat Assessment of Cyber Warfare. Washington, D.C.: , 2005. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
Energy is seen as the second infrastructure that could be attacked. It is broken down into two categories, electricity and natural gas. '''Electricity''' also known as electric grids power cities, regions, and households; it powers machines and other mechanisms used in day-to-day life. Using U.S. as an example, in a conflict cyberterrorists can access data through the Daily Report of System Status that shows power flows throughout the system and can pinpoint the busiest sections of the grid. By shutting those grids down, they can cause mass hysteria, backlog, and confusion; also being able to locate critical areas of operation to further attacks in a more direct method. Cyberterrorists can access instructions on how to connect to the Bonneville Power Administration which helps direct them on how to not fault the system in the process. This is a major advantage that can be utilized when cyber-attacks are being made because foreign attackers with no prior knowledge of the system can attack with the highest accuracy without drawbacks. Cyberattacks on '''natural gas''' installations go much the same way as it would with attacks on electrical grids. Cyberterrorists can shutdown these installations stopping the flow or they can even reroute gas flows to another section that can be occupied by one of their allies. There was a case in Russia with a gas supplier known as Gazprom, they lost control of their central switchboard which routes gas flow, after an inside operator and Trojan horse program bypassed security.&lt;ref name=lyons /&gt;

=== Finance ===
Financial infrastructures could be hit hard by cyber-attacks as the financial system is linked by computer systems.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; is constant money being exchanged in these institutions and if cyberterrorists were to attack and if transactions were rerouted and large amounts of money stolen, financial industries would collapse and civilians would be without jobs and security. Operations would stall from region to region causing nationwide economical degradation. In the U.S. alone, the average daily volume of transactions hit $3 trillion and 99% of it is non-cash flow.&lt;ref name=lyons /&gt; To be able to disrupt that amount of money for one day or for a period of days can cause lasting damage making investors pull out of funding and erode public confidence.

A cyberattack on a financial institution or transactions may be referred to as a '''cyberheist'''. These attacks may start with phishing that targets employees, using [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to coax information from them. They may allow attackers to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into the network and put [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]]s on the [[Accounting information system|accounting systems]]. In time, the cybercriminals are able to obtain password and keys information. An organization's bank accounts can then be accessed via the information they have stolen using the keyloggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krebs |first=Brian |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/10/avoid_windows_malware_bank_on.html |title=Security Fix - Avoid Windows Malware: Bank on a Live CD |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, a gang carried out a US$40 million cyberheist from the [[Bank of Muscat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinenewsoman.com/2013/05/17/indian-companies-at-center-of-global-cyber-heist/|title=Indian Companies at Center of Global Cyber Heist|website=onlinenewsoman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
Cyberattacking telecommunication infrastructures have straightforward results. Telecommunication integration is becoming common practice, systems such as voice and IP networks are merging. Everything is being run through the internet because the speeds and storage capabilities are endless. Denial-of-service attacks can be administered as previously mentioned, but more complex attacks can be made on BGP routing protocols or DNS infrastructures. It is less likely that an attack would target or compromise the traditional telephony network of SS7 switches, or an attempted attack on physical devices such as microwave stations or satellite facilities. The ability would still be there to shut down those physical facilities to disrupt telephony networks. The whole idea on these cyber-attacks is to cut people off from one another, to disrupt communication, and by doing so, to impede critical information being sent and received. In cyberwarfare, this is a critical way of gaining the upper-hand in a conflict. By controlling the flow of information and communication, a nation can plan more accurate strikes and enact better counter-attack measures on their enemies.

=== Transportation ===
Transportation infrastructure mirrors telecommunication facilities; by impeding transportation for individuals in a city or region, the economy will slightly degrade over time. Successful cyber-attacks can impact scheduling and accessibility, creating a disruption in the economic chain. Carrying methods will be impacted, making it hard for cargo to be sent from one place to another. In January 2003 during the "slammer" virus, Continental Airlines was forced to shut down flights due to computer problems.&lt;ref name=lyons /&gt; Cyberterrorists can target railroads by disrupting switches, target flight software to impede airplanes, and target road usage to impede more conventional transportation methods. In May 2015, a man, Chris Roberts, who was a cyberconsultant, revealed to the FBI that he had repeatedly, from 2011 to 2014, managed to hack into Boeing and Airbus flights' controls via the onboard entertainment system, allegedly, and had at least once ordered a flight to climb. The FBI, after detaining him in April 2015 in Syracuse, had interviewed him about the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/17/us/fbi-hacker-flight-computer-systems/index.html|title=FBI: Hacker claimed to have taken over flight's engine controls|work=CNN|date=May 18, 2015|author=Evan Perez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===
Water as an infrastructure could be one of the most critical infrastructures to be attacked. It is seen as one of the greatest security hazards among all of the computer-controlled systems. There is the potential to have massive amounts of water unleashed into an area which could be unprotected causing loss of life and property damage. It is not even water supplies that could be attacked; sewer systems can be compromised too. There was no calculation given to the cost of damages, but the estimated cost to replace critical water systems could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.&lt;ref name=lyons /&gt; Most of these water infrastructures are well developed making it hard for cyber-attacks to cause any significant damage, at most, equipment failure can occur causing power outlets to be disrupted for a short time.

'''Everett Alvarez Jr.''' (born December 23, 1937) is a former [[United States Navy]] officer who endured one of the longest periods as a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) in [[Military history of the United States|U.S. military history]]. Alvarez was the first U.S. pilot to be downed and detained during the [[Vietnam War]] and spent over eight years in captivity, making him the second longest-held U.S. POW, after [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Colonel [[Floyd James Thompson]].

==Early life and captivity==
Alvarez was born in 1937 in [[Salinas, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qh5lffww-KsC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War, The: A Political, Social, and Military ...|work=google.ca|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the grandson of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] from [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter24/in141004alvarez.html |title=AII POW-MIA InterNetwork&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223205712/http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter24/in141004alvarez.html |archive-date=2005-02-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Santa Clara University]] on an academic scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=4647075|title=Pilgrimage: California Golden Bears Memorial Stadium|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the United States Navy in 1960 and was selected for [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] training. On August 5, 1964, during [[Operation Pierce Arrow]], [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG.]] Alvarez's [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] was shot down in the immediate aftermath of what is known as the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]]. Alvarez endured eight years and seven months of brutal captivity by the [[North Vietnam]]ese at the [[H·ªèa L√≤ Prison]] (sarcastically known as the "Hanoi Hilton" by fellow POWs), in which he was repeatedly beaten and tortured.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/Chained_Eagle.html?id=Iyu0f1wevpMC Chained Eagle: The Heroic Story of the First American Shot Down Over North Vietnam&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarez was especially esteemed by his fellow prisoners because he was for almost a year the only aviator prisoner of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hispanic Former Combat Pilot Talks About POW Experiences|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=25069|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense|DOD]]|date=October 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Back in America==
He was released on February 12, 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1973/02/13/ "POWs excellent! Weigh early return"], ''Chicago Tribune'', February 13, 1973, p1&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the first group of American POWs repatriated under [[Operation Homecoming]], after spending 3,113 days in captivity. After hospitalization, Alvarez briefly attended refresher flight training with [[VT-21]] at [[NAS Kingsville]] and then attended the U.S. [[Naval Postgraduate School]], where he received a master's degree in Operations Research and Systems Analysis in October 1976. His final assignment was in Program Management at the [[Naval Air Systems Command]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], from October 1976 until his retirement from the Navy on June 30, 1980.

[[Gunla]] is a holy month for Newar Buddhists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Locke| first =John K.| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://www.niem.com.np/newararticles/unique_features.htm| title =Unique Features of Newar Buddhism| work =| publisher =Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods| date =2008| accessdate =5 January 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120324221525/http://www.niem.com.np/newararticles/unique_features.htm| archivedate =24 March 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they recite the scriptures and visit places of worship playing devotional music. The practice of observing the sacred month is descended from the rains retreat dating from the [[Buddha]]'s time when monks stayed in one place and taught the [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01908-9}}. Page 64. Retrieved 5 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances==

Societies based on locality or caste, in which membership is hereditary, organize Gunla Bajan performances. These groups follow an annual calendar of public performances. They also conduct music lessons and hold religious festivals, hymn singing sessions and feasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first=|title=Music of Buddha|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Music+of+Buddha&amp;NewsID=298298|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Himalayan Times|date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important activity of the year is making daily pilgrimages during Gunla to [[Swayambhu]] and other Buddhist sites playing Gunla music. The main days during the holy month are Bahidyah Swahwanegu (‡§¨‡§π‡•Ä‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§É‡§µ‡§®‡•á‡§ó‡•Å), when devotees playing Gunla music visit sacred courtyards to view the images of Bahidyah ([[Dipankara Buddha]]) and [[paubha]] paintings put on display for the festival;&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John Kerr (1985) ''Buddhist Monasteries of Nepal: A Survey of the Bahas and Bahis of the Kathmandu Valley.'' Kathmandu: Sahayogi Press. Page 408.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nisala Chhawanegu (‡§®‡§ø‡§∏‡§≤‡§æ ‡§õ‡§æ:‡§µ‡§®‡•á‡§ó‡•Å), when offerings are made to Swayambhu and concerts are held at one's neighborhoods. Gunla musical bands also lead processions during New Year's Day of Nepal Sambat.

==Music==


A performance of Gunla music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=University of New Mexico, Laboratory of Anthropology (Museum of New Mexico)|first=|title=Gunla Baja|url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=NqIRAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=gunla+bajan&amp;dq=gunla+bajan&amp;hl=en|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=Journal of Anthropological Research, Volume 16|publisher=University of New Mexico |date=1960}} Page 415.&lt;/ref&gt; starts with Dyah Lhayegu, a short salutation to the deities. Separate pieces of music are played when marching in procession, going around a shrine and crossing a bridge. These are known as Lawantah, Chwoh, Graha, Astar, Palimaa and Partaal.

During processions, musicians usually play the tunes of seasonal songs or other traditional songs backed by drums and cymbals. Tunes of modern hits are also played.

Gwara is a long piece of music which is played in temple squares and sacred courtyards with the musicians standing in a circle. It is 15 to 20 minutes long. The popular ones are Annapurna Gwara, Swetkali Gwara and Sangin Gwara.

==Instruments==

The double-sided drum known as "dhaa" (‡§ß‡§æ:), which is the main instrument in Gunla music, is believed to have been played in the Kathmandu Valley for 2,000 years. It is struck on the left side with a short stick and on the right side with the hand.

Trumpets and clarinets are used to play the tune. Originally, local wind instruments known as "mwahali" (‡§Æ‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø) and "basuri" (‡§¨‡§æ‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡§ø) provided the tune.

The other instruments used are "taa" (‡§§‡§æ:) and "bhusya" (‡§≠‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ:), small and large cymbals respectively. The "naykhin" (‡§®‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ñ‡§ø‡§Ç) small drum and "chhusya" (‡§õ‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ:) cymbals form a separate set of instruments. The "payentah" (‡§™‡§Ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§æ:) is a long trumpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lewis| first = Todd T.| url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:JAPb_sAK2UUJ:archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8816/2723+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh9r3oBIyPmcAJBn1hacu0AnNvM6afGBlNAfuPm7tNLRceDLGzir-JXClg6UJsf6DE7aWRvAbgUdBNIeuwX_kLpb7cpsnT4eSZuBQg6O81zm6mLSbFeAnSo16RtH4LHPVXF58kU&amp;sig=AHIEtbTBvE6656upPxJB5L1Yl_GwQum0hQ |title = Contributions to the Study of Popular Buddhism: The Newar Buddhist Festival of Gumla Dharma | work =Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies | publisher = | date=Winter 1993| accessdate =19 February 2013}} Page 328.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Vajracharya|first=Madansen|title=Lokabaja in Newar Buddhist Culture|url=http://www.aioiyama.net/lrc/papers/cbhnm-ppr-12.htm|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cecil''' ({{Circa}} 2002 ‚Äì 2 July 2015) was a [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]] that lived primarily in the [[Hwange National Park]] in [[Matabeleland North]], [[Zimbabwe]].

===In Zimbabwe===
Cecil's killing went largely unnoticed in the animal's native Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Harare"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dzirutwe |first=M. |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/30/us-zimbabwe-wildlife-lion-idUSKCN0Q41VB20150730 |title='What lion?'

A significant decrease was noted in Hwange, where the lion had lived. Many international tourists, who had planned to see the lion, had cancelled their trips. "This killing is a huge loss to our tourism sector that was contributing immensely to the national wealth", said Emanuel Fundira, the president of the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe. "We had a lot of people, in terms of visitors, coming in to the country to enjoy and view Cecil, so really this was a great loss," Fundira said, and that Cecil's presence was "a draw card," and compared his death to "the demise of an icon". The director of the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, Karikoga Kaseke, said that tourism had been booming, but that Zimbabwe was now perceived as a country which was not interested in protecting and promoting animal rights, and this had also had a negative effect on the tourism sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chikowore, F. |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/07/30/zimbabwe-cecil-lion-dentist/30886959/ |title=Cecil's death causes tourism drop in Zimbabwe |work=USA Today |date=30 July 2015 |accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kwande, D. and Smith, A. |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/cecil-lion-zimbabwe-safari-operator-says-animal-was-murdered-n404336 |title=Cecil the Lion: Zimbabwe Safari Operator Says Animal Was 'Murdered' |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan Orford, a professional wildlife guide who worked in Hwange, calculates that with tourists from a single nearby lodge collectively paying {{currency|9800|US}} per day, the revenue generated by having Cecil's photograph taken during five days would have been greater than someone paying a one-off fee of {{currency|45000|US}} to hunt and kill the lion, with no hope of future revenue.&lt;ref name="NatGeo" /&gt;

On 1 August 2015, in response to Cecil's killing, the hunting of lions, leopards and elephants along with all bow-hunting was immediately suspended in areas outside of Hwange National Park by Zimbabwe's environment minister, Oppah Muchinguri, who said, "All such hunts will only be conducted if confirmed and authorized in writing by the Director-general of the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, and only if accompanied by parks staff whose costs will be met by the landowner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Chidziya |first=E. |title=Press statement by Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority on measures to improve the administration of hunting in the country |url=http://www.zimparks.org/index.php/mc/216-press-statement-by-zimbabwe-parks-and-wildlife-management-authority-on-measures-to-improve-the-administartion-of-hunting-in-the-country |accessdate=1 August 2015 |publisher=[[Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority]] |date=1 August 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814014724/http://www.zimparks.org/index.php/mc/216-press-statement-by-zimbabwe-parks-and-wildlife-management-authority-on-measures-to-improve-the-administartion-of-hunting-in-the-country |archivedate=14 August 2015 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The moratorium was lifted after 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/cecil-lion-zimbabwe-lifts-hunting-ban-after-just-10-days-n406971|title=Cecil the Lion: Zimbabwe Lifts Hunting Ban After Just 10 Days|first=Alexander |last=Smith|date=10 August 2015|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=7 September 2015 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151018125738/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/cecil-lion-zimbabwe-lifts-hunting-ban-after-just-10-days-n406971 | archivedate=18 October 2015| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government officials===
Some government officials publicly condemned the killing of Cecil. [[David Cameron]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], told reporters that the United Kingdom plays "a leading role in preventing illegal wildlife trade", when he was asked about Cecil's death. [[Grant Shapps]], his Minister of State at the [[Department for International Development]], described the incident as "barbaric hunting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ministers call for end to 'barbaric hunting' after Cecil the lion killed |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/ministers-call-for-end-to-barbaric-hunting-after-cecil-the-lion-killed-31415559.html |accessdate=31 July 2015 |work=The Belfast Telegraph |date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Congresswoman [[Betty McCollum]], co-chair of the [[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus]], suggested an investigation of Palmer and the killing.&lt;ref name=mccullum&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brodey |first1=Sam |title=McCollum calls for federal investigation of lion-killing Minnesota dentist |url=http://www.minnpost.com/dc-dispatches/2015/07/mccollum-calls-federal-investigation-lion-killing-minnesota-dentist |accessdate=30 July 2015 |publisher=[[MinnPost.com]] |date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Senator [[Bob Menendez]] introduced the Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large (CECIL) Animal Trophies Act, which "extend[s] the import and export protections for a species listed under the [[Endangered Species Act]] to those that have been proposed for listing, thereby prohibiting the import of any trophies gleaned from Cecil's killing without explicitly obtaining a permit from the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]." The bill was cosponsored by Senators [[Cory Booker]], [[Richard Blumenthal]], and [[Ben Cardin]].&lt;ref name=cecilact&gt;{{cite news |title=Sen.

On 30 July 2015, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted a non-binding resolution to strengthen the efforts to address [[Wildlife smuggling|illicit wildlife poaching and trafficking]]. Germany and [[Gabon]] were the sponsors of the resolution. Harald Braun, Germany's U.N. Ambassador, associated the resolution with the killing and said: "Like most people in the world we are outraged at what happened to this poor lion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nichols |first1=Michelle |title=U.N. tackles illicit wildlife poaching amid Cecil the lion uproar |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/30/uk-un-wildlife-poaching-idUKKCN0Q429R20150730 |accessdate=31 July 2015 |agency=Reuters |date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabon's Foreign Minister [[Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet]] said that Cecil's killing was "a matter of deep concern for all countries in Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zielinski |first1=Caroline |title=The White House opens investigation into Cecil's death after petition exceeds 100,000 signatures |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/technology/science/the-white-house-opens-investigation-into-cecils-death-after-petition-exceeds-100000-signatures/story-fnjwk7l7-1227464222322 |accessdate=31 July 2015 |work=Courier Mail |date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwe's acting information minister, Prisca Mupfumira, when questioned about Cecil's killing, asked, "What lion?"&lt;ref name="Reuters_Harare"/&gt;

At a press conference on 31 July 2015, Zimbabwe's environment minister, [[Opa Muchinguri]], said the hunter violated Zimbabwean law and needs to be held accountable.

[[South Africa]]n President [[Jacob Zuma]] declared on 11 August 2015: "What it sounds like from a distance [is] that the hunter did not know that Cecil was so popular, just saw a lion, and killed a lion, and it's Cecil, and Cecil is very well loved and it caused a problem, because everyone wants to go and see Cecil.

[[Jean Kapata]], [[Zambia]]'s minister of tourism, said "the West seemed more concerned with the welfare of a lion in Zimbabwe than of Africans themselves", and added that "In Africa, a human being is more important than an animal. I don't know about the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/world/a-hunting-ban-saps-a-villages-livelihood.html |title=A Hunting Ban Saps a Village's Livelihood |work=The New York Times |first=Norimitsu |last=Onishi |date=12 September 2015 |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal investigations==
On 7 July 2015, law enforcement officers of the [[Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority]] commenced an investigation after receiving information that a lion had been killed illegally on a farm near Hwange National Park. The investigation discovered that a lion had been killed illegally on the farm on 1 July 2015.&lt;ref name="ZPWMA"/&gt;

On 29 July 2015, Bronkhorst appeared in court at [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] and pleaded not guilty to a charge of "failing to prevent an unlawful hunt". He was granted bail at {{currency|1000|US}} and was ordered to appear back in court on 5 August.&lt;ref name=BBC33699346/&gt; Bronkhorst stated: "Palmer is a totally innocent party to this whole thing, and he has conducted and bought a hunt from me that was legitimate."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Zimbabwe National Parks said in a statement that quotas are assigned to given areas and that Cecil was shot in an area without a quota for lion kills.&lt;ref name=telegraph29july2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander |first1=Harriet |last2=Thornycroft |first2=Peta |title=Zimbabwean hunter and farmer bailed over killing of Cecil the lion |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/11769842/Cecil-the-lion-Zimbabwean-hunter-and-farmer-appear-in-court.html |accessdate=31 July 2015 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=31 July 2015 |archivedate=18 October 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cNj4RmJN?url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/11769842/Cecil-the-lion-Zimbabwean-hunter-and-farmer-appear-in-court.html |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August 2015, the case was adjourned until 28 September, when Bronkhorst's barrister was next available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cecil the lion: charges 'frivolous' says Zimbabwean hunter as trial postponed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/05/cecil-the-lion-trial-hunter-theo-bronkhorst-postponed-zimbabwe|work=The Guardian|location = UK|accessdate=5 August 2015|date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 2016, the High Court in the city of Bulawayo threw out the charges against Bronkhorst, agreeing with the defense that it could not have been a crime under the country's wildlife laws if Palmer had a legal permit to hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/zimbabwe-court-drops-charges-against-hunter-helped-kill-110032896.html |title=Zimbabwe court drops charges against hunter who helped kill Cecil the lion |publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Consequences for the pride==
When one or more new male lions oust or replace a previous male(s) associated with a pride, they often kill any existing young cubs, a form of [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]].&lt;ref name="Packpus83"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Packer |first=C. |last2=Pusey |first2=A.E. |date=May 1983 |title=Adaptations of female lions to infanticide by incoming males |journal=American Naturalist |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716‚Äì28 |doi=10.1086/284097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Elliot |first=Nicholas B. |last2=Valeix |first2=Marion |last3=MacDonald |first3=David W. |last4=Loveridge |first4=Andrew J. |date=September 2014 |title=Social relationships affect dispersal timing revealing a delayed infanticide in African lions |journal=Oikos |volume=123 |issue=9 |pages=1049‚Äì1056 |doi=10.1111/oik.01266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, both the University of Oxford study&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt; and Johnny Rodrigues, head of the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, indicated that they believed Cecil's six cubs could be killed by the new dominant male in the pride.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; In a later interview, however, Rodrigues said Jericho had assumed control of the pride but had not killed Cecil's cubs, and that he was also keeping the cubs safe from any rivals.&lt;ref name="Skynews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cecil's cubs guarded by second lion |url=http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/africa/2015/08/01/cecil-s-cubs-protected-by-second-lion.html |accessdate=1 August 2015 |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=1 August 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215202506/http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/africa/2015/08/01/cecil-s-cubs-protected-by-second-lion.html |archivedate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to the killing of Xanda===
Xanda, a son of Cecil's, was legally shot by [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunters]] in Zimbabwe on 20 July 2017. He was six years old and a father of several young cubs. Despite this being termed a 'legal' act of killing, it provoked reactions, not just amongst advocates of [[animal rights]]. The BBC termed it a 'sad' inheritance from Cecil.&lt;ref name="BBCXanda"&gt;{{cite news |title=Xanda, son of Cecil the lion, killed by hunter in Zimbabwe |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40671590 |date=20 July 2017 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford|University of Oxford's Department of Zoology]] called for a "no-hunting zone" around Hwange Park, spanning {{convert|5.0|km|mile|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/07/20/cecil-the-lions-son-shot-dead-by-trophy-hunter-officials-say/ |title=Cecil the lion's son has 'met the same fate' ‚Äì killed in a trophy hunt in Zimbabwe, reports say |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Lindsey |last=Bever |date=20 July 2017 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/20/son-of-cecil-the-lion-killed-by-trophy-hunter |title=Son of Cecil the lion killed by trophy hunter |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Damian |last= Carrington |date=20 July 2017 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent conservation measures==
Five months after the killing of Cecil, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] added two species of lions, in India and western and central Africa, to the endangered species list.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt;&lt;ref name=nutt/&gt; The listings would make it more difficult (though not impossible) for US citizen hunters to kill these protected lions.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt; According to Wayne Pacelle, president of the [[Humane Society of the United States]] and who petitioned for the new listing, Cecil had "changed the atmospherics on the issue of trophy hunting around the world," adding "I think it gave less wiggle room to regulators."&lt;ref name=goode&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/science/us-to-protect-african-lions-under-endangered-species-act.html |title=After Cecil Furor, U.S. Aims to Protect Lions Through Endangered Species Act |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Erica|last= Goode |date=21 December 2015 |accessdate=21 December 2015| archivedate= 15 January 2016| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160115080422/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/science/us-to-protect-african-lions-under-endangered-species-act.html?_r=0 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne added that he thought the killing of Cecil was "a defining moment" resulting in the new protections.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt; Jeff Flocken, regional director of the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]], said that while the U.S.F.W.S. decision was not the direct result of the death of Cecil, "it would be impossible to ignore the public outcry" and its effect on worldwide opinion.&lt;ref name=nutt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/african-lions-will-be-added-to-the-endangered-species-list-activists-say/2015/12/20/e27f44f2-a75f-11e5-bff5-905b92f5f94b_story.html |title=2 subspecies of lion will be added to the endangered species list, activists say |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Amy Ellis |last=Nutt |date=20 December 2015 |accessdate=21 December 2015 |archivedate=1 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fgx61BhX?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/african-lions-will-be-added-to-the-endangered-species-list-activists-say/2015/12/20/e27f44f2-a75f-11e5-bff5-905b92f5f94b_story.html |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'', writing about the new regulations, said "the killing of Cecil .. seemed to galvanize public attention."&lt;ref name=goode/&gt;

Other countries and companies have also taken action.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt; In the five months since Cecil's killing, France banned the import of lion trophies.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt; The Netherlands did so in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/article/25692197/van-dam-verbiedt-invoeren-jachttrofee√´n-2|title=Van Dam verbiedt invoeren jachttrofee√´n|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain said it will do so during 2017.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt; More than 40 airlines have also said they will no longer transport hunting trophies.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt;

The investigative journalist [[George Knapp (journalist)|George Knapp]] noted Cecil's case on the approach of the incident's one-year anniversary during an annual animal-welfare broadcast concerning issues, the development of law, [[cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]], and remediation efforts in June 2016. The 2016 broadcast covered various issues, including horses and [[trophy hunting]] noting Cecil and the effect the incident was still causing at the date of the show.&lt;ref&gt;''Coast to Coast AM'' evening broadcast, 18 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Money raised in response to Cecil's death has been used by researchers to reduce conflicts between people and lions by paying for lion protectors and other methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/cecil-the-lions-legacy-death-brings-new-hope-for-his-grandcubs |title=Cecil the lion's legacy: death brings new hope for his grandcubs |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Damian |last=Carrington |date=28 June 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cecil effect===
The "Cecil effect" is a term used by some to express the belief that after the killing of Cecil, there was a reduction in the number of hunters coming to Zimbabwe and a subsequent increase in lion populations in certain areas. Byron du Preez, project leader at the Bubye Valley Conservancy, believes the effect does not exist, saying, "Hunters are not coming because there is a massive recession [in the U.S.]."&lt;ref name=derespina/&gt; Those who believe in the effect say hunters are staying away from Zimbabwe due to fear of negative publicity.&lt;ref name=derespina&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/02/25/cecil-effect-dangerous-for-lions-guides.html |title='Cecil Effect' dangerous for lions, guides |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |first=Cody |last=Derespina |date=25 February 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016 | archivedate=25 February 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160225184938/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/02/25/cecil-effect-dangerous-for-lions-guides.html | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a month after Cecil was killed, when international uproar was at its peak, Zimbabwean hunting guide Quinn Swales was killed by a lion on a hunt. Some of his fellow guides speculated that he was afraid of shooting the animal out of fear of the possible backlash due to Cecil. According to guide Steve Taylor, "This guy was a really successful guide, and he died by a lion. And I think that's the Cecil Effect. Guides in Zimbabwe are petrified of having the world turn on them."&lt;ref name=derespina/&gt;

Some attribute the effect as being responsible for an unsustainable lion population in the Bubye Valley Conservancy, negatively affected the conservancy's population of antelope, giraffe, cheetah, leopards and wild dogs.&lt;ref name="Thornycroft"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/12166651/Cecil-effect-leaves-parks-lion-at-risk-of-cull.html |title='Cecil effect' leaves park's lion at risk of cull | work=The Telegraph |first=Peta |last=Thornycroft |date=20 February 2016 |accessdate=1 March 2016| archivedate= 24 February 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160224093319/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/12166651/Cecil-effect-leaves-parks-lion-at-risk-of-cull.html | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 2015 was the driest summer on record, which kept grass low and made game animals easy targets for lions.&lt;ref name="Thornycroft" /&gt;

==Books and other media==
In the children's book ''Cecil's Pride'' (2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cecil's Pride |publisher=Scholastic Inc. |author=[[Craig Hatkoff]] |year=2016 |isbn=978-1338034455}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Craig Hatkoff]] and his daughters sought to shed light on Cecil's life and how he lived prior to his death. He reached out to those who studied Cecil's pride at Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park and got into contact with Cecil's 'biographer', researcher Brent Stapelkamp. Stapelkamp had studied Cecil for over 9 years and had accumulated photographs that were used as illustrations in the book that capture the complexities of the pride. The book highlights the relationship of Cecil and an unrelated male named Jericho who becomes co-leader with Cecil and then leader after Cecil's death.&lt;ref name=dodo&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedodo.com/cecil-lion-pride-book-1757071997.html?sf25203531=1 |title=New Children's Book Shows Cecil The Lion's Family Photos |last=Kelleher |first=Solon |website=The Dodo |access-date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Oxford wildlife biologist Andrew Loveridge, in his book ''Lion Hearted'' (2018), suggests that the hunters allowed Cecil to suffer for more than 10 hours, without hastening his death with a firearm, possibly to allow Palmer to submit the game to a hunting record book as an archery-hunted animal. Loveridge further suggests that Bronkhost, knowing that he had no quota to hunt in the area, attempted to deliberately conceal the hunt by removing Cecil's skinned carcass and disabling his collar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''La F√™te du Baiser''' ("festival of the kiss") is a [[festival]] celebrated the Saturday after [[St. Valentine's Day]], in [[Roquemaure, Gard|Roquemaure]], [[France]], near [[Avignon]]. Begun in 1989, it commemorates not only [[Saint Valentine]], whom locals claim as a former resident, but the arrival of his remains in 1868 to Roquemaure's [[collegiate church]] [[reliquary]]. Celebrations revolve around a return to a 19th-century way of life, including costumes and markets.

The relics of St Valentine were purchased in Rome, in hopes of curing the town's diseased [[grapevine|vine]] stocks; within four years they were healed. Today, Roquemaure is home to a [[winery]] (Cellar St. Valentine) which produces wines named after the saint.

The festival was started by a local priest, Father Ren√© Durieu. Men and women around the village dress as priests and nuns, kissing each other, as well as travelers. Special foods and wines are produced especially for the festival.

'''''Laika''''' is a [[graphic novel]] by [[Nick Abadzis]] that gives a fictionalized account of the life and death of the [[Laika|eponymous dog]], the first living creature launched in [[orbital spaceflight]].

Based on a true story, the graphic novel tells the story of Laika from multiple points of view: from that of the ambitious [[Sergey Korolyov]], Chief Engineer responsible for the launching and construction of [[Sputnik 2]]; to that of Yelena Dubrovsky, official trainer of the space-bound dogs; to that of [[Oleg Gazenko]], scientist; and finally from the viewpoint of Laika herself, who had lived as a stray on the streets of [[Moscow]].

==Theme==
Abadzis notes&lt;ref&gt;"A Short Interview with Nick Abadzis", ''The Comics Reporter'': 1 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; that his intention was to avoid anthropomorphism in portraying the central canine character. Thus Laika's traits of trust and eagerness to please are portrayed through her non-verbalised behaviour, and the reactions of the more sympathetic humans with whom she comes in contact. Mistreated as a young dog, Laika shows a need to gain human affection and approval that leads her through a harsh training regime to death in space. Even the empathetic Yelena accepts that animals will die in the space programme, though bitterly regretting that her "special dog" is the one to be sent with no hope of survival. Many of the incidents portrayed by Abadzis, such as Laika being taken home by a senior officer to play with his children shortly before the launch, are recorded as having actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;"The Age - 06Nov2007- 50 years ago, a dog paved way for space travel"&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic novel concludes with a real-life statement of regret by Oleg Gazenko, made in 1998: "Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I'm sorry about it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog".

==Reception==
''Laika'' was well-received, with the ''[[New York Press]]'' writing that Abadzis "has fashioned a poignant and accurate portrait of the lives Laika touched in the three years leading up to Sputnik II‚Äôs launch. His characters ‚Äî including the dog ‚Äî are as real as the story he‚Äôs telling: animated with complex personalities, flaws, humor and emotion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypress.com/20/38/abouttown/bookreview1.cfm New York Press - NICK ABADZIS - Laika&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014043446/http://nypress.com/20/38/abouttown/bookreview1.cfm |date=2008-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Space Review'' called it "an entertaining but also educational overview of the life of an unwitting space pioneer",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/949/1 The Space Review: Review: Laika&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while another review states that "reading ''Laika'' is the sort of experience that you won‚Äôt forget any time soon".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readaboutcomics.com/2007/08/03/laika/ Read About Comics ¬ª Laika&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Light-emitting diode}}
The most common way for [[LED]]s (and [[diode laser]]s) to fail is the gradual lowering of light output and loss of efficiency. Sudden failures, however rare, can occur as well. Early red LEDs were notable for their short lifetime.

==Packaging-related==
*'''Epoxy degradation:''' Some materials of the plastic package tend to yellow when subjected to heat, causing partial absorption (and therefore loss of efficiency) of the affected wavelengths.
* '''[[Thermal stress]]:''' Sudden failures are most often caused by thermal stresses. When the [[epoxy resin]] package reaches its [[glass transition temperature]], it starts rapidly expanding, causing mechanical stresses on the semiconductor and the [[wire bonding|bonded]] contact, weakening it or even tearing it off. Conversely, very low temperatures can cause cracking of the packaging.
* '''Differentiated phosphor degeneration:''' The different [[phosphor]]s used in white LEDs tend to degrade with heat and age, but at different rates causing changes in the produced light color, for example, purple and pink LEDs often use an organic phosphor formulation which may degrade after just a few hours of operation causing a major shift in output color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Semiconductor and metal related==

*'''[[Nucleation]] and growth of [[dislocation]]s:''' This is a known mechanism for degradation of the active region, where the radiative recombination occurs. It requires a presence of an existing defect in the crystal and is accelerated by heat, high current density, and emitted light. [[Gallium arsenide]] and [[aluminium gallium arsenide]] are more susceptible to this mechanism than [[gallium arsenide phosphide]] and [[indium phosphide]]. Due to different properties of the active regions, [[gallium nitride]] and [[indium gallium nitride]] are virtually insensitive to this kind of defect.
*'''[[Electromigration]]:''' This is caused by high current density and can move atoms out of the active regions, leading to emergence of dislocations and point defects, acting as nonradiative recombination centers and producing heat instead of light.
*'''[[Ionizing radiation]]:''' It can lead to the creation of defects, which leads to issues with [[radiation hardening]] of circuits containing LEDs (e.g., in [[optoisolator]]s)
* '''Metal diffusion:''' Caused by high electrical currents or voltages at elevated temperatures, metal diffusion can move metal atoms from the electrodes into the active region. Some materials, notably [[indium tin oxide]] and [[silver]], are subject to electromigration which causes leakage current and non-radiative recombination along the chip edges. In some cases, especially with GaN/InGaN diodes, a [[barrier metal]] layer is used to hinder the electromigration effects.
*'''[[Short circuits]]:''' Mechanical stresses, high currents, and a corrosive environment can lead to formation of [[whisker (metallurgy)|whiskers]], causing short circuits.

==Stress-related==
*'''[[Thermal runaway]]:''' Non-homogeneities in the substrate, causing localized loss of [[thermal conductivity]], can cause thermal runaway where heat causes damage which causes more heat etc. Most common ones are voids caused by incomplete [[soldering]], or by electromigration effects and [[Kirkendall voiding]].
*'''[[Current crowding]]:''' A non-homogenous distribution of the current density over the junction can lead to the formation of [[current filament]]s. This may lead to creation of localized hot spots, which poses risk of [[thermal runaway]].
*'''[[Electrostatic discharge]]:''' An ESD may cause immediate failure of the semiconductor junction, a permanent shift of its parameters, or latent damage causing increased rate of degradation. LEDs and lasers grown on [[sapphire]] substrate (see [[silicon on sapphire]]) are more susceptible to ESD damage.
*'''[[Reverse bias]]:''' Although the LED is based on a diode junction and is nominally a rectifier, the reverse-breakdown mode for some types can occur at very low voltages and essentially any excess reverse bias can cause immediate degradation, and may lead to vastly accelerated failure. 5&amp;nbsp;V is a typical maximum reverse bias voltage specification for ordinary LEDs; some special types may have lower limits.
*'''[[Catastrophic optical damage]]:''' Can occur in high power [[semiconductor laser]]s.

"Some reflections on violence and the law in industrial relations," in Bercuson, D.J. and Knafla, L.A. (1979) ''Law and society in Canada in historical perspective.'' University of Calgary. See pp. 141, 145 and 150 for multiple analyses of the riots and civil unrest in Calgary.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its incorporation as a town in 1884, like other cities, Calgary has had to deal with a variety of violence. Calgary has been credited with maintaining relative civility during duress.&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, J.M.C. (1986) ''Public Violence in Canada, 1867-1982.'' McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP. p 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Depression in Canada]] has received particular attention from [[sociology|sociologists]] and historians, including Thomas Thorner and Neil Watson who wrote, "There is little question that Calgary experienced its share of civil strife during the Depression. Battles between police and the single unemployed men, full scale riots and threats to blow up public buildings appear to have been almost annual events."&lt;ref&gt;Thorner, T. and Watson, N. (1981) "Patterns of Prairie Crime: Calgary, 1875-1939," in ''Crime and Criminal Justice in Europe and Canada.'' Knafla, L.A. (ed.) Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfried Laurier University Press, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen Graham, a Professor of Human Geography at [[Durham University]], recent events have seen the City of Calgary change their tactics towards civil unrest activities such as protests.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. (2004) ''Cities, War, and Terrorism: Towards an Urban Geopolitics.'' Blackwell Publishing. p 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Regarding the G8 protests: "Many protest groups were denied permits to encamp in public space in Calgary and a variety of other steps were taken by Calgary... to discourage anyone seeking to challenge policies. Court hours were extended and jail facilities were made available in Calgary to process and hold arrested protesters." (p 223) "The tactics utilized in Calgary are now seen as the new normative behavior among Canadian policing entities towards protesters, specifically with international events." (p 224). --&gt;

| Racial tension
| After the Chinese community was blamed for a [[smallpox]] outbreak, a [[race riot]] ensued. The event started when city authorities burned a laundry where a Chinese worker contracted the disease, and its occupants were quarantined. Nine Chinese contracted the disease, and three died. Alleging the spread was caused by unhygienic living conditions, a mob of over 300 men smashed doors and windows of all the Chinese laundries, destroyed and looted property, and assaulted Chinese residents. As the riot ended, police arrived.  Many in the Chinese community sought refuge at the [[North-West Mounted Police]] barracks or in the homes of clergymen. The NWMP patrolled Calgary continuously for the next 3 weeks to protect Chinese Calgarians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calgarypubliclibrary.com/calgary/calgarytimeline.htm "Calgary Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820041110/http://calgarypubliclibrary.com/calgary/calgarytimeline.htm |date=2007-08-20 }}, Calgary Public Library.

When the crowd gathered outside, it was told to disperse by the [[Calgary Police Service|Calgary Police]].  They re-assembled in a nearby vacant lot called "Red Square." After a series of speeches, the crowd was told to disperse, and when they did not, police took away a popular speaker from the platform.

It is informally referred to as '''Mancs''' (''Paw'' in English) which is a joking abbreviation of the name. The magazine was first published in October 1989.&lt;ref name=vox&gt;{{cite web|title=Magyar Narancs|url=http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/source-profile/1240901-magyar-narancs|work=VoxEurop|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=vox/&gt; The language of the magazine is unique in that it uses everyday speech and not the formal language of most [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[journalism]]. It has a great effect on the Hungarian liberal-[[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[intellectual]] society. It includes articles mainly on [[politics]], [[culture]] and [[sociology]].

==Name==
The name is a reference to the communist-era attempt to cultivate oranges in Hungary, which failed. The climate is not suitable and the oranges didn't ripen fully, and they were almost yellow and had a sour taste. This was parodied by the movie ''[[The Witness (1969 Hungarian film)|The Witness]]'', in which the only fruit from the plantation is eaten just before being presented to the great leader. In order to salvage the situation, a lemon is used as a replacement. The leader's reaction to the substitution (''It's a bit more yellow, it's a bit more sour, but it's OURS!'') gave rise to the term "Hungarian orange", which has since become a metaphor, similar to the "[[goulash communism]]" used abroad. It was used to refer to the pseudo-communism in the communist era and to the pseudo-capitalism after the country became a democracy, and other phenomena. The orange was also used as the logo by the [[Fidesz ‚Äì Hungarian Civic Union|Fidesz]] (currently [[centre-right]], but started as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]) party, for similar reasons. This however caused confusion since Fidesz became a conservative party and the magazine did not want to be identified with the changed party. To solve this, recently the orange basic colour of the magazine's headline has been changed to yellow which is also the actual colour of the "Hungarian orange", a lemon.

[[File:CCMDonation28.JPG|thumb|Mambo dancers at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City|ITESM Campus Ciudad de Mexico]]]]

'''Mambo''' is a [[Latin dance]] of [[Cuba]] which was developed in the 1940s when the [[Mambo (music)|music genre of the same name]] became popular throughout Latin America. The original ballroom dance which emerged in Cuba and Mexico was related to the [[danz√≥n]], albeit faster and less rigid. In the United States, it replaced [[rhumba]] as the most fashionable Latin dance. Later on, with the advent of [[salsa music|salsa]] and its more [[salsa dance|sophisticated dance]], a new type of mambo dance including breaking steps was popularized in New York. This form received the name of "salsa on 2", "mambo on 2" or "modern mambo".

In the mid-1940s, bandleader devised a dance for a new form of music known as mambo music, taking its name from the 1938 song Mambo 1980 song a charanga which had popularized a new form of danzon  known as danzon mambo. This was a syncopated, less rigid form of the danz√≥n which allowed the dancers to more freely express themselves during the last section, known as the mambo section . From Havana P√©rez Prado moved his music to Mexico, where his music and the dance was adopted. The original mambo dance was characterized by freedom and complicated foot-steps. 
The mambo dance that was spearheaded by P√©rez Prado and was popular in the 1940s and '50s in Cuba, Mexico, and New York is completely different from the modern dance that New Yorkers now call "mambo" and which is also known as [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]] "on 2". The original mambo dance contains no breaking steps or basic steps at all. The Cuban dance was not accepted by many professional dance teachers. Cuban dancers would describe mambo as "feeling the music", in which sound and movement were merged through the body.&lt;ref name="DGarcia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garcia|first=D. F.|title=Going Primitive to the Movements and Sounds of Mambo|journal=The Musical Quarterly|date=1 December 2006 |volume=89|issue=4|pages=505‚Äì523|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm006|url=http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/505.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional dance teachers in the US saw this approach to dancing as "extreme", "undisciplined", and thus deemed it necessary to standardize the dance to present it as a salable commodity for the social and ballroom market.&lt;ref name="DGarcia"/&gt;

===Americanisation===
The modern mambo dance from New York was popularised in the late 1960s into the 1970s by George Vascones, president of a dance group known as the Latin Symbolics, from [[the Bronx]], New York. George Vascones continued the mambo dance tradition which started two decades earlier during the "Palladium era". It was followed in the 1980s by [[Eddie Torres]], Angel Rodriguez of RazzM'Tazz Mambo Dance Company, and others, many of whom were 2nd generation New York Puerto Ricans. This style is sometimes danced to mambo music, but more often to salsa dura (old-school salsa). It is termed "mambo on 2" because the break, or direction change, in the basic step occurs on count 2. The Eddie Torres and Razz M'Tazz schools each have different basic steps, even though they share this same basic feature. Eddie Torres describes his version as a "street" style he developed out of what he saw on the Bronx streets. The RazzM'Tazz version is closer to the Palladium mambo (from the Palladium ballroom in the 1950s), whose basic step was in turn derived from Cuban son, with which it shares its timing (234 - 678, with pauses on 1 and 5) both styles derived from the American Mambo with the freestyle steps based on jazz and tap steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Sydney |last=Hutchinson |date=Fall 2004 |title=Mambo on 2: The birth of a new form of dance in New York City |url=http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=37716209 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911224717/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/377/37716209.pdf |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |dead-url=no |journal=Centro Journal |volume=XVI |issue=2 |pages=108‚Äì137 |issn=1538-6279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dallas Margarita Society dba Dallas Children‚Äôs Charities (DMS/DCC) is a 501(c)(3) charitable corporation formed in 1977 when a group of Dallas businessmen decided to host a holiday party.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxbyS7Mowss&amp;t=18s][http://www.dallasmargaritasociety.org/events/margarita-ball/]

That signature event, the Annual Dallas Margarita Ball, has grown into the largest, invitation-only, charity black tie gala in the world with over 12,000 guests attending.

A literal mountain of joy accumulates at the event each year, as guests gladly respond to the organization‚Äôs request to drop off a donated toy upon entry to the Ball or sponsor gifts with cash donations.

[http://www.dallasmargaritasociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/13668_213291869306_658184306_4053285_5842892_n1.jpg][http://www.dallasmargaritasociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC041301.jpg]

As the Annual Dallas Margarita Ball has expanded over four decades, so have the organization‚Äôs goals.  We‚Äôve preserved the founders‚Äô original intent ‚Äì to provide gifts for ‚Äúat risk‚Äù youth in the DFW area during the holiday season.  However, the extent of our gifting has broadened, as DMS/DCC now provides support to over 50 regional children‚Äôs charities with gifts of cash, toys, computers, exercise gear, school supplies, and many others that are awarded, not just at Christmas, but in almost every month of the year.  Over its 42-year history, DMS/DCC and its supporters have contributed millions of hours of community service and millions of dollars in gifts, including over 200,000 toys, to lift up those who need it most ‚Äì disadvantaged kids.

Today, the combined value of what we give back exceeds a million dollars a year, but the smiles we provide are priceless.

November 17, 2018 will mark our 42nd Annual Dallas Margarita Ball. In addition to our toy collection efforts, the 2018 Dallas Margarita Ball will feature our 18 &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Annual Silent Auction.  Our Silent Auction has gained notoriety as one of the most extensive charity auctions in the United States and donors benefit from exposure to over 12,000 affluent guests, while supporting one of our organization‚Äôs most effective fundraising opportunities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33811">The '''alleged Prague connection''' between [[Iraq]] and [[Al Qaeda]] came through an alleged meeting between [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacker]] [[Mohamed Atta al-Sayed|Mohamed Atta]] and Iraqi consulate in April 2001.  This alleged connection is notable because it was a key claim used by the Bush administration to justify the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref name="CNN2014-12-12"&gt;{{cite news |last=LaMonica |first=Gabe |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/cia-cable-iraq-war/index.html |title=2003 CIA cable casts doubt on claim linking Iraq to 9/11 |work=CNN |date=December 12, 2014 |accessdate=2014-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech counterintelligence service claimed that Mohamed Atta al-Sayed, a September 11 hijacker, met with [[Ahmad Samir al-Ani]], the [[Consulate general|consul]] at the Iraqi Embassy in Prague, in a caf√© in [[Prague]]. This claim, sometimes known as the "Prague connection", is generally considered to be false and has been said to be unsubstantiated by the Senate Intelligence Committee in the United States.&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-2809536"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/06/05/39963/senate-committee-bush-knew-iraq.html |title=Senate committee: Bush knew Iraq claims weren't true |work=mcclatchydc.com |others=Nancy A.

==Allegations==
In an interview with [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on December 9, 2001, then-Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] said, &lt;blockquote&gt;It's been pretty well confirmed that (Atta) did go to Prague, and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi intelligence service in (the Czech Republic) last April, several months before the attack.&lt;ref name="Meet the Press"&gt;{{cite press release |date = 2001-12-09 |url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/news-speeches/speeches/print/vp20011209.html |title = The Vice President Appears on NBC's Meet the Press |work = White House news release |publisher = The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cheney repeated the allegation as the nation prepared for war with Iraq.&lt;ref name="CNN2014-12-12"/&gt;

The source for the claim came from a contact the Czech intelligence had within the Iraqi embassy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=Atta in Prague? An Iraqi prisoner holds the answer to this 9/11 mystery

Some officials have called the source unreliable."&lt;ref name=bg20040919/&gt;

The story was first [[News leak|leaked]] to the [[Reuters]] news service on September 18, 2001. Without naming Prague, Reuters reported that "[r]ecent intelligence information received by the United States showed Atta had met with a representative of Iraqi intelligence this year". The report cited "U.S. government sources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=September 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 13, 2001, the story was leaked to Czech newspapers. The story was confirmed by the State Department.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} On October 20, 2001, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a story by John Tagliabue saying Czech officials denied the meeting ever occurred.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/20/world/a-nation-challenged-terrorism-trail-no-evidence-suspect-met-iraqi-in-prague.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, Czech Republic Interior Minister [[Stanislav Gross]] responded by calling a press conference at which he "confirmed" that Atta "did make contact with an officer of the Iraqi intelligence" in Prague, namely al-Ani, who was later expelled from the country.&lt;ref name="Kenety"&gt;{{cite news

When rumors of the Czech officials privately backing away from the claims first appeared in the Western media, according to ''[[The Prague Post]]'', [[Hynek Kmon√≠ƒçek]], the Czech envoy to the UN stated "The meeting took place." One senior Czech official who requested anonymity speculated that the media reports dismissing the meeting were the result of a "guided leak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.cz/archivescontent/35333-un-envoy-confirms-terrorist-meeting.html|title=UN envoy confirms terrorist meeting|first=Frank|last=Griffiths|work=The Prague Post|date=5 June 2002|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2002 David Ignatius wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the Czechs, who initially put out the reports about Atta's meeting with al-Ani, have gradually backed away. The Czech interior minister, Stanislav Gross, said in October that the two had met in April 2001. That version was altered slightly by Czech Prime Minister [[Milo≈° Zeman]] when he told [[CNN]] in November [2001]: 'Atta contacted some Iraqi agent, not to prepare the terrorist attack on [the twin towers] but to prepare [a] terrorist attack on just the building of [[Radio Free Europe]]' in Prague. Then, in December, Czech President [[V√°clav Havel]] retreated further, saying there was only 'a 70 percent' chance Atta met with al-Ani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A29957-2002Mar14 | work=The Washington Post | title=Dubious Iraqi Link | first=David | last=Ignatius | date=March 15, 2002 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Havel later "moved to quash the report once and for all"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/22/wirq22.xml | title=Havel rebuts report linking Iraq to Sept 11 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Janet | last=Daley | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002174919/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F10%2F22%2Fwirq22.xml | archivedate=2 October 2003 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by making the statement publicly to the [[White House]], as reported in ''The New York Times''.  According to the ''Times'' report, "Czech officials also say they have no hard evidence that Mr. Ani was involved in terrorist activities, although the government did order his ouster in late April 2001."  ''The New York Times'' report was described as "a fabrication" by a Ladislav ≈†paƒçek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2002/02-10-22.rferl.html#39|title=RFE/RL Newsline, 02-10-22|publisher=Hri.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a spokesman for Czech president V√°clav Havel. But ≈†paƒçek also "said Mr. Havel was still certain there was no factual basis behind the report that Mr. Atta met an Iraqi diplomat."&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. Green, "Havel Denies Telephoning U.S. On Iraq Meeting," ''New York Times'' (23 October 2002) p. A11&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Times'' story was a potential embarrassment to Czech prime minister [[Milo≈° Zeman]] after "extensive interviews with Czech and other Western intelligence officials, politicians and people close to the Czech intelligence community revealed that Mr. Zeman had prematurely disclosed an unverified report."

==Investigations==
Several official organizations conducted investigations into the possibility that such a meeting occurred, and they all concluded that the evidence did not support the likelihood of such a meeting.

===CIA===
Shortly after September 11, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] asked Director of Central Intelligence [[George Tenet]] to look into the claim that Atta had met an Iraqi intelligence agent.  Tenet put the Directorate of Operations [[Jim Pavitt]] on the case, who reported back to Tenet.  On September 21, 2001, Tenet told the President, "Our Prague office is skeptical about the report.  It just doesn't add up."  Tenet also indicated that other evidence the CIA was able to find, including credit card and telephone records, made such a meeting highly unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Suskind, ''The One Percent Doctrine'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2006) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to columnist [[Robert Novak]], Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld "confirmed published reports that there is no evidence placing the presumed leader of the terrorist attacks in the Czech capital." &lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Sun-Times]], 13 May 2002, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the January 2003 CIA report ''Iraqi Support for Terrorism'', "the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility" that such a meeting occurred.&lt;ref&gt;States News Service, 15 April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet released "the most complete public assessment by the agency on the issue" in a statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in July 2004, stating "Although we cannot rule it out, we are increasingly skeptical that such a meeting occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/09/MNG267J1N51.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=CIA doubts hijacker met with Iraq agent / Tenet statement runs counter to Cheney's | first=Douglas | last=Jehl | date=July 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John E. McLaughlin]], who at the time was the Deputy Director of the CIA, described the extent of the Agency's investigation into the claim: "Well, on something like the Atta meeting in Prague, we went over that every which way from Sunday. We looked at it from every conceivable angle. We peeled open the source, examined the chain of acquisition. We looked at photographs. We looked at timetables. We looked at who was where and when. It is wrong to say that we didn't look at it. In fact, we looked at it with extraordinary care and intensity and fidelity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/interviews/mclaughlin.html|title=Interviews - John Mclaughlin - The Dark Side - FRONTLINE - PBS|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FBI===
A senior administration official told [[Walter Pincus]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that the FBI had concluded that "there was no evidence Atta left or returned to the U.S. at the time he was supposed to be in Prague." FBI Director [[Robert S. Mueller III]] outlined the extent of their investigation into the hijacker's whereabouts in a speech in April 2002: "We ran down literally hundreds of thousands of leads and checked every record we could get our hands on, from flight reservations to car rentals to bank accounts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/gunning/etc/alqaeda.html|title=Is There A Link Between Al Qaeda And Iraq? - Gunning For Saddam - FRONTLINE - PBS|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no known travel records showing Atta leaving or entering the US at that time, and [[Mohamed Atta al-Sayed#Timeline in America|everything known about Atta's whereabouts]] suggests that he was in [[Florida]] at that time.

===Czech police and intelligence===
The Czech police chief, Ji≈ô√≠ Kol√°≈ô, "said there were no documents showing that Atta visited Prague at any time" in 2001.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

In August 2002, Czech foreign intelligence chief [[Franti≈°ek Bublan]] publicly backed away from the claim that Atta met al-Ani, saying that rumors of such meetings "have not been verified or proven." The ''[[Prague Post]]'' reported that "Bublan said that promoting a so-called 'Prague connection' between Atta and al-Ani might have been a ploy by U.S. policymakers seeking justifications for a new military action against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein."&lt;ref&gt;Swoger, Kate. "[http://www.praguepost.com/P02/2002/20717/news1.php Intelligence chief casts doubt on Atta meeting]," ''Prague Post.'' August 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' more recently, the Czechs backed away from the claim: "After months of further investigation, Czech officials determined last year that they could no longer confirm that a meeting took place, telling the Bush administration that al-Ani might have met with someone other than Atta."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-283154.html|title=Iraqi Who Might Have Met With 9/11 Hijacker Is Captured; New Focus Is Put on Iraq's Alleged Links to Al Qaeda|work=Washington Post|first1=Vernon|last1=Loeb|first2=John|last2=Mintz|date=9 July 2003|accessdate=17 October 2014}}{{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perception seems confirmed by an associate of al-Ani's who suggested to a reporter that the Czech informant had mistaken another man for Atta. The associate said "I have sat with the two of them at least twice. The double is an Iraqi who has met with the consul. If someone saw a photo of Atta he might easily mistake the two."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=5N4KDX1ALIPAJQFIQMGCM54AVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2001/12/18/wirq18.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Iraq link to Sept 11 attack and anthrax is ruled out | first=Peter | last=Green | date=December 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Ji≈ô√≠ R≈Ø≈æek, the former head of Czech intelligence agency [[Security Information Service|BIS]], published his memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;''V labyrintu zpravodajsk√Ωch slu≈æeb'' (''In labyrinth of intelligence services''), {{ISBN|978-80-7244-363-5}}, 208 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Here he claims that the USA tried to push Czech prime minister [[Milo≈° Zeman]] to announce that 9/11 attack was planned with the help of Iraq in Prague. All blame for the false cause of conflict would then fall on Czech authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/331647-usa-nutily-zemana-prohlasit-ze-plan-na-11-zari-vznikl-v-praze-pise-exsef-bis.html|title=Ex-boss of BIS: USA pushed Zeman to claim that 9/11 plans were made in Prague|language=Czech|publisher=[[Novinky.cz]]|accessdate=2014-03-26|date=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===9/11 Commission===
The 9/11 Commission also addressed the question of an alleged Prague connection and listed many of the reasons above that such a meeting could not have taken place. The report notes that "the FBI has gathered intelligence indicating that Atta was in Virginia Beach on April 4 (as evidenced by a bank surveillance camera photo), and in Coral Springs, Florida on April 11, where he and Shehhi leased an apartment.  On April 6, 9, 10, and 11, Atta's cellular telephone was used numerous times to call various lodging establishments in Florida from cell sites within Florida.  We cannot confirm that he placed those calls.  But there are no U.S. records indicating that Atta departed the country during this period."  Combining FBI and Czech intelligence investigations, "[n]o evidence has been found that Atta was in the Czech Republic in April 2001."  The Commission assessed that "There was no reason for such a meeting, especially considering the risk it would pose to the operation. By April 2001, all four pilots had completed most of their training, and the muscle hijackers were about to begin entering the United States. The available evidence does not support the original Czech report of an Atta-Ani meeting."

In the final analysis, the 9/11 Commission Report makes this statement: "These findings cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that Atta was in Prague on April 9, 2001. He could have used an alias to travel and a passport under that alias, but this would be an exception to his practice of using his true name while traveling (as he did in January and would in July when he took his next overseas trip)." (p.&amp;nbsp;229)

==Two different Attas==
Until late 2004, many believed that Atta traveled to Prague for one day on May 30, 2000.  Nobody claimed he had met al-Ani at that time, but conservative columnist [[Andrew C. McCarthy]] wrote in the ''[[National Review]]'' that his trip was considered suspicious. Atta was apparently detained because he did not have a travel visa but was not picked up on airport surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported in August 2004 that it was a different Atta who traveled to Prague in May 2000 ‚Äî a Pakistani businessman also named Mohammed Atta, who spells his name differently from the hijacker ‚Äî and was turned away because he lacked a visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;blockquote&gt;On June 2, the hijacker Mohamed Atta, who had a visa, arrived in Prague by bus from Cologne, Germany, and flew to Newark the next day. Video surveillance cameras at a Prague bus terminal showed him playing slot machines at the station's Happy Days Casino before disappearing.&lt;ref name=bg20040919&gt;{{cite news

|date=September 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The confusion over the two different Attas "had serious consequences," according to Czech reporter Brian Kenety, "as it laid the groundwork for spurious claims by Czech authorities of a secret meeting in Prague between Atta the hijacker and an Iraqi intelligence agent."&lt;ref name="Kenety"/&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on 29 September 2004 also reported that a man from Pakistan named Mohammed Atta (spelling his name with two "m's" rather than one) flew to the Czech Republic in 2000, confusing the intelligence agency, who thought it was the same Mohamed Atta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.911truth.org/readingroom/whole_document.php?article_id=321|title=911readingroom.org|publisher=911truth.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, Ji≈ô√≠ R≈Ø≈æek, the former head of the BIS, told the Czech newspaper ''[[Mlad√° fronta Dnes]]'', "This information was verified, and it was confirmed that it was a case of the same name. That is all that I recall of it." (3 September 2004).

Opposition leaders in the Czech Republic have publicly called this a failure on the part of Czech intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A 9/11 legacy: confusion over a name Czechs find error in tracking Atta | date=September 19, 2004 | first1=Brian | last1=Whitmore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hopes of resolving the issue, Czech officials hoped to be given access to information from the U.S. investigation but that cooperation was not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slate.msn.com/id/2091354/|title=Prague Revisited|work=slate.msn.com|first=Edward Jay|last=Epstein|date=19 November 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031124232549/http://slate.msn.com/id/2091354/|archivedate=24 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2004, the Czech newspaper ''[[Pr√°vo]]'' speculated that the source of the information behind the rumored meeting was actually the discredited INC chief [[Ahmed Chalabi]].&lt;ref&gt;ƒåTK Czech News Agency, 27 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forged letter==
{{main|Habbush letter}}

According to [[Con Coughlin]], executive foreign editor of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Mohamed Atta is mentioned in a handwritten letter from the former chief of the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]], Gen. [[Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti]], to Saddam Hussein. Coughlin said he received the document from a "senior member of the Iraqi interim government", though this person "declined to reveal where and how they obtained it."&lt;ref name="telegraph_1"&gt;Coughlin, Con. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1449442/Terrorist-behind-September-11-strike-was-trained-by-Saddam.html Terrorist behind September 11 strike was trained by Saddam] ''Daily Telegraph''. 13 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph_2"&gt;Coughlin, Con. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1449441/Does-this-link-Saddam-to-911.html Does this link Saddam to 9/11?] ''Daily Telegraph''. 13 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3710880/|title=Transcript for Dec. 14|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habbush's July 1, 2001, letter is labeled "Intelligence Items" and is addressed: "To the President of the Ba'ath Revolution Party and President of the Republic, may God protect you." It continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mohammed Atta, an Egyptian national, came with Abu Ammer [the real name behind this Arabic alias remains a mystery] and we hosted him in Abu Nidal's house at al-Dora under our direct supervision.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We arranged a work program for him for three days with a team dedicated to working with him... He displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy.&lt;ref name="telegraph_2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coughlin quoted [[Ayad Allawi]] giving personal assurance over the document's authenticity: "We are uncovering evidence all the time of Saddam's involvement with al-Qaeda... But this is the most compelling piece of evidence that we have found so far. It shows that not only did Saddam have contacts with al-Qaeda, he had contact with those responsible for the September 11 attacks."&lt;ref name="telegraph_1" /&gt;

The letter is now widely recognized as a forgery. Newsweek noted: "U.S. officials and a leading Iraqi document expert tell NEWSWEEK that the document is most likely a forgery‚Äîpart of a thriving new trade in dubious Iraqi documents that has cropped up in the wake of the collapse of Saddam's regime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3741646/|title=Dubious Link Between Atta and Saddam|work=MSNBC|date=19 December 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040112232948/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3741646/|archivedate=12 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the newsmagazine, "The Telegraph story was apparently written with a political purpose: to bolster Bush administration claims of a connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam's regime."

In the 2008 book ''[[The Way of the World (book)|The Way of the World]]'', author [[Ron Suskind]] claims that the Bush administration itself was behind the forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12308.html|title=Book says White House ordered forgery - Mike Allen - POLITICO.com|author=Mike Allen|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional evidence==
Even further doubt was cast on rumors of such a meeting in December 2003 when Al-Ani, who is in U.S. custody, reportedly denied having ever met Atta.,&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586|title=Case Decidedly Not Closed|date=19 November 2003|work=MSNBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308134915/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586/|archivedate=8 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/13/international/europe/13INQU.html | work=The New York Times | title=Iraqi Agent Denies He Met 9/11 Hijacker in Prague Before Attacks on the U.S | first=James | last=Risen | date=13 December 2003 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603233316/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/13/international/europe/13INQU.html|archivedate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Newsweek'', it was "a denial that officials tend to believe given that they have not unearthed a scintilla of evidence that Atta was even in Prague at the time of the alleged rendezvous."&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt;

Atta's own religious and political convictions made him violently opposed to the Saddam regime; according to the 9/11 Commission Report, "In his interactions with other students, Atta voiced virulently anti-Semitic and anti-American opinions, ranging from condemnations of what he described as a global Jewish movement centered in New York City that supposedly controlled the financial world and the media, to polemics against governments of the Arab world. To him, Saddam Hussein was an American stooge set up to give Washington an excuse to intervene in the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;The 9/11 Commission Report, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cheney's position changes==
Vice President Dick Cheney, who was a proponent of the theory that Atta had met al-Ani in Prague, acknowledged in an interview on March 29, 2006: "We had one report early on from another intelligence service that suggested that the lead hijacker, Mohamed Atta, had met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;
It should be noted that the country's proper name is the [[Czech Republic]]. Cheney's use of [[Czechoslovakia]] is incorrect. The Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]] split in 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  And that reporting waxed and waned where the degree of confidence in it, and so forth, has been pretty well knocked down now at this stage, that that meeting ever took place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060329-2.html|title=Interview of the Vice President by Tony Snow|date=29 March 2006|publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2006, Cheney responded to questions from [[Tim Russert]] about Atta in Prague on [[Meet the Press]]:

:MR. RUSSERT: Any suggestion there was a meeting with Mohamed Atta, one of the hijackers, with Iraqi officials?

:VICE PRES. CHENEY: No. The sequence, Tim, was, when you and I talked that morning, we had not received any reporting with respect to Mohamed Atta going to Prague. Just a few days after you and I did that show, the CIA, CIA produced an intelligence report from the Czech Intelligence Service that said Mohammad Atta, leader of the hijackers, had been in Prague in April of ‚Äò01 and had met with the senior Iraqi intelligence official in Prague. That was the first report we had that he‚Äôd been to Prague and met with Iraqis. Later on, some period of time after that, the CIA produced another report based on a photographer‚Äîon a photograph that was taken in Prague of a man they claim 70 percent probability was Mohammad Atta on another occasion. This was the reporting we received from the CIA when I responded to your question and said it had been pretty well confirmed that he‚Äôd been in Prague. The‚Äîlater on, they were unable to confirm it. Later on, they backed off of it.

:But what I told you was exactly what we were receiving at the time. It never said, and I don‚Äôt believe I ever said, specifically, that it linked the Iraqis to 9/11. It specifically said he had been in Prague, Mohamed Atta had been in Prague and we didn‚Äôt know...

:MR. RUSSERT: And the meeting with Atta did not occur?

:VICE PRES. CHENEY: We don‚Äôt know. I mean, we‚Äôve never been able to, to, to link it, and the FBI and CIA have worked it aggressively. I would say, at this point, nobody has been able to confirm...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14720480/page/3/|title=Meet the Press transcript for Sept. 10, 2006|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq==
On September 8, 2006, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] released "Phase II" of its report on prewar intelligence on Iraq.  In the report, the following is stated regarding Atta in Prague:
:Postwar findings support CIA's January 2003 assessment, which judged that "the most reliable reporting casts doubt" on...an alleged meeting between Muhammad Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague, and confirm that no such meeting occurred...Prewar assessments described reporting on the Atta lead as contradictory and unverified.  In September 2002, CIA assessed that some evidence asserted that the two met, and some cast doubt on the possibility.  By January 2003, CIA assessed that...they were "increasingly skeptical that Atta traveled to Prague in 2001 or met with IIS officer al-Ani."  Postwar debriefings of al-Ani indicate that he had never seen or heard of Atta until after September 11, 2001, when Atta's face appeared on the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf |format=PDF|title=Postwar Findings About Iraq's WMD Programs and Links To Terrorism and How They Compare With Prewar Assessments|pages=110-111|publisher=Intelligence.senate.gov|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also contains a full page of information with regards to Atta in Prague that was redacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf |format=PDF|title=Postwar Findings About Iraq's WMD Programs and Links To Terrorism and How They Compare With Prewar Assessments|pages=97-98|publisher=Intelligence.senate.gov|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Newsweek'' reports that the blacked-out portion of the Report involved a CIA cable that lays out the controversy.  According to ''Newsweek'', "Democrats charged in a written statement that intelligence officials had failed to demonstrate 'that disclosing the [cable] ... would reveal sources and methods or otherwise harm national security.' The Democrats also complained that officials' refusal to declassify the cable 'represents an improper use of classification authority by the intelligence community to shield the White House.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14824384/site/newsweek/|title=Atta in Prague|date=13 September 2006|work=MSNBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012143820/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14824384/site/newsweek/|archivedate=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Newsweek'' goes on to report: 
:According to two sources familiar with the blacked-out portions of the Senate report that discuss the CIA cable's contents, the document indicates that White House officials had proposed mentioning the supposed Atta-Prague meeting in a Bush speech scheduled for March 14, 2003... According to one of the sources familiar with the Senate report's censored portions, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, the tone of the CIA cable was 'strident' and expressed dismay that the White House was trying to shoehorn the Atta anecdote into the Bush speech to be delivered only days before the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The source said the cable also suggested that policymakers had tried to insert the same anecdote into other speeches by top administration officials.  A second source familiar with the Senate report, however, maintained that it could be read as routine give-and-take between policymakers asking legitimate questions about intelligence reporting and field operatives giving respectful responses. Both sources familiar with the report acknowledge that there is no proof the White House saw the cable, and thus it is unclear whether the CIA document had any bearing on the fact that Bush never mentioned the Atta anecdote in a speech.

CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano asserted that the classification had nothing to do with protecting the Bush Administration: "When CIA did not agree to a specific public release, its case was based on current intelligence equities and a desire to preserve the candor essential to good internal discussion of complex issues. It's simply wrong to suggest the goal was to protect the White House."

'''New Talent Singing Awards Calgary Audition''' (Chinese: Êñ∞ÁßÄÊ≠åÂî±Â§ßË≥ΩÂç°Âä†Âà©ÈÅ∏ÊãîË≥Ω), or ''NTSA Calgary'' for short, is an annual singing contest organized by [[Fairchild TV|Fairchild Television]] and [[Fairchild Radio]] 94.7 FM in Alberta. It selects the Calgary candidate for the [[New Talent Singing Awards]] International Finals held in Hong Kong.

==Alberta Audition to Calgary Contest to Calgary Audition==
The contest was first established as '''New Talent Singing Awards Alberta Audition''' (Chinese: Êñ∞ÁßÄÊ≠åÂî±Â§ßË≥Ω‰∫ûÁúÅÈÅ∏ÊãîË≥Ω) in 1996. The contest included contestants from both [[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]]. However, since 2005, the contest was renamed to '''Calgary New Talent Singing Awards''' (Chinese: Âç°Âä†Âà©Êñ∞ÁßÄÊ≠åÂî±Â§ßË≥Ω),  as FM 94.7 is based in Calgary.  In 2009, the name changed again to its current one to match its [[NTSA Vancouver|Vancouver]] and [[NTSA Toronto|Toronto]] counterparts.

'''Open House Melbourne''' ('''OHM''') is an event held in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] that showcases many of the city's buildings to the public. This annual event is held on the last weekend in July since 2008.

''Open House Melbourne'' is also a not-for-profit association that runs the OHM, as well as other annual events, providing the public a free and rare opportunity to discover a hidden wealth of architectural, engineering and historic buildings nestled around the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6029">'''Paradox of competition''' in [[economics]] names a model of a situation where measures, which offer a [[competition (economics)|competitive advantage]] to an individual economic entity, lead to nullification of advantage if all others behave in the same way. In some cases the finite state is even more disadvantageous for everybody than before (for the totality as well as for the individual). The term ''Paradox of competition'' ({{lang-de|Konkurrenzparadoxon}}) was coined by German economist [[Wolfgang St√ºtzel]].  It is about a case of a [[rationality trap]].

St√ºtzel distinguishes three categories of paradoxes of competition:&lt;ref&gt;Rolf-Dieter Grass, Wolfgang St√ºtzel: ''Volkswirtschaftslehre.'' M√ºnchen 1988, p. 156-165&lt;/ref&gt;
# Circuit paradoxes
# Classical paradoxes
# Marx paradoxes

== Examples ==
* [[Advertising]]: the overall demand for detergent is assumed steady. By advertisement the individual venture can expand its share in market at the expense of its competitors. But if all producers of detergent do the same, their expenses for advertisement rise without gaining higher sales at large, so that profits even decline.   
* [[Opening hours]]: assumed the legislator extends the allowed opening hours by two hours. Now when an individual shop applies that new opening hours, though it has to pay more work, it can gain higher sales and thereby more profit. But if all shops practise the extended opening hours, customers can shop again at other shops with similar supply and the potential sales volume again allocates to all (similar) shops.
* [[Wage policy]]: for each individual country counts: a state can improve its price competitiveness in comparison with other states by a restrained wage policy. But from that it does ''just not'' follow that all countries (can) improve their competitiveness when they apply restrained wage policy.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Schmidt, 2012: ''Sparen ‚Äì Fluch oder Segen?'' In: [http://guthabenkrise.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sparen-fluch-oder-segen.pdf ''Normative und institutionelle Grundfragen der √ñkonomik: Lehren aus der Krise f√ºr die Makro√∂konomik.''] (PDF; 125&amp;nbsp;kB) p. 12 f.&lt;/ref&gt;     
* [[Current account balance]]: a current account surplus is to the expense of an others state current account deficit ‚Äì insofar not all can improve their balance at the same time. On the contrary ‚Äì if all simultaneously begin to cut down their imports they will have a decline of balance in their current account in the end.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang St√ºtzel in: ''Zins, Kredit und Produktion.'' T√ºbingen 1952. Einleitung der Herausgebers. p. 9:
‚ÄûAlle L√§nder wollen [...] mehr exportieren als importieren. Es ist wieder von vornherein klar, da√ü sie nicht zum Ziele kommen werden. Grunds√§tzlich theoretisch gibt es hier zwei M√∂glichkeiten. Entweder betreiben alle Staaten aktive Exportf√∂rderung und lassen die Importe frei: In einem Taumel internationaler Austauschlust wird das Gesamtexportvolumen steigen, ohne da√ü in summa irgend jemand mehr exportiert als importiert h√§tte. Oder aber und das ist das Wahrscheinlichere und leider immer wieder historisch Gegebene: Man wird zur Gewinnung eines aktiven Leistungsbilanzsaldos die Importe zu beschr√§nken suchen. Damit kann auch kein Land mehr seinen Export steigern. Im Gegenteil. Das allgemeine Streben nach einer Differenz zwischen Export und Import wird das Gesamtaustauschvolumen kumulativ zur√ºckgehen lassen.‚Äú&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[protectionism]] in the 1930s: [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]]).    
* [[Currency devaluation]]: an individual state with own currency can achieve to lower overseas prices of its export goods by means of currency devaluation. All countries together in total cannot do so.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang St√ºtzel: ''Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft.'' Aalen 1979. p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; If countries undersell each other with devaluations, the danger of [[currency war]] grows, consequence of which is a spiral of devaluation.

== Partial sentence, Global sentence, lead and lag effect ==
Wolfgang St√ºtzel analyses paradoxes of competition using the concept of [[Balances Mechanics]] ({{lang-de|Saldenmechanik}}). Specifically he defines and distinguishes validness which is valid for individual economic entities respectively individual groups (''Partial sentence''), and validness which counts for the totality of economic entities (''Global sentence'').

Concerning the pursuit of export surpluses he distinguishes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang St√ºtzel: ''Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft.'' Aalen 1979. p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Partial sentence: ''Every country can achieve export surpluses by expanding its export. Every country can achieve export surpluses by reducing its import.''
* Global sentence: ''The sum of export always equals the sum of import.''

On overall economy examination ([[macroeconomics]], [[aggregation problem]]) the benefit which individual economies want to achieve for themselves (legitimately) often appears as so called ''lead effect'' as against an inevitable ''lag effect'' of others. When lag effects are condoned, no paradox of competition arises. Solely because ''individual supply and individual demand'' turn out to be more elastic than ''overall supply and overall demand'' the classical paradox of competition can occur.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang St√ºtzel: ''Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft.'' Aalen 1979. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''shnit international shortfilmfestival ''' is an annual international [[film festival]] based in [[Berne]], Switzerland.

== History ==

The festival was founded in 2003 under the name '''shnit Kurzfilmn√§chte'''.

Over the course of the next couple of years the event for  short films of all kind quickly evolved into a festival with an international competition, and a big variety of special programmes, workshops and public film talks.

Since 2005 the shnit shortfilmfestival takes place in the [[PROGR]] center for cultural production and in various cinemas in the old town of Berne.

Since 2007 the festival is host of the [[Slam-Movie-Night]] and also holds the [[REALTIME film challenge]].

With 6 festival locations, more than 65 screenings and an attendance of around 15'000 the shnit shortfilmfestival is the largest festival of its kind in Switzerland.

== Competition and Festival Concept==

More than 2000 short films from all continents are annually submitted to the selection process.
 
The centre point of the festival is the international competition [[shnit OPEN COMPETITION]]. 
Each OPEN programme consists of about 6 to 7 short films (occasionally with good animations too), lasting about 80-minute.
There are usually 10 OPEN COMPETITION Programmes that are programmed and screened in each participating city/playground. 
Among the OPEN COMPETITION entries, an official festival jury awards films in the following categories:

- SMART JOE (films under 4 minutes)
- MAGIC JACK (films from 4 to 10 minutes)
- LONG JOHN (films over 10 minutes)

The total prize money of the shnit-Open is CHF 100'000 (approximately US$100,000).

In addition, audience could attend the screenings and vote their favourite film in all the cities.
Chosen film with the highest votes get a good chance to win 'AUDIENCE AWARD' conferred by the shnit competition organizer.

Film competitions held in each city award their best film (e.g. Swiss Award, South Africa Award, German Award, Austria Award) with their respective film awards/prizes.

==Other Festival Programmes==

Besides the OPEN COMPETITION screenings, other interesting short films are also curated into different programme sections changing every Edition.
Within the following section are 90-minute programme blocks where every Playground screens the selected programmes:

- A REAL TREAT 
- OUT OF CURIOSITY
- FOR SPECIAL INTEREST

== Playgrounds==

Besides Bern (CH), the festival soon attracted participation from different cities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=San Jos√© hosts international short film fest|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/10/07/san-jose-hosts-international-short-film-fest|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Cologne (DE) in 2009, Cape Town (ZA) in 2010, as well as Vienna, San Jose and Singapore in 2011.
These cities will be screening the OPEN COMPETITION short films over a few days at the same time, in the first week of October every year.
These cities are known as PLAYGROUNDS, and each runs a set of similar festival programmes with their available local resources in terms of sponsorships, partnerships and grants.
Audience are welcome to vote for their favourite film during the screenings. Results will be sent to Bern to award the 'AUDIENCE AWARD' film at the end of the week.

In 2012, Switzerland Embassy of Singapore supported the festival in Singapore.

{{Campaignbox Ionian Revolt}}

The '''Siege of Naxos''' (499 BC) was a failed attempt by the [[Miletus|Milesian]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]], operating with support from, and in the name of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Darius the Great]], to conquer the island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]]. It was the opening act of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], which would ultimately last for 50 years.

Aristagoras had been approached by exiled Naxian aristocrats, who were seeking to return to their island. Seeing an opportunity to bolster his position in Miletus, Aristagoras sought the help of his overlord, the Persian king Darius the Great, and the local [[satrap]], [[Artaphernes]] to conquer Naxos. Consenting to the expedition, the Persians assembled a force of 200 triremes under the command of [[Megabates]].

The expedition quickly descended into a debacle. Aristagoras and Megabates quarreled on the journey to Naxos, and someone (possibly Megabates) informed the Naxians of the imminent arrival of the force. When they arrived, the Persians and Ionians were thus faced with a city well prepared to undergo siege. The expeditionary force duly settled down to besiege the defenders, but after four months without success, ran out of money and were forced to return to Asia Minor.

In the aftermath of this disastrous expedition, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against Darius the Great. The revolt then spread to [[Caria]] and [[Cyprus]]. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect, before the Persians regrouped and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. At the [[Battle of Lade]], the Persians decisively defeated the Ionian fleet and effectively ended the rebellion. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish [[Athens]] and [[Eretria]], who had supported the revolt. In 492 BC therefore, the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], would begin as a consequence of the failed attack on Naxos, and the [[Ionian Revolt]].

==Sources==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

Practically the only primary source for the Ionian Revolt is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name = fine&gt;Fine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NjeM0kcp8swC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=Ionian+revolt#PPA272,M1 pp. 269&amp;ndash;277.]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, On the Laws I, 5&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek&amp;mdash;''Historia''; English&amp;mdash;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440&amp;ndash;430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; As Holland has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."&lt;ref name = hxvi&gt;Holland, pp. ''xvi''&amp;ndash;''xvii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.22 I, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin15&gt;Finley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.&lt;ref name = Fin15/&gt; [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay "On The Malignity of Herodotus", describing Herodotus as "''Philobarbaros''" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227170138/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.&lt;ref name = h377&gt;Holland, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref name = h377/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Fehling, pp. 1&amp;ndash;277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Ionian Revolt}}
In the [[Greek Dark Ages]] that followed the collapse of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]], significant numbers of Greeks had emigrated to [[Asia Minor]] and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the [[Aeolians]], [[Dorians]] and [[Ionians]].&lt;ref name = I14x&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23142;loc=1.141.1 I, 142&amp;ndash;151]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionians had settled about the coasts of [[Lydia]] and [[Caria]], founding the twelve cities which made up [[Ionia]].&lt;ref name = I14x/&gt; These cities were [[Miletus]], [[Myus]] and [[Priene]] in Caria; [[Ephesus]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], [[Lebedos]], [[Teos]], [[Clazomenae]], [[Phocaea]] and [[Erythrae]] in Lydia; and the islands of [[Samos]] and [[Chios]].&lt;ref name = I142&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23142;loc=1.143.1 I, 142]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king [[Croesus]], in around 560 BC.&lt;ref name = I143&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%2326;layout=;loc=1.27.1 I, 26]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name = I141&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23141;layout=;loc=1.140.1 I, 141]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects&amp;mdash;such as the priesthood of Judea.&lt;ref name = h147/&gt; No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions.&lt;ref name = h147&gt;Holland, pp. 147&amp;ndash;151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians thus settled for the sponsoring a [[tyrant]] in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, and have to be replaced.&lt;ref name = h147/&gt; The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.&lt;ref name = h147/&gt;

[[File:Darius-Vase.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Darius I of Persia, as imagined by a Greek painter, 4th century BC]]

About 40 years after the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in the reign of the fourth Persian king, [[Darius the Great]], the stand-in Milesian tyrant [[Aristagoras]] found himself in this familiar predicament.&lt;ref name = h153&gt;Holland, pp. 153&amp;ndash;154.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristagoras's uncle [[Histiaeus]] had accompanied Darius on campaign in 513 BC, and when offered a reward, had asked for part of the conquered [[Thrace|Thracian]] territory. Although this was granted, Histiaeus's ambition alarmed Darius's advisors, and Histiaeus was thus further 'rewarded' by being compelled to remain in [[Susa]] as Darius's "Royal Table-Companion".&lt;ref name = h153/&gt; Taking over from Histiaeus, Aristagoras was faced with bubbling discontent in Miletus.

Indeed, this period in Greek history is remarkable for the social and political upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly the establishment of the first [[Athenian democracy|democracy]] in [[History of Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref name = fine/&gt; The island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], part of the [[Cyclades]] group in the [[Aegean Sea]], was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant [[Lygdamis of Naxos|Lygdamis]], a protege of the Athenian tyrant [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]], until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the [[Sparta]]ns. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos became one of the most prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands.&lt;ref name = fine/&gt;&lt;ref name = V28&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23797;layout=;loc=5.27.1 V, 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.&lt;ref name = fine/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd143"&gt;Lloyd, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some of the exiles from [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], who asked him to help restore them to the control of the island.&lt;ref name = V30&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23799;layout=;loc=5.31.1 V, 30]&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the [[satrap]] of Lydia, [[Artaphernes]], with a proposal. If Artaphernes provided an army, Aristagoras would conquer the island in Darius's name, and he would then give Artaphernes a share of the spoils to cover the cost of raising the army.&lt;ref name = V31&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23800;layout=;loc=5.30.1 V, 31]&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Aristagoras suggested that once Naxos fell, the other Cyclades would also quickly follow, and he even suggested that [[Euboea]] could be attacked on the same expedition.&lt;ref name = V31/&gt; Artaphernes agreed in principle, and asked Darius for permission to launch the expedition. Darius assented to this, and a force of 200 triremes was assembled in order to attack Naxos the following year.&lt;ref name = V32&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23801;layout=;loc=5.31.1 V, 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
The Persian fleet was duly assembled in the spring of 499 BC, and sailed to Ionia. Artaphernes put his (and Darius's) cousin [[Megabates]] in charge of the expedition, and dispatched him to Miletus with the Persian army.&lt;ref name=V32/&gt; They were joined there by Aristagoras and the Milesian forces, and then embarked and set sail. In order to avoid warning the Naxians, the fleet initially sailed north, towards the [[Hellespont]], but when they arrived at [[Chios]] they doubled back and headed south for Naxos.&lt;ref name = V33&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.33 V, 33]&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus recounts that Megabates made inspections of the ships (probably whilst beached for the night), and came across one ship from [[Myndus]] which had not posted any sentries.&lt;ref name = V33/&gt; Megabates ordered his guard to find the captain of the ship, Scylax, and then had the captain thrust into one of the ship's oar holes with his head outside and his body inside the ship.&lt;ref name = V33/&gt; News reached Aristagoras of the treatment of his friend and he went to Megabates and asked him to reconsider his decision. When Megabates refused to grant Aristagoras's wishes, Aristagoras simply cut the captain loose himself.&lt;ref name = V33/&gt; Predictably, Megabates was furious with Aristagoras, who in turn retorted "But you, what have you to do with these matters? Did not Artaphrenes send you to obey me and to sail wherever I bid you? Why are you so meddlesome?".&lt;ref name = V33/&gt; According to Herodotus, Megabates was so enraged by this that he sent messengers to the Naxians to warn them of the approach of the Persian force.&lt;ref name = V33/&gt;

Modern historians, doubting that a Persian commander would have sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, impossible to know exactly how the Naxians became aware of the invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations.&lt;ref name="Keaveney76"&gt;Keaveney, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.&lt;ref name = V34&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.34 V, 34]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing forces==
Herodotus does not provide complete numbers for either side, but gives some idea of the strength of the two forces. Clearly, since they were fighting on home territory, the Naxian forces could theoretically have included the whole population. Herodotus says in his narrative that the "Naxians have eight thousand men that bear shields", which suggests that there were 8,000 men capable of equipping themselves as [[hoplite]]s. These men would have formed a strong backbone to the Naxian resistance.&lt;ref name = V30/&gt;

The Persian force was primarily based around 200 [[trireme]]s.&lt;ref name = V31/&gt; It is not clear whether there were additional transport ships. The standard complement of a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines.&lt;ref name = L46&gt;Lazenby, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]], each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines,&lt;ref name=VII184&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.184 VII, 184]&lt;/ref&gt; and this was probably also true in the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first invasion]] when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes.&lt;ref name = L46/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Chios|Chian]] ships at the [[Battle of Lade]] also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 40&amp;ndash;45 soldiers&amp;mdash;triremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; If the Persian force at Naxos was similarly made up, then it would have contained somewhere in the region of 8,000 to 9,000 soldiers (in addition to many unarmed rowers).

==Siege==
[[File:Naxos towns.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Map of Naxos, showing the eponymous main city]]

When the Ionians and Persians arrived at Naxos, they were faced by a well-fortified and supplied city.&lt;ref name = V34/&gt; Herodotus does not explicitly say, but this was presumably the eponymous capital of Naxos. He provides few details of the military actions that ensued, although there is a suggestion that there was an initial assault on the city, which was repelled.&lt;ref name = V34/&gt; The Ionians and Persians thus settled down to besiege the city. However, after four months, the Persians had run out of money, with Aristagoras also spending a great deal.&lt;ref name = V34/&gt; Thoroughly demoralised, the expedition prepared to return to Asia Minor empty handed. Before leaving, they built a stronghold for the exiled Naxian aristocrats on the island.&lt;ref name = V34/&gt; This was a typical strategy in the Greek world for those exiled by internal strife, giving them a base from which to quickly return, as events permitted.&lt;ref name = board/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Ionian Revolt}}
With the failure of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; he was unable to repay Artaphernes the costs of the expedition, and had moreover alienated himself from the Persian royal family. He fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.&lt;ref name = V35&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23804;layout=;loc=5.34.1 V, 35]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians.&lt;ref name="fine"/&gt; Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and [[Aeolis]] and [[Doris (Asia Minor)|Doris]]), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.&lt;ref name = h155&gt;Holland, pp. 155&amp;ndash;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having brought all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, Aristagoras evidently realised that the Greeks would need other allies in order to fight the Persians.&lt;ref name = h157&gt;Holland, pp. 157&amp;ndash;159.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 499 BC, he sailed to mainland Greece to try to recruit allies. He failed to persuade the [[Sparta]]ns, but the cities of [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] agreed to support the rebellion.&lt;ref name="h157"/&gt; In the spring of 498&amp;nbsp;BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, for a total of twenty-five triremes, set sail for Ionia.&lt;ref name = h160&gt;Holland, pp. 160&amp;ndash;162.&lt;/ref&gt; They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus.&lt;ref name = V100&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23876;layout=;loc=5.99.1 V, 100]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This force was then guided by the Ephesians through mountains to [[Sardis]], Artaphernes's satrapal capital.&lt;ref name = h160/&gt; The Greeks caught the Persians unawares, and were able to capture the lower city. However, the lower city then caught on fire, and the Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus.&lt;ref name = V101&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23878;layout=;loc=5.101.1 V, 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian troops in Asia Minor followed the Greek force, catching them outside Ephesus. It is clear that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were completely routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus.&lt;ref name = h160/&gt; The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships, and sailed back to Greece.&lt;ref name = h160/&gt;&lt;ref name = V102&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.102 V, 102]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ionian Revolt Campaign Map.png|300px|thumb|left|Main events of the Ionian Revolt]]

Despite these setbacks, the revolt spread further. The Ionians sent men to the [[Hellespont]] and [[Propontis]], and captured [[Byzantium]] and the other nearby cities.&lt;ref name = V103/&gt; They also persuaded the [[Caria]]ns to join the rebellion.&lt;ref name = V103&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23879;layout=;loc=5.104.1 V, 103]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of [[Cyprus]] also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.&lt;ref name = V104&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23880;layout=;loc=5.103.1 V, 104]&lt;/ref&gt; For the next three years, the Persian army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in Caria and Cyprus, and Ionia seems to have had an uneasy peace during these years.&lt;ref name = board&gt;Boardman ''et al'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=nNDpPqeDjo0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA485&amp;dq=Battle+of+Pedasus+497+BC&amp;ei=Kj3rSZCZD6b0ygSIn_SYBQ pp. 481&amp;ndash;490.]&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing the untenability of his position, decided to abandon his position as leader of Miletus, and of the revolt, and he left Miletus. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled.&lt;ref name = V124&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.124 V, 124&amp;ndash;126]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the sixth year of the revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The available land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ians, [[Cilicia]]ns and [[Phoenicia]]ns.&lt;ref name = VI6/&gt; The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its centre. The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of Lade, off the coast of [[Miletus]].&lt;ref name = VI6&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.6 VI, 6]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians were uncertain of victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect.&lt;ref name = VI9&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23912;layout=;loc=6.11.1 VI, 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians, the [[Samos|Samian]] contingent accepted the Persian offer. As the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line.&lt;ref name = VI13&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23915;layout=;loc=6.12.1 VI, 13]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Chios|Chian]] contingent and a few other ships remained, and fought bravely against the Persians, the battle was lost.&lt;ref name = VI14&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23916;layout=;loc=6.13.1 VI, 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

With defeat at Lade, the Ionian Revolt was all but ended. The next year, the Persians reduced the last rebel strongholds, and began the process of bringing peace to the region.&lt;ref name = VI31&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23933;layout=;loc=6.30.1 VI, 31&amp;ndash;33]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between [[Greece]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], and as such represents the first phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the revolt.&lt;ref name = h175/&gt; Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire, he decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, would begin as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.&lt;ref name = h175&gt;Holland, pp. 175&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Belize Times''''' is a [[Belize]]an [[newspaper]] published once a week and the official organ of the [[People's United Party]] (PUP). It was established in 1956 and sells for [[Belize dollar|BZ$]]1

Its offices are located at the PUP's Belize City headquarters at 3 Queen Street, [[Belize City]]. As of August 2006, it has published over 4,500 issues, making it the longest continuously published newspaper in Belize since 1950.

Its motto is "The Truth Shall Make You Free", a shortened form of Bible verse John 8:32: "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." (King James Version)

* Publishers: Kevin L. Arthurs and Kareem Musa (BT Publishing)

== History ==
The ''Times'' began publishing in 1956 under the patronage of then leader George Price, who had just ousted ten members of the PUP from its central committee, including [[Philip Goldson]], owner and editor of the ''Belize Billboard''.

For much of the 1980s the newspaper was presented as ''The Sunday Times''; it resumed printing under the ''Belize Times'' moniker in the 1990s.

Longtime columnist Emory King died in August 2007. King's column officially ceased with the 19 August 2007 issue of the ''Times''.

==Editorial policy==

As the official organ of the PUP, ''The Belize Times'' is consistently critical of policies supported by the opposition [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]]. As a result, the ''Times'' has been involved in several lawsuits and controversies. Though the major political parties rarely sue each other over accusations printed in the other's newspaper, allegations have at times become serious enough to warrant a response.

The ''Times'' has also gained a reputation for its support for the arts through its weekly reviews of many Belizean artists.

=== 2006 libel controversy ===

''The Belize Times'' answered to a libel suit in the Supreme Court, filed by attorney Lois Young and her former husband, then-[[Leader of the Opposition (Belize)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Dean Barrow]] over articles printed in the newspaper in October 2006 which they claimed defamed Barrow. Chief Justice [[Abdulai Conteh]] issued an injunction, which the ''Times'' appealed.

On 9 November 2006, Conteh lifted the injunction and set the case for January 2007.

In February 2007, Conteh ruled against the ''Times'' and set damages at BZ$40,000, the third highest award (including lawyer fees and costs) in Belizean legal history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belizenews.com/ BelizeNews]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' will consider an appeal, and in its Friday issue for that week continued to proclaim its innocence and accuse other media houses of unfair treatment of PUP public figures, which it says approaches libel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belizetimes.bz/news/story/6438.shtml ''The Times''‚Ä≤ reaction]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their name is derived from the case of ''[[Vento v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police]]'' (No. 2) (2002) &lt;ref&gt;EWCA Civ 1871, [2003] IRLR 102, [2003] ICR 318&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] identified three broad bands of compensation for injury to feelings awards which were distinct from compensation awards for psychiatric or similar personal injury.

The lower band was initially set at ¬£500 to ¬£5,000 (less serious cases); the middle band was set at ¬£5,000 to ¬£15,000 (cases that did not
merit an award in the upper band); and the upper band was set at ¬£15,000 to ¬£25,000 (the most serious cases), with the most exceptional cases capable of exceeding ¬£25,000.&lt;ref name=Response&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/vento-consultation-response-20170904.pdf Response to Judicial Consultation: Employment Tribunal awards for injury to feelings and psychiatric injury following ''De Souza v Vinci Construction (UK) Ltd.'' (2017)], 4 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in England and Wales in ''De Souza v Vinci Construction (UK) Ltd.'' [2017],&lt;ref&gt;EWCA Civ 879.&lt;/ref&gt; the Presidents of the Employment Tribunals in England and Wales and in Scotland launched a consultation exercise on 20 July 2017 on proposed changes to the bands and, supported by a majority of responses in favour of raising the bands, they were uprated with effect from 11 September 2017. The revised bands will consist of a lower band of ¬£800 to ¬£8,400 (less serious cases); a middle band of ¬£8,400 to ¬£25,200 (cases that did not merit an award in the upper band); and an upper band of ¬£25,200 to ¬£42,000 (the most serious cases), with the most exceptional cases capable of exceeding ¬£42,000.&lt;ref name=Response /&gt;

"'''Youth of the Nation'''" is a song by American [[Christian metal]] band [[P.O.D.]] It was released in December 2001 as the second single to come from their second [[major label]] album, ''[[Satellite (P.O.D. album)|Satellite]]''. It was inspired in part by the [[school shooting]]s at [[Charles Andrew Williams#The shooting|Santana High School]] and [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine High School]]. While ''Satellite'' contained numerous hit songs, "Youth of the Nation" was the band's only No. 1 hit on the [[Modern Rock]] chart and reached No. 28 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], their only single to reach the top 40, and No. 6 on the [[Mainstream Rock]] chart. The song was included in [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s polka medley "[[Angry White Boy Polka]]" from his 2003 album ''[[Poodle Hat]]'', despite lead singer Sonny Sandoval's mixed race background. It was also featured as [[downloadable content]] in the music video games ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]''{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and ''[[Rock Band 3]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Background==
The song's inspiration stems from a trip when the band was on their way to record for ''Satellite'' on March 5, 2001.  They were held up in traffic and discovered that the reason was a shooting at [[Santana High School]] where a fifteen-year-old student named [[Charles Andrew Williams]] killed two and wounded thirteen. The album was consequently delayed, and the band was inspired to write "Youth of the Nation."

In a 2008 interview, guitarist [[Marcos Curiel]] described the event:
:"We were rehearsing and writing ''Satellite'' a couple of blocks away from the school. One day on the way to the studio, there were all these helicopters and cars speeding by. We really didn‚Äôt know what was going on. When we got to the studio, this guy had the news on, and he was like, ‚ÄòThis kid just went and started blasting fools.‚Äô So we started jamming, and that rhythm just naturally came out then [[Wuv Bernardo|Wuv]] [Bernardo, drummer] put that drumbeat on it, and the song was born."

Curiel added, "When you can hear something that's going to uplift you like '[[Alive (P.O.D. song)|Alive]]' or something that's going to bring out knowledge like 'Youth of the Nation,' we've done our jobs as an artist."&lt;ref name="juiced"&gt;Blatt, Mitchell [http://juicedsportsblog.com/2008/03/marcos-curiel-interview.html P.O.D. Interview: Back Together, New Album in April] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413035449/http://juicedsportsblog.com/2008/03/marcos-curiel-interview.html |date=April 13, 2008 }} Juiced Sports (March 13, 2008).

==Lyrics and song structure==
"Youth of the Nation" contains three stories of adolescent tragedy in American culture. It begins by describing a teenager unknowingly skating to school only to be shot by a fellow student. Lyrics go on to speculate whether or not the boy who committed the act felt unloved. Following the chorus, a 12-year-old girl called "little Suzie" is depicted as having been abandoned by her father and subsequently "finding love in all the wrong places." Finally, another teen known as "Johnny boy" fails to fit in with his peers and ultimately commits suicide by firearm, "[telling] the world how he felt with the sound of a [[handgun|gat]]."&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;Fenell, Zachary [http://voices.yahoo.com/alternative-rock-songs-suicide-6907480.html Alternative Rock Songs About Suicide] [[Yahoo!]] (October 11, 2010)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729053434/http://voices.yahoo.com/alternative-rock-songs-suicide-6907480.html |date=July 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The music video for "Youth of the Nation" has the band performing the song in a room filled with photos of adolescents as seen on the single cover. It revolves around a group of teenagers taking a cross country trip in a car from New York City to [[Venice Beach]] in Los Angeles via Western Pennsylvania (New Kensington, Arnold, Cheswick, Harmarville) and other locales. The book ''[[On the Road]]'' by [[Jack Kerouac]] can be seen on the dashboard of the car. Directed by [[Paul Fedor (director)|Paul Fedor]], the video found significant airplay on [[MTV2]].

The video features a prefamous [[Joel David Moore]] as the teenager driving the car.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/62051373&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source| date=June 2015|reason=viewing the video requires the reader to know what Moore looks like and when the person appears.}}

Marcos Curiel noted that censorship of the video came into play due to [[Viacom]]: "We had a girl sitting on the hood of the car going down the highway trying to be free-spirited, you know? [...] But, Viacom and MTV had us edit that out because kids are so easily influenced."&lt;ref name="juiced"/&gt;
