==Biography==
Wilder-Smith earned three doctorates; his first PhD in 1941 in Physical Organic Chemistry from [[Reading University]], England, his second in 1964 in Pharmacology from the [[University of Geneva]], and his third from [[Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule]] (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), Zurich.

As a chemist, Wilder-Smith joined [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] during World War II. Following the war, the [[University of London]] made him the Countess of Lisburne Memorial Fellow. Dr. Wilder-Smith accepted an appointment as Director of Research for a Swiss pharmaceutical company. While in Switzerland, the Medical School of the [[University of Geneva]] elected him to teach Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, for which he received [[habilitation]], the qualification required for professional appointments to European continental universities.&lt;ref name="Wilder-Smith 1993 128"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilder-Smith |first=A.E. |title=The Time Dimension:Its Relationship to the Origin of Life |year=1993 |publisher=The Word For Today |location=Costa Mesa, CA |isbn=978-0-936728-45-2 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957-1958 Wilder-Smith accepted the position of Visiting Assistant Professor at the Medical Center of the [[University of Illinois]]. In 1959-1961 he was Visiting Full Professor of Pharmacology at the [[University of Bergen]] Medical School in Norway. He returned to the [[University of Geneva]] for two years then received an appointment as Full Professor of Pharmacology back at the [[University of Illinois]] Medical Center in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blaine |first=Graham B. |authorlink= |title=The Drug Users: The Psychopharmacology of Turning On, by A.

Dr. Wilder-Smith was Professor of Pharmacology for two years at [[Hacettepe University]] Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. He served as a NATO consultant for the prevention and treatment of drug abuse.&lt;ref name="Wilder-Smith 1993 128"/&gt;

==Family life and religious views==
In 1949, A. E. Wilder-Smith married Beate (17 September 1928 – 15 January 2015), daughter of Rev. Wilhelm Gottwaldt, of [[Breslau]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Name Headings with References, Library of Congress, 1981, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://oconnormortuary.com/obits/beate-wilder-smith&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.librarything.com/author/wildersmithbeate&lt;/ref&gt; She accompanied him through twenty-three moves of their home and rearing of their four children, Oliver, [[Petra Wilder-Smith|Petra]], Clive, and Einar. Each of their children are also professors in their respective medical fields at international universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oconnormortuary.com/obituaries/Beate-Wilder-Smith/#!/Obituary|title=Beate Wilder-Smith Obituary|publisher=oconnormortuary.com|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Wilder-Smith began his education as an atheist. His wife, Beate Wilder-Smith, wrote that Arthur had concluded, "If a loving God really existed, He surely would not have tolerated all the injustice and suffering evident in the world." He became acquainted with [[John Frost (British Army officer)|General Frost]], a devout Christian who challenged Arthur's atheistic worldview. Arthur placed his faith in Christ but continued to struggle intellectually with the difficulties between naturalistic evolution and biblical creation. While studying at Oxford, Arthur became acquainted with [[C. S. Lewis]], a significant influence on Arthur's thought processes and faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilder-Smith|first=A.E.|title=Let Us Reason: Insights on Creation, Suffering, &amp; Evil|year=2007|publisher=The Word For Today|location=Costa Mesa, CA|isbn=9781597510370|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[creationism|creationist]], Dr. Wilder-Smith said there were problems with evolutionary views of the origin of life. This theme is reflected in many of his books including, ''The Creation of Life'' and ''Man's Origin, Man's Destiny''. According to Walter L. Bradley, Dr. Wilder-Smith contended "that the conversion of energy flow into information remains, at present, undemonstrated and without theoretical basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Walter L.|title=No Relevance to the Origin of Life|url=http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/arn/orpages/or101/101brad.htm|work=Access Research Network, vol. 10, no. 1|publisher=Leadership U|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some considered him Europe's leading creationist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Numbers|first=Ronald|title=The Creationists|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and LA|isbn=0-520-08393-8|pages=334, 405–406 n38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not afraid to correct creationists when he believed they were wrong as when he made the comment to Francis Arduini in 1984 that Morris "didn't know a thing about thermodynamics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Numbers|first=Ronald|title=The Creationists|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and LA|isbn=0-520-08393-8|page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1966 he published the book ''Herkunft und Zukunft des Menschen''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliographic Information|url=http://openlibrary.org/search?wisbn=0871233568|publisher=Open Library|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which promoted Burdick's and other's claims that dinosaur and human footprints existed together at [[Paluxy River]]. Wilder-Smith included in his book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilder-Smith|first=A.E.|title=Herkunft und Zukunft des Menschen, 5th ed|year=1980|publisher=Hanssler-Verlag|location=Neuhausen-Stuttgart|isbn=3-7751-0070-9|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/45776454/Herkunft-und-Zukunft-des-Menschen}}&lt;/ref&gt; plates showing the Paluxy site including plates attributed to himself, Burdick and Taylor. With the exception of plate 6 from Burdick all plates claiming to be man tracks were in situ. In the mid-1980s the footprints were shown to be not of human origin, and some specimens were shown to be doctored or carved, in particular the loose blocks attributed to Burdick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuban|first=Glen J.|title=The "Burdick Print"|url=http://paleo.cc/paluxy/wilker6.htm|work=Kuban's Paluxy Website|publisher=Kuban|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy.html|title=Paluxy Dinosaur/"Man Track" controversy|publisher=Talkorigins.org|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Dr. Wilder-Smith published ''The Creation of Life: A Cybernetic Approach to Evolution'' which defended [[William Paley]]'s design argument with computer calculations of the improbability of genetic sequences, which he said could not be explained by evolution but required "the abhorred necessity of divine intelligent activity behind nature," and that "the same problem would be expected to beset the relationship between the designer behind nature and the intelligently designed part of nature known as man." His research and writing were influential in the formation of the [[intelligent design]] movement.&lt;ref name="fands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithandscienceresource.org.uk/reviews/noseriousscientist.html|title=No Serious Scientist...|publisher=Faith and Science Resource|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, intelligent design advocate [[William A. Dembski]] wrote that Wilder-Smith's "intuitive ideas about information has been the impetus for much of my research."&lt;ref name="dembski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.02.Reply_to_Henry_Morris.htm|title=Intelligent Design's Contributions to the Debate Over Evolution: A Reply to Henry Morris|author=William A. Dembski|date=1 February 2005|publisher=Design Inference Website|accessdate=15 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729035206/http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.02.Reply_to_Henry_Morris.htm|archivedate=29 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilder-Smith had never used the phrase "intelligent design" itself. The closest phrasing may be found in his 1968 publication ''Man’s origin, man’s destiny: a critical survey of the principles of evolution and Christianity'', which with its argument that the [[mammary gland]]s in [[whale]]s could not have arisen by chance mutations. Wilder-Smith wrote that (emphasis added) "To deny planning when studying such a system is to strain credulity more than to ask one to believe in an ''intelligent nipple designer'', who incidentally must have understood hydraulics rather well."&lt;ref name="Matzke 007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/the-true-origin.html |title=The true origin of "intelligent design" |author= Nick Matzke |authorlink=Nick Matzke |date= August 14, 2007 |publisher=[[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]] |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1986 [[Oxford Union]] debate, Wilder-Smith and creationist physicist [[Edgar Andrews]] (President of the [[Biblical Creation Society]]) debated creationism with biologists [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[John Maynard Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/audio/721-1986-oxford-union-debate]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907215249/http://richarddawkins.net/audio/721-1986-oxford-union-debate |date=September 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilder-Smith's book ''The Natural Sciences Know Nothing of Evolution'' was published in 1981 by an imprint of Creation-Life Publishing, and reprinted in 1992 by [[Answers in Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Melvindale"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/book/export/html/1447 | title=Analysis of the Melvindale Science Curriculum Sub-Committee Book Recommendations   |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | date=October 30, 1998 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Christiansen, Professor of Biology at [[Grinnell College]], reviewed the book stating "the most fundamental flaw of the book is an apparent confusion or ignorance (it is hard to tell) concerning our present understanding of the evolutionary process." He further noted that Wilder-Smith's work disregarded basic literature in the field discussed.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Christiansen 1992. page 134"&gt;Kenneth Christiansen, "''The Natural Sciences Know Nothing of Evolution'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 134 {{ISBN|0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the book was one of 19 which a public school board in [[Melvindale, Michigan]], voted to purchase for school libraries "to make sure the district was not supporting the theory of evolution as a fact". An analysis by the [[National Center for Science Education]] described the book as "religious doctrine in disguise" promoting the intelligent design argument, with abundant errors typical of creation science, misrepresenting the science of evolution.&lt;ref name="Melvindale" /&gt;

The '''Akan Orthography Committee''' ('''AOC''') was founded for the promotion of the [[Akan language]] and has since created a standard dialect for Akan.

==Orthography==
A standardized writing and orthographic writing system for Akan was completed by the Akan Orthography Committee (AOC) in 1968. Akan languages started to be written down mainly in religious publications by Danish, German and British missionaries during the 17th and 18th centuries. The unified Akan orthography was created during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Akan language"&gt;{{cite book |title=Akan language |first= |last= |publisher= |year= |isbn=|url=http://www.panafril10n.org/index.php/PanAfrLoc/Akan |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education== 
===Primary===
In 1978 the Akan Orthography Committee established a common orthography for all of Akan, which is used as the medium of instruction in [[primary school]].&lt;ref name="Akan language"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Alternation Strategies in Multilingual Settings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language The Alternation Strategies in Multilingual Settings |first=Federica |last=Guerini |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]] |year=2006 |isbn=  0-82048-369-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUHzglM3p7AC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=Akan+Orthography+Committee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WJcsCBXnfl&amp;sig=MJI7ACf9HMe6NABqfnqjNiWsc6I&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Akan%20Orthography%20Committee&amp;f=false |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University===
Akan language is studied in major [[university|universities]] in the United States, including [[Ohio University]], [[Ohio State University]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Harvard University]], [[Boston University]], [[Indiana University]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan University]], and The [[University of Florida]]. Akan has been a regular African language of study in the annual Summer Cooperative African Languages Institute (SCALI) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Akan – Languages|first= |last= |publisher=''[[Rutgers University|amesall.rutgers.edu]]'' |year= |isbn=|url=http://www.amesall.rutgers.edu/languages/128-akan-twi |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anders Sigurd Lange'''  (5 September 1904 – 18 October 1974) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] political organiser, speaker and editor who led his [[eponym]]ously named political party [[Anders Lange's Party for a Strong Reduction in Taxes, Duties and Public Intervention|Anders Lange's Party]] into parliament in 1973.

Educated as a forestry technician, Lange got involved in politics following his stay in [[Argentina]] in the late 1920s. He joined the right-wing [[Fatherland League (Norway)|Fatherland League]] organisation upon his return to Norway in 1929, and he became a popular speaker at public rallies. His provocative style however often led to controversies. Although his agitation was chiefly directed against the political left, he also rejected the efforts of the far-right. He left the organisation in 1938 to join ''Landsforeningen Norges Sjøforsvar'', where he agitated for strengthening the [[Norwegian Armed Forces|Norwegian armed forces]] and warned against the future world war. He was initially blocked from entering the organised [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], but nonetheless did work to assist resistance members, and he was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned twice.

After the war, Lange initially focused on his work as a [[kennel]]-owner, as well as to write and publish his own dog-owner's paper. Although he had pledged to not enter politics again, he became increasingly politically active. He started touring the country to speak at his public rallies, and the paper he published became increasingly political. He was a charismatic right-wing public speaker who first and foremost objected to high [[tax]]es, state-regulations and public [[bureaucracy]]. He gained a considerable following among youth in the 1960s, and their activities included to counter-demonstrate against left-wing demonstrations. Increasingly called upon by his supporters to establish a new political party, it was not until 1973 that he finally agreed to do so. The new party, named Anders Lange's Party (ALP) was founded by popular [[acclamation]] during a public meeting at ''Saga kino''. He successfully entered the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] after the election later the same year, but his new-found political career came to an abrupt end when he died the following year. Lange's political party was reformed and renamed to the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] after his death.

==Early life==
[[File:Anders Lange 1924.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Anders Lange in the Royal Guards in 1924.]]
Anders Sigurd Lange was born in [[Nordstrand, Norway|Nordstrand]], [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] (now a part of [[Oslo]]) to doctor Alf Lange (1869–1929) and Anna Elisabeth Svensson (1873–1955).&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Anders_Lange/utdypning|title=Anders Lange|work=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Forr|last=Gudleiv|authorlink=Gudleiv Forr|accessdate=28 August 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He had two older siblings, Alexander and Karen.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was born in Aker, the family moved to Foss in [[Bjelland]] when he was only six weeks old, owing to his father being appointed district physician for a region consisting of Bjelland, [[Grindheim]] and [[Åseral]]. The Lange family was originally from [[Holstein]] and [[Denmark]], and included several prominent public officials, priests, doctors and businessmen. Lange lived in Foss for his first seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange's parents were divorced in 1911, and Anna Elisabeth moved to [[Bergen]] with her three children. They lived in humble conditions in a guest house in [[Fjøsanger]] for the first two to three years. The family thereafter moved to Kristiania (now named Oslo), settling in [[Skillebekk]].&lt;ref name="Rygnestad 1993, pp. 34"&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anders Lange in Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Anders Lange (seen standing back to the left) in Argentina in the late 1920s.]]

Lange started his secondary education at Vestheim School in 1921, but failed to graduate [[examen artium]]. He subsequently moved to [[Kristiansand]] in 1923, and finished his education at [[Kristiansand Cathedral School]] in 1924. He was not interested in politics in his youth, spending his free time in [[outdoor recreation]] and sports. In Kristiania (Oslo), Lange had played [[Association football|football]] and [[hockey]] for the club [[Mercantile SFK]], and he continued to play football for [[FK Donn]] in Kristiansand. He broke his nose several times during play, giving him his characteristic crooked nose. Lange held his first public speech (albeit a short one), the Kristiansand [[Russefeiring|russ]] speech, on 17 May 1924 in honour of [[Henrik Wergeland]]. He thereafter served in the [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|Royal Guards]] for his [[conscription]] service.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in the military, Lange became interested in forestry after reading the 1923 book ''Skogen og folket'' by [[Christian Gierløff]]. He graduated as a forestry technician at the [[Oddernes]] forestry school in 1926. He had part of his practice in [[Andebu]], and after graduating he continued working there for a local farmer. A cousin of his father later tipped him that he could get work at a forestry school in [[Argentina]], and Lange set out for the country in 1927. He went to port in [[Buenos Aires]], got in connection with Kristiansand-based Norwegians, and travelled north to [[Tartagal, Salta|Tartagal]] near the border to [[Paraguay]]. He became engaged with the Saco company, and headed a work team of 15 men. Lange had also brought with him football equipment to the country, and he became known by the locals as "Don André". Lange lived in Argentina from November 1927 to June 1929, when he went home with his father's casket, his father having died of a heart attack when visiting Lange at his office in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

===Interwar period===
Lange began his political career in the Norwegian right-wing [[Fatherland League (Norway)|Fatherland League]] organisation, which had been founded in 1925 by prominent figures such as [[Christian Michelsen]] and [[Fridtjof Nansen]]. Lange received a letter from writer [[Olaf Benneche]], supplemented with a letter from Nansen requesting him to come back to Norway and join the anti-communist movement, and he was invited to Nansen's property [[Polhøgda|Polhøiden]].&lt;ref&gt;Eide, 1974, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lange himself, it was communism that shaped his views. He had read about communism since his youth, and concluded that it was a "poison" that would destroy humans, take away their liberties and relinquish the independence of nations.&lt;ref&gt;Eide, 1974, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange had also noted the stark political conflicts in Argentina during his stay in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; His experience as an emigrant had led him to debunk what he saw as the left's negative view of patriotism (''fedrelandskjærlighet''). The growth of the left-wing [[labour movement]] at the same time caused a polarisation of Norwegian politics, and the Fatherland League's stated aim was to unite the political right against left-wing revolutionaries. Lange became secretary of the Fatherland League's [[Agder]] branch in 1929, and marked himself in the first year by writing op-eds in newspapers and speaking at public rallies.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 46–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fedrelandslaget 1932.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Representatives for the Fatherland League in 1932; Anders Lange sits as number two from the left in the front row.]]
In early 1933, when [[Vidkun Quisling]] was Defence Minister, Lange was scheduled to host him at a public rally that was endorsed by the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Agrarian Party]] (of which Quisling was a member at the time). The event led Lange to get a complete distaste of him. Lange was set to drive Quisling to the rally, and already when they met Lange noted that Quisling seemed "as distracted as a [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]," and that his handshake was "as limp as a sponge." Quisling did reportedly not say a single word during the five-mile drive to the rally, and his speech was a disaster due to his failure to speak audibly (he would not use a microphone). At the Fatherland League's subsequent national convention in 1933, a faction sought to tie the organisation closer to Quisling's then-newly founded party, but Lange loudly opposed the proposal and attacked Quisling as "the worst Defence Minister this country has ever had." Quisling left the Fatherland League following the convention. Although accused by the left of [[fascism]], Lange distanced himself from the ideology, and instead considered it to "live on" through [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange's later activities consisted mainly of holding public rallies, and his provocative style often got him into physical altercations with left-wing labour activists. His most controversial stunt was in 1935, when he sought to "demonstrate" the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]'s attitude towards the existing society. Inspired by an earlier stunt of the [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Labour Party's youth organisation]] (AUF), Lange demonstratively stood above a volunteer soaked in pig's blood, lying over a truck, and "threatening" him with a hammer. The stunt led to clashes with AUF activists (Lange eventually broke his jaw), and as Lange's stunt had not been approved by neither the Fatherland League's local branch nor its central leadership, Lange was transferred to Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 56–59.&lt;/ref&gt; He then held the position as national leader of the Fatherland League's youth organisation from 1935 to 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange was considered a great speaker, and his rhetoric changed between being largely gentle or more vulgar. During a 1935 speech, Lange warned against both socialism and [[Nazism]], often alleging the "dictatorial tendencies" he saw in the Labour Party. He in turn criticised Norway for being "ripe for dictatorship," owing to Norwegians having "stopped thinking" and uncritically accepted "supervisory boards, editorials, propaganda and dozy parliamentarians."&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange travelled through most of the country to hold speeches, including [[Northern Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange left the Fatherland League at the end of 1938, and joined ''Landsforeningen Norges Sjøforsvar'' ("Country Confederation for the Naval Defense of Norway") as its general secretary. The organisation's purpose was to inform about the importance for Norway of the sea, and thus of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy|Norwegian navy]]. Lange continued to travel around the country in order to show films and hold speeches. He agitated for strengthening the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]], and increasingly warned against a possible world war, and how Norway could be pulled into it. Lange was dejected that the authorities did not take him seriously, and left-wing activists continued to disturb his meetings. He showed up at the last meeting of the organisation on 6 or 7 April 1940 with a [[Krag-Jørgensen]] rifle, telling the audience to "get ready for war," and asking rhetorically when Norway would arm its forces. Lange travelled to the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] on 8 April 1940, and begged Labour Party MP [[Torvald Haavardstad]] to mobilise the Norwegian army. Haavardstad in turn responded that Lange should quit "this hysterical defence talk."&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
On 9 April 1940, Norway was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]]. Part of the background for Lange's predictions about the future war was the letters he sent to several foreign heads of state, including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. He asked in a letter what Hitler's plans were with his "Third Reich", and received response from German authorities that "Nazi Germany will triumph on all fronts." Lange had several [[Jew]]ish friends, and considered their situation to be under such threat in 1939/40 that he thought they should escape before a German invasion of Norway. He managed to reserve 100 seats on the [[Norwegian America Line]] for Jews to escape, but none of the seats were taken.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange and several of his friends from the Fatherland League were eager to join the resistance forces of the [[Norwegian Campaign]], and they set out to [[Nordmarka]] on [[ski]]s on 10 April. Lange had with him a machine gun and 1,000 bullets, but was forced to turn his weapon in when they met other resistance members. He was considered to be "not reliable" on account of his time in the Fatherland League, and he was left to ski back to Oslo. Lange became dejected and bitter as a result of his treatment, and he was left to think that the Labour Party, which he had criticised for not arming the defence before the invasion, had now also taken over control of Nordmarka.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange was imprisoned at [[Møllergata 19]] in September 1940 for getting into a fight at [[Theatercaféen]] with [[Eyvind Mehle]], an associate of Vidkun Quisling. The incident happened the day after Mehle had attacked [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] in a speech. Lange refused to greet Mehle when he came past his table, responding that "I don't greet Norway's greatest turd in another way than this," and then slapped Mehle in the face. Lange thereafter grabbed Mehle and threw him through a door twice. Lange refused to apologise to Mehle, and was captured by German police the following day. Lange was imprisoned for four months, and was released in early 1941. His house was searched several times by the [[Gestapo]] when he was in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 72–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Kristian Ottosen|Ottosen, Kristian]]|title=Nordmenn i fangenskap 1940–1945|edition=2nd|year=2004|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-15-00288-9|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions, Lange and his family also hid Norwegians who planned to escape to [[Sweden]] in their house. Following his release from prison, Lange assisted resistance members with information work. He thus came under investigation by the police, as he was "known for being an opponent of [[Nasjonal Samling|NS]]." In 1942 he was captured and imprisoned once more at Møllergata 19 after his house was raided by German police.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 76–80.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his times in prison that Lange started thinking seriously about practical politics. He was according to himself not tortured or abused in prison, but to his satisfaction he was left alone to just read books and think.&lt;ref&gt;Eide, 1974, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar years===
For the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1945|1945 parliamentary election]], Lange was offered to run for election by the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]], the Agrarian Party and the Labour Party, but he turned the offers down.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange instead started working as the secretary of ''Norsk Kennel Klubb'', a Norwegian dog-owner's club. He was also hired as a columnist in ''[[Morgenbladet]]'', writing about the dog community every Monday. Lange moved to [[Svartskog]], [[Oppegård]] with his family in late 1946, where he started working to establish a [[kennel]]. He thereafter quit his engagement for ''Morgenbladet'' as he started his own paper instead, ''Hundeavisen'' (lit. "dog paper").&lt;ref name="Rygnestad 1993, pp. 86"&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 86–89.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, there were no independent publications such as this for the dog community, and Lange went to great lengths to spread news about his paper. He (helped by his family) sent about 75,000 letters to dog owners, institutions and dog associations throughout the country, informing them about the new paper. The first issue was published in June 1948. He maintained that politics were to be "banished" from the paper, except for issues directly related to the dog community; he thus criticised the tax on dog-keeping, and the ban on dogs in Oslo tenements.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 91–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lange had promised to quit politics after the war, he sought to restart the Country Confederation for the Naval Defense of Norway by late 1947. He thought that the [[Gerhardsen's Second Cabinet|Labour Party government]] had returned to the pre-war negligence of the Norwegian defence, and that it was a "tactic" by the "communists" in order to allow the [[Soviet Union]] to grow itself stronger. His attempt to start the organisation again did however not materialise. Instead of this, one of the main issues for Lange until the early 1950s was to agitate for [[animal rights]]. This in turn led him back to his earlier issues of criticising [[bureaucracy]], [[state capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. He arranged a public meeting at [[Youngstorget]] for the first time in 1950, and was thereafter sponsored by an anonymous group to hold one hundred political speeches throughout the country. One time he gathered a crowd of 19,000 people on Youngstorget, who started chanting "Anders Lange, Norway needs you, Norway needs you." Lange himself was rather startled by the event, as he thought it recollected pre-war [[Cult of personality|personality cults]]. He stopped touring in 1953 due to financial problems. He also stopped publishing the paper ''Hundeavisen'' in September 1953, as one of his associates had embezzled {{NOK|70,000}} from the paper's funding. Although Lange got most of the money back, the paper was not published for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange had great oratory talents, and he liked to consider himself a "[[Demagogy|demagogue]]" in the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] sense of the word. Lange planned a massive campaign with public speeches after the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1953|1953 parliamentary election]], but he was not able to raise the necessary funding. He largely stopped his political activities until 1959, when he again planned speeches at Youngstorget.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange was often encouraged to start a political party during the 1950s, but he did not endorse the idea then.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lange kept contacts with all kinds of people, it was his contacts with businessmen and [[ship-owner]]s that provided him with funds to keep up his political activities.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, Lange was an immensely popular lecturer at secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained a considerable following among youth, and his followers were popularly called ''hundeguttene'', the "dog boys." They were often from the right-wing of the [[Norwegian Young Conservatives|Young Conservatives]], and they joined Lange for counter-demonstrations against meetings of the [[Socialist People's Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]], [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] demonstrations, and protests against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1960 the first issue of ''Hundeavisen'' was published after seven years. The paper, which originally was about dogs and animals, soon took a radical turn. The name of the paper was changed to ''Anders Langes Avis'' (Anders Lange's Newspaper) in 1962, and it gradually became increasingly political. In its last years it had turned into a solely political paper.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 124–127.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 Lange founded the "Independence Party", but he did not register it publicly. Some of the issues for the "party" was to abolish direct taxes, sell state-owned companies, drastic cuts in public expenses, delegate tasks away from municipalities to the state, abandon the welfare system and cover it over the state budget, and revoke public employees' right to vote and run for parliament. The party held a counter-demonstration against a demonstration against the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in Oslo in November 1962, and they handed out flyers in support of US President [[John F. Kennedy]]. The party changed name several times, to the "Independence Movement" in 1963, to the "Freedom Party" in 1965, and a few months later to "Anders Lange's Freedom Movement."&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 127–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anders Lange's Party ===
By the end of 1972 Lange felt a growing support for his views, and he was again asked to start a new political party. He nonetheless questioned if he had become too old, and he initially rejected the idea. Towards 1973 he however increasingly felt a revival of the time from the Fatherland League, and he became sufficiently inspired to start seriously discuss creating a new party.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April 1973, Lange held a public meeting at the cinema ''Saga kino'', which eventually turned into the founding meeting of a new party. Norwegian politics was in turmoil at the time, with voters disaffected six months after the [[Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972|Norwegian EC membership referendum]] and generally disgruntled with the mainstream centre-right as a viable alternative to the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange held a two-hour speech at ''Saga kino'', which resulted in the establishment of Anders Lange's Party for a Strong Reduction in Taxes, Duties and Public Intervention; usually shortened to Anders Lange's Party (ALP).&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The issues promoted before the meeting concerned taxes, regulations, alcohol policies, private property, reduction in foreign aid as well as the political leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange thereafter again started touring and speaking at public rallies; he did not use a manuscript for his speeches. On 5 May, a crowd of 5,000 people turned up at Youngstorget to listen to Lange and his Danish counterpart [[Mogens Glistrup]].&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; On his first appearance in a political television debate, Lange showed up with a bottle of egg liqueur and a [[Viking sword]] he had received from [[Geirr Tveitt]], and his appearance in the debate became a success.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange was not a big drinker, but he used egg liqueur during speeches to clear his throat. His use of the drink nonetheless led sales of [[Advocaat]] to soar.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange finally entered the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] after the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1973|1973 parliamentary election]], together with three other representatives from his party. Lange set a record of speeches during his first year in parliament, speaking more than any other representative. He was elected into the Consumer and Administration Committee, which he dismissed as a redundant entity.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in parliament he came on good terms with politicians from all parties. Lange said he only felt hostility from [[Kåre Willoch]], leader of the Conservative Party, whose presence he considered to "fill the room with hate;"&lt;ref&gt;Eide, 1974, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Willoch had expressed little respect for Lange before the 1973 election, labeling him as a "mad-man" and agitator without visions.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange had originally intended to create a popular movement rather than a political party,&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and an internal conflict erupted over the nature of the party. Lange favoured the superiority of the parliamentary group instead of the party organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The wing led by [[Carl I. Hagen]] and [[Kristoffer Almås]] wanted a more effective party structure, and even wished to throw Lange as leader and change the party's name. After increasing pressure, during the party's first regular national convention in [[Hjelmeland]] in January 1974, Lange and his deputy [[Erik Gjems-Onstad]] were forced to give concessions that gave ALP the outlines of a regular party.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange however continued voicing his opposition against the new development, while Hagen and Almås maintained their views on the leadership and naming issues. After initially indicating that he would grant Hagen his wish of being hired as party secretary, Lange later stated in ''[[Dagbladet]]'' that Hagen only would be hired "over my dead body."&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict led Hagen and Almås to leave ALP in July, and Almås went on to form the [[Reform Party (Norway, 1974)|Reform Party]] with Hagen as a passive member. The conflict was not resolved until October 1974, when Anders Lange died of heart failure following a heart attack. As Hagen had been elected as Lange's parliamentary deputy in 1973 he took over Lange's place as member of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, pp. 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagen later became leader of the party and reformed it as the Progress Party. As the party had grown to become the second largest in Norway, an oil painting portraying Lange was in 2005 put up and unveiled in the big conference room in the Norwegian parliament by Hagen and future leader [[Siv Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Hegtun, Halvor| title=På veggen før sin avgang| url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/Pa-veggen-for-sin-avgang-6578528.html| work=Aftenposten| date=10 September 2008| language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Lange supported the economic policies of [[Milton Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned in 1973 about who his "favourite hero" was, Lange responded [[Ayn Rand]].&lt;ref name=aft73&gt;{{cite news|title=Sommerportrettet: Stå på egne ben ikke på andres|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=49767&amp;page=8&amp;query=fedrelandslaget&amp;date=7.8.1973|date=7 August 1973|accessdate=3 March 2011|language=Norwegian|page=8|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that his motto was "stand on your own feet, and not on others'."&lt;ref name=aft73/&gt; Lange voted in favour of the [[European Economic Community]] (mostly for military reasons), but he was satisfied that Norway did not join it following the [[Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972|1972 referendum]]. This was as he expressed concern that the EEC would likely develop into a massive bureaucracy, and that [[France]] in his mind probably would misuse it due to the French "need to dominate."&lt;ref&gt;Eide, 1974, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guttorm Hansen]], who was the President of the [[Parliament of Norway]] when Lange was a Member of Parliament, once said that he believed Lange's apparent goal was to "make [Parliament] into a political [[circus]] with himself as the main [[clown]]." Lange said many unexpected things in Parliament.  He once bragged about his own [[Virility|potency]], and another time spoke about how much [[moonshine]] he had consumed in his lifetime, and how terrible it was. He was also censored for the use of unparliamentary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stortinget.no/no/Stortinget-og-demokratiet/Historikk/Tilbakeblikk-pa-stortingsspraket/|work=Stortinget.no|title=En vandring langs Memory Lane – et liv med stortingsord|first=Mona|last=Engh|date=13 January 2009|accessdate=29 August 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anders Lange wrote in 1963: "Everyone who claims black majority rule in South Africa are traitors of the white race".
Means Lange was a racist: Quotes (Lange): No vote rights for negroes; Stop mixed marriages, No humanitarian aid for blacks.
[&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/viser-hoyresidas-florting-med-fascisme-og-diktatur/63423107&lt;/ref&gt; ]

==African relations==
Starting in 1962, Lange began promoting [[South Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]] in his paper. One of his main motivations was fears that the countries would turn communist, and he was critical of what he considered to be a one-sided and biased presentation of the conditions in the countries.&lt;ref name="rk159"/&gt; He also had several Norwegian friends in South Africa who traded and did business in the country, and who also considered information about the country in Norway to be naïve and one-sided.&lt;ref name="rk160"&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange said that he received his information about the countries from numerous Norwegian, American and African magazines.&lt;ref name="rk159"&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange was on several occasions visited by South Africans in Norway, both friends of Norwegian ancestry and people with central positions in the country, including General Charles Edward More.&lt;ref name="rk171"&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange and his wife Karin visited the country in early 1972 for three weeks, the trip having been arranged by long-time family friend Major John M. Gray. Their flight was welcomed by government representatives at an airport 50 kilometers outside [[Pretoria]], and he met with prominent figures such as head of the Department of Information [[Eschel Rhoodie]]. He also met the leader of the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]], a party Lange praised for being the purest capitalist party in the world. He was also impressed with what he saw in the country, including the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] chiefs he met.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 166–169.&lt;/ref&gt; Lange also advocated that Norway should recognize [[Ian Smith]]'s Rhodesia, an internationally unrecognized state. He wrote to Smith that ''Anders Langes Avis'' was the only paper in Norway that consistently supported his regime and sent issues of his paper to the Rhodesian Department of External Services. In response his paper received greetings and thanks from Smith and Rhodesian government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 164–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1979 as part of the [[Muldergate Scandal]], the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that Lange and ALP had received 180,000 NOK from a secret South African fund. In December 1981, Gordon Winther claimed that ALP and Lange had received about 400,000 NOK since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt; People who had been close to Lange however rejected that he had received money from the South African government.&lt;ref name="rk175"&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter from 1967, Lange however notes that he would be delighted if he would get funds from South Africa (which he in any event had not received by that time), while another anonymous person who had been close to Lange claimed that he did indeed receive money, even to the point that it saved him from financial ruin.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lange married Anne-Marie Bach-Evensen (1906–1967) in 1930.&lt;ref name="snl"/&gt; They had exchanged letters when Lange was in Argentina, and became a couple soon after his return to Kristiansand, where she lived. They had three children.&lt;ref name="Rygnestad 1993, pp. 34"/&gt; Anne-Marie got diabetes right before the German invasion, and she became very ill. This left Lange with more responsibilities of keeping in charge of their house and children. Although the family was poorly off itself during the war, they regularly invited homeless people into their house for oatmeal soup.&lt;ref name=rk72/&gt; Lange and his family moved to a farm in [[Tomter]], [[Østfold]], where they rented a house from October 1941 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Lange was hired as forest manager for the [[Løvenskiold (noble family)|Løvenskiold]] family, and worked at their estate for two years.&lt;ref name=rk72&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederik Macody Lund]], who had died in 1943, had long considered Lange to be his "adoptive son" as he had no children himself. As his first wife Augusta died in 1946, Lange inherited [[Svartskog]] in [[Oppegård]], an 80 [[Hectare#Decare|decare]] forest property. There, he established a kennel which he named ''[[:nb:Frederik Macody Lund|Macody Lunds]] Minde-Vildmark'', in honour of his late patron.&lt;ref name="Rygnestad 1993, pp. 86"/&gt; In 1949 Lange however started seeing his neighbours' 21-year-old nanny. He filed for divorce from his wife Anne-Marie at the end of 1950, and the divorce was finalised on 18 February 1952. Lange thus moved from Svartskog, leaving it to Anne-Marie, and planned to marry his new girlfriend. They were engaged in 1951, but the relationship fast broke apart. Lange thereafter met Karin Thurmann-Moe (1927–1978), and they married on 17 June 1952, just two months after they first met.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 100–104.&lt;/ref&gt; They had one child.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1952 Lange bought a 22 decare farm with a kennel, Trollstein in [[Heggedal]], [[Asker]]. He received financial support to buy the property from a circle around the libertarian organisation [[Libertas (Norway)|Libertas]]. In addition to dogs, they had geese, hens, cows and pigs at Trollstein, and they grew potatoes and vegetables for their own use.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1972, Lange unsuccessfully sought appointment as the broadcast manager of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;

Anders Lange died of [[heart failure]] at [[Bærum Hospital]] on 18 October 1974, following a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Asker Station]] on 10 October.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association pour la Taxation des Transactions financières et pour l'Action Citoyenne''' ('''''Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions and Citizen's Action''''', '''ATTAC''') is an activist organisation originally created for promoting the establishment of a tax on [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] transactions.

==Background==
Originally called "Action for a Tobin Tax to Assist the Citizen", ATTAC was a [[single-issue movement]] demanding the introduction of the so-called [[Tobin tax]] on [[currency]] [[speculation]].&lt;ref name=Moberg&gt;[On the ATTAC: A new European alternative to globalisation, David Moberg, These Times magazine, May 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; ATTAC has enlarged its scope to a wide range of issues related to [[globalisation]], and monitoring the decisions of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD,) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). ATTAC representatives attend the meetings of the [[G8]] with the goal of influencing policymakers' decisions. Attac spokesmen recently criticised [[Germany]] for what it called the criminalisation of anti-G8 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EFC22DAF-E4DF-4E86-A850-0D3E2F67E81C.htm |title=German police raid G8 opponents |accessdate=2007-05-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070512012829/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EFC22DAF-E4DF-4E86-A850-0D3E2F67E81C.htm| archivedate= 12 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the founding, ATTAC had specific statutory objectives based on the promotion of the Tobin tax. For example, ATTAC [[Luxembourg]] specifies in article 1 of its statutes that it 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"aims to produce and communicate information, and to promote and carry out activities of all kinds for the recapture, by the citizens, of the power that the financial sector has on all aspects of political, economic, social and cultural life throughout the world. Such means include the taxation of transactions in foreign exchange markets (Tobin tax)."&lt;ref name=LLUX&gt;[http://www.etat.lu/memorial/2000/C/Pdf/c0470047.pdf#Page=42 ''Luxembourg Official Journal'', p. 42, ATTAC Statutes (Translated from French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ATTAC refutes claims that it is an [[anti-globalisation movement]], but it criticises the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal ideology]] that it sees as dominating economic globalisation. It supports those globalisation policies that their representatives characterise as [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] and [[Social justice|socially just]].&lt;ref name=Moberg /&gt; One of ATTAC's slogans is "The World is not for sale", denouncing the "[[Merchandization|merchandisation]]" of society. Another slogan is "Another world is possible", pointing to an alternative globalisation in which people and not profit is in focus.

===James Tobin opposing ATTAC===
Attac was founded to promote the [[Tobin tax]] by the [[Keynesian]] economist [[James Tobin]]. Tobin has said that Attac has misused his name. He says he has nothing in common with their goals and supports [[free trade]] — "everything that these movements are attacking. They're misusing my name." &lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;[http://www.econ.yale.edu/news/tobin/jt_01-09-02_ds_misusing-name.htm "They Are Misusing My Name"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928082207/http://www.econ.yale.edu/news/tobin/jt_01-09-02_ds_misusing-name.htm |date=September 28, 2011 }}, an interview with James Tobin, ''Der Spiegel'', 03 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational history==
In December 1997, [[Ignacio Ramonet]] wrote in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' an editorial&lt;ref name="Disarming the markets"/&gt; in which he advocated the establishment of the [[Tobin tax]] and the creation of an organisation to pressure governments around the world to introduce the tax.  ATTAC was created on June 3, 1998, during a constitutive assembly in [[France]].  While it was founded in France it now exists in over forty countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attac.org/about/map ATTAC chapters around the world]&lt;/ref&gt;  In France, politicians from the left  are members of the association. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  In Luxembourg, [[Francois Bausch]] of the left Green party is the founding politician in the association's initial member list.&lt;ref name=LLUX /&gt;

ATTAC functions on a principle of [[decentralisation]]: local associations organise meetings, conferences, and compose documents that become counter-arguments to the perceived neoliberal discourse. ATTAC aims to formalise the possibility of an alternative to the neoliberal society that is currently required of globalisation. ATTAC aspires to be a movement of popular education.

==Views on Attac and its members in different countries==

=== Finland ===
Communist [[Juhani Lohikoski]], previously a chairman of [[Communist Youth League]] and [[Socialist League (Finland)|Socialist League]], served as the chairman of Finnish Attac for two terms (2002 - 2004). [[Yrjö Hakanen]], chairman of the [[Communist Party of Finland (1997)|Communist Party of Finland]], was a member of the board and a member of the founding committee. In March 2002 [[Aimo Kairamo]], the long-time chief editor of the party organ of the Social Democrat Party, resigned from Attac and recommended the same decision for other social democrats because of the left-wing minority communists' leading positions. Soon also the social democrat foreign minister [[Erkki Tuomioja]] considered to follow Kairamo's example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2002/04/107087 Tuomioja eroaa Attacista?] MTV3.fi, 03.04.2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
Researcher Malin Gawell covers the birth and development of Attac Sweden in her doctoral thesis on activist entrepreneurship. She suggests that Attac in Sweden was formed by people seeking a new way of organising with flat hierarchy, and with the strongly sensed need of making a change as the driving force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:189996/FULLTEXT01 Gawell, Malin (2006). Activist entrepreneurship: attac'ing norms and articulating disclosive stories. Diss. Stockholm : Stockholms universitet, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From another perspective, [[Sydsvenskan]] newspaper suggested that the downturn of memberships in Swedish Attac after the hype in the beginning of 2001 may be due to its views on trade policies.&lt;ref name=syds191&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071006032639/http://sydsvenskan.se/opinion/huvudledare/article57740.ece Det goda livet], [[Sydsvenskan]], pääkirjoitus 19.1.2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and activities==
The main issues covered by ATTAC today are:{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* Control of financial markets (e.g., Tobin tax)
* "Fair" instead of "free" trade, via democratic control of the [[World Trade Organization]] and international financial institutions such the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Worldbank]], [[European Union]], [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]], and [[G8]].
* Defense of public goods - air, water, information
* Defense of public social services - like those relevant to health, social services, and [[social security]].  For example, it is against the [[privatisation]] of [[pension]]s and of the [[health care system]].  ATTAC has also taken a position on genetically modified organisms.  ATTAC also opposes [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]].
* The struggle to end tax evasion ([[corporate haven|tax havens]]) as practiced by transnational corporations and rich individuals
* Sustainable globalisation
* Cancellation of the [[debt of Developing Countries]].
* ATTAC campaigned against the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]].
* ATTAC is involved in fighting against [[climate change]], for [[environmental justice]] and, especially, in supporting [[Alternatiba, Village of Alternatives]].

In France, ATTAC associates with many other [[left-wing]] causes.

==Nestlégate==
In the year 2008 Attac [[Switzerland]] was hit by a scandal which was later called Nestlégate by the local media. Between the years 2003 and 2005, the Swiss multinational food and beverage company [[Nestlé]], engaged the external Security company [[Securitas AG]], to spy on the Swiss Attac branch. Nestlé started the monitoring, when Attac Switzerland decided to work on a critical book about Nestlé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klawitter|first1=Nils|title=Spitzel-Affäre um Nestlé|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/spitzel-affaere-um-nestle-das-war-klassisches-profiling-a-811608.html|accessdate=6 April 2015|publisher=Spiegel.de|date=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Nestlégate, Attac Switzerland filed a lawsuit against Nestlé which was decided in favour of Attac in January 2013, as the personal rights of the observed were violated. They received a compensation for damages of 3'000 [[Swiss francs]] each, which has an equivalent of about 3'230 USD at the date of the proclamation of sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Attac Schweiz |title=Nestlégate: Voller Erfolg im Zivilprozess gegen Nestlé und Securitas |url=http://www.attac-netzwerk.de/das-netzwerk/internationales/die-ag-internationales/regionen/europa/schweiz/20130125-attac-schweiz-nestlegate/ |website=Attac Netzwerk |accessdate=6 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411123451/http://www.attac-netzwerk.de/das-netzwerk/internationales/die-ag-internationales/regionen/europa/schweiz/20130125-attac-schweiz-nestlegate/ |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Auroville Village Action Group''' (AVAG) is a [[non-governmental organization]] based in Irumbai which is situated close to [[Auroville]] in the [[Villupuram district]], located in [[Tamil Nadu]], India. It is committed to [[grass roots]] community building together with the local villages in the Villupuram district on different development areas, namely [[community development]], [[economic development]], [[capacity building]], and [[psychosocial support]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://villageaction.in | title = About AVAG | publisher = AVAG}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all those four areas, the ultimate goal is to "realize the inherent capability of human beings for self-empowerment [and to] provide the proper resources to build a healthy life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://villageaction.in/what-we-do/ | title = AVAG's goals | publisher = AVAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Founded in 1983, it nowadays incorporates [[micro finance]] projects, capacity building trainings and seminars, psychological and physical health initiatives, [[livelihood]] trainings and [[social enterprise]] trainings, [[caste]] integration exchange programs, and exposure field trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://villageaction.in/what-we-do/ | title = AVAG's tools | publisher = AVAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and values==
AVAG collaborates with all sectors of society to bring about a holistic and participatory village transformation where the villagers are the main acting force. AVAG sees its main role as enabling the beneficiaries to become more self-empowered. It places relationships between human beings and their behaviors, traditions and prejudices at the foundation of its programs and work with villagers, following the central goal of gender and cast equality. Solidarity and cooperation are also important values to AVAG.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://de.scribd.com/doc/102333132/AVAG-2011-2012-Annual-Report | title = Annual Report 2011-2012 | publisher = AVAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
In July 2000, the '''Auroville Village Action Trust''' developed out of AVAG's diverse activities in order to them better. Since then, AVAG is a part of this trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.auroville.org/contents/1635 | title = information on the Auroville Village Action Trust | publisher = auroville.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five [[trustees]] from [[Auroville]] oversee the running of the organization and ensure that it operates according to its statutes. They are made up out of three executives and the two directors Anbu and Moris – a wife and husband team of professional social workers, who have been responsible for AVAG activities and organizational development since 1988.

Field work is carried out by a team of 6 development workers who themselves come from Vanur block and are deeply familiar with the ground realities. They receive special training and are often the direct link between the trustees and direct beneficiaries. Additionally, 2 vocational trainers and a team of 8 support staff make up the rest of the AVAG team. AVAG regularly hosts students, interns and volunteers from abroad who assist in all aspects of programs delivery.
The immediate [[beneficiaries]] are the members of the women and men [[self-help groups]] (SHGs), who usually meet twice a month to discuss loans and personal issues or to receive training. Every SHG elects an animator and two representatives each month.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Work==
To combat gender inequity, poverty and limited access to resources for development, AVAG executes a multifaceted community development program, executed through a structure of nearly 300 SHGs and Federations, with around 4500 women and 600 men, which promote micro credit, community service, social enterprise development and education. Psychosocial support and capacity building are usually given by AVAG to the federation members and self-help group members in addition.

===Programs===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://vimeo.com/7701113 | title = Women's Empowerment at Auroville Village Action Group | publisher = Lesley Branagan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community development====
Activities that fall under this category are those that improve infrastructure, get access to resources and analyze and challenge long held assumptions on various social issues such as patriarchal and caste systems.

=====Exchange programs=====
Members of different villages and castes spend a day together to break down traditional barriers of gender, caste, social status, and geographic isolation.

=====Work camps and micro projects=====
AVAG partners with villagers to make small, one-time investments to support the self-help groups in planning and submitting solutions for minor physical infrastructure problems in their rural communities.

=====Government schemes=====
AVAG seeks to empower members by helping them understand and access resources provided by government schemes, including Life Insurance coverage, pension schemes and scholarships for students in grades 9th-12th.

=====Service and awareness camps=====
Camps are organized by the SHGs to improve access to healthcare services for poorest members, spread awareness about menstrual hygiene, oral and eye care.

=====Events and community celebrations=====
SHGs together with locally elected panchayats have started to arrange public meetings on important days relevant to them, for which both men and women organize events and give performances.

=====Eco-friendly products for villagers=====
A store is located on AVAG premises and provides access to affordable echo-friendly technologies suitable for rural communities, such as  spirulina supplements, energy powder, CFL bulbs, activated EM, low-cost water filters, and solar-powered devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XB_v9FBp8A | title = EcoLife Stores | publisher = Aneri Patel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Housing for the poor=====
AVAG organizes projects to repair houses of those extremely impoverished families identified by SHGs who cannot afford repairs on their own. AVAG finances 75% of the project while the families themselves are responsible for the repairs.

====Capacity building====
This programme aims at expanding the vision and ability of each individual and providing the tools needed to participate in societal development.

=====Seminars=====
AVAG organizes a day-long seminar each month for SHG members, aimed at increasing awareness about topics such as government schemes, gender and caste issues, water, sanitation, waste management and global warming.

=====Meetings=====
One type of meeting AVAG has are the '''strengthening meetings'''. They support new SHGs as well as the clubs that need assistance with their activities. These meetings also help existing SHGs progress, and resolve internal problems by discussing the importance of unity and cooperation.
Another type of meeting are the '''cluster meetings''', which are held with representatives from SHGs to discuss common issues in the women's area and give clarity to the guidelines of the clubs, as well as create a platform for different clubs to interact, share ideas and foster solidarity.

=====Exposure and field trips=====
These trips are meant for the members to experience other parts of the surrounding areas and to get involved in new techniques like vermicomposting or gardening.

=====Trainings=====
One department getting trained are the '''federation members'''. They participate in mixed-gender exposure trips and workshops that cover subjects such as leadership, caste, domestic violence, environmental awareness and gender, and sometimes also psychosocial aspects. The elected '''animator and two representatives''' of each SHG also receive training in the form of exposure to social issues and educational programs to increase leadership capacities.

====Economic development====
Through revolving funds and a savings program, as well as by providing access to flexible, needs based, ethical financial institutions, income generation is created.

=====Financial inclusion program=====
Within the AVAG network, SHG members can take loans from several places, most importantly internally from the monthly savings of members of AVAG's SHGs. Externally,  SHGs are helped to get loans from the banks, revolving funds of the Federation and AVAG.

=====AVAG Micro Finance Project=====
Based on a grant from the German Ministry for Economic Development and Cooperation ([[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|BMZ]]),  a revolving fund was created to meet the demand for micro-credits for the purposes of businesses, agriculture, education, housing, social functions, as well as to pay back the very high interest loans from the moneylenders. The higher objective was to combat poverty by micro-credits to women self-help groups.

=====Social enterprise initiatives and livelihood training programs=====
AVAG offers a large number of trainings, and creates self-employment opportunities for members of women's SHGs. Together with the '''Sustainable Enterprise Development in the Auroville Bioregion''' (SEDAB) project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://sedabblog.wordpress.com/about/ | title = Sustainable Enterprise Development in the Auroville Bioregion blog | publisher = SEDAB}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of a wider Integral Rural Development vision for the bioregion, the goal is to provide sustainable livelihood options for women in villages in and around Auroville.
Several different products are being produced and sold as part of the social enterprise initiative, such as clothes and accessories and crocheted life style products, like toys and lamps, and accessories (under AVAG's own brand '''Aval'''), herbal beauty products, spirulina capsules (under the brand '''Surya'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://sedabblog.wordpress.com/76-2/ | title = SEDAB Surya production | publisher = SEDAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and hammocks with support and teaching from outside of AVAG.

=====Marketing initiatives=====
SHGs products are now being sold in several shops around Auroville and [[Pondicherry]], as well as in women self-help group exhibitions in Pondicherry and [[Chennai]], organized by the Tamil Nadu Government.

====Psychosocial support====
This program aims to protect and support the emotional, mental, spiritual, and physical health of all individuals.

=====Counseling and mediation=====
AVAG offers counseling services to individuals who have difficulty coping with some part of their lives.  In addition to counseling, AVAG helps connect those in need with government services and other relevant organizations.

=====De-addiction services=====
Some SHG members are trained to spread awareness of the disease and treatment options and to identify cases and send them for rehabilitation services.

===Funding===
AVAG has varying supporters, also relying on individual donors.
The [[Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung|BMZ]] gives AVAG a notable supporting sum each year under the Verein zur Förderung der Auroville-Region (VFAVR), affiliated with AVI Germany. They also supported the issue of the AVVAI scheme. Other funding partners are the '''Village Outreach Society''' of Canada and the United Kingdom, who have supported Eco Femme, AVAG's exchange programs and the solar lantern project of the EcoLife store.
'''World Dignity, Inc.'''(WDI),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.worlddignity.com/ | title = WDI webpage | publisher = World Dignity, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization working internationally to build on the strength, resilience, culture and wisdom of all people, created  the '''AVAG/WDI Education Revolving Fund''' to help financially poor club members pay for their children's higher education through loans or grants together with AVAG.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Auroville Village Action Group | title = Annual Report 2014-2015 | year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Motherson Sumi Systems Limited''' has given a 1 Crore grant towards a project increasing access to education for poor girls in June 2015 as part of their [[Corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.auroville.org/contents/3901 | title = Article on Promoting Poor Girl's Education In the Villages | publisher = Auroville Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
In '''1983''', AVAG was founded by Bhavana Dee Decew "to act as a bridge between [Auroville] and immediate neighbours."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At that time, a few programs with children and women were started in the villages surrounding Auroville. Gradually, professional social workers joined and turned AVAG into an official developmental project.
With [[OXFAM India]]'s help starting '''1991''', AVAG expanded its scope in terms of working areas and adjointed activities and field staff could be recruited and trained. The '''Commonwealth Human Ecology Council''' (CHEC) of the '''Overseas Development Agency''' (ODA)-UK, later called the [[Department for International Development]] (DfID), also supported AVAG so that its work expanded further. Thanks to the DfID's funding, the '''Women's Federation''' and the '''men's groups''' could also be established in '''1999'''.
When the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] hit Tamil Nadu, AVAG experienced a major financial and labor crisis. Many activities had to be reduced or shut down but it was sustained with the help of the women and men SHGs and the leaders of the villages. [[Asian Community Development Corporation|ACDC]] also supported AVAG's work in the tsunami hit areas. ACDC continued to support AVAG until '''2009'''.
In '''2010''', the social enterprise initiative got started with the assistance of the '''Sustainable Enterprise Development in the Auroville Bioregion''' (SEDAB), scheduled to run until the middle of '''2016'''. The BMZ project set up a [[revolving fund]] with the German government's support, mainly for enabling the distribution of grants to poor girls for obtaining a better education.
'''Currently''', AVAG is working on setting up education programs  for adolescent girls and boys and marketing its products more. Also, '''flood relief''' after the hundred-year [[2015 South Indian floods]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chennai-Floods-2015 | title = Chennai floods | publisher = Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the Villupuram district is still going on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://villageaction.in/media/newsletter/january2016/ | title = Newsletter January 2016, article Flood Reliefs | publisher = AVAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
AVAG is closely working together with people in Auroville, for certain events such as flood relief help and different '''entrepreneurial projects''' inside of Auroville. Some of AVAG's women stitch disposable cloth pads for '''EcoFemme''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://ecofemme.org/about/where-we-work/ | title = EcoFemme stitched by AVAG | publisher = EcoFemme}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have also recently started to assist in stitching scarves made by '''The Colours of Nature'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://thecoloursofnature.com/ | title = The Colours of Nature information | publisher = EcoFemme}}&lt;/ref&gt; One different project which AVAG is working together with Auroville on right now is the '''Paalam project''', Paalam meaning bridge in Tamil, which is a bioregional and Auroville youth leadership program and "aims to provide training in sustainable village development through a programme that would include exposure to Auroville and its ideals and to model village development throughout Tamil Nadu."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.auroville.org/contents/3924 | title = Article on the 'Paalam' project | publisher = Auroville Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Once a year, a student from the [[American University of Paris]] (AUP) joins AVAG for a few weeks to assist it in the communications sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://aupindia.org/our-partners/ | title = AUP's working partners in Auroville | publisher = AUP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
AVAG is associated with the [[National Australia Bank]], the [[Indian Bank]] and the [[ICICI Bank]] for the microfinancing and SHG loans. They send a mobile bank to AVAG twice a week and issue the loans to the SHG women.
The German [[Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung|BMZ]] is supporting one or two young volunteers coming to AVAG via '''Auroville International (AVI) Deutschland e.V.''', a non-profit organization which is amongst other things a volunteer sending agency via '''weltwärts''', each year for a year's duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://auroville.de/index.php/2011-12-28-10-36-05/das-programm | title = AVI-D volunteer service | publisher = AVI-D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Garrison Sergeant Major]] '''William Daran Gillduff Mott''', {{post-nominals|size=100%|sep=,|OBE|MVO}} is a former [[British Army]] soldier who was one of the army's most senior [[warrant officer (United Kingdom)|warrant officer]]s between 2002 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;'Senior Army NCO gives action figures authentic voice' (Ministry of Defence, 10 June 2011) https://www.gov.uk/government/news/senior-army-nco-gives-action-figures-authentic-voice (Accessed 10 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Mott was brought up in [[Overpool]], [[Cheshire]], before enlisting into the [[1st Battalion, Welsh Guards]] in April 1979. He saw operational tours in [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland]] and during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. He served at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] as a [[colour sergeant]], [[company sergeant major]], and [[regimental sergeant major]], before becoming Garrison Sergeant Major (GSM) at [[HQ Northern Ireland]]. He became GSM [[London District (British Army)|HQ London District]] in late 2002 and oversaw his first [[Trooping the Colour]] parade as GSM in June 2003. He was subsequently in charge of organising, choreographing and overseeing all major state ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hardman |first=Robert |date=12 November 2007 |title=Prince William holds back the tears in emotional tribute to Britain's war dead |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-493057/Prince-William-holds-tears-emotional-tribute-Britains-war-dead.html |newspaper=The Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=10 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WO1 (GSM) W D G 'Billy' Mott OBE MVO, Welsh Guards http://www.trooping-the-colour.co.uk/gsm/bmott.htm (Accessed 10 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 he was also a pivotal figure in organising the repatriation ceremonies for British soldiers killed in action during operations in the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in Afghanistan]].

Mott was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2007 Birthday Honours]]. In the [[2012 Diamond Jubilee Honours]] he was appointed [[Member of the Royal Victorian Order]] (MVO) for his personal service to the monarch during the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rayner |first=Gordon |date=3 June 2012 |title=The Queen's Diamond Jubilee: Happy and glorious, the river Queen |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9309856/The-Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-Happy-and-glorious-the-river-Queen.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=10 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mott was granted [[Freedom of the City]] of London in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=18 November 2013 |title=Sergeant Major Bill Mott: Deeside man given Freedom of City of London |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/sergeant-major-bill-mott-deeside-6314730 |newspaper=North Wales Daily Post |location= |accessdate=10 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the army in June 2015 following Trooping the Colour, during which the Welsh Guards marked the centennial year of their foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=16 June 2015 |title=Billy Mott Gives his Final Salute to The Queen |url=https://www.armedforcesday.org.uk/billy-mott-gives-his-final-salute-to-the-queen/ |newspaper=Armed Forces Day website |location= |accessdate=21 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6120">The '''Bombers Affair''' ([[Luxembourgish Language|Luxembourgish]]:''Bommeleeër Affär'') is the name given to a series of bomb attacks on Infrastructure installations and public buildings in the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] between May 1984, and April 1986. The identities of the perpetrators and the motives are not known, however the population developed a diverse set of conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lessentiel.lu/de/news/luxemburg/story/25286582 "Bomben, Politik und Verschwörungen"]  (German). In: ''L'Essentiel'', 28&amp;nbsp;June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe that members of the Luxembourgish Government or [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg|Grand Ducal Family]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wort.lu/de/lokales/prinz-guillaume-als-bommeleeer-53066a4fe4b080dc756ba0a9 "Prinz Guillaume als Bommeleeër?"] (German). In: ''Wort'', 20&amp;nbsp;February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; as well as insiders in the [[Service de Renseignement de l’État|Security Services]] were involved in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wort.lu/de/lokales/vor-zwei-jahren-begann-bommeleeer-prozess-bommeleeer-von-vier-spuren-blieb-am-ende-eine-54ecbf890c88b46a8ce542aa "Bommeleeër: Von vier Spuren blieb am Ende eine"]  (German). In: ''Wort'', 25&amp;nbsp;February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

The perpetrators carried out thefts of detonators and explosives from Luxembourgish quarries. The perpetrators used the stolen materials blow up electricity pylons from the electricity company [[Cegedel]].&lt;ref name=chronologie&gt;[http://www.wort.lu/de/lokales/chronologie-der-anschlaege-4f61b12ae4b0860580a9b74e "Chronologie der Anschläge"]  (German). In: ''Wort'', 30&amp;nbsp;October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cegedel]] received multiple ransom letters.&lt;ref name="chronologie"/&gt; The company contacted the police and decided not to pay. Later once the company had come to a conclusion and decided to pay the ransom, the perpetrators declined the transfer of money, stating that they knew of the Police interest surrounding the attacks. [[Cegedel]]'s electricity pylons remained the target of later attacks. However, the perpetrators diversified the targets of their later attacks to include the Headquarters of the Gendarmerie and the Palace of Justice. A particularly significant incident happened during a meeting of the [[European Council]] on the [[Kirchberg, Luxembourg|Kirchberg plateau]], the incident in question involved a small explosive device which was thrown out of the windows of a moving car. After two further attacks, one on the apartment of a Notary (Car Bomb) and the apartment of a retired commander of the Gendarmerie, the attacks ceased.

No-one was killed by the 18 attacks, however a young soldier was killed during service, by a traffic collision during the surveillance of [[Luxembourg Findel Airport|Luxembourg Airport]]. The perpetrators also set up an explosive trap in a forest, which was discovered before it could be put to use, however it could have resulted in the death of many people. Furthermore, an engineer’s hand was severely injured, when he picked up a Flashlight which had been fitted with a detonator. A number of people were injured as a compromised electricity pylon fell upon a highway, which caused traffic to collide on the highway, however nobody was severely injured. It is understood that the perpetrators wanted to avoid human casualties, however in a number of incidents it was pure co-incidence that no-one was injured.

'''The Brotherhood of Russian Truth''' ({{lang-ru| Братство Русской Правды}}) was a Russian [[counter-revolution]]ary [[Russian nationalism|nationalist]] organization established in 1921 by [[Pyotr Krasnov]] and other former members of the [[White movement]], including Prince [[Anatoly Lieven]], to overthrow [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]] in Soviet Russia. The term "Russian Truth" is the word used to describe [[Russkaya Pravda|the Russian code of laws]] established by the mediaeval Rus' Grand Prince, [[Yaroslav I the Wise]].  The political program of the Brotherhood was [[anti-communism]] with a [[monarchism|monarchist]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] sentiment.

The main method of struggle for the Brotherhood was the establishment of an underground network of counter-revolutionaries within Soviet Russia. The Brotherhood sent agents to cross the Soviet border illegally, as did the [[Russian All-Military Union]] and the [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists|NTS]]. Unfortunately for the Brotherhood, agents working for the [[Inner Line]] disrupted their activities, causing considerable casualties.

The organization ceased its activity after its president Afinogen Argunov was killed in 1932 by a [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] agent.

The '''Canada Border Services Agency''' ('''CBSA''') ({{lang-fr|Agence des services frontaliers du Canada; ASFC}}) is a federal agency that is responsible for [[Border control|border enforcement]], immigration enforcement and [[customs]] services.

The Agency was created on December 12, 2003, by an [[order-in-council]] amalgamating Canada Customs (from the now-defunct [[Canada Customs and Revenue Agency]]) with border and enforcement personnel from the Department of [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] (CIC) and the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA). The Agency's creation was formalized by the ''Canada Border Services Agency Act'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/c-1.4/ Canada Border Services Agency Act]. Laws.justice.gc.ca. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; which received [[Royal Assent]] on November 3, 2005.

Since the [[September 11 attacks]] against the [[United States]], Canada's border operations have placed an enhanced emphasis on national security and [[public safety]]. The Canada–United States [[Smart Border Declaration]], created by [[John Manley]] and [[Tom Ridge]], then first [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], has provided objectives for co-operation between Canadian and American border operations.

The CBSA oversees approximately 1,200 service locations across Canada, and 39 in other countries. It employs over 12,000 public servants, and offers around-the-clock service at 119 land border crossings and thirteen international airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/agency-agence/what-quoi-eng.html |title=About the CBSA - What we do |accessdate=2007-11-09 |date=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agency oversees operations at three major [[sea port]]s and three mail centres, and operates [[immigration detention#Canada|detention]] facilities known as immigration holding centres in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], [[Toronto]], and [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/security-securite/ihc-csi-eng.html Immigration holding centres]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBSA operates an Inland Enforcement branch, which tracks down and removes foreign nationals who are in Canada illegally. Inland Enforcement Officers are "plain-clothes" units, and are armed with the same sidearm pistol ([[Beretta PX4 Storm|PX4D Storm]] chambered in [[9×19mm Parabellum]]) as port of entry Border Services Officers.

==History==
Prior to 2004, border security in Canada was handled by three legacy agencies:
*[[Canada Customs and Revenue Agency]]
*[[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]]
*[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]
The CBSA was created in an attempt to address issues found in a review by the [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] including an inability to share certain security information and shortcomings in inter-agency communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill C-26:Canada Border Services Agency Act|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LegislativeSummaries/Bills_ls.asp?Parl=38&amp;Ses=1&amp;ls=C26|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insignia==
In addition to using generic identifiers imposed by the [[Federal Identity Program]], the CBSA is one of several [[Heraldic badges of the Canadian government|federal departments]] (primarily those involved with law enforcement, security, or having a regulatory function) that have been granted heraldic symbols by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]].

The coat of arms was granted on June 15, 2010, and presented by [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]] on July 6, 2010. The ceremony was the Queen's last function on her 2010 [[Royal tours of Canada|Canadian Royal Tour]]. Also in attendance were [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.newswire.ca/en/story/671091/armorial-bearings-presented-to-cbsa-by-her-majesty-queen-elizabeth-ii Armorial bearings presented to CBSA by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the coat of arms is reserved for special occasions, and it is normally associated with the office of the CBSA President.

The [[heraldic badge]] was approved for use at the same time as the coat of arms. It portrays a gold tressure, which symbolizes the agency's security focus. The portcullis represents Her Majesty's agents responsible for border services. The [[Latin]] motto of {{lang|la|Protectio Servitium Integritas}} translates as "Protection, Service, Integrity". The badge figures prominently in the television series "[[Border Security: Canada's Front Line]]".

A flag was approved for use on December 20, 2012. It is meant to resemble [[Canadian Blue Ensign|Canada's Blue Ensign]], which was flown on government vessels (including those patrolling Canada's maritime borders) prior to 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/agency-agence/herald-armoiries-eng.html CBSA Heraldry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes to the CBSA==
Canada Customs officers, and their successor officers of the CBSA during the latter's initial years, did not have firearms, instead relying on a local [[RCMP]] detachment to provide backup if armed force was required.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Since the creation of the Agency in 2003, the CBSA has undergone significant changes to its overall structure, as services previously offered by different agencies are now housed under a single banner. Not only has the structure of the organization changed, but the range of duties and the institutional priorities have changed. Where the prior coupling of Canada Customs with the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] lent itself to a focus on tax collection, the new Agency was created to address heightened security concerns post-[[9/11]], and to respond to criticisms, mostly from the United States, that Canada was not doing enough to ensure the security of [[North America]].

Substantial changes began before the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. In May 1998, the Government of Canada passed an Act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HouseBills/BillsGovernment.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=36&amp;Ses=1#C18|title=House Government Bills|publisher=[[Library of Parliament]]|accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which changed agency policy to allow the officers to arrest and detain individuals at the border for non-customs related violations of Canadian law. These new responsibilities led to the implementation of [[use of force]] policies. Border Services Officers across Canada started to carry collapsible [[Club (weapon)|baton]]s, [[OC spray]] (pepper spray) and [[handcuffs]], although it was still several years before they would be equipped with firearms.

The [[2006 Canadian federal budget]] introduced [[Canadian dollar|$]]101 million to equip Border Services Officers (BSOs) with [[side arm]]s and to eliminate single-person [[border crossing]]s to help officers perform their duties. The decision to arm BSOs has been a subject of some controversy in Canada for several years since previous governments felt that unarmed officers made the country less intimidating to visitors, as opposed to the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], whose officers have carried side arms for decades. Supporters of arming BSOs said that this would help the CBSA shed its lax reputation and better enforce their authority in the post 9/11 era, for instance when dealing with American visitors who frequently carry firearms. Arming BSOs had the support of other law enforcement agencies as well as the union that represents the affected officers. In August 2006, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] announced that arming BSOs would begin in early 2007 and would continue through 2016. Arming at the other Ports of Entry across Canada was conducted systematically with those Ports considered the busiest and/or most dangerous to be completed first; some of the first officers to be armed were those working at the [[Windsor, Ontario]] port of entry which is the busiest highway port of entry in Canada.  Today, Border Services Officers at all Ports of Entry are issued duty firearms; however, they may not be routinely worn depending on the environment the officer is working in.

==Border Services Officer==
[[File:CBSA and Vancouver Police.jpg|thumb|CBSA officers and police in Vancouver]]
A '''Border Services Officer''' (BSO) is a federal law enforcement officer employed by the Canada Border Services Agency. While Border Services Officer is the overarching term for the CBSA's front-line personnel, it is actually not a title derived from legislation. Rather BSOs receive multiple legislative designations such as Customs Officers under the "Customs Act", Immigration Officers under the [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]], and Screening Officers under the "Quarantine Act". Border Services Officers are, when enforcing customs- or immigration-related legislation, [[Law Enforcement Officer#Canada|Peace Officers]] under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code of Canada]]; however, they can only make arrests for offences under the Code if they are appointed "designated officers" by the [[Minister of Public Safety (Canada)|Minister of Public Safety]] under Section 163.4 of the "Customs Act" and are at customs office performing the normal duties of an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52.6/page-37.html#h-95 |title=Customs Act |accessdate=2017-03-20 |date=1998-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Border Services Officers are equipped with [[handcuffs]], [[Pepper spray|oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray]], [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]]s, and are currently armed with [[Beretta]] [[Beretta PX4 Storm|PX4 Storm]] pistols. The arming initiative began in 2007 and officially concluded in 2016.

Border Services Officers are trained at the CBSA College, located in [[Rigaud, Quebec]]. The training begins with a 4-week online program called Pre-OITP, and an 18-week program called  CBSA Officer Induction Training Program (OITP) which covers a range of topics from [[criminal law]] and immigration and customs legislation to control and defensive tactics.

===Operations rank structure===
* Border Services Officer (usually referred to as just Officer): No insignia.
* Trainer: 1 silver stripe
* Superintendent and training administrator: 2 standard silver stripes
* Duty chief: 2 {{frac|1|2}} silver stripes
* Chief of Operations (Commanding Officer of a Point of Entry, i.e. a land checkpoint or an airport inspection area) and training manager: 3 standard silver stripes
* Director (Commanding Officer of a District, which is multiple land borders or an airport): 1 gold CBSA pin and 1 gold pip
* Regional Director General (Commanding Officer of a Region, i.e. Pacific Region): 1 gold CBSA pin and 2 gold pips

* President (the head of the Agency): 1 gold CBSA pin and 4 gold pips

==Incidents==

In 2010 a CBSA officer at B.C's Peace Arch border crossing was convicted of sexually assaulting women in three separate incidents after ordering at least four unauthorized strip searches&lt;ref name=cbsaprovince&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fraser|first1=Keith|title=B.C. border guard who sexually assaulted women at Peace Arch crossing loses sentencing appeal|url=http://www.theprovince.com/news/border+guard+sexually+assaulted+women+Peace+Arch+crossing+loses+sentencing+appeal/6814315/story.html|website=theprovince.com|publisher=The Province|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2012, a CBSA officer was shot on duty at the [[Peace Arch]] Douglas Border Crossing. The attacker was an American man who shot the CBSA officer before he killed himself. The CBSA officer, Lori Bowcock, was shot in the neck but she survived. This is the first time since CBSA's inception that an officer was shot on duty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadian-border-officer-shot-without-warning-cbsa-president-1.1002216 Canadian border officer shot without warning: CBSA president]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search of Electronic Devices===
In March 2015, Alain Philippon, a man from Ste-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, was referred to secondary inspection after returning from a trip to the Dominican Republic. During the inspection, CBSA officers asked Philippon to disclose the password to his Blackberry phone. He refused and was charged with hindering an officer's job under section 153.1 (b) of the Customs Act, which carries a maximum sentence of twelve months' imprisonment and a $25,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Refusal to reveal smartphone password could cost man year in jail|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/quebec-resident-alain-philippon-to-fight-charge-for-not-giving-up-phone-password-at-airport-1.2982236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his arrest, Philippon said that he would fight the charge, as he considers his phone to be "personal". His case got national and international attention, and several organizations argued that the Charter right to privacy could extend to electronic devices at the border, especially in light of recent Supreme Court case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy vs Security at the Border|url=http://www.it-can.ca/2015/03/18/privacy-vs-security-at-the-border/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Philippon entered a guilty plea and was ordered to pay a $500 fine. The plea meant that no Charter challenge was going to be raised, and the question of whether or not a refusal to provide a password to a customs officer is considered hindering remains unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guilty plea ends case that pitted cellphone privacy rights against border security powers|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/guilty-plea-ends-case-that-pitted-cellphone-privacy-rights-against-border-security-powers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in August, following Philippon's guilty plea, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association published a CBSA Operational Bulletin which indicated that the CBSA maintains it has the legal authority to compel passwords, but at the same time acknowledges that the law is unclear. The bulletin also states that officers may only use a password to gain access to data stored within the device itself, and not data stored on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Happens If You Don't Provide Your Cellphone Password to Border Agents?  - BC Civil Liberties Association|url=https://bccla.org/2016/08/what-happens-if-you-dont-provide-your-cellphone-password-to-border-agents/|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaths in custody===
Since 2000, at least 13 people have died while in the custody of the CBSA and its predecessor, with the two most recent deaths occurring in the span of a week in two separate incidents in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secrecy cloaks death of immigration detainee in Toronto jail {{!}} Toronto Star|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2016/03/10/secrecy-cloaks-death-of-immigration-detainee-in-toronto-jail.html|work=thestar.com|date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the latest incidents, several organizations reacted and called for an immigration detention reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deaths in CBSA custody renew calls for immigration detention reform|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-march-21-2016-1.3500358/deaths-in-cbsa-custody-renew-calls-for-immigration-detention-reform-1.3500441|work=CBC|date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBSA remains one of the few enforcement agencies in Canada without an independent and external oversight body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Oversight for the Canada Border Services Agency {{!}} In Due Course|url=http://induecourse.ca/independent-oversight-for-the-canada-border-services-agency/|website=induecourse.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV show===
{{Main|Border Security: Canada's Front Line}}
Beginning in 2012, the CBSA participated in a documentary called ''Border Security: Canada's Front Line'', produced by [[National Geographic Channel (Canada)|Canadian National Geographic Channel]]. It is similar in format to the [[Border Security: Australia's Front Line|Australian version]] in following CBSA officers from various ports and Inland Enforcement Teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://natgeotv.com/ca/border-security BORDER SECURITY: Canada’s Front Line]&lt;/ref&gt; The show has attracted criticism from the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]] and the [[Canadian Bar Association]] due to its approach to privacy rights and its one-sided narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/04/30/border_security_reality_show_called_risk_for_vulnerable_migrants.html Border Security reality show called risk for vulnerable migrants]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, while filming for the show, the CBSA conducted a raid on a construction site in Vancouver. They arrested a Mexican national, Oscar Mata Duran, and brought him to an immigration detention centre where he was presented with a filming consent form. Canada's Privacy Commissioner, following a complaint from the man, investigated. The Commissioner found that the CBSA breached Canada's Privacy Act by filming their interaction with Duran before he was advised of the purposes of filming and found that the coercive nature of being detained in a holding facility would have prevented Duran from providing informed consent for his appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/border-security-cancelled-1.3632468 | title=Border Security TV show canned after federal watchdog finds privacy violation | accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commissioner lauded Duran as a real hero for lodging the privacy complaint even though he would not personally benefit from it. Duran was deported following the raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/border-security-cancelled-1.3632468 | title=Border Security TV show canned after federal watchdog finds privacy violation | accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of Duran's complaint the Privacy Commissioner recommended that the CBSA end its participation in the show, the CBSA announced that the show would not return for a fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citynews.ca/2016/06/12/border-security-tv-show-cancelled-following-privacy-violation/ | title=Controversial reality show "Border Security" cancelled following privacy violation | accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==

===Immigration===
The CBSA plays a key role in [[immigration to Canada]], as it has assumed the port-of-entry and enforcement mandates formerly held by the Department of [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]]. CBSA officers work on the front lines, screening persons entering the country and removing those who are unlawfully in Canada.

As of the end of 2003 there were up to 200,000 [[illegal immigrants]] in Canada (most residing in Ontario). Most are refugee claimants whose refugee applications were rejected by the [[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]].&lt;ref name="illegalimmigrants"&gt;{{Cite news
 |last=Jiminez

 |accessdate=2007-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are very few illegal immigrants who enter the country without first being examined by the CBSA. The reason for this is that Canada is physically very difficult to get to, with the exception of crossing the Canada/U.S. border. As the U.S. is itself a prime destination for illegal immigrants, not many illegal immigrants then attempt to cross the border into Canada in the wild. This differs significantly from the illegal immigration patterns in the U.S., which stem from illegal border crossings.

There has been a recent increase in the number of illegal entrants from [[St. Pierre &amp; Miquelon]] who travel in makeshift boats. High unemployment in the French colony has spurred this increase, which has been acknowledged by the Government of France. The CBSA and Royal Canadian Navy are considering increased marine patrols to intercept the illegal migrants. While residents could lawfully travel to France, the expensive airfare has made the relatively short {{convert|5.5|nmi|km mi|0|adj=on}} boat ride to the Canadian province of Newfoundland more attractive for destitute economic migrants.
&lt;ref&gt;National Post, 30 December 2009, page A7, "Unemployment on St. Pierre &amp; Miquelon brings migrants"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examinations, searches and seizures===
All persons and goods entering Canada are subject to examination by CBSA officers. An examination can be as simple as a few questions, but can also include an examination of the subject's vehicle and/or luggage, more intensive questioning, or [[strip-search|personal searches]]. The intensity of an examination depends on the reasonable grounds that the officer has to escalate the intensiveness of a search.

Examinations are performed to ensure compliance with Customs and Immigration legislation. CBSA officers are given their authority by the ''Customs Act''&lt;ref name="Customs Act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-52.6/ |title=Customs Act, 1985 |accessdate=2007-11-09 |date=1986-02-13 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]].'' In addition, BSOs are also able to enforce other [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] as they are designated as [[Peace Officer]]s under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].

The agency will also seize items it labels [[obscene]], as it did in February 2009 when it detained and banned two films by the [[adult film]] director [[Michael Lucas (director)|Michael Lucas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.avn.com/company-news/31059.html Michael Lucas Implores Obama, Harper to Talk About Porn], AVN News, February 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The CBSA's Policy On The Classification Of Obscene Material states that the "ingestion of someone else's urine... with a sexual purpose" makes a film obscene.&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;[http://www.dnamagazine.com.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=8073&amp;c=1990 Lucas Porn Films Detained At Border], DNA Magazine, February 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000 after a ten-year-long controversy over items the agency labelled obscene, the case reached the British Columbia Supreme Court. One judge in the case concluded not only that Customs officials had wrongly delayed, confiscated, destroyed, damaged, prohibited or misclassified materials imported by the appellant on numerous occasions, but that these errors were caused "by the systemic targeting of [[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice)|Little Sisters']] importations in the Vancouver Customs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc69/2000scc69.html 2000 SCC 69] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211213005/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc69/2000scc69.html |date=December 11, 2011 }}. CanLII. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary examination can at times{{when|date=October 2017}} be a lengthy{{quantify|date=October 2017}} process and may{{clarify|date=October 2017}} cause delays to travellers selected for examination.

===Detector dog service===
The CBSA's use of detector dogs began with three canine units at the Windsor port of entry in 1978. The program has since expanded to include 69 detector dog teams located at ports across Canada. Detector dogs work in mail, air, land and marine modes. Each dog is trained to detect specific commodities, and are generally trained to fit into one of four (Soon to be three) profiles:
*narcotics, explosives and firearms
*currency
*Tobacco (no longer being trained)
*plants, food and animals

====Role====
Detector dogs provide Border Services Officers (BSOs) with one of the most effective tools in the detection of contraband. Although other tools are available to BSOs, detector dogs are highly efficient in their ability to accurately locate the source of a scent, and thus can save time in labour-intensive examinations of vehicles, luggage and cargo. This speeds up the process for BSOs as well as for the travelling public.

The CBSA uses passive detector dogs, unlike some other law enforcement agencies, which use active dogs. When a passive dog detects a scent that it has been trained to recognize, it sits beside the source of the smell. While active dogs, which bark, scratch, dig or bite at the source of the scent, were used initially by the CBSA, passive dogs allow the officer to circulate among passengers more peacefully, and are considered by the Agency to be more effective in the course of their work. The Passive Dog training was implemented in 1993, and is now the Agency's preference.

====Training====
Detector Dog teams (consisting of a dog and a single handler) undergo a 10-week training course at the CBSA Learning Centre. The handlers are Border Services Officers, and are trained on how to care for, maintain, and train their dogs. They are also trained to understand the Cone of Scent. Odour particles always disperse in the shape of a cone: more concentrated at the source, and less concentrated farther away. After the initial training, the handler must keep up a training regimen to ensure their dog remains in top form. Only about 1 in 10 dogs who begin the training eventually become detector dogs.

While there is no specific description for a detector dog, the CBSA looks for certain characteristics that make a better potential detector dog,&lt;ref name="dogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/security-securite/dds-scd/menu-eng.html |title=Detector Dog Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* ability and desire to retrieve
* good physical condition
* alertness
* sociability
* boldness
* temperament

====About the dogs====
Detector dogs begin training between the ages of 11 and 16 months and work for an average of 8 to 10 years. Several different breeds are used, but the CBSA primarily uses Labrador Retrievers for firearm, drug and currency detection, and the Beagle for plant, food and animal detection. Dogs live with their handler full-time. While the dog is at work, it is transported in air-conditioned vehicles that act as a mobile kennel.

The AMPS program, implemented in December 2005, is a system that encourages compliance with Customs legislation through the tendering of monetary penalties. It is used mainly as an enforcement tool on technical infractions, where the subject did not necessarily intend to breach the legislation, but failed to comply in some way. For more serious or deliberate infractions, the goods in question may be seized or subject to forfeiture. AMPS penalties are imposed depending on the severity and frequency of the infraction. Multiple infractions will result in higher penalties under the AMPS system.

==Enforcement and Intelligence==

===Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions===
The Criminal Investigations Division of CBSA is tasked with investigating and pursuing prosecution of those who commit criminal offences against Canada's border legislation.
The CBSA's criminal investigators are responsible for operational activities including:
*  Investigating fraudulent activities related to the importation/exportation of goods and the movement of people;
*  Reviewing leads, researching, gathering evidence;
*  Conducting forensic examinations on digital devices and media;
*  Executing search warrants;
*  Preparing and serving documents (corrective, civil, criminal);
*  Assisting foreign customs administrations with their investigation of customs offences (CMAA, MLAT); and
*  Criminal prosecutions (preparing a Crown Briefs, recommending specific charges, assisting the Public Prosecution Service of Canada).

===Intelligence===
The Canada Border Services Agency maintains a robust and comprehensive Intelligence program, which is mandated to provide timely, accurate and relevant intelligence support to operational decision makers at all levels within the Agency. Information is lawfully collected from a variety of sources, including open and closed source materials, domestic and international intelligence partners, joint operations with other law enforcement agencies, sophisticated technical means, covert surveillance, and informants/human intelligence. Intelligence officers and analysts are deployed within Canada—along the borders and throughout the country—as well as overseas.

The CBSA turns the information it collects into intelligence by using automated risk analysis, analytical tools, and risk management. This allows it to work toward its objective of balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate the flow of people and goods. The Agency seeks to manage risks through a number of means, including the collection and analysis of intelligence information, the use of detection tools, the analysis of indicators and judgment of front-line officers, and random checks.

Threat and risk assessments are widely recognized as valuable decision-making tools when setting examination priorities. The Agency's intelligence directorate conducts a border risk assessment of its border operations every 2–3 years. Under this process, the Agency assesses the risks of smuggling contraband, such as drugs, firearms, proceeds of crime, child pornography, illicit tobacco etc. The information is assessed and ranked by commodity and by mode of transport. The Agency will include the risks of irregular or illegal migration of people, and the movement of food, plants, and animals, now under the Agency's broader mandate, in the next version of its border risk assessment.

The Agency also prepares a national port risk assessment every two years. The Agency assessed the relative risk to 168 ports of entry in 2006 and 220 in 2004. Regional intelligence analysts, in consultation with other sources and port operational staff, complete a questionnaire detailing port demographics, traffic volume, enforcement, and intelligence information. The 2006 risk assessment ranked 23 ports as high-risk and included information on suspected criminal and national security risks, as well as the risk of irregular or illegal migration of people.

In addition to the border and port risk assessment processes, the intelligence directorate provides daily, weekly and monthly updates on specific threats and trends in unlawful activities. Intelligence officers and analysts frequently participate in tactical and operational law enforcement activities such as search warrants, arrests, surveillance, the recruitment and retention of confidential informers, interviews of detainees and the analysis of seized goods and evidence.

===Border Watch===
The CBSA Border Watch toll free info line offers citizens the opportunity to report suspicious cross border activity directly to the Agency in a direct and confidential manner. The Border Watch line differs from other phone lines for the public, such as [[Crimestoppers]] or the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] info line in that it is designed to focus directly on border-related intelligence. The toll free number is 1-888-502-9060.

===Smart Border Declaration and Action Plan===
The [[Smart Border Declaration]] and Action Plan, also known as the Smart Border Accord, was signed in 2001 and is an initiative of the [[Government of Canada]], specifically the CBSA, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] and the [[DFAIT|Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]], and the Government of the [[United States]], specifically the [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the [[United States Coast Guard]]. The two major signatories to the Declaration were [[Deputy Prime Minister|Canadian Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Manley]] and then-[[Homeland Security|US Director of Homeland Security]] [[Tom Ridge]].

The accord was set up in order to facilitate the cross-border flow of travellers and goods, while co-ordinating enforcement efforts in the two countries.

The accord consists of 30 points of common interest&lt;ref name="Smart Border Accord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfait.gc.ca/can-am/main/border/32_point_action-en.asp |title=Border Cooperation 32-Point Action Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve both security and trade between the two countries. Included in the plan are initiatives to improve the [[biometric]] features of Permanent Resident Cards in both countries, sharing [[Advance Passenger Information System|Advanced Passenger Information]], and creating compatible [[immigration]] databases.

There are four main pillars to the Action Plan:

* Secure flow of people
* Secure flow of goods
* Investing in secure infrastructure
* Coordination and information sharing in the enforcement of these objectives

===Canada–United States Integrated Border Enforcement Teams===
Integrated Border Enforcement Teams&lt;ref name="IBET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psepc-sppcc.gc.ca/prg/le/bs/ibet-en.asp |title=IBET}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IBETs) were created as a part of the Accord to consolidate the law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering expertise of different agencies in both countries. The IBETs consist of members from the CBSA, RCMP, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Coast Guard, and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|U.S. ICE Teams]]. However, IBETs also enlist the help of other municipal, state/provincial and federal agencies on certain projects.

In Canada, IBETs operate in 15 regions across the Canada-U.S. Border in air, sea and land modes. They are based on a model started along the [[British Columbia]]-[[Washington (state)|Washington State]] border in 1996. Since their inception, IBETs have helped disrupt smuggling rings involved in the drug trade, alcohol, tobacco and vehicle [[smuggling]], and [[human trafficking]].

==Commerce and trade-oriented programs and initiatives==

=== Customs self-assessment program ===
The CSA program gives approved importers a streamlined accounting and paying process for all imported goods. Importers are required to apply for acceptance into the program

===Advance Commercial Information===
A major ongoing project of the CBSA is [[Advance Commercial Information]], which requires shipborne and airborne cargo entering Canada to be registered with the Agency. This assists officials at seaports and airports in their inspections, and allows for the tracking of suspicious materials. These phases of the project were implemented in 2005, with a similar highway and rail cargo program to follow in the near future.

==Proposed legislative changes==

=== Formation of the Canada Law Enforcement Review Commission ===
A report ordered by the federal government in 2017 urges for the creation of a new independent oversight committee to monitor, address and investigate complaints against the CBSA. Currently, CBSA has no civilian oversight. It is considered a highly unusual situation by many provincial law associations as nearly every policing agency in Canada has some form of independent oversight body.

==Electronic privacy rights at the border==
Whilst the laws surrounding electronic privacy rights at the border are currently considered unsettled, a number of new court cases are raising the issue that personal electronic devices (such as cell phones and lab tops) should be afforded a higher level of privacy.

In August 2018, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) published a guide surrounding searches of electronic devices at the border. The guide was distributed by major media outlets in Canada.

The '''Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization''', also known as the "Military Case" or the "Tukhachevsky Case"), was a 1937 secret trial of the high command of the [[Red Army]], a part of the [[Great Purge]].

==Defendants==

The Case of Military was a [[secret trial]], unlike the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Show Trials]]. It is traditionally considered one of the key trials of the [[Great Purge]]. Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and the senior military officers [[Iona Yakir]], [[Ieronim Uborevich]], [[Robert Eideman]], [[August Kork]], [[Vitovt Putna]], [[Boris Feldman]] and [[Vitaly Primakov]] (as well as [[Yakov Gamarnik]], who committed suicide before the investigations began) were accused of [[anti-Soviet]] conspiracy and sentenced to death; they were executed on the night of June 11 to 12, 1937, immediately after the verdict delivered by a Special Session (специальное судебное присутствие) of the [[Supreme Court of the USSR]]. 

The Tribunal was presided over by [[Vasili Ulrikh]] and included marshals [[Vasily Blyukher]], [[Semyon Budyonny]]; Army Commanders [[Yakov Alksnis]], [[Boris Shaposhnikov]], [[Ivan Panfilovich Belov]], [[Pavel Dybenko]], and [[Nikolai Kashirin]]; and Corps Commander [[Yelisey Goryachev]]. Only Ulrikh, Budyonny and Shaposhnikov would survive the [[purge]]s that followed.

The trial triggered a massive subsequent purge of the [[Red Army]]. In September 1938, the People's Commissar for Defense, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], reported that a total of 37,761 officers and [[commissar]]s were dismissed from the army, 10,868 were arrested and 7,211 were condemned for anti-Soviet crimes.

==Background==
The trial was preceded by several purges of the Red Army. In the mid-1920s, [[Leon Trotsky]] was removed as Commissar of War, and his known supporters were expunged from the military. Former [[tsar]]ist officers had been purged in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The latter purge was accompanied by the "exposure" of the "Former Officers Plot". The next wave of arrests of military commanders started in the second half of 1936 and increased in scope after the February–March 1937 Plenary Meeting of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), where [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] called for more thorough exposure of "[[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]]" within the Red Army since they "had already been found in all segments of the [[Soviet economy]]".

==Evidence, arrest and secret trial==
General [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] was arrested on May 22, 1937 and charged, along with seven other Red Army commanders, with the creation of a "right-wing-[[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]" military conspiracy and [[espionage]] for [[Nazi Germany]], based on confessions obtained from a number of other arrested officers.

Before 1990, it was frequently argued that the case against the eight generals was based on forged documents created by the [[Abwehr]], documents which deluded Stalin into believing that a plot was being fomented by Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders to depose him. However, after Soviet archives were opened to researchers after the fall of the Soviet Union, it became clear that Stalin actually concocted the fictitious plot by the most famous and important of his Soviet generals in order to get rid of them in a believable manner.&lt;ref&gt;Lukes, Igor, ''Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Beneš in the 1930s'', Oxford University Press (1996), {{ISBN|0-19-510267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-510267-3}}, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

At Stalin's order, the [[NKVD]] instructed one of its agents, [[Nikolai Skoblin]], to concoct information suggesting a plot by Tukhachevsky and the other Soviet generals against Stalin and pass it to [[Reinhard Heydrich]], chief of the German (''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'') intelligence arm.&lt;ref&gt;Lukes, Igor, ''Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Beneš in the 1930s'', Oxford University Press (1996), {{ISBN|0-19-510267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-510267-3}}, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing an opportunity to strike a blow at both the Soviet Union and his archenemy [[Wilhelm Canaris]] of the German [[Abwehr]], Heydrich immediately acted on the information and undertook to improve on it, forging a series of documents implicating Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders; these were later passed to the Soviets via Beneš and other neutral parties. Stalin's archives indeed contain a number of messages received during 1920&amp;ndash;30s duly reporting the possible involvement of Tukhachevsky with the "German Nazi leadership".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
 
While the Germans believed they had successfully deluded Stalin into executing his best generals, in reality, they had merely served as useful and unwitting pawns of Stalin.{{clarification needed|date=April 2014}} It is notable that the forged documents were not even used by Soviet military prosecutors against the generals in their secret trial but instead relied on false confessions extorted or beaten out of the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;Lukes, Igor, ''Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Beneš in the 1930s'', Oxford University Press (1996), {{ISBN|0-19-510267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-510267-3}}, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Afraid of the consequences of trying popular generals and war heroes in a public forum, Stalin ordered the trial also be kept secret and for the defendants to be executed immediately following their court-martial.&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G. P. Putnam (1945), pp. 5, 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Tukhachevsky and his fellow defendants were probably tortured into confessions.&lt;ref&gt;Rayfield, Donald: ''Stalin and his hangmen: the tyrant and those who killed for him'' (New York: Random House, 2004), page 324&lt;/ref&gt;
 
All convicts were [[rehabilitate (Soviet)|rehabilitate]]d on January 31, 1957 for the "absence of essence of an offence". It was concluded that arrests, investigations and trials were performed in violation of procedural norms and based on [[forced confession]]s, in many cases obtained with the aid of physical violence.{{clarification needed|date=April 2014}}

==Unresolved issues==
===Reasons and motives===
There are no conclusive facts about the real rationale behind the forged trial. Over the years, researchers and historians put forth the following hypotheses:

The central hypothesis and the one with the widest support is that Stalin had simply decided to consolidate his power by eliminating any and all potential political or military rivals. Viewed from the broader context of the Great Terror which followed, the execution of the most popular and well-regarded generals in the [[Red Army]] command can be seen as a preemptive move by Stalin and [[Nikolai Yezhov]], People's Commissar of State Security, to eliminate a potential rival and source of opposition to their planned purge of the [[nomenklatura]]. The fall of the first eight generals was swiftly followed by the arrest of most of the People's Commissars, nearly all regional party secretaries, hundreds of Central Committee members and candidates and thousands of lesser CPSU officials. At the end, three of five Soviet Marshals, 90% of all Red Army generals, 80% of Red Army colonels and 30,000 officers of lesser rank had been purged. Virtually all were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarification needed|date=April 2014}}

At first, it was thought 25-50% of Red Army officers were purged, but it is now known to be 3.7-7.7%. Previously, the size of the Red Army officer corps was underestimated, and it was overlooked that most of those purged were merely expelled from the Party. 30% of officers purged 1937-9 were allowed back.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lee, European Dictatorships 1918-1945, page 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggestion is that Tukhachevsky and others indeed tried to conspire against Stalin. [[Leon Trotsky]], in his later works, argued that while it was impossible to speak conclusively about the plot, he saw indications in Stalin's mania for involvement in every detail of Red Army organization and logistics that the military had real reasons for dissent, which may have eventually led to a plot. However, the revelations of Stalin's actions following the release of Soviet archival information have now largely discredited this theory. While the military may well have had many secret reasons for their dislike of Stalin, there is now no credible evidence that any of them ever conspired to eliminate him.{{fact|date=January 2014}}

[[Victor Suvorov]] has claimed that the purge was intended to replace Red Army officers with more competent generals for his future conquests. For example, he claims that the ultimate reason why [[Tukhachevsky]] was killed is because he failed to conquer [[Poland]] during the Polish-Soviet War; despite this failure, Tukhachevsky had made a career in the party when he suppressed the [[Tambov rebellion]]. Suvorov compared the change of leadership in the Army as teeth of an shark: each new row is sharper than the previous one.

===Speedy inquest===
[[Vadim Rogovin]]'s book ''1937: Stalin's Year of Terror'' contains a lengthy discussion of another unexplained mystery: that it took only about two weeks to force [[admission (law)|admissions of guilt]] from the accused despite the fact that all of them were relatively young, able-bodied military trained people. Rogovin contrasts it with the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]], where the inquest lasted about four years, despite brutal tortures.

'''Coconstitutionalism''' is where two institutional cultures exist in a complex semi-autonomous relationship to each other. The model of asymmetrical [[devolution]] that has emerged in democratic [[Spain]] has been called "coconstitutional" in that it is neither a [[Federation|federal]] nor a [[Unitary state|unitary]] model of [[government]]: autonomous nation-regions exist alongside and within the Spanish [[nation-state]] in a relatively dynamic relationship.

Similarities to federalism are marked although a key difference lies in the legal status of a federal-state versus a notionally unitary coconstitutional one: in a federation, it is the states who legally transfer powers to the federal government (bottom up) whereas in a unitary state power is devolved from the nation-state down to the regions (top down) and can in theory be revoked. But in the case of Spain any such move by a future Spanish government could rekindle the [[Spanish Civil War]], the truth{{Says who|date=November 2011}} is such a move would probably require a constitutional amendment. Certainly a statue of autonomy (Spanish, ''Estatuto de autonomía'') cannot be abrogated nor modified save by an initiative of an autonomous regional Parliament—that being, of course, unlikely.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

Since 1997, the UK government has pursued a similar coconstitutional model of devolution with regard to its nation-regions.

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Malaysia.svg|150 px]]}}
According to a 2013 public survey in Malaysia by [[Transparency International]], a majority of the surveyed households perceived [[Malaysia]]n political parties to be highly corrupt.&lt;ref name="Global Corruption Barometer 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/malaysia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A quarter of the surveyed households consider the government's efforts in the fight against corruption to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Global Corruption Barometer 2013"/&gt; 

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 62nd place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business executives surveyed in the World Economic Forum's [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014 reveal that unethical behaviours of companies constitute a disadvantage for doing business in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=The World Economic Forum|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government contracts are sometimes awarded to well-connected companies, and the policies of awarding huge infrastructure projects to selected [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]] companies without open tender continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysia Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/malaysia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption Perceptions Index==
Corruption is a problem. Malaysia had a corruption score of 52 out of 100 (high scores are less corrupt); this makes Malaysia the 2nd "cleanest" country in SE Asia, 9th out of 28 in APAC and 50th of the 175 countries assessed worldwide.

Transparency International list Malaysia's key corruption challenges as:
# '''Political and Campaign Financing:''' Donations (e.g.: USD700Million) from both corporations and individuals to political parties and candidates are not limited in Malaysia. Political parties are also not legally required to report on what funds are spent during election campaigns. Due in part to this political landscape, Malaysia’s ruling party for over 55 years has funds highly disproportionate to other parties. This unfairly impacts campaigns in federal and state elections and can disrupt the overall functioning of a democratic political system.
# ''' “Revolving door”:''' Individuals regularly switch back and forth between working for both the private and public sectors in Malaysia. Such circumstances – known as the ‘revolving door’ – allow for active government participation in the economy and public-private relations to become elusive. The risk of corruption is high and regulating public-private interactions becomes difficult, also allowing for corruption to take place with impunity. Another factor which highlights the extent of ambiguity between the public sector and private corporate ownership is that Malaysia is also a rare example of a country where political parties are not restricted in possessing corporate enterprises.
# '''Access to information:''' As of April 2013, no federal Freedom of Information Act exists in Malaysia. Although, Selangor and Penang are the only Malaysian states out of thirteen to pass freedom of information legislation, the legislation still suffers from limitations. Should a federal freedom of information act be drafted it would conflict with the Official Secrets Act – in which any document can be officially classified as secret, making it exempt from public access and free from judicial review. Additional laws such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act, the Sedition Act 1949 (subsequently replaced with the National Harmony Act), and the Internal Security Act 1969 also ban the dissemination of official information and offenders can face fines or imprisonment.TI).&lt;ref name="IBR219"&gt;{{Cite book

In 2013, Malaysia was identified in a survey by Ernst and Young as one of the most corrupt countries in the region according to the perceptions of foreign business leaders, along with neighbouring countries and China. The survey asked whether it was likely that each country would take shortcuts to achieve economic targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malaysia-one-of-the-most-corrupt-nations-survey-shows&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of corruption ==

=== Corruption in Immigration Enforcement ===
Despite periodic actions by the government to crack down on petty corruption in the Immigration Department, bribe-taking and fraudulent issuance of visas has been a long-standing problem, particularly among immigration officers at the KLIA and KLIA2 terminals of Kuala Lumpur International Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-34479720080711|title=Malaysia cracks down on corruption at immigration|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecoverage.my/news/half-malaysian-immigration-officers-found-corrupt-dealing-directly-human-traffickers/|title=Over Half Of Malaysian Immigration Officers Found To Be Corrupt And Dealing Directly With Human Traffickers - The Coverage|website=thecoverage.my|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://annx.asianews.network/content/malaysia-immigration-department-signs-corruption-free-pledge-52845|title=Malaysia Immigration Department signs corruption-free pledge|last=Desk|first=The Star|date=2017-08-08|work=Asia News Network|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) uncovered a scheme in Selangor, in which immigration officers collected passport application fees from travelers and then submitted fraudulent paperwork declaring them disabled, resulting in fee waivers that amounted to over 1 million Malaysian ringgit by the time the scheme was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.malaymail.com/s/1290367/macc-immigration-officers-rm1m-passport-fraud-may-be-tip-of-iceberg|title=MACC: Immigration officers' RM1m passport fraud may be tip of iceberg {{!}} Malay Mail|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December, 2016 statement to the Malaysian press, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Samidi estimated that over half of the 1500 immigration officers working in the KLIA and KLIA2 terminals had participated in a range of corrupt practices, including fraudulent issuance of visas, tampering with Immigration Department data, and collusion with human-trafficking agents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Anti-corruption bodies ==
[[File:Putrajaya Malaysia Anti-Corruption Commission-01.jpg|thumb|Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission]]

The [[Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission]] (MACC) is a government agency in [[Malaysia]] that investigates and prosecutes corruption in the public and private sectors. The MACC was modelled after top anti-corruption agencies, such as the Hong Kong's [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] and the [[New South Wales]] [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]], Australia.&lt;ref name="pmo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.my/?menu=page&amp;page=1670|title=Government Directory: Prime Minister's Department|date=8 July 2011|publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Malaysia|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MACC is currently headed by Chief Commissioner Datuk Dzulkifli Ahmad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22397">'''Demoralization''' is, in a context of [[warfare]], [[national security]], and [[law enforcement]], a process in [[psychological warfare]] with the objective to erode [[morale]] among enemy [[combatants]] and/or [[noncombatants]]. That can encourage them to [[withdrawal (military)|retreat]], [[surrender (military)|surrender]], or [[defection|defect]] rather than defeating them in [[combat]].

Demoralization methods are [[military tactics]] such as [[hit-and-run attack]]s such as [[sniper]]s, disturbing the enemy with [[less-lethal weapons]] and [[incapacitating agent]]s, and [[intimidation]] such as display of [[force concentration]]. Some methods on the [[military strategy|strategic scale]] are [[commerce raiding]], [[strategic bombing]], static operations such as [[siege]]s and [[naval blockade]]s, and [[propaganda]].

==Importance of morale==

[[Morale]] is often perceived as a necessary precursor to success in international relations because success most often goes to those who believe in their cause, as they more easily maintain a positive outlook that contributes to their ability to work harder for the cause.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Angelo Codevilla and Paul Seabury, War: Ends and Means (Washington, D.C.: Potomac Books, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88}} High morale can directly contribute to "an economy of food, textiles, fuel, and other commodities, and to stimulate recruiting, employment in war industries, service in relief work, and the purchase of bonds."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Harold D. Lasswell, Propaganda Technique in World War I (Cambridge, MA: M.I.T. Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Writing in 1965, French philosopher and sociologist [[Jacques Ellul]] described the importance of morale in modern society by saying:

{{cquote|The modern citizen is asked to participate in wars such as have never been seen before. All men must prepare for war, and for a dreadful type of war at that – dreadful because of its duration, the immensity of its operations, its tremendous losses, and the atrocity of the means employed. Moreover, participation in war is no longer limited to the duration of the war itself; there is the period of preparation for war, which becomes more and more intense and costly. Then there is the period in which to repair the ravages of war. People really live in a permanent atmosphere of war, and a superhuman war in every respect. Nowadays everybody is affected by war; everybody lives under its threat…The more demanded of man, the more powerful must be those motivations.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|142}}}}
Though variations are possible, the most common indicators of high morale are determination, enthusiasm, self-confidence, and a relative absence of criticism or complaint.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|8}} While contributors to the level of morale are essentially endless, common examples consist of the level to which individuals identify with a nation or cause; have their basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter met; have confidence in the justness of their cause; have confidence in the ability of their cause to overcome obstacles; the means through which authorities instill discipline; and a sense of unity with other supporters of the cause.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

==Psychological warfare==
[[File:American Revolutionary War demoralization leaflet.jpeg|thumb|left|500px|[[American Revolutionary War]] leaflet attempting to demoralize the enemy by showing distinctions in the quality of life between the fighting forces.]]
In an environment in which two belligerents compete, the chances of success greatly diminish if those whose actions are necessary lack faith in the justness of the cause or its chance for success or are discouraged, morally defeated, disconsolate, antagonistic, sullen, inattentive, or lazy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|88}} Demoralization can be used to lessen the chances of success for an opponent by fostering these attitudes, and it can generally be done in one of two ways: demoralization through objective conditions or demoralization through perception.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

Demoralization through objective conditions most commonly takes the form of a military defeat on the battlefield that has tangible consequences directly resulting in the indicators of a demoralized party, but it can also result from an adverse physical environment where basic needs go unmet.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Demoralization through perception, however, is the most commonly referred to means of demoralization even though its operation and results like [[political warfare]] and [[psychological warfare]] in general, are the most difficult to gauge.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Dyer, The Weapon on the Wall: Rethinking Psychological Warfare (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1959), pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; That is the form of demoralization that is referred to as a tool of psychological warfare, and it is most commonly implemented through various forms of propaganda.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Propaganda as a tool of demoralization refers to influencing opinion through significant symbols, through means such as rumors, stories, pictures, reports, and other means of social communication.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|9}} Other means of political and psychological warfare, such as [[deception]], [[disinformation]], [[agents of influence]], or [[forgeries]],  may also be used to destroy morale through psychological means so that belligerents start questioning the validity of their beliefs and actions.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

==Means used==

While demoralization may use [[propaganda]], [[deception]], [[disinformation]], [[agents of influence]], [[forgeries]], or any other [[political warfare]] tool in isolation to accomplish its ends, a strategic demoralization effort will use more than one of these means as determined by its target and will not limit itself to the strict limits of attacking another belligerent's morale.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|161}} A strategic demoralization campaign will navigate what Harold D. Lasswell describes as roughly three avenues of implementation: divert the hatred normally directed towards the enemy, thereby denying a unified outlet of frustration; sow seeds of self-doubt (classic demoralization); and provide a new focus of hatred and frustration.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|184}}

A strategic demoralization campaign should tailor its strategy to the specific target and situation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163–177}}

An important precursor to successful demoralization is an effort to deny the target the ability to project frustrations and hatred upon a common enemy.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|162}} Such efforts will affect the tendency of the target's citizenry to project their discontent towards a common enemy identified by their government.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|162}} As a result, frustrations will build until it is necessary to divert them elsewhere, and seeds of doubt are then sown in the minds of the citizenry who now question the capability of their leadership in identifying the most ominous threat.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|162–163}}

The operations of the German ''Gazette des Ardennes'', published in occupied areas of France during World War I, are an example of this aspect of strategic demoralization.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|161–162}} The ''Gazette des Ardennes'' regularly published propaganda articles that sought to deny the French of a German enemy image.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|162}} Articles would carry such themes as: the [[Kaiser]] has always been known and respected for promoting peace, even among the British and French intellectual elite; the Kaiser is a kind and gentle family man; "all the stories about the German barbarities are poisonous lies"; German occupying soldiers are kind to and loved by French children; and Germans have an irrepressible love of music, religion, and morality that permeates wherever they are.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|162–163}} The themes are illustrative of "defense by denial".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163}}

Also possible to use is "defense by admission accompanied by justification".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163}} The  technique would make the ''Gazette des Ardennes'' admit that a German atrocity occurred but then publish accounts that the event was exaggerated in earlier reports, that such events occurred in every army, and occurred least often in the German army.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163}}

Articles that attempted to justify German [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] as an unavoidable consequence of the British blockade are also examples of defense by admission and justification.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163}}

===Sowing seeds of doubt and anxiety===
Causing self-doubt or doubt in a cause is the simple definition most commonly ascribed to demoralization.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|189}} It is only one aspect of a successful strategic demoralization campaign but is the most pronounced and essential part.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|164}}

As noted by Lasswell, "the keynote in the preliminary spade work is the unceasing refrain: Your cause is hopeless. Your blood is spilt in vain."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|164}} Propaganda can be an indispensable tool in fostering an environment of doubt and anxiety.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|89-90}}

Propaganda may be used to ensure the [[antagonist]] is the most feared party, give a feeling of nonworth to the target, exploit internal fissures inherent within the target group or use the element of surprise to show a target population that their leadership and cause are unable to protect them from the impending enemy threat.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|89-90}}

Many studies have been conducted that indicate [[fear]] is one of the most widespread psychological traits, and that trait can be manipulated for the purposes of demoralization if it can be expanded into [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Jacques Ellul, Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes (New York, NY: Vintage Books, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|153}}

For anxiety to demoralize, it must result in a distancing of individuals or groups from their cause or leadership because they no longer believe them capable of offering a solution to the source of their anxiety.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|153}} Real and conscious threats that normally inspire disquiet and fear can be made to cause anxiety and borderline [[neurosis]] through the use of such propaganda tools as [[fables]] and [[rumors]].&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}}

Using multiple tools of political warfare, such as deception, disinformation, agents of influence, or forgeries, can expedite the onset of anxiety by overwhelming the target with a constant onslaught of information that the current cause or leadership is incapable of relieving the anxiety now felt.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}} That anxiety cannot be calmed through a rational explanation of facts and is exacerbated by such an approach.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}} The newly-onset anxiety places mass groups of individuals on the border of neurosis and can make them feel conflicts inherent within society or their past.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}}

As a result of contradictions and threats, "man feels accused, guilty."&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|155}} The target will then begin their search for a cause that will provide a sense of righteousness.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}} The pivotal moment of a successful demoralization campaign is when the target is doubt-ridden and anxious, the point at which individual members of a citizenry or group are detached from their current loyalty to their state or cause, and they are then able to be focused in another direction more suitable to the antagonist's needs.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163}}&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}}

If not done properly, the manufactured sense of anxiety can both backfire on antagonists and cause the subject to cling more closely to their original cause or government.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|153}}

===Diverting frustrations and hatred to a new target===
The most powerful strategy of demoralization is diversion, but that is an extremely difficult and multifaceted operation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163}} Lasswell notes, "To undermine the active hatred of the enemy for its present antagonist, his anger must be distracted to a new and independent object, beside which his present antagonist ceases to matter."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163}} 

Because it is such a distinct change, the diversion of hatred towards a new target is necessarily predicated upon the antagonist both diverting hatred away from themselves and fostering a level of anxiety that cannot be mitigated by their existing cause or leadership.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|163}}

Once antagonists met the two precursors of demoralization, it is possible to "concentrate upon the particular object of animosity about which it is hoped to polarize the sentiment of the enemy."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|167}} The diversion of hatred can be towards an ally, towards the end may's government or governing class, or towards antistate sentiment to foster secession of minority nationalities if they exist.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|167–184}}

The attempt to exacerbate relations between allies is one method of diverting hatred from an enemy and was attempted by both the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] and [[Central Powers]] in World War I.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|167–168}} The Germans made efforts to dig up historical animosity between the French and British, using such themes as the British were just letting the French bleed for them and the British intended to stay on French soil, and they offered a German-French alliance against the British and to expand French colonial domain at the expense of the British Empire.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|167–168}}

Meanwhile, the Allies tried to exacerbate the relationship between Austria-Hungary and Germany, using such themes as separate peace talks were being held with Austria-Hungary, Austria-Hungary had a plethora of food while Germans starved, Germans thought of Austrians as slaves, and the familiar promise of territorial expansion if Austria-Hungary abandoned their German alliance.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|168–169}}

The antagonist can also attempt to divert hatred and frustration upon the target's government or ruling class, the most widely attempted method.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|169}} One technique of diverting such frustration is to convince a target that their government or leadership is committing unjust and immoral acts, which is especially effective if the antagonist can convince their target that their leadership has forced them to commit equally unjust and immoral acts out of trickery or desperation.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

If successfully and fully implemented, the leadership of a cause can be made sufficiently troublesome to inspire revolution when there will be insufficient capacity to exercise active hatred towards the external enemy.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|169}} Diverting frustration to one's own leadership is often the method most commonly seen in wartime propaganda, as the photographs below attest. With the implementation of modern warfare in World War I and all its associated stresses, "every belligerent took a hand in the perilous business of fomenting dissension and revolution abroad, reckless of the possible repercussions of a successful revolt."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|169}}

Examples from World War I included German forces providing revolutionary literature to Russian prisoners of war that were expected to return through exchange or release, French use of propaganda leaflets to demonstrate how unaffected by war the Kaiser and his family were, technical encouragement and amplification of national dissent, Wilsonian propaganda stressing peaceful settlement terms, British planting of stories attesting to underground German resistance movements and their subsequent oppression by the German government, propaganda deflecting war guilt, propaganda exposing or exaggerating the desired postwar peace terms, and the promotion of the belief that infidelity was rampant among soldiers and their families back home.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|169–173}}

Finally, the antagonist can attempt to divert frustration towards the growth of [[secessionist]] causes, which is possible in heterogeneous nations.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|173}} Attempts are made to fan the flames of discontent one segment of the nation feels towards another.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|173}}

An example was the ''Congress of Oppressed Habsburg Nationalities'' in Rome in April 1918, all delegates signing a ''Declaration of Independence''. Or actions were widely reported in US and European circles.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|175–178}} Another successful example of this was the encouragement of [[Zionism]] as a means of securing Jewish support for World War I via the [[Balfour Declaration]]. The Central Powers likewise tried to encourage Ukrainian, Irish, Egyptian, North African, and Indian secessionist movements, but all efforts ultimately failed.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|175–178}}

==Tactics==

There are many tactics of pursuing a strategy of demoralization, the nature of the target and the environment at the time determining the best method to employ.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|164–167}} Below is a nonexhaustive list to demonstrate tactics of pursuing demoralization, but any tactic of political and psychological warfare may be used in pursuit of demoralization as appropriate, to the situation:
* Insertions into neutral press&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}
* Direct transmission (through publications or radio)&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}
* Books and pamphlets (such as ''[[J’accuse]]'')&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}
* Forgeries, whether forged letters from home inspiring homesickness or forged government documents&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}
* Tactical delivery systems (airplane or balloon drops, "trench mortars")&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}
* Smuggling (use of printed propaganda for packing materials, camouflaging propaganda to appear as currency so it may be carried about freely)&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}
* Deception&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}
* Disinformation&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}
* Agents of influence&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|178–184}}

==Defense against demoralization==
: ''Every message that resistance shall end, is false.'' - &lt;small&gt;''[[If the war comes]]'', a Swedish information folder first issued in 1943&lt;/small&gt;
Morale can be difficult to maintain, in large part by the diffuse nature of demoralization attacks, but a strong leadership can largely mitigate any such attacks against their group's morale.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|89–90}} Morale will quickly deteriorate if members of the group perceive themselves as victims of injustice or indifference on part of their leadership, or they perceive their leadership as being acting ineptly, ignorantly, or for personal ambition.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|88}}

As noted by Angello Codevilla, the clearest indicators that morale can withstand a demoralization campaign are also hallmarks of a well-led organization, and can be explained through five main questions:
* Do the constituent parts of the group fear their own leadership more than the enemy? That can be either an authoritarian type of fear or a more democratic type of fear in which the members of a group fear contributing to the failure of their cause.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|89}}
* Do the constituent parts of the group feel appreciated by their leadership? No human will work to their full potential if they do not feel appreciated, but those who feel appreciated will contribute remarkable amounts, including sacrifice of life.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|89}}
* Do the constituent parts of the group feel their contributions are important, and others depend on their continued effort towards the cause? That is dependent on leadership engendering a hope of success if all members does their part, but excess attempts to inspire can invite cynicism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|89}}
* Do the constituent parts of the group have habits of loyalty and camaraderie? If so, high morale can be maintained in the most difficult circumstances out of a desire to avoid disappointing or endangering others.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|89}}
* Do the constituent parts of the group have faith in their leaders and the chances of success? As Codevilla notes, "If the two disappear, soldiers tend to believe they have been sold out and throw away their weapons." Credibility is the bedrock of defense against demoralization, but unwelcome surprise is the greatest threat to morale.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|90}}

==Examples==
* [[Chieu Hoi]], a South Vietnamese campaign for defection from the [[Viet Cong]].
* [[Operation Nifty Package]], where the American military used loud music to encourage General [[Noriega]] to surrender.
* [[Tokyo Rose]], a Japanese broadcaster who used a radio show to demoralize American soldiers in the Pacific.

The '''Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department''' (ETLLD) was a former [[Scottish Executive]] [[Ministry (government department)|department]] responsible for [[Scottish economy|economic and industrial development]], [[Scottish education|further and higher education]], skills, [[lifelong learning]], [[Energy in Scotland|energy]], [[Transport in Scotland|transport]] and [[digital connectivity]] until 2007.

[[Philip Rycroft]] was appointed head of the department in May 2006 following the retirement of [[Eddie Frizzell]]. Rycroft was previously Head of Schools Group within the [[Scottish Executive Education Department]].

It was the only Scottish Executive department based in [[Glasgow]].

The [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth]] (currently [[John Swinney]] MSP), assisted by the [[Minister for Transport and Infrastructure]] (currently [[Keith Brown (Scottish politician)|Keith Brown]] MSP) and the [[Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism]] ([[Jim Mather]] MSP) has responsibility for the Enterprise and Transport elements of the current Directorates. The [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]] (currently [[Michael Russell (politician)|Mike Russell]] MSP) has responsibility for the Lifelong Learning portfolio.

ETLLD was formerly the '''Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department''' but was extended in May 2003 to include responsibility for Transport, in recognition of transport's crucial importance to economic growth.

After the SNP won office in 2007, the Department was scrapped and replaced by the [[Education and Lifelong Learning Directorates]].

The '''Equality Party''' ({{lang-fr|Parti Égalité}}) was a political party in [[Quebec]], Canada, that promoted the use of [[English language|English]] in Quebec on an equal basis with [[French language|French]].  Four Equality Party members were elected to Quebec's [[Quebec National Assembly|National Assembly]] in [[Quebec general election, 1989|1989]], as part of an [[English-speaking Quebecer|anglophone]] reaction to changes made by the governing [[Liberal Party of Quebec|Liberals]] to [[Bill 101|Quebec's language law]].  The party had no success in subsequent elections, and stopped organizing after the [[Quebec general election, 2003|2003 Quebec election]].

==History==

=== Foundation to 1989 election ===
The party was formed in 1989 as a reaction to then-Premier [[Robert Bourassa]] invoking the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|"Notwithstanding clause"]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] to override a [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] ruling overturning parts of the [[Charter of the French Language]] (commonly known as "Bill 101").  The court ruling would have allowed languages other than French to appear on store signs and outdoor advertising; the government instead allowed other languages only on small signs inside shops.  Another issue that fed Equality Party support was the [[Liberal Party of Quebec|Quebec Liberal Party]]'s forcing [[English-speaking Quebecer|anglophone]] Members of the [[Quebec National Assembly]] (MNAs) to condemn a report from the [[Official Languages Commissioner]] suggesting Quebec anglophones felt "humiliated" by laws such as Bill 101.

The Equality Party's platform called for equality of both languages (French and English) in Quebec, opposing Bill 101 which made French the sole official language of Quebec, imposed restrictions on the use of English on public signs, and required children to attend school in French unless one of their parents went to school in English in Canada.  The Equality Party drew virtually all of its support from elements of Quebec's [[English-speaking Quebecker|anglophone]] minority, and only ran candidates in electoral districts with very high anglophone populations.

The party first came to prominence in the [[Quebec general election, 1989|1989 general election]], when it won four seats on [[Montreal Island]] in the National Assembly with 3.7% of the popular vote. Along with its then-sister party, the [[Unity Party (Quebec)|Unity Party]] (which ran candidates outside the Montreal Island), it won 4.7% of the provincial popular vote. The winning candidates were [[Gordon Atkinson (Canadian politician)|Gordon Atkinson]], [[Neil Cameron (Quebec politician)|Neil Cameron]], [[Richard Holden (politician)|Richard Holden]] and party leader [[Robert Libman]], who won popular votes ranging from 41 per cent to 58 percent in their respective ridings.

=== In the National Assembly 1989-1994 ===
The party did not receive [[official party status]] in Quebec's National Assembly, being eight members short of the required twelve necessary for recognition, nor had they received 20% of the popular vote which would have otherwise qualified them for official status. The Liberals and Parti Quebecois agreed that the Equality Party caucus would receive some of the privileges of an "official party", including  having their members' seats in the National Assembly placed together and office space allocated close to each other, as well as some research funding; however, they were not allocated a guaranteed number of questions in the National Assembly's daily [[Question Period]], meaning that their opportunity to speak was left to the Speaker's discretion.  (This arrangement was repeated in later elections when [[Action Democratique du Quebec]] won fewer seats in the National Assembly than required for official status).

The four members took an active role in National Assembly debates, most notably when Party leader Robert Libman made headlines by using his [[Parliamentary privilege]] to reveal the details of confidential, money-losing contracts signed between [[Hydro-Québec]] and some of Quebec's aluminum producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurentianweb.com/hydro1.htm Christopher Goodfellow, "The need to know, the right to know, and hydro" (May 13, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party voted against Bill 150, a law providing for a [[referendum]] on [[Quebec sovereignty|sovereignty for Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;ots=R-0l9QMuOQ&amp;dq=%22bill%20150%22%20%22equality%20party%22&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bill%20150%22%20%22equality%20party%22&amp;f=true G. Stevenson, ''Community Besieged'', p.276]&lt;/ref&gt; (which was later cancelled in favour of a referendum on the [[Charlottetown Accord]]).

The [[Unity Party (Quebec)|Unity Party]] merged with the Equality Party on May 7, 1990,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/provincial/rapeq/political-parties-details.php?p=52 Director General of Elections]&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the party's membership to what the party reported as 16,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=pw#hl=en&amp;q=%22Unity+Party%22+%22Equality+Party%22+16000+members&amp;rlz=1R2ADRA_enBM339&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp&amp;fp=cb0deeeba5c1c027 R. Libman, '''Riding the Rapids''']&lt;/ref&gt;  The party's published financial statements, however, reported that only $7795 in membership dues were collected in 1990, down 75% from 1989 and enough to account for only 1,559 dues-paying members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quebecpolitique.com/partis-politiques/les-partis/parti-egalite/ Quebecpolitique.com: "Parti égalité: Membership du Parti"]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 onward, the party suffered from frequent and public infighting, clashing over personalities and over issues such as whether to support the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]]. This peaked when [[Richard Holden (politician)|Richard Holden]], Equality MNA for the overwhelmingly Anglophone [[Westmount]] riding, left the party and eventually defected to the [[Parti Québécois]], a party which had little support in Westmount due to its support of Bill 101 and Quebec independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=©&amp;nbsp;The Gazette (Montreal) 2005 |url=http://www.wednesday-night.com/RichardHolden.asp |title=Richard Holden on DTNicholson's |publisher=Wednesday-night.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Three of the Equality Party's four elected members, including Libman, the party's leader, quit the party before the next election.

In addition to the infighting and defections, the Equality Party's ''raison d'être'' arguably vanished when the government amended the Charter of the French Language in 1993 to allow for more prominent English language text on commercial signs, so that the law no longer needed the use of the "notwithstanding clause" to withstand constitutional challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/518699551.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+07%2C+1993&amp;author=Robert+McKenzie+Toronto+Star&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Language+bill+sparks+new+battle+in+Quebec&amp;pqatl=google Toronto Start (May 7, 1993) p.A-1.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Furthermore, opinion polls prior to the 1994 election showed a close race between the two largest parties (the Liberals and the [[Parti Québécois]]), with the PQ explicitly promising an [[Quebec referendum, 1995|independence referendum]] if it was victorious. All of these factors encouraged Equality Party voters from 1989 to switch their support back to the Liberals in 1994.

=== Post-1994 activities ===
The Equality Party never repeated its electoral success of 1989.  Cameron, the party's sole remaining MNA, was defeated in the [[Quebec general election, 1994|1994 general election]].  Two subsequent general elections in [[Quebec general election, 1998|1998]] and [[Quebec general election, 2003|2003]] did nothing to improve the party's fortunes.

The party continued to exist for another decade in a desultory fashion.  Its remaining members held meetings, maintained a website and ran candidates for office until 2003.  During these years, the party promoted political positions such as the reversal of the [[Montreal Merger|2002 municipal mergers]] on the [[island of Montreal]]. Following the party's poor showing in the 2003 election, its leader, Keith Henderson, announced he would resign once a new leader was chosen, which never occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050306010247/http://www.equality.qc.ca/index.html#%22A%20sad%20day%20for%20civil%20rights%22 Equality Party press release (Apr. 15, 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; The party stopped holding meetings, updating its website or running candidates in elections, but continued to file annual reports with the [[Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec|Director General of Elections]]&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., {{cite web |author=Director General of Elections of Quebec |url=http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/documents/pdf/etats-financiers/2011/PE-E-fin-2011.pdf |title=Equality Party financial statements 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; until it was removed from the list of registered political parties at the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgeq.qc.ca/english/provincial/rapeq/political-parties.php Director General of Elections (list of registered political parties)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a group attempted to restart the party under the name of "Equality Party 2.0 - Parti Égalité 2.0", but abandoned efforts due to lack of support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjad.com/blog/BarryMorganShow/blogentry.aspx?BlogEntryID=10527252 CJAD Blog (March 5, 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26911">Following the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1990s, the [[Russian Navy]] struggled to adjust [[Cold War]] force structures while suffering severely with insufficient maintenance and a lack of funding. However, improvements in the [[Economy of Russia|Russian economy]] over the last decade have seen a significant rise in defence expenditure and an increase in the numbers of ships under construction with a focus on [[Blue-water navy|blue-water vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/22350.htm Project 22350 Admiral Sergei Gorshkov]. Globalsecurity.org. Retrieved on 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive rearmament program was implemented since 2011, with the Russian [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Defence Ministry]] expected to procure 100 warships by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=11583|title=Russian Navy to procure 100 ships by 2020|website=rusnavy.com|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase of 20 submarines, 35 corvettes and 15 frigates is planned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rianovosti.com/mlitary_news/20121031/177088634.html&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the other 30 ships is as yet unknown. The Black Sea Fleet will receive 18 new surface ships and submarines, including {{Sclass2-|Kilo|submarine}}, {{Sclass-|Admiral Grigorovich|frigate}}s, and {{Sclass-|Ivan Gren|landing ship}}. There are also plans to lay down [[Buyan class corvette|Project 21631]] small missile boats and [[Steregushchy class corvette|''Steregushchiy'' class]] corvettes. This state arms program also provided funds for the purchase of two [[Mistral class|''Mistral'' class]] assault ships. Furthermore, older vessels such as the [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirov'' class battlecruisers]] reportedly would also undergo overhauls and modernisation to bring them back into active service after spending over a decade laid up in reserve.

In early 2013 it was reported that the navy was to receive 54 new warships of various classes and 24 submarines by 2020.&lt;ref name="en.rian.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.rian.ru/military_news/20130311/179945052/Russian-Navy-to-Receive-24-Subs-54-Warships-by-2020.html |title=Russian Navy to Receive 24 Subs, 54 Warships by 2020.  |publisher=en.rian.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major surface combatants==

===Future aircraft carriers===
In 2005, it was announced that the Russian Navy was planning a class of two to four new [[aircraft carrier]]s, the production of which could start in 2013–14 for initial service entry in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Interfax, [http://www.milavia.net/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=40ebe4460c357531cef30781524bec37&amp;topic=67.msg340#msg340 Russia Developing New Aircraft Carrier], May 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Jane's said it was not clear whether "this was a funded programme". In mid-2007, the new Navy chief announced plans to reform the country's naval forces and build a [[blue-water navy]] with the world's second largest fleet of aircraft carriers, aiming to create 6 aircraft carrier strike groups in the next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20071113/87843710.html Opinion &amp; analysis: Will Russia create the world's second largest surface navy?] [[RIA Novosti]] Retrieved on April 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian President [[Dmitriy Medvedev]] stated in 2008 that Russia intended to build nuclear [[aircraft carrier]]s in the next decade. However Russia currently does not have a yard capable of building aircraft carriers. All previous Soviet aircraft carriers were built in what was then known as the [[Black Sea Shipyard|Nikolayev South Shipyard]] (Shipyard 444) at [[Mykolaiv|Nikolayev]] in what is now [[Ukraine]]. On August 2, 2010, [[Vladimir Vysotsky (Admiral)|Vladimir Vysotskiy]] stressed their importance: "If, for example, we do not have an aircraft carrier in the North, the combat capability of the Northern Fleet's guided-missile submarines will be reduced to zero after Day One because the submarines' principal adversary is aviation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2010/russia-100802-rianovosti03.htm Russian aircraft carrier blueprint to be ready by year end – Navy chief]&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in [[Saint Petersburg]] on June 30, 2011, the head of United Shipbuilding Corporation, a Russian state holding company, said his company expected to begin design work for a new carrier in 2016, with a goal of beginning construction in 2018 and having the carrier achieve initial operational capability by 2023.&lt;ref&gt;RIA NOVOSTI, [http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20110630/164924604.html "Russia to build Nuclear Aircraft Carrier by 2023"] 30 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, on 3 November 2011 the Russian newspaper ''Izvestiya'' reported the naval building plan now included (first) the construction of a new shipyard capable of building large hull ships, after which Moscow will build four nuclear-powered aircraft carriers by 2023. The spokesperson said one carrier would be assigned to the Russian Navy's Northern Fleet at [[Murmansk]], and the second would be stationed with the Pacific Fleet at [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref&gt;BarentsObserver.com, {{cite web |url=http://www.barentsobserver.com/russia-to-build-two-aircraft-carriers.4980466-58932.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406191508/http://www.barentsobserver.com/russia-to-build-two-aircraft-carriers.4980466-58932.html |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }} 3 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Russian media said that the [[Krylov State Research Center]] in St. Petersburg was on its way towards developing another aircraft carrier. The design was under conceptual testing in Krylov’s laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/russia-claims-its-developing-massive-aircraft-carrier-2015-2|title=Russia claims it's in the early stages of developing an aircraft carrier that can hold 100 planes|first=Jeremy|last=Bender|date=11 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no announcement of what shipyard would be able to build the carrier. The super-carrier project has been code-named [[Project 23000E]] or "Shtorm".&lt;ref name="Janes  14May15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/51452/russia-developing-shtorm-supercarrier |title=Russia developing Shtorm supercarrier  |author=Nikolai Novichkov |date=14 May 2015 |website=IHS Jane's Defence Weekly |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program appears temporarily suspended or slowed down.

===Cruisers===
Modernization of existing [[Kirov-class battlecruiser]] heavy missile cruisers is ongoing with work continuing on the ''Admiral Nakhimov'' at Severodvinsk. 
Construction of the fourth [[Slava-class cruiser]] has been suspended for some 20 years at the shipyard in Ukraine.  Not likely to ever be completed.
[[Lider-class destroyer|Project 23560]] Lider-class class multi-purpose cruiser/destroyer is in design development.

===Destroyers===

{{Main|Lider-class destroyer}}
In 2014 it was reported that the specification had been signed off for a new anti-air destroyer. Twelve ships of the 10,000 tonne ''Lider''-class are planned to enter service, split between the Northern and Pacific Fleets. There will be versions powered by nuclear or conventional power and they will carry the ABM-capable [[S-500 (missile)|S-500]] SAM and Kalibr (SS-N-30) and ([[SS-N-27]]) cruise missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/755539 | title=New-generation missile destroyer under development in Russia| date=21 October 2014 | accessdate=28 October 2014| publisher=TASS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leader-class destroyer|Lider-class destroyer]] concept is a project of JSC Severnoye. In May 2015, Jane's reported that the [[Krylov State Research Center]] has also developed the [[Project 23560]] destroyer design concept. 

Initial reporting said that the ships would enter service in 2023-2025. In January 2018 however it was reported that detailed design phase will start after 2020 and construction in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/2018/january-2018-navy-naval-defense-news/5851-work-on-project-23560-destroyer-detailed-design-to-begin-in-russia-after-2020.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frigates===

An initial order of six Project 22350M {{Sclass-|Admiral Gorshkov|frigate}} are under construction for the Russian Navy. The Northern Shipyard has thus far announced having received orders for six units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=18.03.2011 |url=http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=11776 |title=Severnaya Verf will build 17 warships for Russian Navy |publisher=Rusnavy.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the class, [[Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov|''Admiral Gorshkov'']] was laid down in 2006, launched on 29 October 2010 and originally planned to be delivered by 2012.&lt;ref name="rusnavy4"&gt;{{cite web|author=19.04.2011 |url=http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=12053 |title=Corvette Boiky was launched in St. Petersburg |publisher=Rusnavy.com |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second unit has been launched, the third and fourth are under construction.  As of June 2017 the ''Admiral Gorshkov'', lead ship of class, is undergoing trials with delivery to the fleet expected by year's end.

In addition, six {{Sclass-|Admiral Grigorovich|frigate}} were ordered and under construction at Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad, with the first laid down on 18 December 2010 and scheduled for delivery by 2013. These frigates will all serve in the [[Black Sea Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vz.ru/news/2011/9/14/522433.html |title=ВЗГЛЯД / ОСК и Минобороны подписали контракт о поставке фрегатов проекта 11356 |publisher=Vz.ru |date=2011-09-14 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=14.12.2010 |url=http://flot.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=60278 |title=Фрегаты для Черноморского флота все же будут заложены еще в этом году |publisher=Flot.com |date=2010-12-14 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead ship, the ''Admiral Grigorovich'', was commissioned on 11 March 2016.

[[Jane's Defence Weekly]] and NavyRecognition.com reported in March and January 2015 respectively that the [[Project 20385]] (Gremyashchy), [[Project 21631]] (Buyan-M), [[Project 22350]] (Admiral Gorshkov), and [[Project 11356]]M (Admiral Grigorovich) class corvettes and frigates are dependent on German and Ukrainian engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2015-news/january-2015-navy-naval-forces-defense-industry-technology-maritime-security-global-news/2377-russia-to-lay-down-two-new-project-20380-corvettes-instead-of-improved-version-project-20385.html|title=Russia To Lay Down Two New Project 20380 Corvettes Instead Of Improved Version Project 20385|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects 20385 and 21631 use German diesel engines, while the 22350 and 11356M use Ukrainian-assembled turbines.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas de Larrinaga, 'Russia lays down two more Project 20380 corvettes, JDW, 4 March 2015, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the sanctions and standoff over the [[War in Ukraine]], these components may not be available from 2015. As a result, two more [[Steregushchiy class corvette]]s, the seventh and eighth of the class, were laid down in February 2015. The Steregushchiy class uses Russian-built Kolomna engines.

The ''Gremyashchiy'' was launched on 30 June 2017.

==Submarines==
The State Arms Program 2011–2020 was expected to build and deliver up to 24 submarines (both nuclear and conventional) to the Russian Navy.&lt;ref name="en.rian.ru"/&gt;

'''Borey SSBN'''

[[File:K-535 Yuri Dolgorukiy at sea trials.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian submarine Yury Dolgorukiy|''Yuriy Dolgorukiy'']] is a [[Borei class submarine|''Borey'' class submarine]], one of the two nuclear submarine classes (the other being the [[Yasen-class submarine|''Yasen'' Class attack submarine]] the Russian Navy has ordered).]]

Three boats of the {{sclass2-|Borei|submarine|0}} ballistic missile submarines were initially under construction, the first was under construction since 1996 with completion was expected in 2008. The lead boat, ''Yuriy Dolgorukiy'', was launched in April 2007, began sea trials in June 2009 and was commissioned as a part of the Northern Fleet in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navaltoday.com/2012/06/26/ssbn-yury-dolgoruky-joins-russian-navy-till-july-29/|title=SSBN Yury Dolgoruky Joins Russian Navy Till July 29|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossiyskaya Gazeta Online Retrieved on June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The second boat, ''Aleksandr Nevskiy'' was scheduled to be delivered to the Pacific Fleet in 2012 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=11052|title=Construction of SSBN Alexander Nevsky will cost RUR 23 bln shipbuilder|website=rusnavy.com|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The third was named ''Vladimir Monomakh''. The ''Yuriy Dolgorukiy'' is operational with the Northern Fleet, while the ''Aleksandr Nevskiy'' and ''Vladimir Monomakh'' serve in the Pacific Fleet.  The fourth unit was scheduled to be laid down in 2010. The mainstay of the SSBN force, the Delta IVs, joined the fleet during 1985–91. While the service life of an SSBN normally is twenty to twenty-five years, without maintenance, it may be as short as ten to fifteen years.&lt;ref name="Mikhail Tsypkin 2002, p.13"&gt;Mikhail Tsypkin, Rudderless in a Storm: The Russian Navy 1992–2002, B58, Conflict Studies Research Centre, RMA Sandhurst, December 2002, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of 2017 with three units operation and the fourth ''Knyaz Vladimir'' launched, an additional four units are under construction on the ways at SEVMASH, Severodvinsk.

Before 2012 there were only about ten nuclear submarine patrols a year, each lasting three months at most and usually a lot less.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matthewaid.com/post/109969010611/after-years-of-neglect-russias-navy-is-shrinking&lt;/ref&gt; Most have not gone far from Russian waters and some were by recently built SSNs (nuclear attack subs) or SSGNs (SSNs equipped with cruise missiles) and not by SSBNs.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

'''Yasen SSN'''

12 {{sclass2-|Yasen|submarine}} nuclear attack submarines are to be delivered to the Russian Navy. ''Severodvinsk'', keel laid down on 21 December 1993, was the first boat of the class slated for launch in 1998 delayed due to problems in financing. In 1996 work on the submarine appeared to have stopped completely. Some reports suggested that as of 1999 the submarine was less than 10 percent completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/885.htm |title=Graney Class – Project 885 Yasen |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the project received additional funding and the work of finishing the submarine continued. In 2004 it was reported that the work on the submarine was moving forward, but due to the priority given to the new {{sclass2-|Borei|submarine}}, ''Severodvinsk'', the lead unit of the ''Yasen'' class would not be ready before 2010. In July 2006 the deputy chairman of the Military-Industrial Commission, Vladislav Putilin, stated that two ''Yasen''-class submarines were to join the Russian Navy before 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.ru/content/russia-chooses-its-future-armament |title=Russia Chooses Its Future Armament &amp;#124; Авиатранспортное обозрение |publisher=Ato.ru |date=14 March 2006 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 2009 the work on a second Yasen submarine, named ''Kazan'', was started. On 26 July the [[Russian navy|Russian navy command]] announced that one multipurpose submarine would be laid down every year, not necessarily of this class, starting in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090726/155627360.html |title=Russia to lay down one multipurpose submarine a year from 2011 &amp;#124; Russia &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=26 July 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of the first boat of this class and the beginning of sea trials was reported in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20110912/166792371.html |title=Russia's new attack submarine goes for sea trials &amp;#124; Defense &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2011 Russia signed a contract for four additional ''Yasen'' class submarines to be delivered by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=bmpd November 10th, 2011 |url=http://bmpd.livejournal.com/105985.html |title=bmpd - Мегаконтракты ОСК |publisher=Bmpd.livejournal.com |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of mid-2017 the ''Severodvinsk'' is operational, ''Kazan'' has been launched, and four additional units are under construction.

'''Kilo'''

Following on from the success of the Kilo class submarines, improved design Project 636.3 units are being built for the Russian Navy. Six {{Sclass2-|Improved Kilo|submarine}}s have been built for the Black Sea Fleet, and work has begun on six additional units for the Pacific Fleet.

The first of an unknown number of new {{Sclass-|Ivan Gren|landing ship}} class of amphibious ships was laid down in 2004 and was launched in May 2012. The ship will be delivered to the Navy in 2013. The ''Ivan Gren'' was delivered to the Navy in June 2018. &lt;ref&gt;http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_05_18/75195164/&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010 it was announced that work on a second unit had begun.&lt;ref name="fc 2010"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.flot.com/nowadays/concept/reforms/moderizationprograms-2010 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118064828/http://flot.com/nowadays/concept/reforms/moderizationprograms-2010/ |archive-date=2010-11-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphibious assault ships===
Russian officials negotiated a purchase of four {{Sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship}}s. On 24 May 2010, the Russian Defense Minister said that Russia was in pre-contract discussions with Spain, the Netherlands, and France on purchasing four ''Mistral''-class ships.  It was planned to have one ship built abroad, two with the participation of Russian shipbuilders, and at least one built in Russia. The Minister also said that the first ships of this type would be based in the Northern and Pacific Fleets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rian.ru/defense_safety/20100524/237875198.html Минобороны РФ планирует закупить четыре вертолетоносца типа "Мистраль" | Оборона и безопасность|Лента новостей "РИА Новости"]. Rian.ru. Retrieved on 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 24, 2010, Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev announced France as the winner of a tender to build four ''Mistral''-class ships for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20101224/161921890.html|title=France wins tender to build warships for Russia (Update 1)|first=|last=Sputnik|website=en.rian.ru|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the MISTRAL project continued it was plagued with controversy with arguments that the ships are not required, that Russian ship builders could have built a similar vessel and that they cost too much. In January 2013, Russian Deputy Prime Minister for the Defence Industry [[Dmitriy Rogozin]] was critical about the purchase of French helicopter carriers Mistral. The contracts signed in 2011 had been also criticized by first deputy head of the Military-Industrial Commission [[Ivan Kharchenko]], who blamed former [[Defence Minister]] [[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]. "It is very strange that we, given our climate, are purchasing ships to transport troops that do not work at temperatures below seven degrees," Rogozin said at a general meeting of the Academy of Military Sciences on Saturday 26 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:null&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1440F23BC34E2D18&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggdocs&amp;req_dat=787B728BE4FF4EEE919E134595DD9ADE|title=Russian deputy PM sceptical about usability of French warships|website=docs.newsbank.com|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2013 it was announced that the second Mistral-class helicopter carrier would be named ''Sevastopol'' and join Russia's [[Black Sea Fleet]] in 2017. It was speculated that it would be based in the [[Novorossiysk]] naval base which [[Spetsstroy]], the strategic infrastructure builder, was to complete by that time. Other sources reported that both of the first two Mistral-class helicopter carriers, the ''Vladivostok'' and the ''Sevastopol'' would be assigned to the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]] in 2014 and 2015 respectively after their completion in France. In [[Vladivostok]], Berth 33 was being renovated for them.

On 3 September 2014, French President announced that due to Russia's "[[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|recent actions in Ukraine]]", the two ships would not be delivered.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29052599|title=Ukraine crisis: France halts warship delivery to Russia|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=3 September 2014|accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, François Hollande placed a hold on the delivery of the first ''Mistral'' to Russia in view of the conflict in east Ukraine. Hollande set two conditions for delivery: the observation of a ceasefire in Ukraine and a political agreement between Moscow and Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/28ff1656-74a2-11e4-8321-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3KQXXpOrf | title=France Suspends Mistral Warship Delivery to Russia | publisher=The Financial Times | date=26 Nov 2014 | accessdate=2014-11-28 |author1=Michael Stothard |author2=Adam Thomson |author3=Kathrin Hille }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August 2015 it was announced that France was to pay back Russia's partial payments and keep the two ships initially produced for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;elysee.fr: [http://www.elysee.fr/communiques-de-presse/article/entretien-telephonique-avec-m-vladimir-poutine-accords-sur-les-bpc/ Entretien téléphonique avec M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6923">'''He who does not work, neither shall he eat''' is a [[New Testament]] [[aphorism]] originally by [[Paul the Apostle]], later cited by John Smith in Jamestown, Virginia, and by  [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] during the [[Russian Revolution]].

== New Testament ==
The aphorism is found in the [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|Second Epistle]] of [[Paul the Apostle]] (with [[Saint Silvanus|Silvanus]] and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]]) to the Thessalonians, in which Paul writes:
:{{Lang|grc|εἴ τις οὐ θέλει ἐργάζεσθαι μηδὲ ἐσθιέτω}}
:{{Grc-transl|εἴ τις οὐ θέλει ἐργάζεσθαι μηδὲ ἐσθιέτω}}
that is,
:If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+3%3A10-12&amp;version=ESV 2 Thessalonians 3:10]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greek phrase {{Lang|grc|οὐ θέλει ἐργᾰ́ζεσθαι}} {{Grc-transl|οὐ θέλει ἐργᾰ́ζεσθαι}} means "is not willing to work". Other English translations render this as "would"&lt;ref&gt;[[King James Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; or "will not work",&lt;ref&gt;[[American Standard Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; which may confuse readers unaccustomed to this use of the verb "[[wikt:will#Verb|will]]" in the archaic sense of "want to, desire to".

== Jamestown ==
 
In the spring of 1609, [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] cited the aphorism to the colonists of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Countrymen, the long experience of our late miseries I hope is sufficient to persuade everyone to a present correction of himself, And think not that either my pains nor the adventurers' purses will ever maintain you in idleness and sloth...

...the greater part must be more industrious, or starve...

You must obey this now for a law, that he that will not work shall not eat (except by sickness he be disabled). For the labors of thirty or forty honest and industrious men shall not be consumed to maintain a hundred and fifty idle loiterers.&lt;ref&gt;John Thompson, ''The Journals of Captain John Smith: A Jamestown Biography'', {{ISBN|1426200552}}, 2007, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Soviet Union ==
[[File:Kto-ne-rabotaet.jpg|thumb|The motto in a 1920s Soviet poster]]
According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], "He who does not work shall not eat" is a necessary principle under [[socialism]], the preliminary phase of the evolution towards communist society. The phrase appears in his 1917 work, ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. Through this slogan Lenin explains that in [[socialist states]] only productive individuals could be allowed access to the articles of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]].

{{Quotation|The socialist principle, "He who does not work shall not eat", is already realized; the other socialist principle, "An equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor", is also already realized. But this is not yet communism, and it does not yet abolish "bourgeois law", which gives unequal individuals, in return for unequal (really unequal) amounts of labor, equal amounts of products.

This is a "defect" according to Marx, but it is unavoidable in the first phase of communism; for if we are not to indulge in utopianism, we must not think that having overthrown capitalism people will at once learn to work for society without any rules of law. (Chapter 5, Section 3, "The First Phase of Communist Society")}}

In accordance with Lenin’s understanding of the socialist state, article twelve of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] states: {{Quotation|In the USSR work is a duty and a matter of honor for every able-bodied citizen, in accordance with the principle: “He who does not work, neither shall he eat.”}}

In Lenin’s writing, this was not so much directed at lazy or unproductive workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/dec/25.htm |chapter=How to Organise Competition? |publisher=Progress Publishers |author=Vladimir Lenin |authorlink=Vladimir Lenin |title=Collected Works |volume=26 |pages=404–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/may/22b.htm |title=On The Famine |chapter=Letter to the Petrograd Soviet |author=Vladimir Lenin |date=22 May 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather the [[bourgeoisie]]. Marxist theory defines the bourgeoisie as the group of those who buy the labor-power of workers and engage it in the process of production, deriving profits from the [[surplus value]] thus expropriated. Once communism was realised, that is, after the abolition of property and the [[law of value]], no one would live off the labor of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMXwGdV29jwC&amp;dq=Class+Theory+and+History&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=blauS7efL4P-8Ab1wZy9DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Class Theory and History |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2002 |authors=[[Richard D. Wolff]] and [[Stephen Resnick]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither did the principle apply to those rendered incapable of work by old age or disability. These groups would have a right to society's products because they were not at fault for their condition. The elderly, in particular, had worked during their youth, and so could not be denied life's basic necessities. The Soviet state would then, at least theoretically, provide a basic level of [[social security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12574.html |title=Social Security in the Soviet Union |work=country-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The principle has been fundamental to attempts so far to affect the [[Mode of production|communist mode of production]]. Examples? Discussion? --&gt;

The principle was enunciated in the [[Russian Constitution of 1918]].

[[Leon Trotsky]] wrote that: "The old principle: who does not work shall not eat, has been replaced with a new one: who does not obey shall not eat."&lt;ref name="Somin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volokh.com/tag/trotsky/ |title=The Evil of Leon Trotsky Revisited |first1=Ilya |last1=Somin  |date=November 5, 2009 |newspaper=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]] |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky (1936) ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'' [https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/ch11.htm Chapter 11: Whither the Soviet Union?]&lt;/ref&gt; The context of this statement was a criticism of the Stalinist regime that Trotsky opposed, not a prescription for society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8549">The '''European [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]]''' began as informal relationships between merchants residing in the Empire and the [[Sultan]]. The relationships were defined by the [[ahdname]] granted by the Sultan which would stipulate the religious freedom and exemption from the taxes that non-Muslim subjects had to pay. The religious implications of these relationships diminished over time as the commercial aspects took over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goffman|Aksan|2007|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian [[city state]]s initially appointed resident ambassadors to other Italian states to create some peace between the conflicting powers. From the twelfth-century onward the merchants from the Italian city states would organize and select a consul to represent them in the Ottoman Empire, but soon after these consuls were more formally chosen by the government. By the fifteenth-century other Western European nations adopted similar practices and diplomacy has been characterized as a Western European phenomenon ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mattingly|1963|pp=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause of the consular phenomena was the military hardening of borders which meant that Europeans could not infiltrate another area by force so they relied on economic and commercial ties to gain entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goffman|2002|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of these consular relationships the Ottomans' did not reciprocate in sending consuls to European capitals, partly because European [[Christian]]s were less welcoming towards [[Muslim]]s than Muslims were towards Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steensgaard|1967}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The consuls and the trading communities, of which they were in charge, had wide implications for European-Ottoman relationships. Since consuls and merchants would remain in [[Istanbul]] (and other Ottoman cities) for longer periods of time, they would return home with a more accurate depiction of the Ottoman culture than the earlier negative depiction. Reporting home with political news was one of the consul’s primary responsibilities which also helped in re-shaping the opinions of the Ottoman’s held by Europeans. A new respect–not necessarily for Ottoman people, but for the Ottoman accomplishments—eventually broke the old barriers and Ottomans appointed representatives to European states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goffman|2002|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venetian consuls==

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] appointed principal consuls to important commercial centers like [[Aleppo]] and [[Alexandria]] because this was where there was a large nation of their merchants. They also appointed vice-consuls to less important areas where they had less commercial interest. The principal consuls were in contact with their home country’s authorities, while the vice-consuls had a more informal position. The consuls were Venetian nobility and appointed on a three-year contract which for the most part was strongly adhered to. Also, it was important that they did not have commercial interests or have ties to the merchant community in the area to which they were appointed, but frequently that was not observed in practice. The consuls would have a fixed salary and no other means of income. The Venetian consul would have a council of twelve to assist him and would be responsible for approving all expenditures of the nation’s treasury. Also in the event of the consuls death, the council would appoint a vice-consul until a new consul could be sent from Venice.&lt;ref name="S25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Steensgaard|1967|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the sixteenth and seventeenth-centuries the Venetians practiced a policy of neutrality which was only possible through their strong diplomatic corps—chiefly the [[Bailo of Constantinople|bailo]] (who acted as consul and ambassador). The bailo needed personal skills that would allow him to be-friend high ranking Ottoman officials in order to ensure Venetian interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dursteler|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main tasks of the bailo was to collect information on the Ottomans’ politics and social life and report back to the Venetian senate regularly. Second in importance was his consular role of promoting and protecting Venetian interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dursteler|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bailo was in charge of all Venetians in the Ottoman territory, but he would appoint consuls and vice consuls where he thought it was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dursteler|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French consuls==

The [[French people|French]] appear to have kept most intact the medieval tradition of the consul—a representative of the nation of merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steensgaard|1967|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the state assumed control of the consuls in the later sixteenth century they diminished the privileges of the nation of merchants. The primary function became financial. However, the state then lost control again over the consuls and the position became a personal one that could be succeeded by an heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steensgaard|1967|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French consuls did not have fixed incomes like the Venetians, which caused them to "farm" the position out to someone able to pay a higher price for it. This meant that the nation of merchants was potentially represented by someone who was unqualified. The consul had no legal right to collect supplementary taxes. However a voluntary agreement could be reached, but if one member of the [[France|French]] nation refused to pay or lodged a complaint against the consul it would sabotage the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldem|1999|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French had success in the Ottoman Empire notably through their political and diplomatic initiatives rather than their commercial ones. The consuls were responsible for promoting French trade in the [[Levant]] through persuasion (gifts, donations, favours etc..)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldem|1999|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French consuls were not allowed to participate in trade and commerce themselves, but they were to report political and economic information back to the French government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|2002|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the consulate was frequently headed by corrupt consuls and many of them did engage in commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|2002|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dutch consuls==

Before the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] had their own consuls in the Levant, they traded under the French Capitulations of 1569 until they sent [[Cornelius Haga]] as a Consul to Istanbul in 1611.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Groot|1978|pp=88, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The States-General was responsible for appointing the consul, but the Levant merchants in these cases were closely consulted. The poor payment system for the consuls disrupted the potential successes of the relationship between consul and merchant community. The merchants requested changing to the Venetian fixed salary payment, but the States-General went against their wishes and tried to find other means of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steensgaard|1967|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This posed problems for the Dutch consuls, and there are many reports of cases where consuls exerted their authority over the nations members who did not want to pay consulate and embassy dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Groot|1978|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite internal struggle within the Dutch nation, it had a good relationship with the Ottomans and in 1804 Sultan Selin III (1789–1807) appointed the first resident representative to Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="S25"/&gt;

==English consuls==

The English consuls were appointed by and affiliated with the [[Levant Company]]. The consuls were not in any way a representative for [[the crown]], but merely representing the interests of the Company. It is interesting that if any issues arose with the Ottoman officials, the nation of merchants would meet with the consul to reach a decision on what to do and the company would never interfere in the decisions of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steensgaard|1967|pp=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1605 that the Company gained the formal right to appoint consuls and vice consuls which were solely concerned with the nation of merchants who were members of the Company. If a consul was absent or died the vice consul would remain in charge until a new consul could be sent. England had the simplest hierarchy when it came to consular representation because the Company was in charge of the nation and consuls below, whereas the crown used other representation abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steensgaard|1967|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12526">[[Solomon Islands]] is a [[sovereign country]] in the [[Oceania|South West Pacific]] consisting of many islands with a population of 561,231 (2013). It became self-governing from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1976 after three previous attempts at forming a Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;British Solomon Islands Order 1960 (UK), British Solomon Islands Order 1970 (UK), British Solomon Islands Order 1974 (UK),&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of Solomon Islands was enacted in 1978. This however led to conflicts between cultures and armed conflict in the late 1990s forced a review of the 1978 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/nzacl/PDFS/CLJP_JDCP/Vol%2013,%202007/09-corrin.pdf |format=PDF |title=Breaking the Mould : Constitutional Review in Solomon Islands |website=Victoria.ac.nz |accessdate=2016-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311005317/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/nzacl/PDFS/CLJP_JDCP/Vol%2013%2C%202007/09-corrin.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This review resulted in the Federal Constitution of the Solomon Islands Bill 2004 (SI) and various other amendments, the Human Rights Chapter however remained unchanged.

However, there are Human Rights concerns and issues in regards to education, water, sanitation, women and persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender [[LGBT rights in the Solomon Islands|(LGBT)]]

==International treaties==
[[Solomon Islands]] joined the [[United Nations]] in 1978. It is party to four of the nine core human rights treaties - the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]]), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/Treaty.aspx?CountryID=160&amp;Lang=EN |title=Treaty bodies Treaties |website=Tbinternet.ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2011, Solomon Islands issued a standing invitation to the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Procedures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Invitations.aspx |accessdate=March 28, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330210852/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Invitations.aspx |archivedate=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In a 2011, the [[United Nations|UN]] released a UPR&lt;ref name="franciscansinternational1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://franciscansinternational.org/fileadmin/docs/UPR_Reports_2010/FI_joint_UPR_submission_for_the_Solomon_Islands_2010_May__2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=Universal Periodic Review (UPR) for Solomon Islands |website=Franciscansinternational.org |accessdate=2016-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020234854/http://www.franciscansinternational.org/fileadmin/docs/UPR_Reports_2010/FI_joint_UPR_submission_for_the_Solomon_Islands_2010_May__2011.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlined the current availability of education as being limited for the poor island state. Despite the government’s 2010 policy statement,&lt;ref&gt;National Coalition for Reform and Advancement (NCRA) Government Policy Statement, Office of the Prime Minister, Honiara, October 2010, item 4.2.5, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; which committed to ensuring all Solomon Islanders have equal access to quality education, this is an ongoing issue that is still being addressed. Statistics show that overall primary attendance rate at 65.4%, this increased in urban areas to 72%.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Islands Demographic and Health Survey 2006-2007, item 2.8.1, p28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the ‘Fee Free Primary Education’ policy of the government, primary education is free and financed by overseas donors. However it is not compulsory. Article 15 of [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] requires compulsory primary education, as does article 28 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]. In the report’s recommends that basic primary quality education should be compulsory.

There is also limited access to education for children with disabilities. This is a cultural and social issue as well as a human rights concern. The traditional view is that persons with disabilities are cared for and looked after, therefore not required or expected to be an active part in the community. This charitable approach has led to the majority of children with disabilities having no real access to education.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, Forum Disability Ministers‟ Meeting, Rarotonga, Cook Islands, October 2009, p5&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Government’s 2010 policy, the UPR&lt;ref name="franciscansinternational1"/&gt; urges the government to give this the highest priority to give children equal opportunity.

Another issue integrated to this is the lack of certified teachers who do not take interest in what they are doing. In a 2010 [[UNICEF]] mid-term report on education it was estimated that 50% of teachers in the Solomon Islands are unqualified.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Pacific Education Programme, Mid Term Review: Ensuring Children‟s Rights to, in, through Education, 2010, p8&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommends that the government allocate more of its budget on developing an adequate infrastructure such as training professional teachers, having more schools and classrooms as well as ensuring teachers are paid on time.

=== Secondary school ===
Article 28 1(b) of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] requires governments to encourage the development of different forms of secondary education, available and accessible to every child, and to take appropriate measures such as the introduction of free education and offering financial assistance in case of need. In a 2006-2007 survey, 29 out of every 100 children (12–18 years old) attended secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Islands Demographic and Health Survey 2006-2007 pg 29 and 30&lt;/ref&gt; This figure was worse in rural areas and people surveyed stated that secondary school fees were too expensive for families. The UPR report recommended increasing accessibility to secondary school.

==Water and sanitation==
The issue of safe drinking water is one that affects 355,000 Solomon Islanders,&lt;ref&gt;AusAID project&lt;/ref&gt; although fresh water is available year round in some places, the islands often suffer from severe water shortage. Water-borne disease and lack of proper sanitation is a major risk and concerned locals have commented that sickness caused from unsafe drinking water was preventing children from attending school. Around half of primary schools have access to safe drinking water. Article 15 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] sets out the criteria for the full enjoyment of the right to water including availability, quality and accessibility.

In Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands, there are many overcrowded slums as a result of people moving to urban areas in search of opportunities. There was not adequate infrastructure to deal with the influx of inhabitants during the 1970s and 1980s. This has resulted in the unavailability of clean water, leaving residents faced with a long and sometimes dangerous journey to find it. These people often opt instead to wash clothes, dishes and themselves in dirty water, putting them at risk of disease.&lt;ref name="Dignity"&gt;“Where is the dignity in that?” Women in Solomon Islands Slums denied sanitation and safety (September 2011) Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

The right to sanitation is an integral part of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]], defined in Article 11(1) of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]. As well as relating to right to health, housing and water, the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] recognizes the right for access to sanitation. According to a 2009 survey of Honiara, only a quarter of residents had adequate toilet facilities. Around 55% relieved themselves either in the sea, a river, or nearby toilets.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, Progress on Sanitation and Drinking-water: 2010 update p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
Although the Solomon Islands are party to [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]], women’s rights and access to adequate sanitation are limited. Women are not treated equally to men as witnessed by Amnesty International which reported they witnessed 100 young women and girls as well as 2 elderly men collect water from a broken pipe. When asked why no men were collecting the water, they replied that the men were drunk or playing sports. This was also found in another slum where the men were also high on drugs.&lt;ref name="Dignity"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

The lack of adequate water supply has led to rise of violence against women have to walk further and more often to get water or to go toilet, bathe or to obtain drinking water. This is an issue especially in Honiara’s slums where men attack women either physically or sexually making them too afraid to use communal toilets at night. Rape and other abuse is generally unreported to police as women and girls fear reprisals from their attackers.&lt;ref name="Dignity"/&gt;{{rp|10}} The government has acknowledged the ongoing violence towards women and in 2010 approved a national policy to eliminate violence against women. This was a result of lobbying by women’s groups.

==LGBT rights==
{{main article|LGBT rights in Solomon Islands}}

==Right to privacy==
The lack of a women’s [[right to privacy]] in Solomon Islands is more prevalent in the slums with shared bathing, washing and toilets facilities. There are reports of not being able to wash themselves adequately and being spied on or whistled at. A lack of privacy is demeaning and embarrassing.&lt;ref name="Dignity"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

==Right to housing==
When the issue of inadequate housing and facilities especially regarding the slums was broached to government officials, they explained it was the fault of the people and not of the government. The slums sit mostly on Honiara City Council Land, which the ministry of land, housing and survey is responsible for. This issue of state negligence has not been resolved.&lt;ref name="Dignity"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

'''Human rights in Sweden''' are largely protected in their [[Basic Laws of Sweden|Constitution]] and ratified [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf|title=The Constitution of Sweden|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three Constitutional acts concerning human rights are Chapter 2 of the Instrument of Government, ''Regeringsformen'', the Freedom of the Press Act, ''Tryckfrihetsfsӧrordningen'' (1949) and Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, ''Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen'' (1991).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constitutional Law in Sweden|last=Nergelius|first=Joakim|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2011|isbn=978-90-411-3435-6|location=The Netherlands|pages=99–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] has been incorporated into Swedish domestic law since 1995.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

Sweden regards itself as a global leader in protecting and advocating human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sweden.se/society/openness-shapes-swedish-society/|title=Openness shapes Swedish society|date=2015-04-02|work=sweden.se|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, their position on human rights is strongly linked to democracy and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.government.se/49550b/contentassets/f864bf87a5d64f11b033f32e6e1fed3f/human-rights-democracy-and-the-principles-of-the-rule-of-law-in-swedish-foreign-policy.pdf|title=Human rights, democracy and the principles of the rule of law in Swedish foreign policy|author=Wallström|first=Margot|date=8 December 2016|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|issue=Skr. 2016/17:62|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018 an independent human rights expert of the [[United Nations]], Obiora C. Okafor, praised Sweden's contribution to human rights internationally due to its financial support to international organisations and promoting human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22970&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} UN human rights expert to assess Sweden's international solidarity and development agenda|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden has been regarded for its soft power diplomacy in promoting new human rights norms and challenging the international state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson-Rainer|first=Elise|date=Winter 2017|title=SWEDEN IS A WORLD LEADER IN PEACE, SECURITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&amp;u=usyd&amp;id=GALE%7CA541811494&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon|journal=World Affairs|volume=180|pages=79+|via=Expanded Academic ASAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sweden is not exempt however from domestic human rights breaches. Key areas for concerns include discrimination, race and social issues, and protection of asylum seekers.

== History of human rights ==
The first protection of human rights in Sweden dates back to the mid-14th Century with the ''Konungabalk'' ("King's Chapter") found in the ''Landslagen'' (the General Law of the Realm).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Rights in Sweden|last=Danelius|first=Hans|publisher=The Swedish Institute|year=1973|isbn=978-91-520-0033-5|location=Stockholm|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Konungabalk'' was Swedish's first written constitution. It contained an oath for all succeeding monarchies in Sweden to "defend justice and truth and put down injustice, falsehood and lawlessness" and to "keep faith with the commonality of the realm, to injure neither rich nor poor in life or limb except after trial in accordance with the law of the realm, neither to deprive any man of his goods except by due legal process".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The royal oath expressed an intention to adhere to fundamental principles of human rights such as the right to trial and protection of life and limb. 

This expression formed the basis of Article 16 of the Instrument of Government of 1809.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Article 16 was the only proviso relating to human rights in the old Constitution. The Article reads: 

"The King shall maintain and further justice and truth, prevent and forbid iniquity and injustice; he shall not deprive anyone or allow anyone to be deprived of life, honour, personal liberty or well-being, without legal trial and sentence; he shall not deprive anyone or permit anyone to be deprived of any real or personal property without due trial and judgement.... he shall not constrain or allow to be constrained the conscience of any person, but shall protect everyone in the free exercise of his religion...".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

Although this is more a "general declaration of principle"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; it shows Sweden's early recognition of fundamental principles of human rights. 

The death penalty, often considered to fundamentally abrogate human rights was practised in Sweden for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PKoai1nNseUC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=swedish+death+penalty#v=onepage&amp;q=swedish%20death%20penalty&amp;f=false|title=The Barbaric Punishment: Abolishing the Death Penalty|last=Franck|first=Hans Göran|last2=Nyman|first2=Klas|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-9041121516|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th and 17th Centuries 68 offences carried the death penalty, including crimes of theft, forms of adultery and religious offences against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PKoai1nNseUC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=swedish+death+penalty#v=onepage&amp;q=swedish%20death%20penalty&amp;f=false|title=The Barbaric Punishment: Abolishing the Death Penalty|last=Franck|first=Hans Göran|last2=Nyman|first2=Klas|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-9041121516|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until 1921 that the Riksdag formally abolished the death penalty for crimes committed in peacetime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The last state execution took place in 1910. 

== Key sources of rights in the Constitution ==
Sweden's legal protection of human rights developed significantly in the 20th Century with the modernisation of the Constitution and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and the Freedom of Press Acts.  Protecting human rights in the Constitution means that ordinary law is subordinate and may not operate if they are contrary to the rights set out. Human rights set out in Sweden's constitutional law are difficult to amend and require a more thorough process than ordinary law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/en/how-the-riksdag-works/democracy/the-constitution/|title=The Constitution|last=Riksdagsförvaltningen|website=www.riksdagen.se|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 2 of the Instrument of Government===

Sweden's modern Constitution was enacted in 1974&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with the inclusion of Chapter 2 named 'Fundamental rights and Freedoms'. The chapter protects four types of rights: positive freedoms, negative freedoms of opinion, physical rights and rule of law guarantees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (pg 102). Article 1 protects positive freedoms of opinion including freedom of speech, freedom of information, freedom of assembly, to name a few. Articles 2-3 protects negative freedoms of opinion such as coercion regarding political, religious, cultural, or other opinions as well as the requirement for consent for citizens to have their political opinions publicly registered. Articles 4-8 outline the physical rights to integrity and freedom of movement such as no capital punishment, no one to be subject to torture or no citizen to be refused entry to Sweden. Articles 9-11 outlines the rule of law principle that ensures each citizen is entitled to procedural guarantees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (pg. 102). Articles 12-13 protect against discrimination against people on grounds of ethnicity, gender, sexuality. Article 15 protects individuals right to private property and the right to public access of land or buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-instrument-of-government-2015.pdf|title=The Instrument of Government|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

===Freedom of Press Act===  

Freedom of press is a well established right in Sweden being protected since 1766. In 1766 Sweden incorporated freedom of the press into its constitution, being the first country globally to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sweden.se/society/openness-shapes-swedish-society/|title=Openness shapes Swedish society|date=2015-04-02|work=sweden.se|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This constitutional law abolished censorship in printed publications as well as guaranteeing public access to government documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Freedom-of-the-Press-Act-of-1766|title=Freedom of the Press Act of 1766 {{!}} Swedish legislation|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1949 the Freedom of Press Act was enacted and superseded the existing acts. Article 1 of Chapter 1 on the freedom of press outlines that it is to be "understood to mean the right of every Swedish citizen to publish written matter, without prior hinderance by a public authority or other public body, and not to be prosecuted thereafter on grounds of its content".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riksdagen.se/en/SysSiteAssets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-freedom-of-the-press-act-2015.pdf/|title=The Freedom of Press Act|last=|first=|date=2015|website=www.riksdagen.se|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Sweden was ranked the second on the World Press Freedom Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/sweden|title=Sweden : World's first press freedom law {{!}} Reporters without borders|website=RSF|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression===

The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression 1991 is largely similar to the Freedom of Press Act set out above.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both are fundamentally protecting the right of expression and speech. Whilst freedom of speech has been protected in Sweden since 1766, it initially only extended to written published documents. There was no other mention of other types of freedom of speech until 1974.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Article 1, section 1 of the Act sets out the aim of the Act to guarantee every citizen's right to publicly express themselves. The Act protects all Swedish citizens right to express themselves freely on the radio, TV, films, video and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/en/how-the-riksdag-works/democracy/the-constitution/|title=The Constitution|last=Riksdagsförvaltningen|website=www.riksdagen.se|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also lists freedom of expression offences such as defaming someone or threatening domestic security through publication.

== Sources of human rights in International Law ==
International law and conventions provide a key framework for protecting human rights in Sweden. Sweden abides and is signatory to multiple international agreements concerning human rights. International standards for human rights found in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration of Human Rights,]] the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] all influence Sweden's domestic and foreign human rights policy. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is the foundational document for modern human rights and has largely influenced international conventions and treaties that Sweden is signatory to.    

The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (EHCR) which was incorporated into Swedish domestic law from 1 January 1995 forms the cornerstone of Sweden protection of rights and freedoms. Sweden is a "dualist state"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in its adoption of International Law such as the ECHR thereby requiring a special act by the Swedish government for treaties and conventions to take effect domestically. Since Sweden has ratified the EHCR this in practice means that Swedish Court's must interpret cases with respect to the articles of the EHCR. The Convention guarantees specific right and freedoms as well as prohibiting negative freedoms and unfair practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/what-european-convention-human-rights|title=What is the European Convention on Human Rights? {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the rights include: right to life, freedom from torture, right to a fair trial, freedom of expression and right to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts&amp;c|title=European Convention on Human Rights - Official texts, Convention and Protocols|last=ECHR|website=www.echr.coe.int|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Human rights influencing foreign policy ==
Sweden's position on human rights has influenced their foreign policy and bilateral relations with other countries. In recent times Sweden has adjusted its relations with other states due to their domestic abrogation of human rights. 

=== Saudi Arabia ===

In 2015 relations between Saudi Arabia and Sweden became tense after [[Margot Wallström]], foreign minister of Sweden, delivered a speech to Swedish parliament stating that human rights were violated in Saudi Arabia and that she would pursue a feminist foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister|title=Who’s Afraid of a Feminist Foreign Policy?|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador from Sweden and stated it would no longer issue business visas for Swedish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/20/sweden-stood-up-for-human-rights-in-saudi-arabia-this-is-how-saudi-arabia-is-punishing-sweden/|title=Sweden stood up for human rights in Saudi Arabia. This is how Saudi Arabia is punishing Sweden.|last=Adam|first=Taylor|date=|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diplomatic affair resulted in the termination of a long-standing arms deal between Saudi Arabia and Sweden. Saudi Arabia was the third largest non-Western buyer of Swedish arms and bought approximately $37 million euros of arms in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/sweden-cancels-saudi-arms-deal-after-human-rights-row/a-18306674|title=Sweden cancels Saudi arms deal after human rights row {{!}} DW {{!}} 10.03.2015|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden prioritised its human rights policy, in particular in regards to women's rights in their relations with Saudi Arabia.    

=== Uganda ===
Another instance where Sweden has favoured human rights obligations over bilateral relations was in the early 2000s when Uganda proposed a bill that instituted the death penalty or life imprisonment for homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson-Rainer |first1=Elsie |title=Sweden is a World Leader in Peace, Security, and Human Rights |journal=World Affairs |date=Winter 2017 |volume=180 |issue=4 |page=79+}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden condemned the legislation and adjusted its foreign aid to Uganda due to the "appalling" anti-gay law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/sweden-cutting-aid-to-uganda-over-appalling-anti-homosexuality-bill-7c99e3fbbf89/|title=Sweden cutting aid to Uganda over ‘appalling’ Anti-Homosexuality Bill.|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden along with donors such as the World Bank, Norway and Denmark withheld aid of approximately $110 million from Uganda due to the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-aid-sweden/sweden-suspends-some-aid-to-uganda-over-anti-gay-law-idUSBREA2509720140306|title=Sweden suspends some aid to Uganda over anti-gay law|last=Croome|first=Philippa|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
Sweden has been vocal in criticising Russia for their human rights violations. The relationship between Sweden and Russia has been termed "cool neighbours"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lidqvist|first=Karin|date=Spring 2016|title="Cool Neighbours": How has Sweden's attitude towards Russia changed since the end of the Cold War?|url=http://www.diva-portal.se/smash/get/diva2:951999/FULLTEXT01.pdf|journal=Hogskolan Vast|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to past conflicts and diverging ideologies and views. Although relations between the two states is relatively stable in recent times, Sweden is critical of some of Russia's policies. According to Sweden's ambassador to Russia, Peter Ericson, Sweden has "a lot to teach Russia in terms of free speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20180831/i-believe-we-have-a-lot-to-teach-russia-in-terms-of-free-speech|title='I believe we have a lot to teach Russia in terms of free speech'|date=2018-08-31|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current issues ==
According to Amnesty International some areas for concern of human rights in Sweden include discrimination, rape and sexual violence and the protection of asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/sweden/report-sweden/|title=Sweden 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Race ===
Sweden's current anti-discrimination laws have eliminated the term race, replacing the term with "ethnicity" to denote "national or ethnic origin, skin colour or other similar circumstances".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McEachrane|first=Michael|date=April 2018|title=Universal Human Rights and the Coloniality of Race in Sweden|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/s12142-018-0510-x.pdf|journal=Human Rights Review|volume=|pages=1–23|doi=10.1007/s12142-018-0510-x|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael McEachrane in a 2018 study considers the exclusion of the term race means Sweden is not able to "recognise, monitor, or address structural racial discrimination even as a ''possible'' universal human rights issue".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; McEachrane outlines the nature of racial discrimination pertinent to Sweden with housing segregation of non-European backgrounds such as African or Middle Eastern living in low-income neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Discrimination ===
Sweden has recently been criticised in a report by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) over "racist hate speech against Afro-Swedes, Jews, Muslims and Roma".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20180511/un-concerned-about-level-of-racism-in-sweden|title=UN 'concerned' about level of racism in Sweden|date=2018-05-11|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the report found that hate crimes remain high with an 11% increase in reported hate crimes from 2014 to 2015.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fn.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CERD-2018-Submitted-by-UNA-SWEDEN.pdf|title=Alternative Report to Sweden's 22nd and 23rd Periodical Reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|date=March 2018|website=UNA Sweeden|publisher=United Nations Association of Sweden|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2016 it was reported that approximately 440 hate crimes with an anti-religious motive, specifically anti-Islamic were committed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

A study by Martha F. Davis and Natasha Ryan in 2017 found that Swedish authorities had evicted more than 80 [[Romani people|Roma]] settlements during 2013 and 2016.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hhrjournal.org/2017/12/inconvenient-human-rights-water-and-sanitation-in-swedens-informal-roma-settlements/|title=Inconvenient Human Rights: Water and Sanitation in Sweden's Informal Roma Settlements – Health and Human Rights Journal|website=www.hhrjournal.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These evictions were on the grounds of poor sanitation and access to water, both considered fundamental human rights. The study concluded that Sweden had violated its human rights obligations under both European and international law. Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights access to water and sanitation are fundamental human rights for all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The 2017/2018 Amnesty Report also noted the discrimination faced by Roma citizens who are denied access to basic services such as health care and education by the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/sweden/report-sweden/|title=Sweden 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roma citizens continue to be subject to harassment and prejudice from European nationals.   

=== Migrants and asylum-seekers ===
Sweden's protection of asylum seekers and refugees has historically been viewed as "progressive and ambitious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/Projekte/28_Einwanderung_und_Vielfalt/IB_Studie_Asylum_Procedures_Sweden_Parusel_2016.pdf|title=Sweden's Asylum Procedures|last=Parusel|first=Bernd|date=2016|website=www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received the largest amount of refugees and asylum seekers per capita in 2013 among the countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/refugee-law/sweden.php|title=Refugee Law and Policy: Sweden|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=www.loc.gov|others=Hofverberg, Elin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many European countries with the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis Sweden adopted new border controls and cut benefits that refugees had previously had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-has-done-so-much-for-refugees-now-its-turned-its-back-on-them-a6792726.html|title=Sweden has done so much for refugees. Now it's turned its back on them|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden introduced an amendment to their asylum seeker policies which prevented entitlement to "accommodation, subsistence allowance and special aid"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redcross.se/globalassets/press-och-opinion/rapporter/swedish-rc-status-report-law-changes.pdf|title=Status Report|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.redcross.se|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for adult asylum seekers with no children and who have had their applications rejected. These emergency measures breached asylum-seekers fundamental rights such as the right to family reunification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/sweden/report-sweden/|title=Sweden 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10150">'''Information privilege''' is the idea that access to information can be based on an individual’s status, affiliation, or power. Access to information can be blocked by various means including geography, access to technology, financial standing, and identity. The type of information that is obstructed is often the most skilled, researched, and credible. This creates a power dynamic where there are parts of a society who can benefit from this access and those who are marginalized because of a lack of access. Information privilege is closely tied with information literacy. [[Information literacy]] is the ability to identify, locate, evaluate, and use information to solve an issue, as such, access to information is a necessary human right to be information literate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Laura|date=2017|title=Connecting Information Literacy and Social Justice: Why and How|url=|journal=[[Communications in Information Literacy]]|volume=11 No. 1|pages=55-75|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various human rights declarations include a component of information literacy and/or access to information. In addition, the librarian profession is founded on and advocates for access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/restrictedaccess|title=Restricted Access to Library Materials|last=admin|date=2006-07-26|work=Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National and international statements ==
Below is a list of national and international statements declaring access to information as a basic human right that should be upheld:
* [[United Nations]] ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'' – Article 19 states that an individual has the right to hold their opinion and their opinion should be held “without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of any frontiers”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions’]] (IFLA) ''Beacons of the Information Society: The Alexandria Proclamation for Information Literacy and Lifelong Learning'' states information literacy is a “basic human right in a digital world” and advocates “institutions to meet technological, economic and social challenges, to redress disadvantage and to advance the well-being of all”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifla.org/publications/beacons-of-the-information-society-the-alexandria-proclamation-on-information-literacy|title=Beacons of the Information Society: The Alexandria Proclamation on Information Literacy and Lifelong Learning|last=|first=|date=November 9, 2005|website=IFLA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* The ''Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report'' from the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]] recognized the problems associated with lack of access to credible information. It states, “problems are more difficult to solve when people lack access to meaningful information vital to good decision making.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/whitepapers/presidential|title=Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report|last=admin|date=2006-07-24|work=Association of College &amp; Research Libraries (ACRL)|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2015/02/opinion/peer-to-peer-review/privilege-in-the-framework-peer-to-peer-review/#_|title=Privilege in the Framework {{!}} Peer to Peer Review|last=Bivens-Tatum|first=Wayne|date=February 26, 2015|website=Library Journal|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[American Library Association]] ''Bill of Rights'' states "all libraries are forums for information and ideas"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill|title=Library Bill of Rights|last=admin|date=2006-06-30|work=Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the published follow up, ''Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights'' states, "Libraries and librarians protect and promote these rights by selecting, producing, providing access to, identifying, retrieving, organizing, providing instruction in the use of, and preserving recorded expression regardless of the format or technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations|title=Interpretations of the Library Bill of Rights|last=admin|date=2007-07-30|work=Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ACRL framework ==
The Association of College and Research Libraries developed the [http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework Framework for Information Literacy] which is meant to guide the instruction of information literacy to college students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework#introduction|title=Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education-Introduction|last=DMUELLER|first=|date=2015-02-09|work=Association of College &amp; Research Libraries (ACRL)|access-date=2017-12-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The ACRL first mentions the term "information privilege" in the frame titled Information Has Value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework|title=Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education-Information Has Value|last=DMUELLER|first=|date=2015-02-09|work=Association of College &amp; Research Libraries (ACRL)|access-date=2017-11-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It discusses the legal and socioeconomic circumstances that can influence the production of, and access to, information. It encourages learners to recognize their own information privilege and acknowledge that some individuals and groups are underrepresented especially in [[academic publishing]]. Some argue that the ACRL Framework does not go far enough to teach learners of information literacy about the social injustice issue of lack of access. It is advised that more explicit instructions be included on how learners can combat the injustice in access to information&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battista, Andrew; Ellenwood, Dave; Gregory, Lua; Higgins, Shana; Lilburn, Jeff; Harker, Yasmin Sokkar; Sweet, Christopher|first=|date=2015|title=Seeking Social Justice in the ACRL Framework|url=|journal=Communications in Information Literacy|volume=9 Issue 2|pages=111-125|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Barriers to Access ==
Researcher and educator Laura Saunders defines three barriers to access as physical, social, and cognitive/intellectual barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physical barriers to access include not only geographical barriers but also access to the technology that will allow a person access to particular sources. As the internet became more popular and information became more readily available online, companies developed database subscription services that allowed individuals to access only the most reliable and well researched information. However access to this information was hidden behind a paywall where only a person with financial means or an affiliation with an education institution could have access.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piccininni|first=James|date=Spring 1997|title=Current Issues: Information Access: A Right or Privilege?|url=|journal=Journal of Information Ethics|volume=Volume 6, Issue 1|pages=5-7|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saunders' idea of social barriers to access implies there is a barrier to information based on a cultural or socioeconomic circle of communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marginalized groups may not participate in a society they are distrusting of and therefore the information sources they trust may not be as vast or diverse. Access is limited because they only receive information from a small circle of people they trust. They may also not ask for help as readily as more privileged groups do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; James Piccininni has stated that this social exclusion of groups of people in "social, economic, and political spheres" creates a power dynamic that dictates how information is created, distributed, and accessed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The third barrier to access is cognitive/intellectual access and ties in best with information literacy. Without learning the skills to locate, evaluate, and use information, a person may be susceptible to misinformation, propaganda, fake news, and general false statements, leaving them at a disadvantage and an inability to find reliable information&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. An advantage to providing access to information within a community is that it allows the voices of the most brilliant within a demographic to be heard when they might otherwise have been discounted or marginalized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Open Access  ==
{{Main|open access}}

Much of the most reliable and current information in a particular field is found behind a paywall where only persons associated with an educational institution or professional organization, or the monetary means to purchase journal subscriptions has access to this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://infomational.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/on-information-privilege/|title=on information privilege.|last=Booth|first=Char|date=2014-12-01|work=info-mational|access-date=2017-12-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inherent issues of [[academic publishing]] created a growing advocacy for the [[Open access|Open Access]] movement.

== History of Canada's International Policy Statement ==
The need for the IPS was born on [[September 11 attacks|September 11th, 2001]], when the western world was reminded of their vulnerability at the hands of [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This unprecedented attack on North American soil profoundly shocked Canada and the U.S, especially considering Canada’s dependence on America for defense.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Canadian troops were deployed with the U.S. military to [[Afghanistan]], it challenged previously understood ideas about Canadian Foreign policy. An "unexpected war" against terrorism, coupled with the [[Invasion of Iraq order of battle 2003|invasions of Iraq]] by allied forces, stretched Canadian soldiers thin, to the extent that it forced Canada to seriously consider changing foreign policy to combat rising global insecurity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This insecurity coupled with an upcoming federal election, gave way to the liberal government introducing the International Policy Statement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Defense ==
The defense section of the international policy statement is a guide for the Canadian forces in their operations, assisting the Department of National defense in the development of a sustainable long term program.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection/D2-168-2005E.pdf|title=CANADA’S INTERNATIONAL POLICY STATEMENT A Role of Pride and Influence in the World DEFENCE|last=Graham|first=Bill|publisher=Government of Canada|year=2005|isbn=0-662-68940-2|location=Ottawa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Policy emphasizes three broad roles for the Canadian forces; Protecting Canadians, Defending North America with the United States, and contributing to international peace and security.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The statement is meant to address and build on previous public consultations regarding defense such as those carried out during the 2002-03 Defense update.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; International, and domestic security will be bolstered by an additional 5,000 regular personnel as well as 3,000 reserves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The largest perceived international threats to security include: terrorism, failing and failed states, weapons of mass destruction and regional flash-points such as North Korea and the Israeli-Palestine conflict.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== How effective has the IPS been? ==
Five years after the release the IPS has not been a significant factor in guiding Canada’s foreign policy, this is due largely to the

shift from liberal to Conservative government, as a result of the federal election of 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Diplomatic changes outlined by the IPS such as the restructuring of Foreign affairs met heavy resistance in parliament.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The conservative government has cherry-picked from the IPS, initiatives they agree with, such as the heavier focus on fragile states/ zones of international interest such as Israel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Stability and Reconstruction task force was reorganized to handle high level foreign policy efforts such as Canada’s Global Peace and Security Fund.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Results of diplomatic priorities have been successful in building North American partnerships and building a more secure world. Defensively, the IPS has been significantly altered, as the conservative government has focused on achieving diplomacy goals through the addition of defense and security. Canada’s top down focus on defense has had many critics, calling the military top heavy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Naval improvements seemed to lack the most, as many shortcomings and complexities, such as ship building teams not able to meet Canadian capability requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the Conservative governments interest in accelerating many defensive aspects of the IPS has revitalized the Canadian forces to the extent that they can focus on maintaining Arctic sovereignty, and security, while also effectively responding to domestic situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Development goals such as global reduction of policy have not been reached as efforts have shifted to security in fragile and failing states, instead of focusing on food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Stephen|date=Fall 2005|title=Achieving the Development Objectives of Canada’s International Policy Statement|url=http://stephenbrown.xyz/wp-content/uploads/Stephen-Brown-MIR.pdf|journal=Mcgill International Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commerce section of the IPS has been deemed insignificant in light of the housing crisis of 2006, where a lack of new ideas in the IPS forced Canada to improvise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7158">The '''Iraq Historic Allegations Team''' ('''IHAT''') is a unit set up by the British government in March 2010 to investigate allegations of abuse and torture by British soldiers in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-teams/iraq-historic-allegations-team-ihat|title=Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT) - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of these have focused on three interrogation sites near [[Basra]] operated by the Joint Forward Interrogation Team (JFIT) between March 2003 and December 2008.The inquiry was established in November 2010&lt;ref name="iraq-work"&gt;{{Cite web |date=1 November 2010|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/IraqHistoricAllegationsTeamStartsWork.htm|title=Iraq Historic Allegations Team starts work|work=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after 146 Iraqi men claimed to have been tortured.&lt;ref name="G121012"/&gt;

The unit is led by retired senior civilian police detective, Mark Warwick, and is made up of Royal Navy Police officers and ex-civilian police detectives&lt;ref name="G260312"&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/26/royal-military-police-removed-iraq-inquiry|title=Royal Military Police removed from Iraq prisoner abuse inquiry|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 March 2012|first1=Ian|last1=Cobain|first2=Richard|last2= Norton-Taylor|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will soon be up to its full complement of 145 staff. In January 2013 [[G4S]] subsidiary G4S Policing Solutions lost its contract to provide 40 former police officers for the inquiry, and was replaced by Police Skills, a subsidiary of Red Snapper Group, who will provide 100 former detectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/9797997/G4S-agrees-deal-over-fiasco-at-Olympics.html|first1=Angela|last1=Monaghan|first2=David|last2=Barrett|date=13 January 2013|title=G4S agrees deal over fiasco at Olympics|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[judicial review]] the [[Court of Appeal]] ruled in November 2011 that the involvement of the General Police Duties branch of the [[Royal Military Police]] (RMP) "substantially compromised" the inquiry because members of the unit had participated in detentions in Iraq. The armed forces minister, [[Nick Harvey]], responded by announcing in March 2012 that the RMP staff would be reassigned and replaced by [[Royal Navy Police]] personnel by 1 April 2012.&lt;ref name="G260312"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G121012"&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/12/inquiry-british-abuse-iraqi-prisoners | title =Inquiry into British abuse of Iraqi prisoners faces fresh allegations | work =[[The Guardian]] | date=12 October 2012 | first =Ian | last=Cobain|accessdate=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{cite web| url =https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=2082643&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=1885434&amp;Usage=2 | title =Execution of Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights Action Plan Al Skeini (application no. 55721/07) Information submitted by the United Kingdom Government | work =[Council of Europe | date=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyers representing people alleging that they have been tortured applied for another judicial review in May 2012 to examine the claim that the Royal Navy Police are not sufficiently independent since they also took part in interrogations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = MOD's ‘Iraq Historic Allegations Team’ to face further legal challenge |work =Public Interest Lawyers| url=http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/news_details.php?id=266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that abuses were so systemic and widespread that only a public inquiry will satisfy the UK's human rights obligations.

The case started on 29 January 2013 and a judgement was handed down by Mr Justice Silber on 24 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approved Judgement|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/AZM%20_No%202_%20v%20SOS%20for%20Defence%20FINAL.pdf|publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this judgement it was stated that IHAT has now been structured in such a way that it can independently carry out its investigative and prosecutorial functions. It also ruled that the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to order an overarching public enquiry could not be called into question and said more should be done to address wider systemic issues. A possible solution - coronial-type inquests once criminal proceedings are complete in a particular case, or once it is evident that particular allegations will not lead to a criminal prosecution - was suggested for consideration by the Secretary of State.

In 2016 Martin Jerrold, Managing Director of the Red Snapper Group was called as a witness to an oral evidence session by a parliament select committee.  A subsequent Daily Telegraph article highlighted the profits made by the company which has contracts worth £4.8 million a year and its apparent ineffectiveness in that over its six years of existence it has yet to produce a single successful prosecution. Its 127 staff can be paid through limited companies potentially reducing tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/17/the-husband-and-wife-and-their-army-of-retired-police-officers-t/|title=The couple and their army of retired police officers taking £5m a year from taxpayers to pursue British soldiers around the globe|work=Daily Telegraph|author=Robert Mendick|date=17 September 2016|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Defence Secretary [[Michael Fallon]] announced that the investigations would be shut down within months after MPs called it an "unmitigated failure."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38937053 ''Iraq war allegations probe to end''] at www.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 10 Feb 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Defence Committee report, IHAT had taken up over 3,500 allegations of abuse despite most not having any credible evidence. The report found failings in the conduct of investigations and concluded that those being investigated had suffered unacceptable stress, had their lives put on hold and careers damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/defence-committee/defencesubcommittee/news/mod-support-report-published-16-17/ ''Close IHAT this year and immediately dismiss remaining weak cases''] at parliament.uk.

[[File:Major Research Stations in the Arctic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Location of the major research stations in the Arctic]]

A number of governments maintain permanent '''research stations in the [[Arctic]]'''. Also known as Arctic bases, Polar stations or Ice stations, these bases are widely distributed across the northern Polar region of the earth.

Historically few [[research station]]s have been permanent. Most of them were temporary, being abandoned after the completion of the project or owing to lack of funding to continue the research. Some of these facilities are constructed on land or on ice that rests on land, while others are [[drifting ice station]]s built on the [[sea ice]] of the high latitudes of the [[Arctic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html | title=North Pole drifting stations (1930s-1980s)|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MDP Youth Wing''', is the youth movement of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] in [[Maldives]]. The organization is made up of all members of the Maldivian Democratic Party who are 18 to 35 years old.

==A Humble Start==

On June 26, 2005, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) became the first political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives.  Beginning with just 40 members, the MDP is now the largest political party in the Maldives, with over 40,000 registered members. The MDP prides itself in promoting policies that best reflect the priorities of Maldivians. Aside from the values of human rights and democratic practice, which are ingrained in all of the Party’s activities, the MDP’s policies encapsulate the Maldivian people’s want of a state and society that provides both security and the opportunities for innovation and success.

==Youth For Change==
The MDP always strives to be in touch with the pulse of the population and with over 35% of Maldivian society being made up of individuals between the ages of 18-35, the MDP acknowledges the essential role of youth involvement in all sectors of politics and development. For instance, the MDP recognised that the pre 2008 constitution’s voting age of 21 disenfranchised large sections of the country from major national decision making processes, and thereby campaigned the Special Majlis, with success, to lower the voting age to 18. The national democratic reform process demonstrated the influence and the extent to which the youth of the country were invested in the future of a democratic Maldives, when youth from across the nation joined together in activities such as ‘Badhalakah Emmen’, ‘Youth for Change’, and ‘Wathan Edhey’, combining young people’s opinions, energy, and creativity in a powerful effort to bring change.

The establishment of the MDP’s youth wing in 2010 sought to institutionalise youth involvement across the Party. This was initiated with the election of the Youth Wing’s President, Aminath.  The youth wing has since taken a leading role in policy formulation, campaigning, street activism and fundraising, using the power of art, music, and social media to make sure that the MDP continues to be a voice for the youth of the Maldives.

The '''Mendiola massacre''', also called '''Black Thursday'''&lt;ref name="jlplaw"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =The Mendiola Massacre:What happened according to jurisprudence | url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/the-mendiola-massacre-what-happened-according-to-jurisprudence|website=Jlp-law.com | accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; by some [[Filipino people|Filipino]] journalists, was an incident that took place in [[Mendiola Street]], [[San Miguel, Manila]], [[Philippines]] on January 22, 1987, in which state security forces violently dispersed a farmers' march to [[Malacañan Palace|Malacañang Palace]] in protest of the lack of government action on land reform.

Calls for just and comprehensive land reforms to President Corazon Aquino sparked rallies and demonstrations participated by farmers, workers, and students. According to reports, antiriot personnel guised as civilians, opened fire on unarmed protesters killing at least 12 and injuring 51 protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1993/mar1993/gr_84607_1993.html|title=Supreme Court G.R. No. 84607|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lawphil.net|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on Philippine Extrajudicial Killings from 2001-August 2010|last=Parreno|first=Al A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Corazon Aquino]]'s election to the presidency brought about the prospects of rebuilding the formal institutions of democracy and the fundamentals of the Philippine economy left weakened by the regime of the ousted President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Conflicts with secessionist groups in Mindanao, ballooning national debts, and severe economic inequality plagued the newly-installed administration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One such severe manifestation of the economic inequality can be seen in the agrarian problems of the Philippines at that time. Promised land reforms during the Marcos regime failed to bring agrarian justice to the farmers. Instead, the cronies and oligarchs of the Marcos regime perpetuated the abuse of farmers and peasants. The newly raised administration acted as a fresh opportunity for minorities to supplicate their respective grievances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The farmers pushed to the new government amendments in the agrarian law. However, their representatives were told by Minister Heherson Alvarez to wait for the finalization of the new Philippine Constitution and the new Congress, which made the farmers suspicious of this indecisiveness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the new Congress that would supposedly make the laws that will carry out the reforms was dominated by the landlords.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Aquino's EO 229 failed to address the root of agrarian problems of the country, disappointing the farmers and causing them to protest against the administration.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The End of an Illusion: The Mendiola Massacre and Political Transition in Post-Marcos Philippines|last=Curaming|first=Rommel|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2004|isbn=|location=Kentucky|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas'' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: "Farmworkers Movement of the Philippines"), a militant farmers' group led by Jaime Tadeo, demanded genuine [[agrarian reform]] from the Aquino government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Captive Land: The Politics of Agrarian Reform in the Philippines.|last=Putzel|first=J|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 15, 1987, members of the ''Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas'' encamped at the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (now the [[Department of Agrarian Reform (Philippines)|Department of Agrarian Reform]]) in Diliman, [[Quezon City]].The group presented their problems and demands: give land for free to farmers, end the retention of lands by landlords, and stop the amortizations of land payments.&lt;ref name="jlplaw2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/the-mendiola-massacre-what-happened-according-to-jurisprudence|title=The Mendiola Massacre:What happened according to jurisprudence|website=Jlp-law.com|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialogue between the farmers, represented by Jaime Tadeo, and the government, represented by Agrarian Reform Minister Heherson Alvarez, took place on January 20, 1987. Alvarez promised to bring the matter to the President's attention during the next day's cabinet meeting.

The response of the administration towards the protests, particularly in the Mendiola incident, was a violent dispersal. Whether or not it was a deliberate action or a miscommunicated order, the Mendiola incident showed that the people are dissatisfied with the self-preserving oligarchs-legislators who backed Cory's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Twenty-five years since the Mendiola massacre in the Philippines."|last=Santolan|first=Joseph|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violent dispersal became a tipping point for key anti-government groups such as the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] (NDF) to defer from the peace talks with the government, ending hopes for reconciliation for agrarian reforms&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On January 22, 1987, the farmers decided to march to [[Malacañang Palace]] in order to air their demands instead of negotiating with Heherson Alvarez. Marching from the [[Quezon Memorial Circle]], Tadeo's group was joined by members of other militant groups: ''Kilusang Mayo Uno'' (May One Movement), ''Bagong Alyansang Makabayan'' (New Patriotic Alliance), League of Filipino Students and ''Kongreso ng Pagkakaisa ng Maralitang Lungsod'' (Unity Congress of the Urban Poor). At 1:00 in the afternoon, the marchers reached [[Liwasang Bonifacio]] and held a brief presentation. At around the same time, anti-riot personnel under the command of Capital Regional Command commander Gen. Ramon Montaño, Task Force Nazareno under the command of Col. Cesar Nazareno and police forces under the command of Western Police District Chief Brig. Gen. [[Alfredo Lim]] were deployed around the vicinity of Malacañang.

The first line of civil disturbance control units consisted of [[police]]men from the Western Police District. About ten yards behind the policemen were [[Philippine National Police|Integrated National Police]] Field Force units. The third line, a further ten yards from the second police line, consisted of a [[Philippine Marine Corps]] unit, the Marine Civil Disturbance Control Battalion. Positioned behind the Marines were army trucks, [[water cannon]]s, [[Fire apparatus|fire truck]]s and two Mobile Dispersal Teams equipped with [[Lachrymatory agent|tear gas]] delivery gear.

The marchers numbered 10,000&amp;ndash;15,000 by the time they reached [[Recto Avenue]]. They clashed with the police, and the police lines were breached. At this point, gunshots were heard and the marchers disengaged from the melee, retreating towards Claro M. Recto Avenue. Sporadic gunfire could be heard amidst the withdrawal. Alfredo Lim, the mayor of Manila in 2007, maintains that the Marines were responsible for the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Lopez | first =Allison | title =Lim clarifies role in Mendiola Massacre | pages = | publisher =Inquirer.net | date =2008-01-21 | url =http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080121-113849/Lim-clarifies-role-in-Mendiola-Massacre | accessdate =2008-06-06 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080616035710/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080121-113849/Lim-clarifies-role-in-Mendiola-Massacre | archivedate =2008-06-16 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Western Police District, Marines, Special Weapons and Tactics team, and the Military all colluded to barricade the entrance of the Malacañang Palace. They formed multiple lines of defense, but still were not able to fend of the marching rallyists. The second line of defense, composed of the Marines, fired warning shots and threw pillbox and tear gas canisters to the supporters which started an even worse commotion. Twelve marchers were immediately confirmed dead, at least four of which were reportedly members of the [[New People's Army]] based in Bataan. At least fifty people were reportedly injured, six of which were policemen; the victims were taken to different hospitals around the area namely: Far Eastern University Hospital, [[Philippine General Hospital]], [[José R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center|Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center]], UST Hospital, Mary Chiles Hospital, Singian, and [[Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center|Ospital ng Maynila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Manila Standard|date=January 23, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death toll rose the next day, reaching eighteen deaths. Injury toll also rose to one hundred one people. As a response to the Mendiola Massacre, the Kilusang Magbubukid sa Pilipinas leaders announced that they will be staging a nationwide protest condemning the mass killing. An estimated 750,000 members and another 2,000,000 familiars were expected to join the said protest. As part of the protest, farmers were instructed to go on a farming strike, barricading major produce routes, and forcibly seizing agricultural inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers from abusive landlords. KMP leader Jaime Tadeo also demanded for the immediate resignation of then Defense Minister [[Rafael Ileto]], Gen. [[Fidel Ramos]], Brig. Gen. [[Ramon Montaño|Ramon Montano]], and Brig. Gen. [[Alfredo Lim]] for "they were directly involved in the massacre."&lt;ref name=MT&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Manila TImes|last=|first=|date=January 24, 1987|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then exiled President Ferdinand Marcos released a statement in Honolulu regarding the mass shooting. In his statement, he showed vexation towards the reaction of the armed forces towards the rallyists. He also accused the then President Corazon Aquino of having a private militia known as "The Yellow Army."&lt;ref name=MT/&gt;

Gen. [[Ramon Montaño|Ramon Montano]] said in an interview that the marchers were the ones who started the shooting in an attempt to break the barricade set up by the armed forces. However, he admittedly said that the military forces might have "overreacted" on their response to the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Sunday Times|last=|first=|date=January 25, 1987|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the bloodbath was the February 4, 1987 letter addressed to President Corazon Aquino indicating the desires of most of the Filipinos, especially the poor and the oppressed, which is "bringing about a more progressive and stable foundation for upholding their rights." The KMP emphasizes on the incompetence of the Ministry of Agrarian Reform, which was strongly believed to be the primary reason why the Mendiola Massacre happened on the first place. Lastly, the letter demands for the Aquino government to mend its governance and side with the Filipinos, particularly to the peasants, workers, and the poor.

The Citizen's Mendiola Commission (CMC), formed by Aquino to investigate on the incident released its official report on the day of February 27, 1987. The commissioners noted that the rallyers did not secure a permit; the members of crowd-disturbance units were armed with pistols and armalites; armed soldiers in civilian clothes were among the crowd; some of the demonstrators carried weapons; and Jaime Tadeo, KMP's leader uttered words that incited sedition. Unfortunately, the commission failed to identify who fired on the marchers and recommended further investigation by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). Overall, the findings were not conclusive as to who should be held responsible for the killings. On February 28, 1987, upon completing the investigations regarding the Mendiola Massacre the Citizens Mendiola Commission suggested to President Aquino to file sedition charges to KMP Chairman Jaime Tadeo.

=== Immediate Consequences of the Protest ===
In protest over the [[massacre]], the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)#History|Presidential Committee on Human Rights]], [[Jose Diokno]] and [[J.B.L. Reyes]], resigned from the government.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|title=Filipinos in History Vol. IV|last=|first=|publisher=National Historical Institute|year=1994|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, other members of the Presidential Committee on Human Rights asked for the resignation of Defense Minister Ileto and Gen. [[Fidel V. Ramos]] for their alleged complicity in the Mendiola Massacre. (Malaya, 24 January 1987)

[[Crispin Beltran]], leader of Kilusang Mayo Uno, spoke on behalf of the protesters when he stated that they wanted no more bloodshed: "We shall return tomorrow with no weapons, but armed with courage and determination to seek justice for our slain comrades." True enough, the number of protesters near the Malacanang Palace increased, from the initial 10,000 to over 15,000 and growing. As a result of the increased dialogue between the government and the rallyists, more protests and the number of protesters increased, and not just at the site of the Mendiola Bridge and the Malacanang Palace. In [[Pampanga]], an estimated 2,000 protesters barricaded highways, including the highway linking Eastern Pampanga and San Fernando, and the highway linking Porac town and Angeles City. (Malaya, 26 January 1987) Talks regarding the Agrarian Reforms were shortly suspended because both sides failed to reach a common agenda, due to the real threat to the members of both panels at the time. (Pertaining to the rebels and insurgents against the Aquino administration at the time)

On another note, the National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP) challenged President [[Corazon Aquino]] to sign an executive order carrying out a minimum program of land reform presented to her by the Kilusang Magbubukid. Aside from the challenge of the NUSP, KMP (Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas) Chairman Jaime Tadeo said that the Aquinos should distribute their 6,000 hectare (14,600 acre) estate in Central Luzon as a model for land reform. In response to this, President Corazon Aquino was reportedly prepared to distribute at least parts of [[Hacienda Luisita]], and the Aquino sugar plantation as part of the supposed land reform program. In order to improve relations with the protesters, (including the groups Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, Kilusang Mayo Uno, The August Twenty-One Movement, and the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan) President Corazon Aquino allowed the protesters to cross the Mendiola Bridge and march towards the [[Malacanang Palace]]. (Malaya, 27 January 1987)

=== Government Legislation as Response ===
As a response to the incident, in 1987, the Aquino Government implemented the [[Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program]] (CARP). It was passed as "an agriculturally based economically driven" reform. This reform applied to all types of agricultural land, both public and private, regardless of tenure arrangement and crops produced. It aimed to redistribute 9,773,870 ha of land to 3,713,110 beneficiaries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Martin, Aurora L. Almeda. "Philippine Land Reform Cycles: Perpetuating U.S. Colonial &amp;nbsp;Policy." Philippine Studies 47, no. 2 (1999): 181-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, CARP experienced slow implementation due to: the land evaluation processes of the time, the lack of guidelines for landowner compensation, troubles with landowner-tenant negotiations, and the lack of institutional coordination between agrarian administrative agencies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Reception of CARP ====
Because of the problems in the implementation of CARP, public faith in government credibility and its capability to undertake reforms diminished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The farmers' response to this legislation was also extremely critical. They asserted that the legislation goes against the democratic process of land ownership and protects landlord interests. They also claim that it was passed as a counter-insurgency measure, instead of for genuine social justice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Eventual Consequences ===
In 1988, the Manila Regional Trial Court issued a decision to dismiss a P6.5-million class suit filed by relatives of the victims.&lt;ref name="bulatlat"&gt;{{cite web | last =Corpuz | first =Gerry Albert | title =Compensation Bill for Mendiola Massacre Victims Sought | url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/3-50/3-50-mendiola.html|website=Bulatlat.com | accessdate = 2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1993.&lt;ref name="bulatlat" /&gt;

In 2007, members of the ''Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas'' installed a [[granite]] marker at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the incident.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The government disallowed the conduct of demonstrations at Mendiola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =No rally policy on Mendiola designed to avoid repeat of 1987 bloody incident| url=http://www.news.ops.gov.ph/archives2005/oct16.htm#incident|website=News.op.gov.ph | accessdate = 2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2008, Mayor Alfredo Lim allowed rallies at the landmark, as long as they were held on weekends and holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Mendiola now open to rallyists on weekends, holidays - Lim | pages = | publisher =GMANews.tv | date = 2008-01-18 | url =http://www.gmanews.tv/story/76991/Mendiola-now-open-to-rallyists-on-weekends-holidays---Lim | accessdate = 2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5333">The '''Military Counseling Network''' ('''MCN''') is a non-profit GI Rights organization dedicated to being a free source of information to U.S military members concerning military regulations and discharges, with an emphasis on working with those members who are looking to apply for a [[conscientious objection]] discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Der Spiegel, english article [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,594250,00.html].&lt;/ref&gt; The Network is a project of the [[German Mennonite Peace Committee]] (Deutsches Mennonitisches Friedenskomitee, DMFK) and is located in [[Bammental]], [[Germany]] in the DMFK offices. MCN is part of the [[GI Rights Network]].

'''MCN''' exists as a source of information concerning a wide range of regulations and discharges, such as conscienctious objection, medical, and hardship to U.S military members stationed in Europe. Counselors do not provide legal advice, but can assist callers in finding lawyers in their area who can give them appropriate advice.

== History ==
In September 1986, Bill Boston created the ‘Military Counseling Project – Mutlangen’ in West Germany, offering an independent source of information about GI rights and discharge possibilities for US servicemembers. In the Fall of 1987, Janice Hill and Andre Gingerich Stoner joined with Boston and created the ‘Military Counseling Network.&lt;ref name="MCC Peace Office Newsletter"&gt;MCC Peace Office Newsletter: Military Counseling Network: Helping Military Sevicemembers Lay Down Their Arms [http://mcc.org/peace/pon/mcc_pon_08_01.pdf MCC Peace Office Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820061301/http://mcc.org/peace/pon/mcc_pon_08_01.pdf |date=2008-08-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mission statement read:
''Presently more than 250,000 members of the US military and their families and US civilian employees are stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany. Many of them suffer violations of rights and face conflicts of conscience and other difficulties within the military.''
''The Military Counseling Network advises US soldiers free of charge about their rights under military law and can assist them in achieving various discharges (conscientious objection, medical, hardship, etc.). The network of trained civilian counselors was established because soldiers are often poorly informed of their rights and until now had no source of assistance in Germany outside of the military.''
''The network also seeks to build bridges and foster dialogue between US soldiers and the German population in order to break down stereotypes and prejudices. MCN counselors are committed to the principles of nonviolence. The network works in close cooperation with European, American, and international human rights, peace, church, and women’s groups''.&lt;ref&gt;MCN, “Request for Funding,” p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through trainings in cooperation with the [[Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors]] ([[CCCO]]), the network expanded and included counselors in [[Berlin]], [[Frankfurt]], Mutlangen, [[Heilbronn]], [[Tübingen]], and [[Hunsrück]]. All of the counselors contributed on a voluntary, part-time basis, while continuing in their other jobs until August 1990, when MCN officially closed due to financial struggles and a number of counselors leaving the area.&lt;ref name="MCC Peace Office Newsletter"/&gt;

Later that month, however, [[Iraq]] invaded [[Kuwait]], and the US military build-up in the Middle East began. Over 100,000 US troops were deployed from Europe, and the need for MCN rose. During this time, MCNs' caseload increased, and counselors were even brought over from the US to help with the counseling. By mid-1995, however, MCN was disbanded as a coordinated organization after a decrease in case load.&lt;ref name="MCC Peace Office Newsletter"/&gt;

In 2003, as the United States prepared for another war in the Middle East, David Stutzman saw the reemerging need for military counseling. With the help of the [[Mennonite Central Committee]], [[Connection e.V]], and Ohne Rüstung Leben, MCN was re-founded as a project of the Deutsches Mennonitisches Friedenskomitee ([[the German Mennonite Peace Committee]]) 17 days before the War in Iraq began.&lt;ref name="MCC Peace Office Newsletter"/&gt; Since 2004, when the Mennonite Mission Network also came on as a supporting partner, there have been two full-time personnel in the office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mennoweekly.org/2009/4/20/counselors-help-soldiers-find-way-peace/?page=2 The Mennonite Weekly Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''No Land! No House! No Vote!''' is the name of a campaign by a number of poor people's movements in South Africa that calls for the boycotting of the vote and a general rejection of party politics and [[Votebank|vote banking]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://soundzofthesouth.blogspot.com/2011/03/by-voting-we-are-only-choosing-our.html By Voting We Are Only Choosing Our Oppressors], Soundz of the South&lt;/ref&gt; The name is meant to imply that if government does not deliver on issues important to affected communities (such as land and housing) these movements will not vote.

==History==
[[File:The Poor People's Alliance Outside the Constitutional Court 14 May 2009.jpg|thumb|Protesters outside the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] in 2009]]
The ''No Land! No House! No Vote!'' campaign began as a national campaign by the South African [[Landless Peoples Movement]] (LPM) in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abahlali.org/node/865|title="No Vote" Campaigns are not a Rejection of Democracy|publisher=Mail and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called the ''No Land! No Vote!'' campaign, the Landless People's Movement and the National Land Committee argued that voters have to be registered in their home ward to vote and that it would be impossible to vote if families were under threat of eviction or had no secure tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2005-01-25-an-anatomy-of-new-power|title=An anatomy of new power|publisher=Mail and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] has reported that LPM activists were tortured during the 2004 national government elections after taking on a ‘No Land! No Vote’ position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2005&amp;c=ZAF|title=2005 Annual Report for South Africa|publisher=Amnesty International|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081129162821/http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2005&amp;c=ZAF|archivedate=29 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]] and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://secure.financialmail.co.za/06/0217/currents/acurrent.htm Battle to be Heard], by Carol Paton, ''Financial Mail'', 17 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; movements boycotted the municipal elections under the banner of this campaign. The AEC held an election day march in [[Cape Town]] saying they would abstain from voting. A march by Abahlali baseMjondolo under the banner of the ''No Land! No House! No Vote!'' campaign was illegally banned by the [[Durban]] Municipality and was met with police repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/comment/53204|title=Sekwanele! (Enough is enough!): Post-apartheid land and housing struggles|publisher=Pambazuka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abahlali.org/node/865|title="No Vote" Campaigns are not a Rejection of Democracy|publisher=Mail and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Landless Peoples Movement, the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign and Abahlali baseMjondolo and the Rural Network joined to form the [[Poor People's Alliance]]. In 2009, the Alliance voted to boycott the national elections under the ''No Land! No House! No Vote!'' banner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainfos.ca/en/ainfos23942.html Resistance Not Ballots; Mass Organisation Not Authoritarian Leaders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608163041/http://www.ainfos.ca/en/ainfos23942.html |date=8 June 2011 }}, Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front, 9 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009 national election campaign, the ''No Vote!'' campaign suffered severe repression by political parties and police. On 8 February 2009, the [[South African Police]] allegedly beat and tear-gassed [[Gugulethu]] residents who were holding a meeting about housing because the [[ANC]] provincial chairperson [[Mcebisi Skwatsha]] claimed they were disrupting voters registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://antieviction.org.za/2009/02/09/aec-members-tear-gassed-beaten-and-arrested-residents-lay-blame-on-anc/|title=AEC members tear gassed, beaten and arrested; residents lay blame on ANC|publisher=Anti-Eviction Campaign|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213234246/http://antieviction.org.za/2009/02/09/aec-members-tear-gassed-beaten-and-arrested-residents-lay-blame-on-anc/|archivedate=13 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/245.1|title=Elections: A Dangerous Time for Poor People's Movements in South Africa|publisher=SACSIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight members of the Landless Peoples Movement were also arrested in March 2009 and some claim that this is related to the ''No Vote!'' campaign by the Poor Peoples Alliance.

==Reasoning behind the campaign==
Proponents of the ''No Land! No House! No Vote!'' campaign have explained the reasons behind their campaign. There are a variety of reasons for boycotting elections&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/258.1 The Thoroughly Democratic Logic of Refusing to Vote], SACSIS, 2 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but most people who take this position say that they have been voting since 1994 but have seen no positive result from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2452475,00.html|title='No house, no jobs – no vote'|publisher=News24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301060216/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2452475,00.html|archivedate=1 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsandletters.org/issues/2011/May-Jun/SAfricaMayJun_11.asp South Africa: 'No Land!

==Variations on the campaign==

Proponents of the ''No Land! No House! No Vote!'' Campaign have come up with similar slogans which have included the statements 'No Jobs!', 'No Electricity!', 'No Water!', 'No Respect!', 'No Freedom!' as part of the 'No Vote!' boycott campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-10-30-no-electricity-vote-say-protesters No electricity, no vote, say protesters], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 30 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abahlali.org/node/4406 Devastating Fire in RR Section Khayelitsha – No Electricity!

==International connections==

The Chicago Anti-Eviction Campaign has used the slogan 'No House No Vote'&lt;ref&gt;[http://inthesetimes.com/uprising/entry/13663/whos_house_our_house_chicago_communities_hold_meeting_to_demand_eviction_mo/ Chicago Communities Demand Eviction Moratorium], by MILES KAMPF-LASSIN, ''In these Times'', 10 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the campaign==

According to South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] "If you do not vote, you are depriving yourself of a freedom we have fought for and given you. You are deciding to oppress yourself...you are failing yourself and the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypress.co.za/SouthAfrica/News/Zuma-Malema-gun-for-votes-20110507 Zuma, Malema gun for votes], Paddy Harper, ''City Press'', 8 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Object detection''' is a computer technology related to [[computer vision]] and [[image processing]] that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. Well-researched domains of object detection include [[face detection]] and [[pedestrian detection]]. Object detection has applications in many areas of computer vision, including [[image retrieval]] and [[video surveillance]].

==Uses==
It is widely used in [[Computer vision|computer vision task]] such as [[face detection]], [[face recognition]], [[object Co-segmentation|video object co-segmentation]]. It is also used in tracking objects, for example tracking a ball during a football match, [[motion capture|tracking movement]] of a cricket bat, tracking a person in a video.

== Concept ==
Every [[entity|object]] class has its own special [[feature (computer vision)|feature]]s that helps in classifying the class &amp;ndash; for example all [[circles]] are round.
Object class detection uses these special features. For example, when looking for circles, objects that are at a particular distance from a point (i.e. the center) are sought. Similarly, when looking for squares, objects that are [[perpendicular]] at corners and have equal side lengths are needed.  A similar approach is used for [[face]] identification where eyes, nose, and lips can be found and [[feature (computer vision)|feature]]s like skin color and distance between eyes can be found.

==Methods==

Methods for object detection generally fall into either [[machine learning]]-based approaches or [[deep learning]]-based approaches. For Machine Learning approaches, it becomes necessary to first define features using one of the methods below, then using a technique such as [[support vector machine]] (SVM) to do the classification. On the other hand, deep learning techniques that are able to do end-to-end object detection without specifically defining features, and are typically based on  [[convolutional neural networks]] (CNN).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9563">'''Operation West End''' was the first sting operation done by [[Tehelka]] in 2001, an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[news magazine]] known for its [[investigative journalism]]. It was done in order to make the murky defense deals of the then ruling party NDA public. 

The special correspondents of the magazine filmed several corrupt defense officials and politicians of ruling [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) government including [[Bhartiya Janta Party]] then President Late [[Bangaru Laxman]]. The operation took seven and a half months to complete.

== The operation ==
The magazine created a fictitious London based [[arms manufacturing]] company known as West End International. The strategy adopted by the investigative journalists was to get in touch with a person in the lowest end of the defence chain and then move upwards. Therefore, the operation started&lt;ref name="ol1"&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Tehelkas-Operation-West-End/211141 Tehelka's Operation West End], March 24, 2001, Outlook.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Senior Section Officer P. Sashi who was posted in the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]]. His desire to make money from arms dealers provided the starting point for journalists from Tehelka. After getting some monetary incentive, P. Sashi took the team to Brigadier Anil Sehgal’s house in New Delhi. Sehgal was then the Deputy Director in Directorate General of Ordnance and Supply (DGOS), an important army procurement post. Both these officials helped the team with two vital things; information about a defence product required by the [[Indian army]] and how to move ahead in order to sell their products.

Brigadier Sehgal demanded to be entertained in a five-star hotel to which the team agreed. The former brought in Lt. Colonel Sharma, who was an army officer posted in [[Air Force]] procurement section. After the meeting, Brigadier Sehgal demanded Rs. 200,000 to give documents related to the procurement of hand-held [[Thermographic camera|thermal cameras]] and other equipment that the company might be interested in supplying to the Indian Army. After accepting the money he also advised on how to proceed in the matter of bidding for the hand-held thermal cameras. During the conversation, Brigadier Sehgal said that the company would have to pay to everyone and some percentage would also reach the then Defence Minister [[George Fernandes]]. P. Sashi also provided confidential documents related to the procurement of [[ammunition]], tubes, [[clothing]] and [[helicopters]].

On November 26, 2000, the team was introduced to Deepak Gupta, the son of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) [[trustee]] R. K. Gupta. Deepak Gupta assured that he would help the UK based company bag the project and talked about his influence in the government. In the subsequent meetings he elaborated on his functioning and said that he worked from the [[Prime Minister's Office (India)|Prime Minister's Office]] (PMO).&lt;ref name="ol2"&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?211141-4 Tehelka's Operation West End], March 24, 2001, Outlook.&lt;/ref&gt;

The team then met R. K. Gupta, the RSS trustee and a big defence middleman. He was quite vocal about his relationship with the Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[Lal Krishna Advani]] and said that both of them were tenants at his properties. He had also helped establish the RSS headquarters in 1967 in Jhandewala, [[Delhi]]. He assured the team that he will get their work done and will pay the bribe on their behalf to the Defence Secretary, Joint Secretary, Under Secretary, the then treasurer of the party Ved Prakash Goyal, [[List of Presidents of the Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP’s national president]] Bangaru Laxman. He did not wanted to involve [[Brajesh Mishra]] as his price was rupees one [[crore]].&lt;ref name="ol3"&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?211141-5 Page 5, Tehelka's Operation West End], March 24, 2001, Outlook.&lt;/ref&gt;

They then met him several times over the period of one week and promised to compensate him for his recommendation to the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Defence Ministry]] of Supply regarding hand-held thermal imagers. On January 1, 2001, Laxman accepted One [[lakh]] rupees at BJP’s office for pursuing their proposal.&lt;ref name="yt"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsuUIRiVlsU Operation West End: The Bangaru Laxman Tape], April 27, 2012, YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 2001, the final meeting held between the fake representatives and Laxman.

== Aftermath ==
On March 13, 2001,&lt;ref name="it1" /&gt; Tehelka released video CDs of the sting operation that led to political storm in India. Subsequently, Bangaru Laxman had to resign from the position of BJP president. It emerged that the defence deals were not driven by considerations of national security, but by the [[greed]] of political and bureaucratic people.&lt;ref name="hindu2001"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/2001/03/20/stories/13200341.htm Operation West End], March 20, 2001, The Hindu.&lt;/ref&gt; The defence minister George Fernandes and his party president Jaya Jaitly resigned. [[Mamata Banerjee]], an important ally of the coalition quit the government.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/16/world/the-sting-that-has-india-writhing.html?pagewanted=1 The Sting That Has India Writhing], March 16, 2001, The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government booked Tehelka under many sections and used Inland Revenue, Enforcement Directorate and Intelligence Bureau but could not find anything. Investors of the website were also investigated and Tehelk’s financer Shanker Sharma was imprisoned without any charge. The journalists who carried out the investigation were also imprisoned.&lt;ref name="tg"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2003/jan/06/newmedia.india Website pays price for Indian bribery expose], January 6, 2003, The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgement by court ==
On April 27, 2012, a special [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] court convicted the former BJP President, Bangaru Laxman of [[Political corruption|corruption]] charges.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3360364.ece Bangaru Laxman convicted of taking bribe], April 28, 2012, The Hindu.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28, 2012, the court sentenced him to four year of rigorous imprisonment and also imposed a fine of one lakh rupees.&lt;ref name="hindu2"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bangaru-laxman-sentenced-to-4year-rigorous-imprisonment/article3364120.ece Bangaru Laxman sentenced to 4-year rigorous imprisonment], April 28, 2012, The Hindu.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The investigation into the sting operation took a dramatic turn when it was revealed that [[prostitutes]] were supplied to three defence officials.&lt;ref name="rediff"&gt;[http://m.rediff.com/news/2001/aug/22teh.htm Tehelka expose: Armymen bribed with prostitutes], August 22, 2001, Rediff.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and Samata Party condemned it and raised the questions on ethical side of investigative journalism. However, Aniruddh Bahal, the journalist who was a part of the operation said, “When the demand came from armymen (to have prostitutes) we were foxed. We resisted it. We were baffled. But the demand was so forceful we could not proceed further without catering to their demand.” They decided to provide prostitutes to show that officials were ready to go to any level.&lt;ref name="rediff" /&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Osaka International Peace Center'''|大阪国際平和センター|Ōsaka-kokusai-heiwa-sentā}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Peace Osaka'''|ピースおおさか|Pīsu-Ōsaka}}, is a [[peace museum]] established in August 1991 based in the city of [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. It focuses on the destruction of the city during [[World War II]] and the broader themes of the tragedy of war and the importance of peace. It is funded by [[Osaka city]] and [[Osaka Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/09/14/national/war-museum-may-scale-back-on-japan-aggression/ War museum may scale back on Japan aggression September 14, 2013] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, after pressures by members of the [[Japan Innovation Party]], exhibits were changed; the section on U.S. air raids in Osaka Prefecture between December 1944 and August 1945 was expanded and items related to Japan's actions in Asia were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201505010073 Peace museum, caving in to threats of closure, scraps wartime 'aggression' exhibits], ''Asahi Shimbun'' May 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the museum was radically altered and transformed: it became a conservative museum.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Seaton, [http://japanfocus.org/-Philip-Seaton/4348/article.html "The Nationalist Assault on Japan’s Local Peace Museums: The Conversion of Peace Osaka"], ''The Asia-Pacific Journal'', Vol. 13, Issue 30, No. 2, July 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding and early history==
The museum was established in 1991 and was rare in Japan for showing the atrocities committed by Japan as well as the tragedies suffered by Japanese people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeff Kingston|Kingston, Jeff]] [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2015/06/06/commentary/history-harsh-unless-erase/ History is harsh unless you erase it June 6, 2015] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 it hosted a symposium by the Osaka-based [[historical revisionism|historical revisionist]] group "Society to Correct the Biased Display of War-Related Materials" with [[Shūdō Higashinakano]] of [[Asia University (Japan)|Asia University]] as the keynote speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Eric [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2000/01/18/national/nanking-massacre-biggest-lie-unverifiable-group/ Nanking Massacre biggest lie, unverifiable: group January 18, 2000] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved on October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeff Kingston|Kingston, Jeff]] [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2000/04/18/books/book-reviews/lessons-of-the-nanjing-debate/ Lessons of the Nanjing debate April 18, 2000] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese government spokesperson stated that hosting the event would hurt the [[Osaka bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2000/01/25/national/rape-of-nanking-symposium-hurts-games-bid-china-says/ Rape of Nanking symposium hurts Games bid, China says January 25, 2000] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Osaka later became the first city to be eliminated from the bidding process, with the games later being awarded to Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, Jere [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/sports/olympics-beijing-wins-bid-for-2008-olympic-games.html?pagewanted=all OLYMPICS; Beijing Wins Bid for 2008 Olympic Games July 14, 2001] ''[[New York Times]]'' Retrieved October 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political pressure to censor==
Since opening, the museums exhibits were described as "masochistic" by [[historical negationism|conservative groups]]. In September 2013 the museum unveiled a plan to put more emphasis on the [[Bombing of Osaka]] during [[World War II]]. There was a possibility that exhibits dealing with [[Japanese war crimes]] may [[political censorship|be reduced]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/09/14/national/war-museum-may-scale-back-on-japan-aggression/ War museum may scale back on Japan aggression September 14, 2013] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that the plans were to "drastically" reduce the material on Japan's aggression, the ''[[Japan Times]]'' printed an editorial calling on the museum to reconsider and stated that "The plan by the center — which is dedicated to studies of the war and efforts to foster peace — contradicts its purported independence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2014/08/14/editorials/dont-hide-the-harsh-reality-of-war/ August 14, 2014] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibits before 2015 ==
Exhibition Room A, on the second floor of the Osaka International Peace Center, covered the [[bombing of Osaka]] and other factors of Japanese domestic life during the last four years of the [[Pacific War]], mentioning neighborhood associations, school mobilization, nationalistic textbooks, and civil defense measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seltz|first1=Daniel|title=Remembering the War and the Atomic Bombs: New Museums, New Approaches|journal=Radical History Review|date=Fall 1999|volume=75|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition Room B, on the first floor, covered the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] and was critical of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s actions in East Asia. One panel was entitled "Invading the Asian Continent," and was accompanied by displays of the Imperial Japanese Army's involvement in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. There is also a section on the annexation of Korea in 1909 and [[Korea under Japanese rule]], ending with a note that "Japan has still many unsolved problems" regarding the human rights of the 680,000 resident Koreans in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seltz|first1=Daniel|title=Remembering the War and the Atomic Bombs: New Museums, New Approaches|journal=Radical History Review|date=Fall 1999|volume=75|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition Room C, on the third floor, advocated the end of "disputes and wars over ethnic, religious, or ideological differences."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peace-osaka.or.jp/pdf/pamphlet_en.pdf Pamphlet describing museum exhibits] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exhibits focus on the threat of nuclear weapons, but also argue that starvation, [[poverty]], and [[environmental degradation|degradation of the global environment]] are threats to [[world peace]].  To emphasize these threats to peace, the museum includes a replica of the [[Doomsday Clock]].

In May 2013, the party merged with the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]].&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/554612/arbab-ghulam-rahims-ppml-merges-with-pml-n/|title=Arbab Ghulam Rahim's PPML merges with PML-N|work=The Express Tribune|date=26 May 2013|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many PML (Q) heavyweights including [[Arbab Ghulam Rahim]], [[Hamid Nasir Chattha]], [[Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri]], [[Humayun Akhtar Khan]], Haroon Akhtar Khan, [[Salim Saifullah Khan]], [[Humayun Saifullah Khan]], [[Gohar Ayub Khan]], [[Omar Ayub Khan]], [[Kashmala Tariq]], Ata Muhammad Maneka and many other like-minded politicians got together to form what they believed was the legitimate version of the PML (Q). This created a huge vacuum in the original PML (Q) and in 2011, more than half of its members in the Punjab Assembly decided to ditch their original party and join hands with the PML (N) to support [[Chief Minister of Punjab, Pakistan|Chief Minister]] [[Shahbaz Sharif]] when the Pakistan Peoples Party was kicked out of the Punjab Government. In 2010 the Likeminded faction began its effort to unite factions of the Muslim League under one umbrella and managed to create an electoral alliance known as the Muttahida Muslim League which included [[Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed]] of [[Awami Muslim League (Pakistan)|Awami Muslim League]], Makhdoom Syed Ahmad Mehmood of [[Pakistan Muslim League (F)|Pakistan Muslim League (Functional)]], and Ijaz-ul-Haq of [[Pakistan Muslim League (Z)|Pakistan Muslim League (Zia)]]. In May 2012 the Likeminded Group officially entered into an electoral alliance with Pakistan Muslim League (N) in a bid to unite all Muslim League factions and defeat opposing parties such as [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|PTI]] and the ruling coalition of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] and [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML (Q)]].

In March 2009, Pakistan Muslim League (Like-Minded) renamed as Pakistan Peoples Muslim League&lt;ref name="name change"&gt;http://dawn.com/2013/03/28/arbab-renames-his-party-as-peoples-muslim-league/&lt;/ref&gt; but it eventually seized to exist as it merged with [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] in May 2013.&lt;ref name="merger"/&gt;

'''Parliamentary debate''' (also referred to as "parli") is an academic [[debate]] event. Many university-level institutions in English-speaking nations sponsor parliamentary debate teams. In addition the format is currently spreading to the high school level. Despite the name, the parli is not related to debate in governmental parliaments beyond formal speaker titles such as "Opposition Leader" and "Prime Minister".

==British Parliamentary debate==
[[File:British Parliamentary style debate, Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine.JPG|thumb|Debating in [[Khmelnytskyi]], [[Ukraine]]. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is speaking.]]
{{main article|British Parliamentary Style}}
British Parliamentary debate is very widespread. It has also been adopted as the official style of the [[World Universities Debating Championship]] and the [[European Universities Debating Championship]] (at which the speakers are given only fifteen minutes' notice of the motion).  Speeches are usually between five and seven minutes in duration. The debate consists of four teams of two speakers, sometimes called ''factions'', with two teams on either side of the case.

Because of the style's origins in British [[parliamentary procedure]], the two sides are called the ''Government'' and ''Opposition'', while the speakers take their titles from those of their parliamentary equivalents (such as the opening Government speaker, called the ''Prime Minister''). Furthermore, since this style is based on parliamentary debate, each faction is considered to be one of two parties in a [[coalition]]. They must therefore differentiate themselves from the other team on their side of the case in order to succeed in their own right.

All speakers are expected to offer [[Point of information (competitive debate)|Points of Information]] (POIs) to their opponents. POIs are particularly important in ''British Parliamentary'' style, as it allows the first two teams to maintain their relevance during the course of the debate, and the last two teams to introduce their arguments early in the debate. The first and last minute of each speech is considered "protected time", during which no POI may be offered.

Depending on the country, there are variations in speaking time, speaking order, and the number of speakers. For example, in New Zealand, both the leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister offer a short summary as the last two speakers.

==In the United States==
''American parliamentary debate'' is supported by a number of organizations in the United States at the tertiary and secondary levels.

'''University level'''

The most popular intercollegiate parliamentary debate style is supported by the [[National Parliamentary Debate Association]] (NPDA), which was born in western US in 1991.&lt;ref name="parlidebate1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlidebate.org/about-npda/history/an-early-history-of-the-npda/ |title=An Early History of the NPDA &amp;#124; National Parliamentary Debate Association |publisher=Parlidebate.org |date=30 June 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927093217/http://www.parlidebate.org/about-npda/history/an-early-history-of-the-npda/ |archive-date=27 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; NPDA circuit consists of a loose confederation of local leagues and a number of invitational tournaments.

[[American Parliamentary Debate Association]] (APDA), the oldest intercollegiate parliamentary debate league in the US, was founded in 1982. APDA currently has around 40 member universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeforensics.org/list-of-college-programs |title=List of College Programs » Council of Forensic Organizations |publisher=Collegeforensics.org |date=17 September 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725185626/http://www.collegeforensics.org/list-of-college-programs |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdaweb.org/standings |title=Home of the American Parliamentary Debate Association &amp;#124; American College Debate Association – Standings |publisher=Apda Web |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily on the east coast.

A number of smaller intercollegiate debate leagues, such as the Lincoln Parliamentary League (LPL) and [[International Public Debate Association]] (IPDA) also exist.

The [[British Parliamentary Style]] (a.k.a. Worlds Debate, distinct from World Schools Style) is also beginning to spread to the US, with the US Universities Debating Championship held annually at the University of Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debate.uvm.edu/debateblog/usu2011/Welcome.html |title=USU 2011 VERMONT |publisher=Debate.uvm.edu |date=3 April 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chamber Debate is a modified form of [[Australia-Asia debating]] that sponsors three national tournaments annually using the 3-on-3 format of parliamentary debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parli.org |title=C3 Debate |publisher=parli.org |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other formats of parliamentary debate, Chamber Debate allows teams to use electronic devices a via 4th non-speaking member of each team who conducts fact-checking and other research for their team during the round.

'''High school level'''

Parliamentary debate is offered through the High School Public Debate League (http://highschooldebate.org).

The other public school high school debate league, [[National Forensic League]] (NFL), does not offer parliamentary debate at its national tournament. It does, however, recognize parli competitions offered at the state level, albeit at a reduced points value.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nflonline.org/uploads/Rostrum/0910_011_013.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 NFL Nationals added Supplemental Debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nflonline.org/Main/NewSupplementalDebateEvent |title=National Forensic League, Speech &amp; Debate Honor Society – New Supplemental Debate Event |publisher=Nflonline.org |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629192150/http://www.nflonline.org/Main/NewSupplementalDebateEvent |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which bears some similarity to parliamentary debate.

A number of attempts to organize a high school parli championship tournament have been made – National Parliamentary Caucus (2003–2005), NPDL Parli Grand Nationals (2006–2007) and IDEA Tournament of Champions (2005–2009, switched to world format in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointofinformation.org/files/results/championships/ |title=Folder State and National Championships |publisher=Point of Information |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007041822/http://www.pointofinformation.org/files/results/championships/ |archive-date=7 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current incarnation of such championship is the Tournament of Champions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointofinformation.org/news/california-cup-2011/ |title=California Cup 2011 |publisher=Point of Information |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007041857/http://www.pointofinformation.org/news/california-cup-2011/ |archive-date=7 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by Point of Information. (2010–present, began accepting out-of-state teams in 2011). It was started as a California championship, named "California Cup," but has been renamed the Tournament of Champions to represent the prestige of the high school tournament.

Oregon State Tournament ([[Oregon School Activities Association|OSAA]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osaa.org/speech/ |title=Speech |publisher=OSAA.org |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; added parliamentary debate (known In Oregon as [[Public debate]]) in 2001, California State Tournament (CHSSA)&lt;ref&gt;http://cahssa.org/curriculum/event_information&lt;/ref&gt; followed suit in 2003, and Pennsylvania State Tournament (PHSSL)&lt;ref name="phssl1"&gt;http://www.phssl.org/pdf/ParliamentaryDebateGuide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010. Yale, ASU, Whitman, as well as a number of invitational tournaments in Oregon and California, the largest of them held at Stanford, James Logan HS, SCU, UOP, Willamette, University of Oregon, Pepperdine and Claremont HS also offer parli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointofinformation.org/resources/tournament-calendar-2010-2011/ |title=Tournament Calendar 2010–2011 |publisher=Point of Information |date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007041902/http://www.pointofinformation.org/resources/tournament-calendar-2010-2011/ |archive-date=7 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kansas City, Missouri area has conducted monthly high school tournaments since 2002.  The Kansas City Greater Metropolitan Parliamentary Debate League offers two-round contests during the week with a championship tournament at the end of the school year.

High school parli is taught at several summer [[debate camp]]s, including Stanford National Forensics Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snfi.org/camp/40/parliamentary-debate.html |title=Parliamentary Debate : Stanford National Forensic Institute |publisher=Snfi.org |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ODI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregondebateinstitute.wordpress.com/ |title=Fiat Oregon |publisher=Oregondebateinstitute.wordpress.com |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCPDI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/forensics/events/hspdi.html |title=About Us |publisher=Claremontmckenna.edu |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the POI Debate Institute at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poiinstitute.com |title=About Us |publisher=poiinstitute.com|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the home school level, the home school debate league, [[Stoa USA|Stoa]], also promotes parliamentary debate in a number of its tournaments nationwide. [[Stoa USA|Stoa]] also offers parliamentary debate at nationals ([http://www.stoausa.org/nitoc NITOC]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NITOC 2012|url=http://www.stoausa.org/nitoc|publisher=Stoa USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other home school debate league, [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association|NCFCA]], does not offer parliamentary debate at any of its tournaments or is it hosted at nationals.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Format'''

The first key feature uniting various formats of parliamentary debate in the US is their spontaneity. The resolutions alternate each round. They are announced, then participants are given 20 minutes of preparation time known as "prep". APDA is somewhat of an exception in the respect, with "loose link" rounds allowing the affirmative to run a case of their choosing, dealing with virtually any topic.&lt;ref name="apdaweb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdaweb.org/guide/rules |title=Home of the American Parliamentary Debate Association &amp;#124; American College Debate Association – Guide |publisher=Apda Web |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second key feature of parli is a ban on quoted evidence. Debaters may not bring in any material that was not prepared in the 20 minutes of preparation time and consult it during the round. APDA, Worlds and high school parli debate styles tend to take a more lay-friendly approach to debate, ensuring that debates are easy to understand no matter the audience member's expertise of the resolution. NPDA is more diverse, with some teams engaging in a more academic and specific-knowledge style borrowed from [[Policy debate]]. Resolutions typically focus on current events, though the entrance of the [[Kritik]] to NPDA, and, to a lesser extent, to some high school circuits, introduced a philosophical element to parli.

This style consists of a two-on-two debate, between the affirmative team, known as the Government or the Proposition, and the negative team, referred to as the Opposition. Debater role names are borrowed from the British Parliament, with the judge being referred to as the Speaker. The round consists of six speeches, as follows:

#''Prime Minister'' (PM): the first affirmative speaker presents the affirmative case
#''Leader of the Opposition Constructive (LOC)'': the first negative speaker presents the negative case and answers the PMC arguments
#''Member of the Government Constructive (MGC)'': the second affirmative speaker upholds the affirmative case by pulling across information that was not addressed in the LOC and responds to the LOC arguments
#''Member of the Opposition Constructive (MOC)'': the second negative speaker upholds the negative case by pulling across information that was not addressed in the MGC and responds to the MGC arguments
#''Leader of the Opposition Rebuttal (LOR)'': the first negative speaker begins with an overview of why the negative team should win and explicitly analyzes certain arguments that had been dropped by the affirmative team throughout the debate. New arguments are not allowed.
#''Prime Minister Rebuttal (PMR)'':the first affirmative speaker summarizes the round with an overview and responds to any new arguments brought up in the MOC/LOC Opp block and provides reasons for why the judge should vote affirmative. New arguments in the PMR are not allowed.
 
Specific rules and speech times vary slightly between organizations. NPDA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlidebate.org/npda-rules/ |title=NPDA Rules &amp;#124; National Parliamentary Debate Association |publisher=Parlidebate.org |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; APDA&lt;ref name="apdaweb1"/&gt; and OSAA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointofinformation.org/resources/osaa-parli-rules/ |title=OSAA Parli Rules |publisher=Point of Information |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007041953/http://www.pointofinformation.org/resources/osaa-parli-rules/ |archive-date=7 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; use the 7-8-8-8-4-5 format, CHSSA&lt;ref&gt;http://cahssa.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/ByLaws11.338142000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the ASU Invitational&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joyoftournaments.com/az/asu/info.asp?p=5 |title=2012 Arizona State University Tournament |publisher=Joyoftournaments.com |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; use the Claremont 7-7-7-7-5-5 format, the SCU Invitational uses the 6-7-7-7-4-5 format, and Yale high school tournaments use the Osterweis 4-5-5-5-2-3 format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledebate.org/osterweis/parli.html |title=Yale Debate Association |publisher=Yaledebate.org |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; PHSSL borrows its 8 speeches 6-6-6-6-6-6-3-3 format from [[World Schools Style debate]].&lt;ref name="phssl1"/&gt;

Most variations of the style do not include a specialized cross-examination period, but allow debaters to make parliamentary points.

* [[Point of information (competitive debate)|Points of Information]] (POI) are questions or statements the opposing side can direct the speaker who has the floor. The speaker has an option to recognize or decline a POI. In most styles POIs cannot be made during the first and last minute of each speech (known as protected time) or during rebuttals.
*''Points of Order'' are made when the speaker is introducing a new argument during a rebuttal speech, or grossly mischaracterizing arguments. During a Point of Order, official time (usually kept by the judge) is to be stopped while the judge listens and considers the point raised.
*''Points of Personal Privilege'' are made when the speaker makes offensive claims or personal attacks.

==World Schools style==
{{main article|World Schools Style Debating}}
World Schools Style Debating combines the British Parliamentary and Australian formats, which results in a debate comprising eight speeches delivered by two three-member teams (the Proposition and the Opposition). Each speaker delivers an eight-minute speech – the first two are substantive matter and the third a rebuttal speech; then both teams deliver a "reply speech" lasting four minutes, with the last word being reserved for the Proposition. In junior debates, these limits are changed to about 5 minutes, and in some local competitions, speeches are 7 minutes.

Between the end of the first and the beginning of the last minute of an eight-minute speech, the opposing party may offer "points of information". The speaker may refuse these, but should take at least one or two points during his or her speech. No points of order or Privilege are used.

Topics can be supplied long in advance, or may be given 45 minutes or an hour before the debate begins. There is not much room for re-definition, and [[squirrel (debate)|squirreling]] is strictly prohibited. The [[World Schools Debating Championships]] is attended by many countries, and uses this format.

A similar format, with 7-minute speeches and Points-of-Information, is known as the Asian Parliamentary Format and is used by the [[United Asian Debating Championships]]

The '''People's Revolutionary Army''' ({{lang-es|Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo}}, abbreviated as ERP) was the military branch of the [[communist]] [[Workers Revolutionary Party (Argentina)|Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores]] (PRT, Workers' Revolutionary Party) in [[Argentina]].

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The ERP was founded as the armed wing of the PRT, a [[communist party]] emerging from the [[Trotskyist]] tradition, but soon turned to the [[Maoist]] theory, especially the [[Cultural Revolution]].  During the 1960s, the PRT adopted the ''[[foco|foquista]]'' strategy of [[insurgency]] associated with [[Che Guevara]], who had fought alongside [[Fidel Castro]] during the [[Cuban Revolution]].

The ERP launched its guerrilla campaign against the [[History of Argentina (1966-1973)|Argentine military dictatorship]] headed by [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] in 1969, using targeted [[urban guerrilla warfare]] methods such as assassinations and kidnappings of government officials and foreign company executives.  For example, in 1973 [[Enrique Gorriarán Merlo]] and [[Benito Urteaga]] led the ERP kidnapping of [[Esso]] executive [[Victor Samuelson]] and obtaining a ransom of $12 million.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=Corporations: Record Ransom|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942847,00.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=March 25, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|title=Court: Exxon Ransom Valid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/28/business/court-exxon-ransom-valid.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 28, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also assaulted several companies' offices using heavily armed commandos of the ERP's elite "Special Squad". Although claim and counter-claim are invariably difficult to reconcile, figures released for an official publication, ''Crónica de la subversión en la Argentina'' (Buenos Aires: Ediciones Depalma) at least give an indication of the kind of guerrilla activity undertaken, with claims that the rural guerrillas occupied 52 towns, robbed 166 banks and took US $76 million in ransoms for the kidnappings of 185 people.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrillas and Generals: The "Dirty War" in Argentina, Paul H. Lewis, Page 52, Greenwood Publishing Group (2002) ''"Moyano classified her armed operations more carefully into arms thefts, attacks on property, takeovers (of towns buildings, broadcasting stations, or police and military posts), bombings, kidnappings, hijackings, and deaths (i.e., assassinations). She found that bombings ( 855 incidents), arms thefts (278) and takeovers (200) were the most frequent kinds of guerrilla action between 1969 and 1973."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The group continued the violent campaign even after democratic elections and the return to civilian rule in 1973, with [[Juan Peron]]'s return. On June 20, 1973 the [[Peronist]] movement split after the [[Ezeiza massacre]], that started when Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Osinde's crowd monitoring right-wing Peronist militia reported the arrival of heavily armed Montoneros in two buses the day that Peron returned from exile.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrillas and Generals: The "Dirty War" in Argentina, Paul H. Lewis, Pages 88-89, Greenwood Publishing Group (2002) "Around midmorning they began to notice suspicious movements beyond the fields that flanked the airport highway. Men with different-colored armbands were positionining themselves behind the trees while others were climing up into them. Then, just before noon, a huge column of armed men, led by Governor Oscar Bidegain, appeared at the southern approach to the overpass, flanked by two Leyland buses and some ambulances. A few minutes later someone fired a shot, and the battle was on. It raged for the next three hours (...) One of the Leyland buses was blown up by a grenade. Later, it was found to be full of weapons, with supports in the windows for machine guns  (...)  Thrown back, the Montoneros began to scatter, pursued by Osinde's men. Some of those who were caught were shot or badly beaten. Most were hauled to the International Hotel at the Ezeiza Airport, where Osinde had set up an emergency interrogation center, and were beaten unmercifully until they revealed who had ordered the attack."&lt;/ref&gt; Victor E. Samuelson, an [[Exxon]] executive, was abducted on 6 December 1973 by the ERP. He was released after 144 days in captivity, after the Exxon Corporation paid a record ransom of $14.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Executive Freed in Argentina; Guerrillas Got Record $14.2 Million. Los Angeles Times. (30/04/1974)&lt;/ref&gt; The avowed aim of the ERP was a [[communist revolution]] against the Argentine government in pursuit of "[[Dictatorship of the proletariat|proletarian rule]]."

The ERP publicly remained in the forefront. ERP guerrilla activity took the form of attacks on military outposts, police stations and convoys. In 1971, 57 policemen were killed fighting the left-wing guerrillas, and in 1972 another 38 policemen lost their lives in the guerrilla violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NtZ3EvNYxjYC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=another+38+policemen+were+killed+during+1972&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wd9uksDdmg&amp;sig=kqMHR9PcQg55iQImjxZT-HJ4eLU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PYSzSafYDpK2sAPltMhy&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=Guerrillas and Generals|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December 1972, Marine Private Julio César Provenzano of the ERP, is killed when the bomb he planted in one of the lavatories of the Argentine Naval Headquarters went off prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19730331&amp;id=MGo0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8QkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4256,7005410|title=Star-News - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 1973, ERP guerrillas kidnapped Rear-Admiral Francisco Agustín Alemán.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19730404&amp;id=4ddUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1JADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3341,378012|title=The Age - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1974 the ERP ''Compañía Héroes de Trelew'', named in commemoration of the 1972 [[Trelew massacre|Massacre of Trelew]], during which 16 left-wing guerrillas who had attempted to escape detention had been shot dead, attacked the barracks at Azul, killing the Commanding Officer (Colonel Camilo Arturo Gay) and his wife (Hilda Irma Casaux) and kidnapping and later executing Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Ibarzábal, with Patricia Gay the daughter of Gay and Casaux later taking her own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2009/01/18/elpais/p-01841740.htm|title=Cuando Perón habló de "exterminar uno a uno" a los guerrilleros|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August, an assault on the Argentine Army's Villa Maria explosives factory in Cordoba and the 17th Airborne Infantry Regiment at Catamarca by 70 ERP guerrillas dressed in army fatigues, met mixed fortune after killing and wounding eight policemen and soldiers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodismodeverdad.com.ar/2009/08/18/ataque-a-la-fabrica-militar-de-polvoras-y-explosivos-villa-maria-cba-el-secuestro-de-larrabure/ Ataque a la Fabrica de Polvoras y Explosivos Villa Maria Cordoba]&lt;/ref&gt; but losing 16 guerrillas shot dead after they surrendered to 300 paratroopers of the 17th Airborne Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant-Colonel Eduardo Humberto Cubas.

=== Operations in Tucumán and Buenos Aires ===
{{main|Operativo Independencia}}
After the return of [[Juan Perón]] to the presidency in 1973, the ERP shifted to a rural strategy designed to secure a large land area as a base of military operations against the Argentine state.  The ERP leadership chose to send the ''Compania del Monte Ramón Rosa Jimenez'' (Ramón Rosa Jimenez Mountain Company) to the [[province of Tucumán]] at the edge of the long-impoverished Andean highlands in the northwest corner of Argentina. Many of the officers in the rural ''guerrilleros'' company were trained in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Díaz-Araujo. La guerrilla en sus libros. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-73493-2006-09-24.html|title=Página/12 :: El país :: Gorriarán Merlo cuenta su versión|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2008, Cuban leader Fidel Castro admitted that he supported the guerrilla forces in South America: ''"The only place where we didn't attempt to promote a revolution was in Mexico. Everywhere else, without exception, we tried"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/98-07/98-07-04/pag18.htm|title=Página/12|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politician Gustavo Breide Obeid, who fought as an army captain against ERP guerrillas in Tucumán Province, claimed in 2007 that mercenaries from Jordan, Nicaragua and Angola served in the 'Ramón Rosa Jimenez' Mountain Company. By December 1974, the guerrillas numbered about 100 fighters, with a 400-person support network from the Montoneros.&lt;ref&gt;Setentistas: De La Plata a la Casa Rosada, Fernando Amato, Christian Boyanovsky Bazán, Page 338, Editorial Sudamericana, (1 January 2008) ''"Luego fundó la Unidad Básica de Combate Logística (UBCL) en la que el Hippte era el jefe. Con el tiempo logró contar con cerca de treinta combatientes, alrededor de doscientos militantes, y mayor número de simpatizantes."''&lt;/ref&gt;
Led by [[Mario Roberto Santucho]], they soon established control over a third of the province and organized a base of some 2,500 sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NtZ3EvNYxjYC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=general+vila%27s+forces+numbered#PPA105,M1|title=Guerrillas and Generals|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Santucho's armed guerrillas in the northwestern province of Tucuman never exceeded 300 in the first year of the campaign.

The growth in ERP strength in the northwest, together with an increase in urban violence carried out by the left-Peronist [[Montoneros]] following Perón's death in 1974, led the government of [[Isabel de Perón]] to issue "annihilation decrees" and expand the military's powers to fight a [[counter-insurgency]] campaign in February 1975. In all, 83 servicemen and policemen were killed in fighting the left-wing guerrillas, between 1973 and 1974.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

Some 3,500 soldiers of the 5th Mountain Infantry Brigade, and two companies of elite [[commando]]s, placed under the command of Brigadier-General Acdel Vilas began immediately deploying in the Tucumán mountains in ''[[Operacion Independencia]]'', joined later by 1,500 more troops from the 4th Airborne Infantry Brigade and 8th Mountain Infantry Brigade.  The pattern of the war was largely dictated by the nature of the terrain, the mountains, rivers and extensive jungle denying both sides easy movement. The [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4B Skyhawk]] fighters and [[English Electric Canberra|B.62 Canberra]] bombers of the Argentine Air Force were used for offensive air support while the North American T-34 and [[FMA IA 58 Pucará]] served as a light ground-attack and reconnaissance aircraft. While fighting the guerrilla in the jungle and mountains, Vilas concentrated on uprooting the ERP support network in the towns, using [[state terror]] tactics later adopted nationwide during the "[[Dirty War]]", as well as a civic action campaign. By July, the Argentine Army commandos were mounting search-and-destroy missions. The Army special forces discovered Santucho's base camp in August, then raided the ERP urban headquarters in September. Most of the ''Compania del Monte's'' headquarters staff was killed in October and the remainder dispersed by the end of the year. While most of the leaders of the movement were killed outright, many of the captured ERP subalterns and sympathizers were incarcerated during the government of [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]], but little mercy was shown to captured guerrillas and civilian collaborators during the military dictatorship.

In May 1975, ERP representative Amilcar Santucho was captured trying to cross into [[Paraguay]] to promote the JCR unity effort. As a way to save himself, he provided information about the organization to [[Secretaría de Inteligencia]] (SIDE) agents that enabled Argentine security agencies to destroy what was left of the ERP, although pockets of ERP guerrillas continued to operate in the heavily wooded Tucuman mountains for many months. The case, during which an [[FBI]] official transmitted information obtained from the prisoners (Amilcar was detained along with a [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] member) to the Chilean [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], was one practical operation of [[Operation Condor]], which had started in 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fathom.com/feature/35164/ Operation Condor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027065127/http://www.fathom.com/feature/35164/ |date=2007-10-27 }}, [[John Dinges]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Meanwhile, the guerrilla movement switched its main effort to the north and on 5 October 1975 guerrillas struck the 29th Mountain Infantry Regiment. The 5th Brigade suffered a major blow at the hands of ''Montoneros'', when over one-hundred—perhaps several hundred&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=9nFyZaZGthgC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=perhaps+several+hundred+montoneros&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nS1oUdmih1&amp;sig=2JQIlP0Jvget7uNo6lU4amIp-kE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-Bi7SfnKDJSgM6yfsZMI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=Terrorism in Context|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Montoneros guerrillas and ''milicianos'' (militants) were involved in the planning and execution of the most elaborate Montoneros operation in the so-called "Dirty War", which involved the hijacking of a civilian airliner, taking over the provincial airport, attacking the 29th Infantry Regiment's barracks at [[Formosa Province|Formosa province]] and capturing its cache of arms, and finally escaping by air. Once the operation was over, they made good their escape towards a remote area in [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe province]]. The aircraft, a [[Boeing 737]], eventually landed on a crop field not far from the city of [[Rafaela]]. In the aftermath, 12 soldiers and 2 policemen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r5cuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=987,2124967&amp;hl=en|title=The Montreal Gazette - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were killed and several wounded. The sophistication of the operation, and the getaway cars and safehouses they used to escape from the crash-landing site, suggest several hundred guerrillas and their civilian supporters were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Hf1jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HOcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1098,1842894&amp;dq=|title=The Sydney Morning Herald - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1975 most 5th Brigade units were committed to the border areas of Tucumán with over 5,000 troops deployed in the province. There was however, nothing to prevent infiltrating through this outer ring and the ERP were still strong inside Buenos Aires. Mario Santucho's Christmas offensive opened on 23 December 1975. The operation was dramatic in its impact, with ERP units, supported by ''Montoneros'', mounting a large scale assault against the army supply base ''Domingo Viejobueno'' at the industrial suburb of Monte Chingolo, south of Buenos Aires. The attackers were defeated and driven off with 53 ERP guerrillas and 9 supporting militants killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vocesderesistencia.com.ar/monte-chingolo Monte Chingolo: Voces de Resistencia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130041032/http://www.vocesderesistencia.com.ar/monte-chingolo |date=2009-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven army troops and three policemen were reported killed.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; In this particular battle the ERP and supporting Montoneros militants had about 1,000&lt;ref&gt;Review of the River Plate: A weekly journal dealing with commercial financial and economic affairs, 30 December 1975, p. 1021&lt;/ref&gt; deployed against 1,000 government forces. This large-scale operation was made possible not only by the planning of the guerrillas involved, but also by their supporters who provided houses to hide them, supplies and the means of escape.

On 30 December a bomb exploded at the headquarters of the Argentine Army in Buenos Aires, injuring at least six soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HPBLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c-0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3050,5982817&amp;dq=|title=The Spokesman-Review - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eyes of the military, the credibility of the government was now destroyed and the strategy of attrition was bankrupt. The guerrillas had even successfully utilized divers of the Grupo Especial de Combate of the Montoneros: the modern [[type 42 destroyer]] {{ship|ARA|Santísima Trinidad|D-2|2}} was severely damaged by explosives placed under her keel by frogmen of the [[Montoneros]] on 22 August 1975 while moored in the port of Ensenada. The damage was so great that the ship remained unseaworthy for several years. By the end of 1975, a total of 137 servicemen and police had been killed that year by left wing guerrillas.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; Elements within the armed forces, particularly among the junior officers, blamed the weakness of the government and began to seek a leader who they considered was strong enough to ensure a preservation of Argentinian sovereignty, settling on Lieutenant-General Jorge Videla.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; On 11 February 1976, colonel Raúl Rafael Reyes, the commander of the 601st Air Defence Artillery Group, was killed and two army conscripts (Privates Tempone and Gómez) wounded in an ambush by six ERP guerrillas in the La Plata suburb of Buenos Aires.

The Argentine armed forces moved ahead with the "[[Dirty War]]", dispensing with the civilian government through a [[coup d'état]] in March 1976. In his editorial immediately after the military takeover, Santucho wrote that ''"a river of blood will separate the military from the Argentine people"'', and this would result in a popular uprising followed by a civil war.&lt;ref name="Argentina, Antonius C.

=== Aftermath ===
After the destruction of the left-wing in Argentina, some revolutionary [[cadres]] made their way to Nicaragua, where the [[Sandinista]]s had taken power in 1979. An ERP commando team comprising veterans of the "Dirty War" under Gorriarán Merlo, for example, demonstrated their active involvement in the revolutionary struggle by killing ex-dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6B6OGy-EqsIC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=a+commando+team+comprising+erp+veterans|title=In from the Cold|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorriarán returned to Argentina in 1987 to become a leader of the ''[[Movimiento Todos por la Patria]]'' (All For the Motherland Movement or MTP).

Claiming another military coup by the ''[[Carapintadas]]'' was imminent against the new democratic government of [[Raúl Alfonsín]] (which at the time was leading a series of trials against members of the Argentine Military accused of [[human rights]] violations), Enrique Gorriarán Merlo led the [[1989 attack on La Tablada Regiment]], during which the Argentine army used [[white phosphorus (weapon)|white phosphorus]] as an anti-personnel weapon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/298628a9022c5e06c12569fb00576635?OpenDocument E/CN.4/2001/NGO/98], ''[[United Nations]]'', January 12, 2001 - URL accessed on February 9, 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] cable quoted by [[RAI|RaiNews]]24: [http://www.rainews24.rai.it/ran24/inchiesta/testimonianze.asp Alcune testimonianze sull'uso militare del fosforo bianco] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarin"&gt;''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|El Clarín]]''.

In protest to Duhalde's decision, former Lieutenant-Colonel Emilio Guillermo Nani who took part in the fighting to recover the La Tablada barracks and lost an eye as a consequence, formally announced that he would be returning the medal for wounded military personnel that he won during the administration of Argentine president [[Raúl Alfonsín]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/46650-me-siento-defraudado-soy-doctor-en-idiotez-aseguro-emilio-nani|title="Me siento defraudado; soy doctor en idiotez", aseguró Emilio Nani|date=29 December 2000|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MTP still exist today as a political movement which has abandoned [[armed struggle]].

In January 2016 for the first time in decades, Mauricio Macri (the recently elected president of Argentina) through the new Human Rights Secretary Claudio Avruj, granted an audience to CELTYV (Centre for Legal Studies on Terrorism and its Victims) representing the victims of left-wing terrorism in Argentina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1862254-el-secretario-de-derechos-humanos-recibio-a-familiares-de-victimas-del-terrorismo|title=El secretario de Derechos Humanos recibió a familiares de víctimas del terrorismo|date=14 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a move that drew strong condemnation from [[Estela Barnes de Carlotto]], head of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/207363/%E2%80%98macri-said-he-was-too-busy-to-meet-us%E2%80%99|title='Macri says he's too busy to meet us'|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], the '''Principal Secretary''' is a senior aide, often the most senior political aide, to a head of government. Formerly, the position of Principal Secretary was the most senior in the [[Canadian Prime Minister's Office]], though since 1987, it is second to the [[Chief of Staff (Canada)|Chief of Staff]].

'''Ramon Trobat i Vinyes''' (died April 1698) was the son of Francesc Trobat i Trias and a native of [[Barcelona]], where he trained in the law. During the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] of 1640, he sided with the rebels and served in the army. He came to the notice of the French, and served as an adviser to [[Cardinal Mazarin]] at the negotiations for the [[Peace of the Pyrenees]]. A prominent member of the French government in [[Roussillon]] after its annexation to France, he was named one of the original six councilors of the [[Sovereign Council]] on 7 June 1660, promoted to president à mortier on 24 November 1680, and named its first president 18 April 1691. In addition, he was an avocat général of the Sovereign Council from 1660 until 1681, when he was named intendant of Roussillon, a position he retained until his death in 1698.

{{Status of religious freedom|persecution}}
[[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] are a [[religious minority]] in every country where they exist&lt;ref&gt;Consistently below 0.5%. Estimated ratios may approach 0.4% in [[Religion in Iceland|Iceland]] and the [[Religion in the United Kingdom|UK]]. In the USA and Canada, Neopagans account for an estimated 0.2% of the population.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been subject to [[religious discrimination]] and/or [[religious persecution]]. The largest Neopagan communities are in North America and the United Kingdom, and the issue of discrimination receives most attention in those locations, but there are also reports from Australia and [[Greece]] (the latter specifically concerning [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenic Neopaganism]]).

In 2003, Olivia Watts charged the mayor of the [[City of Casey]], Victoria, Rob Wilson, as violating the [[Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001]] after he issued a press release in June of that year titled "Satanic cult out to take over Casey", in which Watts was mentioned by name. During a hearing on August 12, 2004 in the [[Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]], Watts said that after the press release, she suffered vandalism to her property and an assault at her home, in addition to general "hatred, contempt and revulsion". On August 13, it was revealed in tribunal that the matter had been settled overnight, and Wilson read a statement acknowledging that Watts was not a Satanist and expressing "regret for any hurt felt by Ms Watts in consequence of his press release".&lt;ref name="age224"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/12/1092102595224.html |title=Tribunal hears claims of Satanic cult |work=The Age |first=Jamie |last=Berry |date=2004-08-13 |accessdate=2007-08-01 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ss279"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.saltshakers.org.au/html/P/20/B/279/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20041013135047/http://www.saltshakers.org.au/html/P/20/B/279/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-10-13 |title=Rob Wilson VCAT case&amp;nbsp;— statement |work=Salt Shakers |first=Jenny |last=Stokes |date=2004-08-14 |accessdate=2007-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Separation of church and state#Greece|modern day Greece]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] has the status of [[state religion]], and consequently, alternative religions such as [[Hellenic Neopaganism]] may be subject to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/05/08/wgods08.xml |title=The Telegraph: Modern Athenians fight for the right to worship the ancient Greek gods |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=2010-05-22 |first=Charles |last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Greek Society of Attic Friends'', which states that it has 40,000 members, has been unsuccessful when they asked for recognition as a legal religion and was denied the right to build a temple in [[Athens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.widdershins.org/vol10iss4/09.htm |title=Ongoing Persecution of Pagans in Modern Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to use existing temples for worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/travel/modern-pagans-worship-illegally-in-athens/2007/01/22/1169330798194.html |title=The Age: Modern pagans worship illegally in Athens |location=Melbourne |date=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the South African Pagan Rights Alliance (SAPRA) in South Africa voiced objections to the ''[[Witchcraft Suppression Act, 1957|Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957]]'' and the draft ''[[Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill|Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill of 2007]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/07/20/us-safrica-witches-idUSL2080650220070720 |title=Reuters: S.Africa witches fight for rights |date=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, there have been occasional clashes between [[New Age travellers]] and authorities, such as the [[Battle of the Beanfield]] in 1985. There are also occasional charges of harassment against Neopagans such as the following examples:

In 1999, Dr Ralph Morse was appointed by the [[Pagan Federation]] as their first national youth manager. Following an article that appeared in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' on April 2, 2000, Morse was summarily suspended from his post as Head of Drama, Theatre Arts and Media Studies at Shenfield High School in Essex.&lt;ref&gt;''Independent on Sunday'' articles dated April 2 and 9, 2000 and The Foundation for Religious Freedom responding comment; CNS News Coverage (Foreign Bureaus)&lt;/ref&gt; Morse was subsequently fully investigated by the school and reinstated with a full retraction released to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Religious Movements in the 21st Century |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |first=Phillip Charles |last=Lucas |author2=Robbins, Thomas |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-96576-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] |first=Michael F |last=Strmiska |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-85109-608-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, members of "[[Youth 2000]]", a conservative Catholic organisation, on visit to Father Kevin Knox-Lecky of St Mary's church, [[Glastonbury]], attacked pagans by throwing salt at them and told them they "would burn in hell". Knox-Lecky apologised and said he would not invite the group again. The police warned two women and arrested one youth on suspicion of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2436968,00.html |title=Bad vibes in Glastonbury after Catholics against pagans |work=[[The Times]] |first=Ruth |last=Gledhill |authorlink=Ruth Gledhill |date=4 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202064318/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2436968,00.html |archivedate=December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,1939477,00.html |title=Catholic marchers turn on Glastonbury pagans |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Thair |last=Shaikh |date=2006-11-04 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Army Chaplain Corps|U.S. Army Chaplain]] Captain Don Larsen was dismissed from his post in [[Iraq]] in 2006 after changing his religious affiliation from [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal Christianity]] to Wicca and applying to become the first Wiccan military chaplain. His potential new endorser, the Sacred Well Congregation based in Texas, was not yet an officially recognised endorsement organisation for the military, and upon hearing of his conversion, his prior endorser, the Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, immediately revoked its endorsement. At this point, the U.S. Army was required to dismiss him from chaplaincy despite an exemplary service record.&lt;ref name="washpost20070218"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/18/AR2007021801396_pf.html |title=For Gods and Country |work=The Washington Post |first=Alan |last=Cooperman |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In prisons===
{{Further|Prisons in the United States|Religion in the United States' prisons|Dettmer v. Landon|Cutter v. Wilkinson|Wisconsin witch hunt}}
The 1985, Virginia prisoner Herbert Daniel Dettmer sued Robert Landon, the Director of the [[Virginia Department of Corrections]], in federal court, to get access to objects he claimed were necessary for his Wiccan religious practice. The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|district court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] decided in Dettmer's favor, although on appeal the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] ruled that, while Wicca was a religion, he was not being discriminated against. This case marked the first legal recognition of Wicca as a religion.

In Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709 (2005), a case involving five Ohio prison inmates (two followers of [[Ásatrú]], a minister of the [[Church of Jesus Christ Christian]], a [[Wicca]]n witch and a [[Satanist]]) protesting denial of access to ceremonial items and opportunities for group worship was brought before the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="select.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60916FC355F0C708DDDA90994DC404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fS%2fSupreme%20Court%20 |title=NY Times: Justices Will Hear 2 Church-State Cases |work=The New York Times |first=Linda |last=Greenhouse |date=2004-10-13 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the denied objects was instructions for runic writing requested by an Ásatrúarmaður, which was initially denied when prison officials raised concerns that runic writing could be used for coded gang communication.

In an interview about the role of race-based [[gang]]s and other extremists in America's prisons, the historian [[Mark Pitcavage]] came to the conclusion that "[n]''on-racist versions of Ásatrú and [[Odinism]] are pretty much acceptable religions in the prisons''",&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Mark Pitcavage – [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=55 Behind the Walls]&lt;/ref&gt; but materials from racist variants of these religions may be prohibited by corrections departments.

In early 2011, a Stillwater prisoner named Stephen Hodgson filed a federal lawsuit against the state of Minnesota claiming his religious rights have been violated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/east/119516524.html Wiccan Prisoner sues State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413163120/http://www.startribune.com/local/east/119516524.html |date=April 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson claimed he was prohibited from practising his Wiccan faith when guards and prison administrators refused to allow him to use prayer oils and herbs needed. He also claimed that his religious mail had been confiscated and that he had been prohibited from burning incense or using prayer oils and herbs. He claimed those items were necessary for the practice of his religion and that they posed no danger to guards or other inmates.  The Minnesota Department of Human Rights agreed with Hodgson, saying "probable cause exists to believe that an unfair discriminatory practice was committed."

The discrimination case is awaiting trial.  

===Wicca===
According to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who popularised [[Wicca]] in the twentieth century, the religion is a survival of a European witch-cult that was persecuted during the [[witch trials]] (sometimes called the ''[[Witch-hunt#The Burning Times|Burning Times]]''), and the strong element of secrecy that traditionally surrounds the religion was adopted as a reaction to that persecution. Since then, [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of an organised pan-European witch-cult has been discredited, and doubts raised about the age of Wicca; many Wiccans no longer claim this historical lineage. However, it is still common for Wiccans to feel solidarity with the victims of the witch trials and, being witches, to consider the witch-craze to have been a persecution against their faith.&lt;ref name="WitchcraftInside"&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft From The Inside: Origins of the Fastest Growing Religious Movement in America |first=Raymond |last=Buckland |authorlink=Raymond Buckland |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |location=St. Paul, MN |date=2002-09-01 |origyear=1971 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-1-56718-101-2 |oclc=31781774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been confusion that Wicca is a form of [[Theistic Satanism|Satanism]], despite important differences between these religions.&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=up5fnY7Wp1wC&amp;pg=PA75 |publisher=Baylor University Press |location=[[Waco, Texas|Waco]] |author1=Davis, Derek |author2=Hankins, Barry |edition=2nd |year=2003 |pages=75 |isbn=978-0-918954-92-3 |oclc=52895492 |quote=Much to the chagrin of practitioners of Wicca, there has been confusion in the minds of many about their religion, which is often linked with Satanism, although there are important differences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to negative connotations associated with witchcraft, many Wiccans continue the traditional practice of secrecy, concealing their faith for fear of persecution. Revealing oneself as Wiccan to family, friends, or colleagues is often termed "coming out of the broom-closet".&lt;ref name="slate031204"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2090966/ |title=Witch Way |work=Slate.com |author='Bewitched' |date=2003-12-04 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |quote=Believe me, coming out of the "broom closet" is a one-way trip.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiccans have also experienced difficulties in administering and receiving prison ministry, although not in the UK of recent times.&lt;ref name="hmprison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psi.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/PSI_2005_33_paganism.doc |title=Practice of Paganism in Prison |work=HM Prison Service |first=Michael |last=Spurr |date=2005-08-31 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017113544/http://psi.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/PSI_2005_33_paganism.doc |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, as a result of ''[[Dettmer v. Landon]]'' [617 F. Supp. 592 (D.C. Va 1985)], the District Court of [[Virginia]] ruled that Wicca is a legally recognised religion and is afforded all the benefits accorded to it by law. This was affirmed a year later by Judge [[John D. Butzner, Jr.]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] [''Dettmer v. Landon'', 799 F. 2d 929 (4th Cir. 1986)]. Nevertheless, Wiccans are sometimes still stigmatised in America, and many remain secretive about their beliefs.

Also in 1985, conservative legislators in the United States introduced three pieces of legislation designed to take away the tax-exempt status of Wiccans. The first one was House Resolution (H.R.) 3389, introduced on September 19, 1985 by Congressman [[Robert Smith Walker|Robert S. Walker]] (R-Pennsylvania), which would have amended to the United States [[Internal Revenue Code]] that any organisation which promotes witchcraft would not be exempt from taxation. On the other side of Congress, Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-North Carolina ) added Amendment 705 to H.R. 3036, "The Treasury, Postal, and General Government Appropriations Bill for 1986", which similarly stated that organisations promoting witchcraft would not be eligible for tax-exempt status. After being ignored for a time, it was attached to H.R. 3036 by a unanimous voice vote of the senators. Congressman [[Richard T. Schulze]] (R-Pennsylvania) introduced substantially the same amendment to the Tax Reform Bill of 1985. When the budget subcommittee met on October 30, the Helms Amendment was thrown out as it was not considered germane to the bill. Following this, Schulze withdrew his amendment from the Tax Reform Bill, leaving only H.R. 3389, the Walker Bill. [[Joe Barton]] (R-Texas) was attracted to become a co-sponsor of this bill on November 14, 1985. The [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] set aside the bill and quietly ignored it, and the bill was allowed to die with the close of the [[Ninety-ninth United States Congress|99th session of Congress]] in December 1986.&lt;ref name="99thCongress"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soamc.dynu.com/tfh/FILES/Cults,%20Occult,%20Mysticism/Info%20on%20pagan%20rituals%20&amp;%20other%20info/index18.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311074100/http://soamc.dynu.com/tfh/FILES/Cults%2C%20Occult%2C%20Mysticism/Info%20on%20pagan%20rituals%20%26%20other%20info/index18.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 11, 2007 |title=Witch Busters: A Summary of Anti-Witchcraft Activity in the 99th Congress |work=soamc.dynu.com/tfh |accessdate=2007-07-11 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WitchesMedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/58/story_5812_2.html |title=Witches, Pagans, and the Media |work=Beliefnet.com |first=Margot |last=Adler |accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Cynthia Simpson of [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]], submitted an application to be invited to lead prayer at the local Board of Supervisors meetings, but in a response was told that because the views of Wicca were not "consistent with the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", her application had been denied. After the Board reviewed and affirmed their policy, Simpson took the case to the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|U.S. District Court of Virginia]], which held that the Board had violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] by advancing limited sets of beliefs.&lt;ref name="simpedva"&gt;''[http://www.acluva.org/docket/pleadings/simpson_edvaopinion.pdf Simpson v.

===Ásatrú===
{{Further|Ásatrú in the United States}}
The United States government does not officially endorse or recognise any religious group, but numerous Ásatrú groups have been granted [[Non-profit corporation|non-profit religious status]] going back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name= "Well of Mimir"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Linzie, Bil |title=Drinking at the Well of Mimir |version= |publisher= |year=2000 |url=http://ragngautr-kindred.org/library/modern/drinking-at-the-well-of-mimir.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inmate of the "Intensive Management Unit" at [[Washington State Penitentiary]] alleges that adherents of Ásatrú in 2001 were deprived of their [[Mjolnir|Thor's Hammer]] medallions as well as denied religious literature, as well as complaints against the prison chaplain calling Ásatrú "'devil worship,' etc."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonerlife.com/articles/articleID=3.cfm Walla Walla's Suppression of Religious Freedom]{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a federal judge confirmed that Ásatrú adherents in US prisons have the right to possess a Thor’s Hammer pendant. An inmate sued the Virginia Department of Corrections after he was denied it while members of other religions were allowed their medallions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=18629 |title=First Amendment Center: Va. inmate can challenge denial of Thor's Hammer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030054005/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=18629 |archivedate=October 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sino-Albanian split''' was the gradual worsening of relations between the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] in the period 1972–78. Both countries had supported each other in the [[Soviet–Albanian split|Soviet–Albanian]] and [[Sino-Soviet split]]s, together declaring the necessity of defending [[Marxism–Leninism]] against what they regarded as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] within the international communist movement. By the early 1970s, however, Albanian disagreements with certain aspects of Chinese policy deepened as the [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit of Nixon to China]] along with the Chinese announcement of the "[[Three Worlds Theory]]" produced strong apprehension in Albania's leadership under [[Enver Hoxha]]. Hoxha saw in these events an emerging Chinese alliance with [[American imperialism]] and abandonment of [[proletarian internationalism]]. In 1978, China broke off its trade relations with Albania, signalling an end to the informal alliance which existed between the two states.

==Origins==

[[File:HODŽA druhá míza.jpg|thumb|The Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]], pictured in 1971]]
In September 1956, [[Enver Hoxha]] headed a delegation of the Central Committee of the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] (PLA) at the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of China. Writing years later of his impressions of the country before the visit, he noted that "we had followed with sympathy the just war of the fraternal Chinese people against the Japanese fascists and aggressors, Chiang Kai-shek reaction and the American interference... We knew also that at the head of the Communist Party of China was [[Mao Zedong]], about whom personally, as well as about the party which he led, we had no information other than what we heard from the Soviet comrades. Both during this period and after 1949 we had not had the opportunity to read any of the works or writings of Mao Zedong, who was said to be a philosopher and to have written a whole series of works. We welcomed the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|victory of October 1, 1949]] with heartfelt joy and we were among the first countries to recognize the new Chinese state and establish fraternal relations with it. Although greater possibilities and ways were now opened for more frequent and closer contacts and links between our two countries, these links remained at the level of friendly, cultural and commercial relations, the sending of some second-rank delegation, mutual support, according to the occasion, through public speeches and statements, the exchange of telegrams on the occasion of celebrations and anniversaries, and almost nothing more."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=240–241}}

Khrushchev's rehabilitation of [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and his "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]" in February 1956 put the Soviet leadership at odds with its Albanian counterpart.{{sfnm |1a1=Vickers |1y=1999 |1pp=180–181 |2a1=Halliday |2y=1986 |2p=143}} According to the Albanians, the "Khrushchev group's approaches to the Yugoslav revisionists and its open denigration of Joseph Stalin were the first open distortions of an ideological and political character, which were opposed by the PLA."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=152–153}} After arriving in Beijing on September 13, Hoxha held his first (and only) meeting with Mao Zedong in between sessions of the party's congress. Mao's first two questions concerned Yugoslav-Albanian ties and the Albanians' opinion on Stalin. Hoxha replied that Albania's relations with Yugoslavia were "cold" and he gave Mao "a brief outline, dwelling on some of the key moments of the anti-Albanian and anti-Marxist activity of the Yugoslav leadership." On the subject of Stalin, Hoxha stated that the PLA considered him "a leader of very great, all-round merits, a loyal disciple of Lenin and continuer of his work." Mao argued that the 1948 [[Cominform|Information Bureau]] decision to expel Yugoslavia was incorrect, and also stressed what he considered to have been Stalin's mistakes in regard to China.{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=249–251}}

Hoxha later recalled that "our impressions from this meeting were not what we had expected... We were especially disappointed over the things we heard from the mouth of Mao about the Information Bureau, Stalin and the Yugoslav question. However, we were even more surprised and worried by the proceedings of the 8th Congress. The whole platform of this Congress was based on the theses of the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], indeed, in certain directions, the theses of Khrushchev had been carried further forward... Apart from other things, in the reports which [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] delivered one after the other at the 8th Congress they defended and further deepened the permanent line of the Communist Party of China for extensive collaboration with the bourgeoisie and the kulaks, 'argued' in support of the great blessings which would come to 'socialism' from treating capitalists, merchants, and bourgeois intellectuals well and placing them in high leading positions, vigorously propagated the necessity of collaboration between the working class and the national bourgeoisie, and between the communist party and the other democratic nationalist parties, in the conditions of socialism, etc., etc. In fact, the 'hundred flowers' and the 'hundred schools' of Mao Zedong... constituted the Chinese variant of the bourgeois-revisionist theory and practice about the 'free circulation of ideas and people', about the coexistence of a hotch-potch of ideologies, trends, schools and coteries within socialism."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=254–255}}

According to Hoxha, Mao at the 1957 International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties declared that, "If Stalin were here, we would find it difficult to speak like this. When I met Stalin, before him I felt like a pupil in front of his teacher, while with Comrade Khrushchev we speak freely like equal comrades" and condemned the "[[Anti-Party Group]]" of [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] and others. Hoxha also claimed that Mao expressed regret that the Yugoslavs refused to attend the conference, with Mao speaking of those "who are 100 per cent Marxists, and others who are 80 per cent, 70 per cent or 50 per cent, indeed there are some who may be only 10 per cent Marxists. We ought to talk even with those who are 10 per cent Marxists, because there are only advantages in this. Why should we not gather, two or three of us, in a small room and talk things over? Why should we not talk, proceeding from the desire for unity?" In Hoxha's view the refusal of the Yugoslavs to attend, as well as both Soviet and Chinese desires to enhance their prestige in the world communist movement in response to events over the previous year, produced a situation where "the 1957 Moscow Declaration [resulting from the Conference], in general, was a good document" owing to its emphasis on opposing revisionism, which both the Soviets and Chinese found advantageous to stress at the time.{{sfnm |1a1=Hoxha |1y=1984 |1pp=340–346 |2a1=Hoxha |2y=1979a |2p=85}}

[[File:Mao Zedong 1963.jpg|thumb|left|The Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]], pictured in 1963]]
According to William E. Griffith, the Chinese position on international affairs had begun to shift to the left owing to deepening contradictions with the Soviet Union and the failure of the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]] at home. "Only when the Chinese decided, in 1957 and openly in 1960, to challenge Soviet domination of the [communist] bloc did they seriously look around for allies whom they were ready and willing to support."{{sfn|Griffith|1963|pp=27, 29}} By 1960 the Albanians found themselves in ideological agreement with the Chinese, as Elez Biberaj notes: "The Chinese had criticized Khrushchev for his rapprochement with Tito, and considered the toleration of Yugoslav 'revisionism' dangerous to the entire communist bloc... Although the seeds of the Sino-Soviet conflict were sown during Stalin's time, policy differences between Beijing and Moscow emerged during the mid- and the late 1950s, coinciding with the deterioration of Albanian-Soviet relations."{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=39}} The Chinese found the Albanians useful owing to their hostility to perceived Soviet revisionism, with Albanian articles on the subject being reprinted in the Chinese media.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=66}}

In November 1960 the Second International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was to be held, and a Commission was created in October to prepare for it. The Albanian delegation headed by Hysni Kapo and the Chinese delegation headed by Deng Xiaoping, however, were at odds; Kapo's speech to the Commission criticized the Soviet handling of the [[Soviet–Albanian split#Bucharest Conference|Bucharest Conference]] and its attacks on China, whereas Deng stated that, "We are not going to speak about all the issues... We are not going to use such terms as 'opportunist', or 'revisionist', etc." Neither Kapo nor [[Ramiz Alia]] (another member of the delegation) felt this stand was correct, with Hoxha sending letters to the delegation calling Deng's speeches "spineless" and further replying that, "They are not for carrying the matter through to the end... They are for mending what can be mended, and time will mend the rest... If I were in the Soviets' shoes, I would accept the field which the Chinese are opening to me, because there I will find good grass and can browse at will." Alia thus wrote that on the subject of principles, "The Chinese were concerned only about the [Soviet] 'conductor's baton', which they wanted to break. They went no further."{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=267–272}}

Nonetheless, Hoxha recalled years later that, concerning the breakdown in relations between China and the Soviet Union, "we were quite clear that [the Soviets] did not proceed from principled positions in the accusations they were making against the Chinese party. As became even clearer later, the differences were over a series of matters of principle which, at that time, the Chinese seemed to maintain correct stands. Both in the official speeches of the Chinese leaders and in their published articles, especially in the one entitled 'Long Live Leninism', the Chinese party treated the problems in a theoretically correct way and opposed the Khrushchevites."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=398}} On this basis it defended the activity of the Communist Party of China at the Conference, "it did so in full consciousness in order to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and not to be given some factories and some tractors by China in return."{{sfn|Letter|p=5}}

==1960s==

[[File:1966-10 1966年霍查与周恩来.jpg|thumb|Enver Hoxha and Zhou Enlai in 1966]]

Griffith wrote in the early 60s that "Albanian documents are notable for their tone of extreme violence and defiance. A remarkable combination of traditional Balkan fury and left-wing Marxist-Leninist fanaticism, the Albanian anti-Khrushchev polemics... were certainly much more extreme than the relatively moderate, flowery, and above all 'correct' language in which the Chinese Communists have normally couched their most icy blasts against Moscow... It seems doubtful that Peking initiated or even necessarily approved the intensity and extent of the Albanian verbal violence... they quite possibly could not or did not feel it wise to restrain him."{{sfn|Griffith|1963|pp=99–100}} One author noted that "Hoxha's speech [to the November 1960 Conference] so vehemently denounced Khrushchev that even the Chinese delegates looked embarrassed."{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=186}}

With both states claiming that the Soviet leadership had betrayed Marxism–Leninism and was presiding over the restoration of capitalism in the USSR, "China came to be perceived as having replaced the Soviet Union as the leader of the 'anti-imperialist struggle.' This image was reinforced by the poor state of Beijing's relations with the capitalist countries in general. ... The revolutionary spirit characterizing the Chinese society was highly regarded by the Albanian leadership, and was considered as an indication of the Marxist-Leninist character of the CCP and its policies. During the formative years of the alliance, Tiranë looked to Beijing as a center for the development of a new and 'truly' Marxist-Leninist movement."{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|pp=45–46}} In 1964 Zhou Enlai visited Albania and signed a joint statement which, among other things, stated that, "Relations between socialist countries, big or small, economically more developed or less developed, must be based on the principles of complete equality... It is absolutely impermissible to impose the will of one country upon another, or to impair the independence, sovereignty and interests of the people, of a fraternal country on the pretext of 'aid' or 'international division of labor.'"{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=67–68}}

The informal alliance between China and Albania was considered by [[Jon Halliday]] to be "one of the oddest phenomena of modern times: here were two states of vastly differing size, thousands of miles apart, with almost no cultural ties or knowledge of each other's society, drawn together by a common hostility to the Soviet Union."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=251}} Biberaj wrote that it was unusual, "a political rather than a military alliance" without any formal treaty having been signed and "lacking an organizational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination," being "characterized by an informal relationship conducted on an ad hoc basis."{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=48}}

One early disagreement between the Chinese and Albanians concerned the character of the Soviet leadership and polemics against it. In July 1963 Hoxha wrote in his diary that, "The Chinese are saying about Khrushchev today what Khrushchev said about Tito yesterday: 'He is an enemy, a Trojan horse, but we must not let him go over to the enemy, must not let him capitulate, because there is the question of the peoples of Yugoslavia', etc." and that "we are not dealing with a person or a group that is making some mistakes, that in the middle of the road sees the disaster looming up ahead and turns back; in this case it would be essential to manoeuvre, without giving way on principles, 'to prevent him from going over to the imperialists'. But with Khrushchev it is not at all in order, or correct, even to consider, let alone do such a thing. He has betrayed completely."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979a|pp=45–46}} The Chinese were reluctant to engage in public polemics with the Soviet leadership in 1961–63, stressing the need for a "united front" against the Americans and accordingly asking the Albanians to tone down their own polemics and ask for the restoration of diplomatic relations from the Soviet Union, with the Albanians taking offense to such views.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=57}}

Another early disagreement between the Chinese and Albanians was over the subject of border disputes. Hoxha wrote in his diary in August 1964 that "Chou En-lai raises with the Rumanians territorial claims against the Soviet Union. He accuses the Soviet Union (Lenin and Stalin because, this 'robbery', according to Chou En-lai, took place in their time) of having seized Chinese, Japanese, Polish, German, Czech, Rumanian, Finnish, and other territories. On the other hand, Chou En-lai tells the Rumanians that they are doing well to claim the territories which the Soviet Union has seized from them. These are not Marxist-Leninist, but national-chauvinist positions. Regardless of whether or not mistakes may have been made, to raise these things now, when we are faced, first of all, with the ideological struggle against modern revisionism, means not to fight Khrushchev, but on the contrary to assist him on his chauvinist course."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979a|p=72}} In September that year the Central Committee of the PLA sent a letter to the CC of the CCP on the Sino-Soviet border dispute, stating that, "Under the pressure of Khrushchev's revisionist propaganda, under the influence of Khrushchev's slanders and calumnies, and for many other reasons, the masses of the Soviet people will not understand why People's China is now putting forth territorial claims to the Soviet Union, they will not accept this, and Soviet propaganda is working to make them revolt against you. But we think that even true Soviet communists will not understand it, nor will they accept it. This would be a colossal loss for our struggle." The CC of the CCP did not reply.{{sfn|Letter|pp=29–30}}

With the downfall of Khrushchev and rise of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in October 1964 the Chinese called for the PLA to join in supporting the new leadership "in the struggle against the common enemy, imperialism."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=297–298}} The PLA felt that Brezhnev's rise merely represented "Khrushchevism without Khrushchev" and in a letter to the CC of the CCP urged the continuation of polemics against the Soviet leadership, whereas the Chinese sought to get the Albanians to send a delegation to Moscow together with their own delegation headed by Zhou Enlai.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=59}} Recalling this incident in 1968 Hoxha wrote that, "Chou En-lai went to Moscow without us and there he suffered [an] ignominious defeat... Later we were told: 'We made a mistake in going to Moscow and in proposing it to you, too', etc., etc."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979a|p=419}} Regardless of these and future differences between the two informal allies, the Albanians subsequently wrote that they "supported China publicly... in the international arena for those stands of the Chinese side which were correct."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=297}}

A constant irritant on the Albanian side was an inability to have regular contacts with the Chinese. Examining Hoxha's two-volume ''Reflections on China'' (consisting of extracts from his political diary), Halliday writes that, "If there is a central theme to the whole 1600 pages, it is the problem of deciphering China's actions... In the very first entry... Hoxha writes that in spite of the importance of consulting about 'revisionism', 'up to now, the Chinese have not had any contact at all with us to discuss these things. Were our enemies to know that between us there is no consultation at all about the fight against the modern revisionists, they would be astonished. They would never believe it. But that is how things stand.' ... Hoxha presents the decade and a half of 'alliance' with China as years when Albania had to muzzle itself quite a lot, with the occasional bust-out to signal disapproval of China's actions... The diary is rich in accounts of his attempts to decode both published statements and acts, on the one hand, and (something not so widely known) the private communications of the Chinese to the Albanians which were also in 'code'. In the end, Hoxha is reduced to watching the TV of his hated Yugoslavia and capitalist Italy."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|pp=252–253}}

In October 1966 Hoxha delivered a speech to a plenum of the CC of the PLA titled "Some Preliminary Ideas about the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution]],"  noting that, "We have been informed about and have followed the recent developments in China only through the Chinese press and [[Xinhua|Hsinhua]]. The Communist Party of China and its Central Committee have not given our Party and its Central Committee any special comradely information. We think that as a party so closely linked with ours, it ought to have kept us better informed in an internationalist way, especially during these recent months." Hoxha analyzed the events in China in an overall negative fashion, criticizing among other things the fact that the CCP had not held a congress in ten years and that four years had gone by without a plenum of the CC being called, a practice which "cannot be found in any Marxist-Leninist party." Hoxha said that "the cult of Mao was raised to the skies in a sickening and artificial manner" and further added that, in reading of its purported objectives, "you have the impression that everything old in Chinese and world culture should be rejected without discrimination and a new culture, the culture they call proletarian, should be created." He further stated that, "It is difficult for us to call this revolution, as the '[[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]' are carrying it out, a Proletarian Cultural Revolution... the enemies could and should be captured by the organs of the dictatorship on the basis of the law, and if the enemies have wormed their way into the party committees, let them be purged through party channels. Or in the final analysis, arm the working class and attack the committees, but not with children."{{sfn|Hoxha|1982|pp=94–113}}

The beginning of the Chinese "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" coincided with the intensification of the Albanian "Ideological and Cultural Revolution" in the fields of culture, economics and politics, which unlike its Chinese counterpart was presented as "a continuation and deepening of policies, programs, and efforts undertaken by Albania over a period of some twenty years," with other differences being that Hoxha's presence was never given "the symbolic and mystical stature in the Albanian revolution that Mao Tse-tung enjoyed in China," there was no inner-party factional struggle at the root of Albanian initiative, the Albanian army played no significant role in events, and there were no Albanian equivalents to the Red Guards nor was there an "influx of supporters of the revolution from the provinces to Tiranë... no public purges, no turmoil in the State University of Tiranë or dislocations of the school system, and no damaging blow to the economy as a result of changes brought on by the revolution."{{sfn|Prifti|1978|pp=145–147}} The Albanians also resisted Chinese efforts to get them to praise "[[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]]" as constituting a "higher stage" of Marxism–Leninism.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=67}}

Another difference between the Albanians and Chinese was on the treatment of "[[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]]" parties in Europe and elsewhere who openly upheld the positions of the Albanians and Chinese against the Soviet Union, with the Chinese being reluctant to organize them in joint endeavors due to fears of alienating "neutral" parties such as those in [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]], whereas the Albanians took an active interest in such efforts; Hoxha wrote that the CCP "is avoiding general meetings... It holds meetings with other parties, one at a time, which it is entitled to do, and after such meetings these parties come out with statements and articles which defend everything which China says and does. Now the entire concern of the Communist Party of China is that the Marxist-Leninist communist movement should accept that the ideas of Mao Tsetung lead the world, accept the cult of Mao, the Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the entire line of the Communist Party of China with its good points and its mistakes... Just as the opinions of one party cannot be accepted en bloc, neither can those of two parties be accepted en bloc. All must state their opinion. Therefore, the joint meeting and the taking of joint decisions is important."{{sfnm |1a1=Biberaj |1y=1986 |1p=63 |2a1=Hoxha |2y=1979a |2pp=287–292}}

Following the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 an Albanian delegation to Beijing was told by Zhou Enlai that "Albania, as a small country, had no need of heavy armament and that it was not at all in a position to defend itself alone from foreign aggression... Therefore, according to Chou En-lai, the only road for Albania to cope with foreign aggression was that of... concluding a military alliance with Yugoslavia and with Rumania... [and he] repeated this same thesis to the Albanian Government delegation which had gone to Peking in July 1975... [which] was turned down again by our delegation in a clear-cut and categorical manner."{{sfn|Letter|pp=37–38}} An indication of the Albanian position on Romania was shown by [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s visit to China in June 1971, with Hoxha writing in his diary that: "Hsinhua reported only that [Mao] said to him: 'Rumanian comrades, we should unite to bring down imperialism'. As if Ceausescu and company are to bring down imperialism!! If the world waits for the Ceausescus to do such a thing, imperialism will live for tens of thousands of years. It is the proletariat and the peoples that fight imperialism."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979a|p=536}}

==1970s==
Following [[Lin Biao]]'s downfall the Chinese leadership began seeking an accommodation with the United States against the Soviet Union, viewing the latter as a more dangerous opponent to its interests.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=91}} [[Henry Kissinger]]'s visit to China in July 1971 and the subsequent announcement of Nixon's visit came as a shock to the Albanians, with Hoxha writing in his diary at the time that "when the Americans were [[Vietnam War|killing and bombing in Vietnam]] and the whole of Indochina, China held secret talks with the Americans... These disgraceful, anti-Marxist, uncomradely negotiations were held without the knowledge of the Vietnamese, let alone any knowledge on our part. This was scandalous. This was a betrayal of the Chinese towards the Vietnamese, towards their war, towards us, their allies, and all the other progressive peoples. This is revolting."{{sfnm |1a1=O'Donnell |1y=1999 |1p=70 |2a1=Hoxha |2y=1979a |2pp=576–577}} 

A month later the CC of the PLA sent a letter to its Chinese counterpart strongly protesting the decision to receive Nixon, writing among other things that "regardless of the result of the talks, the very fact that Nixon, who is known as a rabid anti-communist, as an aggressor and murderer of peoples, as the representative of the blackest of American reaction, is to be received in China, has many minuses and will bring many negative consequences to the revolutionary movement and our cause. There is no way in which Nixon's visit to China and the talks with him can fail to create harmful illusions about American imperialism. ... It will exert a negative influence on the resistance and struggle of the American people themselves against the policy and aggressive activity of the government of Nixon, who will seize the opportunity to run for President again. ... It is not hard to guess what the Italian workers who clashed with the police and demonstrated their repugnance to Nixon's recent visit to Italy, the Japanese workers who did not allow Eisenhower even to set foot on their territory, and the peoples of Latin America who protested and rose against the Rockefellers and all the other envoys of the Washington government, will think. Only the Yugoslav Titoites and the Rumanian revisionists welcomed President Nixon to their capitals with flowers." The CC of the CCP did not reply to the letter.{{sfnm |1a1=Hoxha |1y=1982 |1pp=665–682 |2a1=Biberaj |2y=1986 |2pp=92–93}} In that year and in 1972, however, the Chinese did send messages notifying the Albanians that they should expect a lower level of economic activity with China in the future.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=71}}

In October 1971 Hoxha was informed that the Chinese would not be sending a delegation to the 6th Congress of the PLA held next month, which prompted Hoxha to write that, "Every cloud has a silver lining. Reaction and the revisionists will make the most of this anti-Marxist action of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, but the international communist movement will judge how right our Party has been in its line and how wrong the Communist Party of China is on this question."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979a|pp=593–598}} At the 6th Congress Hoxha indirectly criticized recent Chinese foreign policy moves by declaring that, "As long as American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist imperialism are two imperialist superpowers and come out with a common counter-revolutionary strategy, it is impossible for the struggle of the peoples against them not to merge into a single current. You cannot rely on the one imperialism to oppose the other."{{sfnm |1a1=Hoxha |1y=1982 |1p=698 |2a1=Prifti |2y=1978 |2p=245}}

In 1973 China's trade with Albania experienced a significant decline, to $136 million from $167 million a year earlier.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=98}} Reflecting on China's relations with the PLA at this point, Hoxha wrote that "Chou En-lai, [[Li Xiannian|Li Hsien-nien]] and Mao have cut off their contacts with us, and the contacts which they maintain are merely formal diplomatic ones. Albania is no longer the 'faithful, special friend'. For them it comes at the end of the line, after Rumania and Yugoslavia in Europe ... it is quite obvious that their 'initial ardour' has died."{{sfnm |1a1=Hoxha |1y=1979b |1p=41 |2a1=O'Donnell |2y=1999 |2p=72 |3a1=Biberaj |3y=1986 |3p=99}} In April the same year [[Geng Biao]] informed the Albanians that "China does not approve the creation of Marxist-Leninist parties and does not want the representatives of these parties to come to China. Their coming is a nuisance to us but we can do nothing about them, for we cannot send them away. We accept them just as we accept the representatives of bourgeois parties."{{sfn|Hoxha|1985|p=693}}

In 1974–75 various figures in Albanian military, economic and cultural fields were arrested, with some executed on charges of plotting a [[coup d'état]] which would install a government favorable to greater ties with the West and which would promote economic and cultural liberalization on broadly Yugoslav lines.{{sfnm |1a1=O'Donnell |1y=1999 |1pp=73–74 |2a1=Biberaj |2y=1986 |2pp=100–104}} In his diary at the time Hoxha wrote that, "The Chinese make a friend of any state, any person, whether Trotskyite, Titoite, or a Chiang Kai-shek man, if he says, 'I am against the Soviets'. We are opposed to this principle... It is clear that the Chinese do not like these and other stands of ours, because they tear down the Marxist-Leninist disguise they want to maintain, therefore they are exerting pressure on us. This pressure is economic, because politically and ideologically they have never made us yield and will never be able to make us yield. ... Their pressure is not imaginary, but took concrete form in the military and economic plot headed by Beqir Balluku, Petrit Dume, Hito Çako, Abdyl Këllezi, Koço Theodhosi, Lipe Nashi, etc."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979b|pp=108–109}}

In April 1974 Deng Xiaoping, head of the Chinese delegation to the [[United Nations]], proclaimed the "[[Three Worlds Theory]]" at a speech to its [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], which declared that the world was divided into "first" (the United States and the Soviet Union), "second" (France, Great Britain, West Germany, Japan, etc.), and "third" (the various countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia) worlds, of which China was declared to be in the third.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|pp=109–110}} Writing on such matters, Hoxha declared that, "When China took its pro-American and anti-Soviet stance, this policy was manifested in all its relations with the foreign world. Imperialist America, the fascists Pinochet and Franco, Tito and Ceausescu, renegades and adventurers, German revanchists and Italian fascists are its friends. For China ideology has no importance... The Chinese imagine (there is no other way their actions can be interpreted) that the whole world thinks and is convinced that China is red and revolutionary. This policy which China is pursuing has a 'revolutionary' aim: to unite the 'third world', the 'second world' and American imperialism against the Soviet social-imperialists. And from their actions it turns out that in order to achieve this 'ideal' they must not take much account of principles. 'We now defend the United States of America,' the Chinese justify themselves, 'because it is weaker than the Soviet Union, but with this we must also deepen the contradictions between the Soviet Union and the United States of America'. ... Having deviated from a principled Marxist-Leninist class policy, China, naturally, must base itself on the political conjunctures, on the manoeuvres and intrigues of reactionary governments."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979b|pp=166–167}}

In response to Albania's refusal to endorse the "Three Worlds Theory," the rapprochement with the United States, and other activities, "Beijing had drastically reduced the flow of its economic and military assistance" to Albania by 1976, trade declining to $116 million in that year from $168 in 1975.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=111}}

==Culmination==
At the 7th Congress of the PLA held in November 1976 Hoxha indicated his opposition to the new Chinese leadership that had taken over with the death of Mao Zedong in September by refusing to mention [[Hua Guofeng]] and openly denouncing [[Deng Xiaoping]] while calling for a multilateral meeting of Marxist–Leninist parties.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|pp=122–123}} According to the Albanians in their 1978 letter to the Chinese, the latter had tried to pressure them to denounce those who were not part of the ruling group in China: "As we did not do this, it comes to the conclusion that we are partisans of Lin Piao and 'the [[Gang of Four|gang of four]]'. It is wrong in both aspects. ... The Party of Labour of Albania never tramples on Marxist-Leninist principles, and has never been, nor will it ever be, anybody's tool."{{sfn|Letter|pp=29–30}} The Congress also saw activity on the part of various delegations from "anti-revisionist" parties, 29 in all, of whom a number expressed definite preference for the Albanian line over its Chinese counterpart.{{sfnm |1a1=Biberaj |1y=1986 |1p=123 |2a1=Prifti |2y=1978 |2pp=251–252}}

Speaking at the Congress, Hoxha reiterated his declaration at the 6th Congress on opposing both superpowers equally, and also denounced the [[European Economic Community|Common Market]] and [[NATO]], both of which were looked upon favorably by China in its anti-Soviet strategy. "Loyal to the interests of the revolution, socialism, and the peoples," Hoxha said, "our Party will support the proletariat and the peoples who are against the two superpowers and for their destruction, against the capitalist and revisionist bourgeoisie and for its overthrow."{{sfn|Hoxha|1985|p=110}} In December the Albanians were given a Chinese note criticizing Hoxha's report to the Congress, with Hoxha deciding to have the CC of the PLA give an official reply, stressing in it that "the PLA is an independent Marxist-Leninist party which formulates its own line itself, from the viewpoint of the Marxist-Leninist theory, on the basis of realistic analyses of the internal and external situation... it accepts criticism by sister Marxist-Leninist parties, and it will discuss many problems with them, and vice-versa, the PLA also has the same right towards other sister parties." Hoxha also had the reply mention that various letters sent to the CC of the CCP by its Albanian counterpart never received replies, such as the letter on Nixon's decision to visit China. The new Albanian letter did not receive a reply.{{sfn|Hoxha|1979b|pp=334–339}}

Around this time Hoxha began analyzing the works of Mao Zedong and the history of the Communist Party of China. As part of his examination of the then-recently released 1956 Mao speech "[[Ten Major Relationships|On the Ten Major Relationships]]" in late December, Hoxha wrote of the Sino-Soviet split that "Mao's aim was to help not Khrushchev but himself, so that China would become the main leader of the communist world... He wanted meetings, wanted social-democratic agreements because he himself was a social-democrat, an opportunist, a revisionist. But Mao could not extinguish the fire [against perceived Soviet revisionism] or the polemic, and seeing that he was unable to establish his hegemony, he changed his stand. Mao took a somewhat 'better' anti-Soviet stand, and here he appeared to be in accord with us who were fighting Khrushchevite revisionism consistently. But even at this time he had hopes of rapprochement with the Khrushchevite revisionists. ... Then, from the strategy of the fight on the two flanks he turned towards the United States of America." Hoxha further wrote that: "Mao Tsetung accuses Stalin of left adventurism, of having exerted great pressure on China and the Communist Party of China. ... Glancing over all the main principles of Mao Tsetung's revisionist line, in regard to all those things which he raises against Stalin, we can say without reservation that Stalin was truly a great Marxist-Leninist who foresaw correctly where China was going, who long ago realized what the views of Mao Tsetung were, and saw that, in many directions, they were Titoite revisionist views, both on international policy and on internal policy, on the class struggle, on the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], on peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, etc."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979b|pp=367–387}}

In May 1977 a Chinese parliamentary delegation visited Romania and Yugoslavia, but not Albania, and referred to the Yugoslav system as socialist while praising the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], while Tito was invited to Beijing in August and praised by his hosts.{{sfnm |1a1=Biberaj |1y=1986 |1pp=125-126 |2a1=O'Donnell |2y=1999 |2p=76}} In September 1978 Tito declared that, according to Hua, "Mao Zedong said that he should have invited me for a visit, stressing that in 1948, too, Yugoslavia was in the right, a thing which he had declared even then, to a narrow circle. But, taking into consideration the relations between China and the Soviet Union at that time, this was not said publicly."{{sfn|Hoxha|1985|pp=696–697}}

On July 7, 1977 an editorial in ''[[Zëri i Popullit]]'' written but not signed by Hoxha and entitled "The Theory and Practice of the Revolution" openly attacked the "Three Worlds Theory" by name and thus signified a direct attack on the Chinese.{{sfnm |1a1=Biberaj |1y=1986 |1p=126–128 |2a1=Prifti |2y=1978 |2p=253 |3a1=Halliday |3y=1986 |3p=254}} Among other things the editorial stated that, "The Marxist-Leninists do not confuse the fervent liberation, revolutionary and socialist aspirations and desires of the peoples and the proletariat of the countries of the so-called 'third world' with the aims and policy of the oppressive compradore bourgeoisie of those countries ... to speak in general terms about the so-called 'third world' as the main force of the struggle against imperialism ... means a flagrant departure from the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and to preach typically opportunist views ... according to the theory of the 'three worlds', the peoples of those countries must not fight, for instance, against the bloody fascist dictatorships of Geisel in Brazil and Pinochet in Chile, Suharto in Indonesia, the Shah of Iran or the King of Jordan, etc., because they, allegedly, are part of the 'revolutionary motive force which is driving the wheel of world history forward'. On the contrary, according to this theory, the peoples and revolutionaries ought to unite with the reactionary forces and regimes of the 'third world' and support them, in other words, give up the revolution." Furthermore, "The supporters of the theory of 'three worlds' claim that it gives great possibilities for exploitation of inter-imperialist contradictions. The contradictions in the enemy camp should be exploited, but in what way and for what aim? ... The absolutisation of inter-imperialist contradictions and the underestimation of the basic contradiction, that between the revolution and the counter-revolution ... are in total opposition to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism." And, "This is an anti-revolutionary 'theory' because it preaches social peace, collaboration with the bourgeoisie, hence giving up the revolution, to the proletariat of Europe, Japan, Canada, etc. ... it justifies and supports the neo-colonialist and exploiting policy of the imperialist powers of the 'second world' and calls on the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America not to oppose this policy, allegedly for the sake of the struggle against the superpowers."{{sfn|T&amp;P|pp=14–15, 20–23}}

Hoxha wrote on the occasion of the editorial's publication that, "The Chinese did not make the slightest effort to defend their notorious theses about the revolution, because in fact there was no way in which they could defend them, because the division into three worlds and the inclusion of China in the 'third world', is nothing but an effort to extinguish the proletarian revolution and make the proletariat submit to the yoke of the capitalist bourgeoisie of the industrialized countries and of American imperialism. This absurd anti-Marxist theory allegedly combated Soviet social-imperialism which was endangering American imperialism, Chinese social-imperialism and the developed capitalist countries. The Chinese theories, which have their source in the bourgeois-revisionist views of Mao Tsetung, Chou En-lai, Teng Hsiao-ping and Chairman Hua, take no account at all of the peoples and the revolution."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979b|pp=544–545}} The Chinese temporarily revived their interest in the pro-Chinese parties in order to use them as polemicists against attacks on the "Three Worlds Theory" while pro-Albanian parties fought back; on November 1 ''[[People's Daily]]'' dedicated its entire issue that day to an article entitled "Chairman Mao's Theory of the Differentiation of the Three Worlds Is A Major Contribution to Marxism-Leninism" in recognition that China could no longer rely entirely on proxies in defending its foreign policy from the Albanians.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|pp=129–130, 132}}

In December 1977 Hoxha recorded in his diary that a group of Chinese specialists were not being sent to Albania because in their excuse "the appropriate conditions do not exist, therefore as long as good conditions and understanding have not been created, we are not going to send our specialists for these objects."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979b|p=715}} In April and May 1978 the Albanian Foreign Ministry made an official complaint that Chinese experts in the country "had the deliberate intention of harming Albania's economy" and on July 7 that year, on the first anniversary of the publication of "The Theory and Practice of the Revolution," the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the Albanian embassy in Beijing that it was ceasing all economic and military agreements with the country.{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|pp=134–135}} On July 29 the Albanians replied, declaring the July 7 decision "a reactionary act from great power positions, an act which is a repetition, in content and form, of the savage and chauvinist methods of Tito, Khrushchev and Brezhnev which China, also, once condemned. The Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian Government reject the attempts made in the Chinese note to blame Albania, to groundlessly accuse the Albanian leadership of allegedly being ungrateful for China's aid and of allegedly having tried to sabotage the economic and military cooperation between the two countries. To any normal person it is unbelievable and preposterous that Albania, a small country, which is fighting against the imperialist-revisionist encirclement and blockade and which has set to large-scale and all-round work for the rapid economic and cultural development of its country, which is working tirelessly for the strengthening of the defence capacity of its socialist Homeland, should cause and seek cessation of economic cooperation with China, refuse its civil and military loans and aid."{{sfn|Letter|p=4}}

The letter went on to note delays on the Chinese side in providing equipment and materials for the vast majority of its economic projects in Albania, but also concluded that, "The true motives for the cessation of aid and loans to Albania have not an exclusively technical character, as the note of the Chinese Government makes out, on the contrary they have a deep political and ideological character."{{sfnm |1a1=Biberaj |1y=1986 |1p=137 |2a1=Letter |2p=7}} The letter concluded that, "Albania will never submit to anybody, it will stand to the end loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It will march non-stop on the road of socialism and communism illuminated by the immortal teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. ... Though encircled, socialist Albania is not isolated because it enjoys the respect and love of the world proletariat, the freedom-loving peoples and the honest men and women throughout the world. This respect and love will grow even more in the future. Our cause is just! Socialist Albania will triumph!"{{sfn|Letter|pp=55–56}}

==Subsequent developments==
Following the split with China, the Albanians proclaimed that their country was the only one in the world genuinely constructing a socialist society.{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=203}} In December 1977 Hoxha wrote an analysis of the Chinese revolution, declaring that, contrary to the Chinese view, "in general, the decisions and directives of the Comintern, first of all of the time of Lenin, were correct, and that those of the time of Stalin were correct, too." On the character of the revolution he wrote that, "In my opinion, and as far as I can judge, China carried out a bourgeois-democratic revolution of a new type through the national liberation armed struggle" and that "the revolution in China could not be carried through to the end. ... So long as the working class in China shared power with the bourgeoisie, this power, in essence, was never transformed into a dictatorship of the proletariat, and consequently the Chinese revolution could not be a socialist revolution."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979b|pp=760–798}}

Biberaj writes that throughout the alliance the Albanians had a definite advantage in that "the scope of China's decision-making participation in Albania was insignificant ... it was the Albanians rather than the Chinese who decided on the use of the aid... Tiranë was in a stronger bargaining position than Beijing because the Chinese were more keen in maintaining the alliance."{{sfn|Biberaj|1986|p=138}} Peter R. Prifti noted that Albania's relations with China "emphasize[d] once again the great importance the Albanian leaders attach to ideology ... [and] proved conclusively—if such proof were needed—Albania's independence of China. It demonstrated that the Albanian Party was not a mere mouthpiece of Peking but follows a basically independent foreign policy."{{sfn|Prifti|1978|p=255}}

Recalling his pre-1956 impressions of China, Hoxha once wrote that, "It was said that Mao was following an 'interesting' line for the construction of socialism in China, collaborating with the local bourgeoisie and other parties, which they described as 'democratic', 'of the industrialists', etc., that joint private-state enterprises were permitted and stimulated by the communist party there, that elements of the wealthy classes were encouraged and rewarded, and even placed in the leadership of enterprises and provinces, etc., etc. All these things were quite incomprehensible to us and however much you racked your brains, you could not find any argument to describe them as in conformity with Marxism-Leninism. Nevertheless, we thought, China was a very big country, with a population of hundreds of millions, it had just emerged from the dark, feudal-bourgeois past, had many problems and difficulties, and in time it would correct those things which were not in order, on the right road of Marxism-Leninism."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=241–242}} Likewise in September 1977 Hoxha wrote that, "The question of Chinese communism has been an enigma to me. I am not saying this only now, but have expressed my doubt years ago in my notes. This doubt arose in my mind immediately after the Bucharest Meeting, and it was aroused because of the timorous stand the Chinese adopted there. ... Khrushchev's activity compelled Teng to change [his conciliatory] report and make it somewhat more severe, because Khrushchev issued a document in which China was attacked, and distributed it before the meeting. Teng was also compelled by the resolute stand of our Party, but that is a long story. The later stands of the Chinese, I am speaking about their political and ideological stands, have shown continuous vacillation, and this was precisely the basis of the enigma and my doubt about them ... but now we can say that this policy of China was a great fraud, a major manoeuvre of the Chinese revisionists to disguise themselves."{{sfn|Hoxha|1979b|pp=641–642}}

In the view of the Albanians, the shift in China's line between 1956 and 1960 was due to the following: "After the death of Stalin, the Chinese, with Mao Zedong at the head, thought that their time had come ... they wanted to gain as much as they could from Soviet economic aid, in order to become a great power, indeed, an atomic power. But these projects could not be carried out smoothly. If Mao Zedong had his hegemonistic ambitions, Khrushchev and his associates had their expansionist plans, too. ... While making most of what benefit they could get from the Chinese, at the same time Khrushchev and his associates began to be 'cautious' and 'restrained' in their support and aid for them. They did not want China to grow strong, economically or militarily. ... The policy of rapprochement with American imperialism, which Khrushchev was pursuing, likewise, was incompatible with the interests of the Chinese, because that would leave China out of the game of great powers. In this situation, seeing that Khrushchev's line had caused concern in the communist movement, the Communist Party of China seized the opportunity ... seized the 'banner' of defence of the principles of Marxism–Leninism. ... Undoubtedly, not to compel Khrushchev to abandon his course of betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, but to have him accept the hegemony of China and join it in its plans."{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=253–255}} As Hoxha put it, "when Mao Zedong and his associates saw that they would not easily emerge triumphant over the patriarch of modern revisionism, Khrushchev, through the revisionist contest, they changed their tactic, pretended to reject their former flag, presented themselves as 'pure Marxist-Leninists', striving in this way, to win those positions which they had been unable to win with their former tactic. When this second tactic turned out no good, either, they 'discarded' their second, allegedly Marxist-Leninist, flag and came out in the arena as they had always been, opportunists, loyal champions of a line of conciliation and capitulation towards capital and reaction. We were to see all these things confirmed in practice, through a long, difficult and glorious struggle which our Party waged in defence of Marxism–Leninism."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=256–257}}

In December 1978 Hoxha's ''Imperialism and the Revolution'' was released, the second half of which was a criticism of the "Three Worlds Theory," Chinese foreign policy in general, and Maoism. Hoxha declared that China had become a "social-imperialist" country, aspiring to superpower status alongside the USA and USSR by tactically allying with the former against the latter on account of the former's greater economic strength and willingness to invest in the Chinese economy. On the subject of Maoism Hoxha stated that "Mao Zedong was not a Marxist-Leninist, but a progressive revolutionary democrat, who remained for a long time at the head of the Communist Party of China and played an important role in the triumph of the Chinese democratic anti-imperialist revolution. Within China, in the ranks of the party, among the people and outside China, he built up his reputation as a great Marxist-Leninist and he himself posed as a communist, as a Marxist-Leninist dialectician. But this was not so. He was an eclectic who combined some elements of Marxist dialectics with idealism, even with ancient Chinese philosophy."{{sfn|Hoxha|1985|pp=617–618, 697–698}}

In a 1988 publication, the Albanians stated that they "appreciated China's aid and its role, among other outside factors, in the development of our country's economy, seeing it as aid by a friendly people, aid without strings attached and without political conditions, which served the general cause of the revolution and socialism." However, "In order to subjugate the PLA and the Albanian state, the Chinese revisionists raised many serious difficulties and obstacles for the fulfilment of the 6th Five-Year Plan [of 1976-1980]. Under various trumped-up excuses, they recalled some of their specialists who worked in Albania, slowed down the rates of work and, especially, postponed the setting up of the industrial projects ... which were planned to be built with the aid of China." Following the split Albania also became a country "relying entirely on its own forces, without any kind of aid or credits from abroad, without external and internal debts."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=297, 339, 342}}

'''Steve Hofmeyr''' (born 29 August 1964) is a South African singer, songwriter, political activist, actor and TV presenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mg.co.za/article/2013-10-10-red-october-march-steve-hofmeyr |title=Red October march calls for end to black-on-white violence |date=10 October 2014 |work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] |accessdate= 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hofmeyr married actress [[Natasha Sutherland]], whom he had met on the set of ''[[Egoli: Place of Gold]]'' in 1998. They had two sons. Hofmeyr also has three other children by other women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tvsa.co.za/actors/viewactor.aspx?actorid=5487 |title=Steve Hofmeyr|publisher=TVSA|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Steve Hofmeyr|url=http://rollingstone.co.za/opinion/item/903-qaa-steve-hofmeyr|publisher=RollingStone Magazine|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was divorced after reports of numerous affairs dominated Hofmeyr's time in the spotlight in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Philip de Bruin, ''News 24'', [http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Local/0,,2-1225-1242_2443465,00.html "Steve 'needs psychiatric help"], 17 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Hofmeyr allegedly assaulted Esmaré Weideman, editor of ''[[Huisgenoot]]'', a popular Afrikaans magazine, by pouring a cup of cold tea over her at the [[Miss South Africa]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;Philip de Bruin, ''News 24'' (South Africa),[http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Local/0,,2-1225-1242_2443046,00.html "Steve gets shir-tea with editor"], 17 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have blamed her and two other journalists for his divorce from Sutherland.

On 19 December 2013, Hofmeyr was arrested in [[Bronkhorstspruit]] for driving at 169&amp;nbsp;km/h in an 80&amp;nbsp;km/h zone and was released on bail of [[South African rand|R]]500. He was subsequently fined R10,000 in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate's Court on 23 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel24.co.za/News/Local/Steve-Hofmeyr-fined-R10-000-for-speeding-20140123 |title=Steve Hofmeyr fined R10 000 for speeding|date=23 January 2014 |work=Channel24.co.za|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr married Janine van der Vyver on 26 January 2014. In 2008, van der Vyver, a fitness instructor, revealed they had been seeing each other for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/hofmeyr-pays-up-in-time-for-wedding-1.1636171#.U6RvXk3QdaS |title=Hofmeyr pays up in time for wedding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr's grandfather, Steve Hofmeyr Sr., was a leader in the [[Ossewabrandwag]], a South African political and guerrilla organisation which supported Germany during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Phyllis |last1=Green |date=7 March 2014|work=Sarie|title=Steve Hofmeyr gesels oor sy nuwe boek |url= http://www.sarie.com/lewe-liefdes/boeke/steve-hofmeyr-gesels-oor-sy-nuwe-boek/#/|language=Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Piet|last1= Ebersöhn|date=25 July 2012|title=Eerste sportredakteur was Oxford Blue én owerste van Stormjaers |url=http://perskor.blogspot.de/2012/07/eerste-sportredakteur-was-oxford-blue.html|language=Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In January 2007, there were reports that one branch of the [[News Cafe]] restaurant chain would not play Hofmeyr's song ''Pampoen''. The managing director of the company that owns the franchise denies that this is company policy and points out that many Afrikaans acts, such as [[Karen Zoid]] and [[Arno Carstens]] have performed at News Cafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Eagan Williamson | title = News Cafe begin 'n ander (Afrikaanse) deuntjie sing | url = http://www.news24.com/Beeld/Suid-Afrika/0,,3-975_2051223,00.html | work = Beeld | date = 4 January 2007 | accessdate = 8 January 2007 | language = Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2011, Hofmeyr released the lyrics to his new song called "Ons sal dit oorleef", which means "We will survive this". The song is controversial, because Hofmeyr threatened to include the ethnic slur "[[kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]" in the lyrics of the song.&lt;ref name="Steve Hofmeyr Spits venom"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2011/05/13/steve-hofmeyr-spits-venom | title=Steve Hofmeyr spits venom | date=12 May 2011 | accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hofmeyr removed the offensive word in his song, citing that the word would offend his black friends and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sapa|title=K-word will offend my black friends, says Hofmeyr|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-17-kword-will-offend-my-black-friends-says-hofmeyr|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he made public that he supports the Afrikaner advocacy group "Expedition for Afrikaner Self-Determination"  ([[Onafhanklike Afrikaner Selfbeskikkingsekspedisie]], OASE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=OASE|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjTmH5OXGvA|title=Steve Hofmeyr Supports OASE|date=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr was heavily criticised after performing the former South African national anthem, ''[[Die Stem]]'', at a cultural festival known as ''Innibos'' in [[Nelspruit]] in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/hofmeyr-sings-die-stem-at-innibos-1.1716416#.VJgh814C8|title=Hofmeyr sings Die Stem at Innibos |date=8 July 2014 |website= |publisher=iol News |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to perform the anthem on international tours, and encouraged white South Africans to continue singing it, stating that it did not contain any form of hate speech.

In October 2014, Hofmeyr wrote and published a tweet stating that he believed that black South Africans were the "architects of apartheid" on his public Twitter account. This prompted a significant public backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hofmeyr faces Twitter backlash after Apartheid post|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Hofmeyr-faces-Twitter-backlash-after-apartheid-post-20141028}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Hofmeyr's critics was puppeteer Conrad Koch through his puppet Chester Missing, who launched a campaign calling on companies to stop sponsoring Hofmeyr. On 27 November 2014, Hofmeyr failed to acquire a final protection order against Koch and his puppet in the Randburg Magistrate's Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2014/11/27/steve-hofmeyr-0-chester-missing-1|title=Steve Hofmeyr 0, Chester Missing 1 |date=28 November 2014 |website= |publisher=Business Day |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr has given statements indicative of apartheid denialism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-10-30-chester-missing-questions-steve-hofmeyr-sponsorship|accessdate=11 April 2015|title=Chester Missing questions sponsorship of 'apartheid denialist'|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|agency=SAPA|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading various journalists and political analysts to label him a "disgrace to South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawjee|first1=Haji Mohamed|title=Steve Hofmeyr: 7 books from his library|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-10-29-the-library-of-a-right-wing-afrikaner-nationalist|accessdate=3 November 2014|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cronje|first1=Frans|title=Steve Hofmeyr, you're a disgrace to South Africa|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=236445&amp;sn=Detail|website=PoliticsWeb|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gous|first1=Nico|title=Hofmeyr in onderonsie oor ‘white trash’|url=http://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Algemeen/hofmeyr-in-onderonsie-oor-white-trash-20161110|website=Netwerk24|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mg.co.za/article/2014-07-16-die-stem-steve-hofmeyr-and-a-die-hard-sense-of-idealism&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims about murders of white South Africans===
{{see|Crime in South Africa|White genocide conspiracy theory}}
Hofmeyr has made numerous claims relating to murders of white South Africans. Hofmeyr has claimed that whites, and in particular Afrikaners, are being "killed like flies", posting on [[Facebook]] that "my tribe is dying". Hofmeyr also posted a picture of a "World Cup soccer stadium" which he claimed could be filled by the number of whites murdered by blacks. However, [[Africa Check]], a [[fact-checking]] organisation has found Hofmeyr's claims to be "incorrect and grossly exaggerated" - pointing out that whites are in fact "less likely to be murdered than any other race group". Lizette Lancaster from the [[Institute for Security Studies]] told Africa Check that "Whites are far less likely to be murdered than their black or coloured counterparts." While white South Africans account for nearly 9% of the population they account for just 1.8% of murder victims.&lt;ref&gt;https://africacheck.org/reports/are-white-afrikaners-really-being-killed-like-flies/&lt;/ref&gt;
During May 2018, The minister of Police, Mr [[Bheki Cele]] released farm attack statistics &lt;ref&gt;[[South African farm attacks]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}} for the first time in years. &lt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6646">'''THINK AGAIN''' is an artist-activist collaborative founded in 1997 by David John Attyah (b. Los Angeles) and [[S.A. Bachman]] (b. Columbus, Ohio.) They produce interventions that recruit art-making in the service of public address. Their work — digital murals, billboards and wallscapes, exterior projections, and viral poster campaigns — links the global to the local and combines cultural theory, sociological research, and activism to create a visual language for engaging civic dialogue. THINK AGAIN projects have explored a diverse range of issues including  queer liberation; the ways capitalism and misogyny conspire to jeopardize women and the outnumbered; the logic of militarization; international labor and the treatment of immigrants; and gentrification and displacement.

Many of its projects privilege face-to-face interactions: handing out postcards at Pride parades, parking mobile billboards in front of City Halls and grocery stores, and disseminating posters to activists mobilizing against the war machine. THINK AGAIN has distributed tens of thousands of printed matter free-of-charge through art spaces, grassroots community organizations, unions and the internet. Documentation of the work of THINK AGAIN can be found at http://sabachman.com and http://www.dja-art.work

=== Projects ===
*'''Actions Speak''' (2008-2010) is a multi-media project examining political brutality and public policy, and reconsiders social problems like HIV/AIDS and violence against women. The project features a 17 x 67 foot interior wall mural and a concurrent outdoor projection.  Debuting the week before the 2008 Presidential Election, ''Actions Speak'' promotes dialogue between art and public response, between global reality and local action. Commissioned by the [[Worcester Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agitart.org/actionsspeak/ www.agitart.org/actionsspeak]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-m-l.org/?q=node/171 www.c-m-l.org/?q=node/171]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://agitart.org/actionsspeak/press/afterimage.pdf AFTERIMAGE Vol. 38 No. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The NAFTA Effect''' (2006-2007) is a series of public projections in Los Angeles addressing how [[free trade]] reshapes the lives of people on both sides of the [[United States–Mexico border]].
*'''Hola/Hello''' (2002 and 2006) includes postcards and installations that link the rape, sexualized violence, and [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|murder of over three hundred unidentified women]] in [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], to the structural effects of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and intergovernmental relations between the US and Mexico.
*'''Protestgraphics''' (2001-2004) was one of the first websites to respond to the 9/11, U.S. military action in Iraq and Central Asia, violence against Arab and Muslim Americans, and to the Bush administration's [[War on Terrorism]]. In addition to the online archive, 500 sets of posters were distributed free of charge to organizations and activists internationally. Major campaign:  "Act Like It's A Globe, Not An Empire."
*'''CIA.TV''' (2001-2003) included a mobile billboard in [[Los Angeles, California]] and a web debate inviting the public to think critically about the increasingly blurry lines between news and entertainment at a political moment when federal agencies want permission to withhold information from the public, seek expanded surveillance authority and increase their budgets.
*'''Target Marketing Is Not A Social Movement''' (2001-2002) is a mobile billboard and postcard project that addressed [[target market]]ing and "Gay Chic."
*'''Popping The Question''' (2000) is a caravan of mobile billboards circulated throughout the cities of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and [[San Francisco, California]] intended to inspire public debate about the topics of marriage and family.

As a forward operating agency of the [[United States Army Medical Command]], APHC is responsible for providing technical support and expertise in the areas of [[preventive medicine]], [[public health]], [[health promotion]], and [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] to military units around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phc.amedd.army.mil/Documents/USAPHC_CIS-001_UPDATE.pdf USAPHC Command Information Sheet 1]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout the history of warfare, armies have depended on clean water, wholesome food, sanitation, disease and injury prevention, hazard-free environments and other sound public health practices to keep Soldiers in fighting form. The '''Army Public Health Center''' has broadened the scope of the public health mission to meet today’s Army’s needs: to enhance Army readiness by identifying and assessing current and emerging health threats; developing and communicating public health solutions; and assuring the quality and effectiveness of the Army’s Public Health Enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/usaphc#org-about Army.mil APHC (Provisional)]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Resta serves as the director.

The Maryland Office of [[ORAU]] and Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) administers research participation programs for APHC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orau.org/maryland/ ORAU]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Before 2015===
The lineage of the APHC can be traced back more than 70 years to the '''Army Industrial Hygiene Laboratory''', which was established in 1942 at the beginning of World War II under the direct jurisdiction of the Army surgeon general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phc.amedd.army.mil/Pages/About.aspx/ About APHC ]&lt;/ref&gt; AIHL originally was located at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]]; it had a staff of three and an annual budget of $3,000. Its mission was to conduct [[occupational health]] surveys and investigations within the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] industrial production base, a mission that proved beneficial to the nation’s war effort. In October 1945, AIHL was transferred to what is now Aberdeen Proving Ground - South. From 1940 to 1960, AIHL's mission and personnel continued to expand, and AIHL became the U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency (USAEHA).

In 1973, USAEHA became a subordinate command of the U.S. Army Health Services Command (the latter later became the [[United States Army Medical Command]]). The following year, USAEHA was given command of the health and environmental resources of the Army medical laboratories. These assets became USAEHA subordinate commands.

In 1994, USAEHA was re-designated as the '''United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phc.amedd.army.mil/Documents/CIS002_USAPHC_History-revised.pdf USAPHC Command Information Sheet 2]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its continental United States regional commands, USACHPPM also had two subordinate commands. In 1995, USACHPPM Europe was activated in Landstuhl, [[Germany]], and USACHPPM Pacific was activated, moving in 1997 to [[Camp Zama]], [[Japan]].

In 2010, the center was merged with the United States Army Veterinary Command (VETCOM) to form '''U.S. Army Public Health Command'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/37971/Creation_of_the_U_S__Army_Public_Health_Command/ Creation of the U.S. Army Public Health Command]&lt;/ref&gt; VETCOM supported almost 500 DOD installations worldwide and included the DOD Veterinary Food Analysis and Diagnostic Laboratory and the DOD Military Working Dog Veterinary Service. Through this merger, a uniquely capable military organization was born—one that embodies the “[[One Health]]” approach to public health.

[[One Health]] is the concept that health in animals, people, and the environment is interrelated; that is, the health of each contributes to the health of all. The formal uniting of prevention, health promotion, and veterinary missions allowed for full coordination, synchronization, and integration of the military [[public health]] services around the globe.

USAPHC, inactivated on October 1, 2016, had six subordinate elements: the Army Institute for Health and five regional commands located at [[Fort George G. Meade]] in [[Maryland]]; [[Joint Base San Antonio]] in [[Texas]]; [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]; [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] in [[Germany]]; and [[Camp Zama]] in [[Japan]]. USAPHC's mission was to promote health and prevent disease, injury, and disability of Soldiers and retirees, their Families, and Army [[civilians]], and to provide [[veterinary medicine]] services for the Army and Department of Defense. USAPHC also provided consulting services to senior military leaders, commanders both deployed and in garrison, and military medical and health professionals.

===U.S. Army Public Health Center===
The APHC reached provisional status on August 17, 2015 and full operating capacity on October 1, 2016.

Headquartered at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], the APHC is a field operating agency assigned to [[U.S. Army Medical Command]], but it is unique among MEDCOM organizations in these ways:
* Its “patients” are populations, that is groups of people—military units, their families, or Army civilian employees, for example—rather than individuals.
* It emphasizes prevention of disease, injury, and disability, rather than healing those who have already experienced these conditions.
* It is proactive, optimizing health by educating members of the Army population about healthy behaviors, empowering them to build and sustain their own good health.

==Mission and Services==
The APHC draws on a distinguished legacy to provide [[public health]] services to its Army and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] customers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phc.amedd.army.mil/whatsnew/Pages/WhatisPublicHealth.aspx What is Public Health?]&lt;/ref&gt; It standardizes and promulgates practices and procedures used throughout the public health enterprise, provides one-of-a-kind and reach-back technical capabilities, and oversees quality assurance of public health missions. 

The organization completes an extensive amount of analytical support to global operations and is responsible for the collection and archival of all deployment occupational and [[environmental health]] surveillance data. 

APHC personnel have expertise in a variety of fields. Their professions include almost 70 scientific and technical disciplines, which are brought to bear on [[public health]] issues and problems in matrixed teams.

The APHC continues to fulfill its mission of enhancing Army readiness and focusing on promoting healthy people, communities, animals and workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/Pages/default.aspx APHC Topics and Services]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vote pairing in the 2016 United States presidential election''' refers to [[vote pairing]] that occurred between United States citizens [[Domicile (law)|domiciled]] in different states during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].

== Background ==
{{main article|Vote trading#Among citizens}}[[Vote pairing]] occurs when two people [[Promise|commit]] to [[voting]] in a mutually agreed upon manner. In [[United States presidential election]]s, vote pairing usually comes in the form of voters from "safe" states, or non-swing states, voting for [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] candidates, and voters from [[swing state]]s voting for their second-preference candidate. This form of vote pairing encourages third-party support while minimizing the risk that the more favored major-party candidate will lose [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in the nationwide election (i.e., the "[[spoiler effect]]"). In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], this has usually manifested in the form of supporters in swing states of [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate [[Gary Johnson]] and [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Jill Stein]] swapping votes with supporters in [[Red states and blue states|blue states]] of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Hillary Clinton]].

Vote pairing was used in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 United States presidential election]], where [[Al Gore]] supporters were concerned that votes for the left-leaning third-party candidate, [[Ralph Nader]], could siphon off critical support for Al Gore in swing states like Florida. As the election neared, several "Nader Trader" websites emerged. Through these websites, a Nader supporter in swing state Florida could promise to vote for Gore, and in exchange, a Gore supporter in a strongly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state like [[California]] would promise to vote for Nader. However, word didn't spread fast enough and vote pairing had a negligible effect on the electorate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/opinion/anti-trump-republicans-dont-waste-your-vote-trade-it.html|title=Anti-Trump Republicans: Don't Waste Your Vote. Trade It.|last=Stubbs|first=John|date=2016-09-16|work=|last2=Reyes|first2=Ricardo|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-02|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004, 2008, and 2012 presidential elections, vote pairing was rarely used or talked about, possibly because there were no third party candidates who seriously challenged the major-party candidates.

In the 2016 presidential election, the terms "vote pairing", "vote swapping", and "vote trading" have all been used by media outlets to describe the same basic phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nevertrump-app-vote-swapping-third-party-2016-10|title=#NeverTrump app helps facilitate vote swapping to safely vote for a third-party|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=2016-11-02|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-171-scott-aaronson-on-the-ethics-and-strategy-of-vote-tra.html|title = RS 171 - Scott Aaronson on "The ethics and strategy of vote trading"|last = Aaronson|first = Scott|authorlink = Scott Aaronson|last2 = Galef|first2 = Julia|authorlink2 = Julia Galef|date = October 30, 2016|accessdate = November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vote pairing sites ==

=== Vote pairing schemes ===
Several vote pairing sites have been created during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]]; among them are Trump Traders, the #NeverTrump app, [[Balanced Rebellion]], VotePact, and MakeMineCount. These vote pairing sites fall in three broad categories:
 
# A Hillary Clinton voter from an uncontested state (one that is definitely Democratic or definitely Republican) agrees to vote for a third-party candidate (such as [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate [[Gary Johnson]] or [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate [[Jill Stein]]), and in exchange, a supporter of the third-party candidate from a [[swing state]] agrees to vote for Clinton. This has no effect on the total number of votes received by each candidate but it does give Clinton more votes in a swing state, and therefore improves the probability of Clinton winning the election.
# Multiple Hillary Clinton voters from an uncontested state (one that is definitely Democratic or definitely Republican) agree to vote for a third-party candidate, and in exchange, a supporter of the third-party candidate from a [[swing state]] agrees to vote for Clinton. This has two effects: it increases the number of votes received by the third-party candidate nationwide, while still increasing Clinton's chances of winning the election.
# Democratic and Republican voters whose first preference is a third-party candidate, but who were considering voting for a major party candidate to avoid the [[spoiler effect]], decide to both vote for their first preference third-party candidate. This increases the total number of votes that the third-party candidate receives. If the paired voters are from the same state, it should have no effect on the election outcome, but if they are from different states, it could affect the outcome.

=== #NeverTrump app ===
Launched by Amit Kumar, the app seeks to give a voice to both Hillary and third-party voters. The end goal of this, as the name suggests, is to prevent [[Donald Trump]] from being elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/3/13478042/third-party-clinton-vote-trading|title=Third-party voters are "trading votes" with Clinton voters to defeat Trump|last=Crockett|first=Zachary|newspaper=Vox|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise is that third-party voters in swing states are matched with Hillary voters in blue states. This makes it so Hillary gets more swing state votes and third-party candidates get their vote counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.trimian.com/nevertrump|title=#NeverTrump|website=apps.trimian.com|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app has two main functions:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# The app goes through a user's existing contacts and tells them who is from a swing state. It then encourages the user to reach out and possibly swap votes with one of their contacts. Users can also message their contacts, reminding them to vote.
# The app uses an automated matching system which draws from the user's interests (such as civil rights) and matches the user with five voters who share similar interests. Then the user can look at their profiles and begin chatting with any of them
The #NeverTrump app has between 500 and 1000 installs on [[Google Play]], and more than a thousand users in total.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trimian.nevertrump|title=#NeverTrump - Android Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MakeMineCount ===
A Stein or Johnson supporter in a swing state is matched with a Clinton supporter in an uncontested state.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Registered users are matched on the website, and then take it from there.

=== Trump Traders ===
Trump Trades connects third-party supporters from swing states with Hillary Clinton supporters in uncontested states (definitely Democratic or definitely Republican states), with the third-party supporter agreeing to vote for Clinton and the Clinton supporter agreeing to vote for the third party.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For a while, Trump Traders offered a 2:1 exchange rate: a single third-party supporter could vote for Clinton in exchange for getting two Clinton supporters to change their vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161102161910/https://trumptraders.org/trade/|title = Trump Traders (archived at the Internet Archive)|date = November 2, 2016|accessdate = November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Republicans for Clinton in 2016 co-founder John Stubbs, most users are matched within 1 to 2 hours. As of October 31 more than 10,000 voters have signed up for Trump Traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article111674002.html|title=Trump Traders: Like Tinder, but for swapping your swing state vote|newspaper=miamiherald|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being matched, two users sort out everything else on their own.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Balanced Rebellion ===
{{Main article|Balanced Rebellion}}

The premise is that a disgruntled Trump voter and a disgruntled Clinton voter agree to both vote for Gary Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://balancedrebellion.com/|title=Balanced Rebellion|website=balancedrebellion|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HackmanGuiltFreeVoting2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/08/26/johnson-backers-launch-bid-to-woo-disaffected-but-wary-democrats-and-republicans/|title=Match Game: Website Promises Guilt-Free Voting for Gary Johnson|date=August 26, 2016|work=|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|via=|last1=Hackman|first1=Michelle|accessdate=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StanleyAbeLincoln2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/abe-lincoln-trashes-clinton-and-trump-insane-ad-libertarian-gary-johnson-173174|title=Abe Lincoln Trashes Clinton and Trump in This Insane Ad for Libertarian Gary Johnson|date=August 29, 2016|work=|publisher=[[AdWeek]]|via=|last1=Stanley|first1=T.L.|accessdate=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeigelAdsHope2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/libertarians-hope-rallies-and-ads-can-nudge-them-into-the-presidential-debates/2016/08/27/2517567c-6b9d-11e6-8225-fbb8a6fc65bc_story.html|title=Libertarians hope rallies and ads can nudge them into the presidential debates|date=August 27, 2016|work=|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|via=|last1=Weigel|first1=David|accessdate=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The site then matches two users to allow them to work things out.

AlternativePAC's chief Matt Kibbe reported that as of September 7, 2016, 33,393 Democrats and 33,036 Republicans have signed up, for a total of 66,429 signed up and 30,819 successful matches made, covering 61,638 people.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reason.com/blog/2016/09/07/pro-gary-johnson-balanced-rebellion-ad-v|title=Pro-Gary Johnson "Balanced Rebellion" Ad Viral Sensation of this Political Cycle|last=Doherty|first=Brian|date=2016-09-08|work=|newspaper=Reason.com|access-date=2016-11-02|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balanced Rebellion has created several [[viral video]]s with the goal of spreading their message. Their comedy video "What Abe Lincoln Prophesied About Trump and Hillary" has over 35 million views and 750 thousand shares on [[Facebook]] as of November 2, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BalancedRebellion/videos/1771513536422109/|title=Balanced Rebellion - Timeline {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VotePact ===
Disenchanted Republicans pair up with disenchanted Democrats and both vote for third party or independent candidates instead of voting for the two establishment parties. By forming this pact, the major-party candidates on both sides are deprived of one vote. This prevents the spoiler effect from happening.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.votepact.org/about/|title=Vote Pact   » About Vote Pact|website=www.votepact.org|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/158570-what-is-votepact-its-a-smart-route-for-disillusioned-third-party-voters|title=What Is VotePact? It's A Smart Route For Disillusioned Third-Party Voters|last=LaTour|first=Amée|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals wishing to vote pact must find matches by themselves. VotePact has set up a Facebook page to help facilitate the process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/VotePact|title=Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
One criticism of vote pairing is that vote pairing agreements are unenforceable, given the [[secret ballot]], as well as the fact that vote pairing agreements are not [[Contract|legal contracts]], and thus not legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/upshot/if-your-vote-doesnt-really-count-is-there-anything-you-can-do.html|title=Questions to Consider if Your Trump-Clinton Vote Doesn't Really Count|last=Monkovic|first=Toni|date=2016-09-28|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein campaign co-chair Gloria Mattera has been critical of vote pairing schemes of type (1) and (2), stating that the campaign's position on vote pairing is that it is a failed strategy because voting for the "[[Lesser of two evils principle|lesser evil]]" had led to the most disliked and distrusted major party candidates in history, and that instead Americans should vote for the candidate who best represents their interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/10/27/voting-3rd-party-some-clinton-backers-want-swap-votes-you/92729736/|title=Voting for minor party? Some Clinton backers want to swap votes with you|newspaper=USA TODAY|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms of vote pairing consist of arguments against supporting third-parties in the first place. One criticism is that helping third parties could hurt the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in future elections, because if a third party secures 5% of the total votes, they are entitled to federal funds, and can then siphon off more votes from the Democratic Party in future elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/7/29/1554288/-Why-You-Shouldn-t-Trade-Your-Vote-With-a-3rd-Party-Voter-Also-why-you-should-not-vote-3rd-Party|title=Why You Shouldn't Trade Your Vote With a 3rd Party Voter.

== Legality ==
The main vote-swapping site in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 United States presidential election]], voteswap2000.com, was shut down by California's Republican Attorney General, [[Bill Jones (California politician)|Bill Jones]], only four days after it opened. A second vote-swapping site, votexchange.com, was never directly threatened but also ceased operations because of what happened to voteswap2000. Before it was shut down, voteswap2000 had brokered 5,041 vote-swaps, including hundreds in Florida.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2891|title=The Ninth Circuit ruled that vote-swapping is legal.

On August 6, 2007, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled on a case, ''[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/08/06/0655517.pdf Porter v. Bowen]'', stemming from the California Attorney General's shutdown of voteswap2000.com. Vote-swapping, it said, is protected by the First Amendment, which state election laws can't supersede, and it is fundamentally different from buying or selling votes. Furthermore, vote pairing agreements are not legally binding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/10/27/voting-3rd-party-some-clinton-backers-want-swap-votes-you/92729736/|title=Voting for minor party?

The '''Way Out Alliance''' ({{lang-hy|«Ելք» դաշինք, ԵԼՔ}}; ''YELK Dashink, YELQ'') or '''Yelk Alliance''' or simply '''Yelk''' or '''Way Out''' was a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[political alliance]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of three political parties in Armenia: [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]], [[Bright Armenia]] and the [[Hanrapetutyun Party]] party. It was formed on 12 December 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://armenianweekly.com/2017/01/24/new-opposition-bloc-formed-in-armenia/ New Opposition Bloc Formed in Armenia] The Armenian Weekly, 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;, before the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2017|2017 Armenian parliamentary election]]. Its leaders were [[Edmon Marukyan]] (leader of Bright Armenia), [[Nikol Pashinyan]] (leader of Civil Contract, [[Prime Minister of Armenia]]) and [[Aram Sargsyan]] (leader of Republic and former [[Prime Minister of Armenia|Prime Minister]] for six months in 1999-2000). It was dissolved on 12 September 2018 after its constituent parties agreed to participate in the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2018|2018 parliamentary elections]] separately.

==History==
On 2 April 2017 the alliance participated in the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2017|2017 Armenian parliamentary election]] with [[Edmon Marukyan]] as the leader of the alliance and won 9 seats out of 105 in [[National Assembly (Armenia)|National Assembly]].

After parliamentary elections the party participated in the [[Yerevan City Council election, 2017|2017 Yerevan City Council election]]. The alliance's candidate for the [[Mayor of Yerevan]] was [[Nikol Pashinyan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.am/eng/news/383357.html ''Nikol Pashinyan is Yerevan mayoral candidate of opposition Yelk Bloc''], News.am, 7 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However the alliance won only 14 seats out of 65 in the [[Yerevan City Council]] and Nikol Pashinyan gave up his mandate of City Council and continued his work in National Assembly as a MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hetq.am/eng/news/78785/nikol-pashinyan-headed-for-parliament-not-yerevan-council.html ''Nikol Pashinyan Headed for Parliament, Not Yerevan Council''], hetq.am, 15 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.am/eng/news/389995.html ''Nikol Pashinyan decides to take parliamentary mandate''], News.am, 15 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance did not participate in the [[Yerevan City Council election, 2018|2018 Yerevan City Council election]]. [[Bright Armenia]] and the [[Hanrapetutyun Party]] formed another alliance - [[Bright Alliance]] while [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]] formed [[My Step Alliance]] with [[Mission Party]]. [[My Step Alliance]] won the elections and their candidate [[Hayk Marutyan]] was appointed as the [[Mayor of Yerevan]] while [[Bright Alliance]] was the third in elections and won 3 seats out of 65 in [[Yerevan City Council]].

== Ideology ==
The Way Out Alliance's ideology is based on [[liberalism]]. In terms of foreign relations of [[Armenia]], the alliance states that Armenia's decision to join [[Eurasian Economic Union]] was wrong and had a negative impact on the country. The alliance proposed to renegotiate with the [[European Union|EU]] on signing the [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area|Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.evnreport.com/elections-2017/foreign-policy-discourse Foreign Policy Discourse] EVN Report, 16 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
