This article reviews what is known of the 1731 [[cricket]] season in England. Details have survived of 31 top-class matches, thirty played eleven-a-side and one [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]]. Match reports in the newspapers were increasingly common and tended to contain more detail, sometimes including the names of patrons and players. London's Tim Coleman was named in the report of a minor match in which he was playing, and referred to as "the famous Tim Coleman".

The most dramatic match of the season was the one at [[Richmond Green]] on Monday, 23 August. It ended in a riot and it is believed that the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|2nd Duke of Richmond]] conceded defeat after the match was originally declared a draw. Of greater significance, it is the earliest match for which the team totals were recorded and have been preserved, rather than simply who won the wager.

The original report in ''Fog's Weekly Journal'' calls the winning team "Surrey" but a report of the return match on Monday, 26 July refers to "Croydon". As the names seem to be interchangeable, it must be assumed that the Croydon club was effectively representative of Surrey as a county at this time. This match was played at [[Duppas Hill]], home venue of the Croydon club.

Buckley's source was the ''Daily Advertiser'' on Tuesday, 27 July. Another source (''Read's Weekly Journal'', quoted in ''Dawn of Cricket'') reports that London were playing Dartford, but this match was almost certainly a return of the one at [[Duppas Hill]] on Tuesday, 20 July. "Wickets to be pitched at 1 pm under forfeiture of £10 on either side".

The ''St James's Evening Post'' on 27–29 July announced "a great Cricket match" to be held "on Monday se'nnight" (i.e., Monday, 9 August, as the term means "a week on Monday") at [[Richmond Green cricket ground|Richmond Green]] for 100 guineas "by several persons of Distinction". The [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] was expected to be present.

The stake in this game was 100 guineas. No details are reported other than that Chambers' XI won. It seems that Chambers and his team all came from Middlesex so the match could perhaps be titled [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] v [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]]. According to [[John Major]], [[Thomas Chambers (English cricketer)|Thomas Chambers]] was a forebear of [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]].&lt;ref name=JM56&gt;Major, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

This return match was played for 200 guineas and it is notable as the earliest match from which team scores are known: Richmond's XI 79, Chambers' XI 119; Richmond's XI 72, Chambers' XI 23-5 (approx.). The game ended promptly at a pre-agreed time although Chambers' XI with "four or five more to have come in" and needing "about 8 to 10 notches" clearly had the upper hand. The end result caused a fracas among the crowd at Richmond Green who were incensed by the prompt finish because the Duke of Richmond had arrived late and delayed the start of the game. The riot resulted in some of the Sussex players "having the shirts torn off their backs; and it was said a law suit would commence about the play". The source (Buckley) includes a further note which suggests the Duke of Richmond may have later conceded the result to Thomas Chambers (see match on Monday, 6 September below).

This game was drawn due to heavy rain. Kent led by 17 on first innings but Surrey, with 3 wickets standing, needed just 12 to win when rain ended it. The report says the participants originally intended to continue another time but it seems they settled for the draw.

The ''Daily Post Boy'' reported on Wednesday, 8 September that "11 of Surrey beat the 11 who about a fortnight ago beat the Duke of Richmond's men". See the game on Monday, 23 August above.

No post-match report was found for this match despite its being promoted as "likely to be the best performance of this kind that has been seen for some time, there being great wagers depending". It was reported that "for the convenience of the gamesters, the ground is to be staked and roped out" so it seems that enclosure quickly became common practice in 1731. In addition, the advertisement refers to "the whole county of Surrey" as London's opponents. The [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] was expected to attend.

==Single wicket==
''July''. A [[single wicket cricket|single wicket match]] was played at [[Maidstone]] between two officers of the [[Royal Horse Guards]], Captain Beak and Lieutenant Coke. It was for a "considerable sum of money" and won by Captain Beak after three hours "very hard played". Waghorn stated that it was the first military match he found during his researches.&lt;ref name=CS3&gt;Waghorn (CS), page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other events==
''July'' (exact date unknown). An unusual match at [[Duppas Hill]], Croydon, between a Kent team and a Surrey team who were all called Wood. The Woods won. This is interesting given the well documented confusion over different players called Wood or Woods in the 1770s.&lt;ref name=CS3/&gt;

1753 was the 57th English [[cricket]] season since the earliest known [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] was played. Details have survived of three [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important eleven-a-side]] and one [[single wicket cricket|single wicket matches]]. 

A poem, dedicated to the [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|1st Duke of Dorset]], refers to a crimson cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Barty-King, ''Quilt Winders and Pod Shavers: the history of cricket bat and ball manufacture'', MacDonald and James, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been made by Mr Clout, whose firm was in [[Sevenoaks]] where the Dukes of Dorset reside at [[Knole House]].

== Important matches ==
The following matches are classified as [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important]]:&lt;ref name="status" group="note"&gt;First-class cricket was officially defined in May 1894 by a meeting at [[Lord's]] of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and the [[county cricket|county clubs]] which were then competing in the [[County Championship]]. The ruling was effective from the beginning of the 1895 season. Pre-1895 matches of the same standard have no official definition of status because the ruling is not retrospective and the [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] designation, as applied to a given match, is based on the views of one or more substantial historical sources. For further information, see [[First-class cricket]], [[Forms of cricket]] and [[History of cricket]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dover scored 57 and 83; Dartford scored 95 and 38. This is the first significant mention of Dover in cricket history. Dartford remained a premier club through the 1750s so presumably this was a shock result.

Hambledon scored 202 and 105; Surrey scored 131 and 63. This is the first mention of cricket being played on Broadhalfpenny (discovered in the ''Salisbury Journal'' in 2011). John Lucas, of Portsmouth, scored 82 in Hambledon's first innings.

This was a benefit match for Mr Anderson of the Dial in Long Alley, Moorfields. There was a well-known player called [[William Anderson (18th-century cricketer)|William Anderson]], first mentioned in 1745, so possibly this was he. The two elevens were made up of various players from the general London area with "the best bowlers to be parted".

In 2006, several allegations were made of corruption in [[English football]], by sources both inside and outside the game, including a ''[[BBC Panorama]]'' investigation. In response, the [[Football Association]] commissioned a report from [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Lord Stevens]], former Commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], and subsequently an investigation was carried out by the [[City of London police]], leading to many arrests.

==Allegations==

===January – Managers===
In January 2006, then [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] manager, [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] and then-manager of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Ian Holloway]] alleged that bribes were rife in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =FA to meet Newell over bung claim |publisher=BBC News | date = 12 January 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/luton_town/4605184.stm| accessdate =20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Newell optimistic following talks |publisher=BBC News | date = 20 January 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/luton_town/4631368.stm| accessdate =20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Holloway cynical about FA action |publisher=BBC News | date = 23 January 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4630844.stm| accessdate =20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[The Football Association]] subsequently held talks with the two managers and established an enquiry.

===September – ''BBC Panorama''===
On 19 September 2006 the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] television programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' broadcast a special investigation into corruption in English football which had begun filming in August 2005.

''"Undercover: Football's Dirty Secrets"'' included footage shown of meetings between agents, managers and high ranking football club officials, filmed undercover by [[Knut auf dem Berge]], a freelance coach posing as a prospective football agent.  This footage purported to show agents and managers accepting backhanders and illegally "[[tapping-up]]" players under contract to other clubs.

These allegations included:

* That [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] manager [[Sam Allardyce]], and his agent son Craig were alleged to have accepted bribes from agents for signing certain players. Two agents, Teni Yerima and Peter Harrison, were secretly filmed, each separately claiming that they had paid Allardyce through his son. Allardyce denies ever taking, or asking for, a bribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Agents claim manager was bribed |publisher=BBC News | date = 19 September 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5360700.stm | accessdate =19 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Then [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] manager [[Harry Redknapp]] is secretly filmed discussing the possibility of buying the [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] captain [[Andy Todd (footballer born 1974)|Andy Todd]] with agent Peter Harrison, which is illegal under FA rules. However, the programme merely showed Harrison approaching Redknapp and asking direct questions which Redknapp answered.
* Then Portsmouth first-team coach [[Kevin Bond (English footballer)|Kevin Bond]], first team coach of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] when the programme was aired, is secretly recorded admitting he would consider discussing receiving payments from a proposed new agency involving agent Peter Harrison. This was the programme's description; it did not seem explicit from the extract broadcast.  Bond was suspended and then sacked by Newcastle as a result of the allegations.
* [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] director of youth football [[Frank Arnesen]] is secretly filmed making an illegal approach or "tapping up" [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]'s England youth star 15-year-old [[Nathan Porritt]]. Arnesen offers a fee of £150,000 spread over three years as an incentive to move, although he had been advised that it was 99.9% certain that Porritt would leave Middlesbrough. Both of these allegations are illegal under FA rules. Officials from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] were also implicated in attempts to sign Porritt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Time to make a ruling that tapping up be made legal |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 21 September 2006 | url = http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329581983-103,00.html | accessdate =8 November 2006  | first=Kevin | last=McCarra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Agent Peter Harrison told the undercover reporter that, to secure transfer deals with Bolton, he bribed Sam Allardyce by offering to pay his son Craig. Harrison is a FIFA-listed agent, who is based in the north-east of England.
* That three different Bolton transfer signings involved secret payments from agents to Craig Allardyce, some when he was contractually banned from doing any Bolton deals. Panorama alleged Bolton's transfer signings of defender [[Tal Ben Haim]], midfielder [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] and goalkeeper [[Ali Al Habsi]] involved secret payments from agents to Craig Allardyce. Allardyce's son quit the agency business in summer 2006, and has admitted in newspaper interviews that his working as an agent might have cost his father the chance of becoming England manager.
* Agent Charles Collymore, is secretly filmed in the Panorama film, saying: "There's managers out there who take bungs all day long. I would say to you comfortably there's six to eight managers we could definitely approach and they'd be up for this no problem." Later, Collymore is named publicly for the first time by Luton Town manager Mike Newell as the agent who offered him an illegal payment. Collymore also represents England cricketer [[Simon Jones (cricketer)|Simon Jones]].

The programme also claimed to have set up a sting involving handing a cash payment to an unnamed Premiership manager, but the alleged manager did not turn up at the rendezvous. The programme claimed that he had been scared off by [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]]'s claims being revealed that same day.

===September – Telegraph Sport===
On 26 September, the [[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]] alleged that an unlicensed agent was paid in the deal to bring [[Tal Ben Haim]] to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. When the Israeli international moved to England, agent Jamie Hart – the official middle man – was paid a fee by Bolton. But he has now confirmed that unlicensed agent David Abu also received a cut of the fee for the role he played in the deal. Allardyce's son, Craig, a key protagonist in the Panorama documentary, also received a payment but when quizzed on such payments Bolton Chairman Phil Gartside confirmed he had no such knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=418332&amp;CPID=8&amp;clid=30&amp;lid=3&amp;title=Bolton+in+fresh+transfer+probe |work=Sky Sports |title=Sky Sports – Football – Premier League – Bolton Wanderers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218180946/http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=418332&amp;CPID=8&amp;clid=30&amp;lid=3&amp;title=Bolton%2Bin%2Bfresh%2Btransfer%2Bprobe |archivedate=18 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
On 3 March 2006, The Football Association established an enquiry to be headed by [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Lord Stevens]], former Commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]] and former head of an enquiry into corruption in cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Ex-police chief leads bungs probe |publisher=BBC News | date = 3 March 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4769606.stm| accessdate =19 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial findings of Stevens' report were announced in December 2006.

On 20 September, The Football Association asked the BBC to provide all of the collected evidence and announced that it would investigate these allegations. It was to investigate allegations of illegal approaches involving Chelsea sporting director [[Frank Arnesen]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], Newcastle United and Portsmouth manager [[Harry Redknapp]], along with allegations "relating to players' agents and connected activities" involving Bolton Wanderers manager [[Sam Allardyce]], son [[Craig Allardyce]], Newcastle United assistant manager [[Kevin Bond (English footballer)|Kevin Bond]], and agents [[Charles Collymore]] and [[Peter Harrison (footballer)|Peter Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =FA Statement re allegations | publisher = The FA | date = 20 September 2006 | url =http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2006/09/FAStatement.htm| archive-url =https://archive.is/20081011092348/http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2006/09/FAStatement.htm| dead-url =yes| archive-date =11 October 2008| accessdate =20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of those accused of impropriety have denied all allegations arising from the programme, including:

* '''Sam Allardyce:''' said that he had placed the matter in the hands of his lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Allardyce denies Panorama claims |publisher=BBC | date = 20 September 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5363942.stm| accessdate =20 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061026091819/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5363942.stm| archivedate= 26 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said: “As a father it is painful to watch your son talk tall and exaggerate his influence for financial gain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Big Sam: it's painful | publisher = The Sun | date = 21 September 2006 | url =http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2006430655,00.html| accessdate =21 September 2006 | location=London | first=Shaun | last=Custis}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September he announced that after lengthy discussions his lawyers had advised that "I have a very strong case in relation to the programme, and I am planning to sue the BBC over the false and highly damaging allegations. I have therefore instructed my lawyers to prepare my case against the BBC." Allardyce added that he would discuss the matter with Bolton chairman, [[Phil Gartside]], as well as his wife before he took any final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5378842.stm |work=BBC News | title=Allardyce planning to sue the BBC | date=25 September 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allardyce has not yet filed any legal action against the BBC, meaning the allegations remain legally unchallenged.
* '''Kevin Bond:''' said that he intended to sue the BBC for libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Bond to sue BBC over bung claims |publisher=BBC | date = 20 September 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/5365570.stm| accessdate =20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcastle United placed him on [[gardening leave]] following the broadcast, and terminated his contract on 26 September. In response, Bond issued a statement claiming that Newcastle had sacked him without investigating properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/5378844.stm |work=BBC News | title=Newcastle terminate Bond contract | date=26 September 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2006440549,00.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Shaun | last=Custis | title=Magpies axe Bond | date=17 May 2007| accessdate=26 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond was employed again within a month, as manager of [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. Kevin Bond filed legal papers against the BBC, but withdrew the libel action, 8 days before the trial was set to commence. The BBC's claims against Bond remain legally unchallenged.

The [[League Managers Association]] demanded hard evidence: "As the organisation which represents managers we were very disappointed with the programme. There was a complete lack of substance and evidence, and if the BBC has any hard evidence it should give it to the Football Association."&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5363048.stm |work=BBC News | title=LMA wants evidence from Panorama | date=20 September 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HM Revenue &amp; Customs]] has also indicated it will look into the claims.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; No libel proceedings were issued by any of those accused of wrongdoing in the broadcast.

==Stevens report==
It was announced on 2 October 2006 that Lord Stevens' inquiry into [[association football|football]] corruption had been extended by two months to investigate 39 transfers involving eight clubs. On 20 December 2006, Stevens presented his preliminary report, which found that while the level of corruption within English football was not as high as had been anticipated, there were several causes for concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6192665.stm |work=BBC News | title=Bung inquiry targets 17 transfers | date=20 December 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen transfer deals were still subject to further scrutiny.

On 15 June 2007, Lord Stevens' inquiry issued its final report which raised concerns over issues involving 17 player transfers, involving five clubs, three managers and numerous agents and other third parties. In summary, the report stated: “there is no evidence of any irregular payments to club officials or players, and they are identified only as a consequence of the outstanding issues the inquiry has with the agents involved”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = What Stevens said about each club |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | date = 16 June 2007| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=A1YourView&amp;xml=/sport/2007/06/16/sfnste116.xml
| accessdate =17 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of one of the suspect transfer deals was withheld. The other transfers about which there are unresolved issues are:

===Bolton Wanderers===
* [[Ali Al-Habsi]] (Free transfer from [[F. C. Lyn Oslo|Lyn Oslo]] – 7 January 2006)
* [[Tal Ben Haim]] (Free transfer from [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] – 29 July 2004)
* [[Blessing Kaku]] (Free transfer from [[F.C. Ashdod]] – 24 August 2004)
* [[Júlio César Santos Correa|Julio Correia]] (Free transfer from [[Real Valladolid]] – 25 July 2004)

There were also unanswered concerns regarding the involvement of [[Craig Allardyce]] in a number of transactions. “The inquiry  remains concerned at the conflict of interest that it believes existed between Craig Allardyce, his father [[Sam Allardyce]] – the then manager at Bolton – and the club itself.”

===Chelsea===
* [[Didier Drogba]] (£24 million from [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] – 20 July 2004)
* [[Petr Čech]] (£7 million from [[Stade Rennais FC|Rennes]] – 1 June 2004)
* [[Michael Essien]] (£24.4 million from [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] – 19 August 2005)

“Agent [[Pini Zahavi|Pinhas Zahavi]] has failed to co-operate fully with the inquiry. There was an initial failure to disclose his involvement in a number of transfers but, more seriously, he has failed to provide the inquiry  with complete bank statements due to the confidential nature of them. There has also been a lack of responsiveness by Zahavi. There remains questions relating to his relationship with, and payments to, licensed agent [[Barry Silkman]], and with Silkman's failure to initially disclose his involvement in all the transactions in which he has received fees.”

===Middlesbrough===
* [[Fábio Rochemback]] (Free transfer from [[F.C. Barcelona|Barcelona]] – 31 August 2005)
* [[Yakubu (footballer)|Yakubu]] (£7.5 million from [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] – 4 July 2005)

The statement relating to Zahavi and Silkman above also relates to the two Middlesbrough transfers.

===Newcastle United===
* [[Albert Luque]] (£8.5 million from [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]] – 26 August 2005)
* [[Emre Belözoğlu]] (£3.8 million from [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] – 14 July 2005)
* [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] (£8 million from [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] – 1 January 2005)
* [[Amdy Faye]] (£2 million from [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] – 25 January 2005)

“There remains inconsistencies in evidence provided by [[Graeme Souness]] – a former manager of the club – and [[Kenneth Shepherd]]” (son of the former Newcastle chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]])“— apparently acting in an undefined role but not as a club official – as to their respective roles in transfer negotiations.” Souness issued a statement denying any wrongdoing: "I cannot understand why my name features in this report. I volunteered full information to Quest as a witness and I have heard nothing further from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stevens enquiry then issued a clarification: "We wish to make it clear that inconsistencies did not exist within the evidence given by Graeme Souness to Quest concerning his role in transfers covered by the Inquiry during his time as manager of Newcastle United FC and neither the Premier League nor do Quest have any concerns in this regard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=980622007 |title=Souness evidence to bung probe not in question |deadurl=yes |accessdate=26 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031193801/http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=980622007 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The inquiry has been unable to obtain the co-operation of the agent [[Ahmet Bulut]]” in connection with the Emre transfer.

“The inquiry is still awaiting clarification from agent [[Willie McKay]]” in connection with the Boumsong and Faye transfers. However, Quest later issued the following statement: "Further to the key findings from the final Quest report published on 15 June 2007 by the Premier League, Quest would like to emphasise that, in that report, it was clear that no evidence of irregular payments was found in the transfers in the inquiry period which involved the agent Willie McKay. Quest would also like to thank Mr McKay for his cooperation with the inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2207222,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Quest finds no irregular payments in McKay deals |first=Matt |last=Scott |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the Luque transfer: “The inquiry still has unanswered questions relating to possible payments made by agent Francis Martin, who Newcastle officials believed was working for the selling club.”

===Portsmouth===
* [[Collins Mbesuma]] (Free transfer from [[Kaizer Chiefs FC|Kaizer Chiefs]] – 1 August 2005)
* [[Benjani Mwaruwari]] (£4.1 million from [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] – 6 January 2006)
* [[Aliou Cissé]] (£300,000 from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] – 6 August 2004)

“Agent [[Willie McKay]] acted for the selling club, Auxerre, in the transfer of Benjani and for Portsmouth in the transfer of Cisse and, for the same reason as above” (still awaiting clarification) “the inquiry is not prepared to clear these transfers at this stage.” However, as mentioned above, the enquiry issued a further statement saying that no evidence of irregular payments had been found in the transfers in the inquiry period which involved McKay and thanking McKay for his co-operation.

“In relation to Benjani’s transfer, the inquiry also has identified concerns regarding the role of (agent) [[Teni Yerima]] and (third party) [[Ralph N’Komo]].”

With regard to manager [[Harry Redknapp]], his ownership of a racehorse named "Double Fantasy" thought to have been given to him by the agent Willie McKay, has aroused some suspicion. Redknapp told the inquiry that it was possible that he did own the horse but insisted that he had not made any money out of it because the horse was a failure and never won a race.

==November 2007 arrests==
On 28 November 2007 it was reported by [[BBC News]] that the then Portsmouth manager, [[Harry Redknapp]], Managing Director, [[Peter Storrie]], former Portsmouth chairman, [[Milan Mandaric]], former Portsmouth footballer [[Amdy Faye]] and agent [[Willie McKay]] had been arrested by [[City of London Police]] in relation to the ongoing inquiries into allegations of corruption in football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7116823.stm Redknapp held in football inquiry] BBC News – 28 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2218469,00.html Redknapp arrested in corruption investigation] Guardian Unlimited – 28 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in June 2009, that both Kevin Bond and Harry Redknapp had dropped their libel cases against the BBC, shortly before the trial. Meaning the BBC's claims are now legally unchallenged.

When questioned on the subject, the FA stated that their own investigation was still ongoing, and any charges will probably wait until the government's own investigation into football corruption has concluded.

On 14 May 2008, [[The Football Association]] dropped one of the two charges it had brought against each of six players' agents relating to alleged breaches of rules in transfer dealings at [[Luton Town]].&lt;ref name=conn&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/14/leagueonefootball.lutontown "FA drops charge against agents over Luton transfer irregularities"] by David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The F.A. has laid twelve charges against agents - two each against [[Sky Andrew]], [[Michael Barry (agent)|Mike Berry]], [[Mark Curtis (agent)|Mark Curtis]], [[Stephen Denos]], and [[Andrew Mills (agent)|Andrew Mills]].

The first charge was that payments were made to them by a third company, unrelated to the club and not by the club itself. All six had denied the charge and, eventually, after seven months of "investigation," the charge was dropped.&lt;ref name=conn/&gt;

The other charge against each agent was that they did not have written agreements, a.k.a. "representation contracts," to act for the club when conducting negotiations. F.A. stated it is continuing with that one. Denos, Manasseh and Berry have admitted the charge but Andrew, Curtis and Mills denied it and requested personal hearings.&lt;ref name=conn/&gt;

Agent Andrew Mills, who had never previously been charged with any disciplinary offence since he began as a [[FIFA]]-licensed agent in 1993, stated that he was disappointed by the "sensationalist coverage" of the case. "The headlines suggested there had been serious wrongdoing," Mills said. "It is now clear that was not the case."&lt;ref name=conn/&gt;

{{2018 Commonwealth Games}}

The '''2018 Commonwealth Games''', officially known as the '''XXI Commonwealth Games''' and commonly known as '''Gold Coast 2018''', were an [[international]] [[multi-sport event]] for members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] that were held on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], between 4 and 15 April 2018. It was the fifth time Australia had hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] and the first time a major multi-sport event achieved [[gender equality]] by having an equal number of events for males and female athletes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-13/commonwealth-games-more-relevant-than-ever/9644954|title=This Commonwealth Games will be remembered as a year of 'firsts', on and off the field|date=2018-04-13|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 4,400 athletes including 300 para-athletes from 71 Commonwealth Games Associations took part in the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/gold-coast-2018-commonwealth-games-come-end|title=Up to 300 Para athletes participated in the 2018 Commonwealth Games|last=|first=|date=16 April 2018|website=International Paralympic Committee (IPC)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Gambia]] which withdrew its membership from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] in 2013, was readmitted on 31 March 2018 and participated in the event .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With 275 sets of medals, the games featured 19 [[Commonwealth Sports|Commonwealth sports]], including [[beach volleyball]], [[Paratriathlon|para triathlon]] and women's [[rugby sevens]]. These sporting events took place at 14 venues in the host city, two venues in [[Brisbane]] and one venue each in [[Cairns]] and [[Townsville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gc2018.com/about|title=ABOUT {{!}} Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games|website=Gold Coast 2018|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were the first Commonwealth Games to take place under the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] (CGF) presidency of Louise Martin, [[Order of the British Empire|&lt;small&gt;CBE&lt;/small&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sportscotland.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/profile/archived-articles/louise-martin-elected-as-cgf-president/|title=Louise Martin elected as CGF President|last=sportscotland|website=sportscotland.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The host city Gold Coast was announced at the CGF General Assembly in [[Basseterre]], [[Saint Kitts]], on 11 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/games/gold-coast-2018#bid-process|title=CGF General Assemble 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold Coast became the seventh Oceanian city and the first regional city to host the Commonwealth Games. These were the eighth games to be held in [[Oceania]] and the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

The host nation [[Australia]] topped the medal table for the fourth time in the past five Commonwealth Games, winning the most golds (80) and most medals overall (198). [[England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|England]] and [[India at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|India]] finished second and third respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://results.gc2018.com/en/all-sports/medal-standings.htm|title=Medal Standings  - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games|website=results.gc2018.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vanuatu at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|Vanuatu]], [[Cook Islands at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|Cook Islands]], [[Solomon Islands at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|Solomon Islands]], [[British Virgin Islands at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|British Virgin Islands]] and [[Dominica at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|Dominica]] each won their first Commonwealth Games medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/news/cgf-president-declares-commonwealth-more-relevant-ever-games-firsts-draw-close-gold-coast|title=CGF President declares Commonwealth more relevant than ever before as "Games of Firsts" draw to a close on Gold Coast|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host selection==
{{Main|Bids for the 2018 Commonwealth Games}}
[[File:Gold Coast skyline (Unsplash).jpg|left|thumb|Gold Coast was selected by the [[Australian Commonwealth Games Association]] as the official bid city from Australia for the 2018 Commonwealth Games]]
On 22 August 2008, the [[Premier of Queensland]], [[Anna Bligh]], officially launched Gold Coast City's bid to host the Commonwealth Games in 2018. On 7 April 2009, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] reported a land exchange deal between Gold Coast City and [[Queensland|State of Queensland]] for [[Carrara Stadium]]. According to Mayor [[Ron Clarke]], the land would aid a potential bid for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The land exchanged would be used as the site of an aquatics centre. In the same article, Mayor Clarke raised the question of the Australian Federal Government's commitment to a 2018 Commonwealth Games bid in light of the Government's support for [[Australian 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Australia's 2018 FIFA World Cup Finals bid]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/07/2537125.htm?site=goldcoast |title=Gold Coast eyes 2018 Games bid with land swap |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April 2009, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh told reporters that a successful Commonwealth Games bid by Gold Coast City could help the tourist strip win a role in hosting the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/bligh-pushes-bids-for-games-world-cup-20090416-a85x.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Bligh pushes bids for Games, World Cup | date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Some of the infrastructure that would be built for the Commonwealth Games will be useful for Gold Coast City to get a World Cup game out of the soccer World Cup if we're successful as a nation," she said. However the decision on the venues for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups were made eleven months prior to the bid decision for the 2018 Commonwealth Games, so the potential World Cup venues had already been chosen. On 3 June 2009, Gold Coast City was confirmed as Australia's exclusive bidder vying for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/gc-gets-sole-right-to-bid-for-2018-cwealth-games-20090603-bvbd.html |title=Gold Coast gets sole right to bid for 2018 Commonwealth Games |newspaper=Brisbane Times |date=3 June 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Should a bid proceed, Gold Coast City will have the exclusive Australian rights to bid as host city for 2018," Bligh stated.

"Recently I met with the president and CEO of the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and we agreed to commission a full and comprehensive feasibility study into the potential for the 2018 Commonwealth Games," she said. "Under the stewardship of Queensland Events new chair, [[Geoff Dixon]], that study is now well advanced." On 15 March 2010, it was announced that the Queensland Government will provide initial funding of A$11 million for the 2018 Commonwealth Games bid. The Premier of Queensland has indicated the Government's support for the bid to the Australian Commonwealth Games Association.&lt;ref name="goldcoast.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sue |last=Lappeman |url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/03/15/198301_gold-coast-news.html |title=Coast Games bid up and running |newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin |date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309111011/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/03/15/198301_gold-coast-news.html |archive-date=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2010, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association officially launched the bid to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sue|last=Lappeman|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/03/31/203445_gold-coast-news.html|title=Coast Commonwealth Games bid backed|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=26 May 2011|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314202139/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/03/31/203445_gold-coast-news.html|archive-date=14 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Gold Coast City Mayor [[Ron Clarke]] stated that the games would provide a strong legacy for the city after the games have ended.&lt;ref name="Legacy benefits to Gold Coast of 2018 Commonwealth Games will be huge, says city's Mayor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Degun|first=Tom|title=Legacy benefits to Gold Coast of 2018 Commonwealth Games will be huge, says city's Mayor|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/commonwealth-games/2018/14656-legacy-benefits-to-gold-coast-of-2018-commonwealth-games-will-be-huge-says-citys-mayor-|publisher=Inside the Games|accessdate=17 November 2011|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2010, a surprise bid was made for the 2018 Commonwealth Games by the [[Sri Lanka]]n city of [[Hambantota]]. Hambantota was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami]], and is undergoing a major face lift. The first phase of the [[Port of Hambantota]] is nearing completion and it is funded by the government of [[China]]. The [[Mattala International Airport]], which is the second international Airport of Sri Lanka is built close to Hambantota. A new [[Hambantota International Cricket Stadium]] had also been built, which had hosted matches in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]].

On 10 November 2011, the Hambantota bidders claimed they had already secured enough votes to win the hosting rights.&lt;ref name="Sri Lanka boasting of Games bid win"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ardern|first=Lucy|title=Sri Lanka boasting of Games bid win|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2011/11/11/365211_commonwealth-games.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=11 November 2011|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113171613/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2011/11/11/365211_commonwealth-games.html|archive-date=13 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 11 November it was officially announced [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast City]] had won the rights to host the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Candidate City Manual|url=http://www.thecgf.com/games/2018-Candidate-City-Manual-Dec-2009.pdf|publisher=[[Commonwealth Games Federation]]|accessdate=17 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705075211/http://www.thecgf.com/games/2018-Candidate-City-Manual-Dec-2009.pdf|archivedate=5 July 2010  |date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coast wins 2018 Commonwealth Games"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ardern|first=Lucy|title=Coast wins 2018 Commonwealth Games|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2011/11/13/365241_commonwealth-games.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=13 November 2011|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114195049/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2011/11/13/365241_commonwealth-games.html|archive-date=14 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carrara Stadium during the 2018 Commonwealth Games.jpg|thumb|[[Carrara Stadium]] during the 2018 Commonwealth Games|right]]The regulations stated that from the 26 approved sports administered by Commonwealth [[Sport governing body|Governing Bodies]], a minimum of ten core sports and maximum of seventeen sports must be included in any Commonwealth Games schedule. The approved sports included the 10 core sports: [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], [[badminton]], [[boxing]], [[Field hockey|hockey]], [[lawn bowls]], [[netball]] (for women), [[rugby sevens]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[List of water sports|swimming]] and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]]. Integrated [[Disabled sports|disabled competitions]] were also scheduled for the Games in nine sports: swimming, athletics, cycling, table tennis, powerlifting and lawn bowls. Along with these events for the first time EAD events in triathlon were held, with the medals added to the final tally for each nation. A record 38 para events were contested at these games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/gold-coast-2018-host-largest-commonwealth-para-sport-programme |title=Gold Coast 2018 to host largest Commonwealth para-sport programme |date=3 March 2016|website=www.paralympic.org/ |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]] |access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 2016, [[beach volleyball]] was announced as the 18th sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/exclusive-beach-volleyball-to-be-played-at-the-2018-gold-coast-commonwealth-games/news-story/0e75284699bda7026d0f84fd14bd5a95|title=Exclusive: Beach volleyball to be played at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games |publisher=Gold Coast Bulletin |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was broadly similar to that of the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]], with the major changes being the dropping of [[judo]], the reintroduction of [[basketball]], the debut of women's rugby sevens and beach volleyball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/more/womens-rugby-sevens-added-to-commonwealth-games/ |title=Women's rugby added to Commonwealth Games |date=7 October 2014 |website=www.sportsnet.ca/ |publisher=[[Rogers Media]] |access-date=23 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2016, it was announced seven new events for women were added to the sport program, meaning there are an equal number of events for men and women. This marks the first time in history that a major [[multi-sport event]] has equality in terms of events. In total 275 events in 18 sports are being contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=7 October 2016 |title=Level playing field for women at 2018 Commonwealth Games|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/more-in-sport/level-playing-field-for-women-at-2018-commonwealth-games-1-4251310 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |access-date=7 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/index.php/articles/1042362/gold-coast-2018-to-offer-same-amount-of-medals-for-men-and-women-after-seven-events-added |title=Gold Coast 2018 to offer same amount of medals for men and women after seven events added|last1=McKay |first1=Duncan|date=7 October 2016 |website=Insidethegames.biz |publisher=Dunsar Media |access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motto===
The official motto for the 2018 Commonwealth Games was "Share the Dream". It was chosen to highlight the dreams and experience at the games that were shared by participants of the games, ranging from athletes to volunteers and the host country Australia to the world including the Commonwealth nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gc2018.com/games|title=The Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emblem===
The emblem was launched on 4 April 2013, which marked exactly five years until its opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/sports/emblem-unveiled-for-2018-commonwealth-games|title=Emblem unveiled for 2018 Commonwealth Games|date=2013-04-04|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unveiled at the [[Southport Broadwater Parklands]].

== Concerns and controversies ==

=== Missing athletes ===
At least 13 athletes from four countries - Cameroon, Uganda, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone - absconded during or immediately after the Games.

Most hold nationalities that are deemed high-risk by immigration authorities and find it impossible to get visas outside of exceptional events, such as major games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/11/cameroon-athletes-missing-from-commonwealth-games|title=Cameroon athletes missing from Commonwealth Games|last=Doherty|first=Ben|date=2018-04-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of the closing ceremony ===
The organising committee decided to bring in the athletes before the start of the closing ceremony. This caused an uproar on social media as, contrary to public expectations, none of the athletes were shown entering the stadium during the ceremony. Broadcast rights holders [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] complained on air about the decision and concluded that, "it hasn't really lived up to expectations". Many spectators and athletes left during the ceremony, resulting in a half-empty stadium for much of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-15/channel-seven-rip-into-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony/9661088|title=Commonwealth Games closing ceremony slammed on social media as Channel Seven hosts open fire|date=15 April 2018|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC)|access-date=15 April 2018|location=Sydney, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC]] claimed that Channel 7 was briefed on the closing ceremony schedule,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-16/commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony-footage-channel-seven/9663266|title=Seven was briefed on closing ceremony|date=2018-04-16|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim which Channel 7 later refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/griggs-hits-back-at-claims-channel-seven-knew-plan-to-snub-athletes-20180416-p4z9yu.html|title=Griggs hits back at claims Channel Seven knew plan to snub athletes|last=Cunningham|first=Melissa|date=2018-04-16|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--===Doping case===
On May 31, 2018, the first positive case of doping was announced by the [[International Weightlifting Federation]] (IWF). [[Khumukcham Sanjita Chanu]] of [[India at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|India]] who was won the gold medal at [[Weightlifting at the 2018 Commonwealth Games – Women's 53 kg|Weightlifting Women's 53 kg]] was caught on the anti-doping test and immediately lost her medal, Papua New Guinea athlete [[Dika Toua]] was promoted to silver for gold, the Canadian [[Rachel Leblanc-Bazinet]] rose to second place and the Sri Lankan athlete Chamari Warnakulasuriya  moved up to third place. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1065685/indian-gold-medallist-and-spaniard-among-new-weightlifting-positives].

'''Badminton''' is a racquet sport played using [[racket (sports equipment)|racquets]] to hit a [[shuttlecock]] across a [[net (device)|net]]. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.

Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.{{sfnp|Boga|2008}}

The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher [[drag (physics)|drag]], causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.

The game developed in [[British India]] from the earlier game of [[battledore and shuttlecock]]. European play came to be dominated by [[Denmark]] but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by [[China]]. Since 1992, badminton has been a [[Summer Olympics|Summer]] [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]] with [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|four events]]: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Badminton The Olympic Journey|url=http://olympics.bwfbadminton.com/history/|website=bwfbadminton.com|publisher=Badminton World Federation|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require [[Aerobic conditioning|aerobic stamina]], [[agility]], strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good [[motor coordination]] and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.{{sfnp|Grice|2008}}

==History==

[[File:Battledore - Youthful Sports.png|thumb|right|upright|An 1804 depiction of [[battledore and shuttlecock]]]]

[[File:Battledore-and-shuttlecock.jpg|right|thumb|upright|An 1854 depiction of [[battledore and shuttlecock]] by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]]]

Games employing [[shuttlecock]]s have been played for centuries across [[Eurasia]],{{efn|Other related sports include [[Hanetsuki]], which originated in [[Japan]].}} but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the [[British people|British]] as a variant of the earlier game of [[battledore and shuttlecock]]. ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".){{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the [[Duke of Beaufort]]'s [[Badminton House]] in [[Gloucestershire]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named [[Isaac Spratt]] published a booklet entitled ''Badminton Battledore – A New Game'', but no copy is known to have survived.{{sfnp|Adams|1980}} An 1863 article in ''The Cornhill Magazine'' describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground".&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |contribution=badminton, ''n.'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in [[British India]],{{sfnp|Guillain|2004|p=47}} where it was very popular by the 1870s.{{sfnp|Adams|1980}} [[Ball badminton]], a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Thanjavur]] as early as the 1850s&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=About Game&lt;!--sic--&gt; |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707210120/http://ballbadmintonfederationofindia.com/about_game.html |title=Ball Badminton Federation of India |date=2008 |accessdate=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.

Early on, the game was also known as '''Poona''' or '''Poonah''' after the garrison town of [[Pune]],{{sfnp|Guillain|2004|p=47}}{{sfnp|Connors, et al.|1991|p=195}} where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873.{{sfnp|Adams|1980}}&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;{{efn|''Against this'', Downey, Jake, [[et al]] claim that the first rules were drawn up at [[Karachi]] in 1877.{{sfnp|Downey, Jake et al.|1982|p=13}}}} By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in [[Folkestone]]. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The shuttlecocks were coated with [[India rubber]] and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with [[lead]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the [[Bath, England|Bath]] Badminton Club drew up revised regulations.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules.{{sfnp|Adams|1980}} The [[Badminton England|Badminton Association]] of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called "Dunbar"{{efn|6 Waverley Grove, [[Portsmouth]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;}} in [[Portsmouth]] on 13 September.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{citation |contribution=The History of Badminton: Foundation of the BAE and Codification of the Rules |contribution-url=http://www.worldbadminton.com/newsite/History/index.html |title=World Badminton |url=http://www.worldbadminton.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAE started the first badminton competition, the [[All England Open Badminton Championships]] for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an [[England]]–[[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] championship match appeared in 1904.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

England, [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[New Zealand]] were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in 1934, now known as the [[Badminton World Federation]]. [[India]] joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs international badminton. Although initiated in England, competitive men's badminton has traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations have become dominant in international competition. [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[South Korea]] are the nations which have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men's and women's competition recently.

The game has also become a popular backyard sport in the [[United States]].

==Rules==

The following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, ''Laws of Badminton''.&lt;ref name=laws&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=14915|title=Laws of Badminton|publisher=Badminton World Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court===

[[File:Badminton court 3d.svg|right|thumb|upright|Badminton court, [[isometric projection|isometric]] view]]

The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules  permit a court to be marked for singles only.&lt;ref name=laws/&gt;  The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.

The full width of the court is 6.1&amp;nbsp;metres (20&amp;nbsp;ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18&amp;nbsp;metres (17&amp;nbsp;ft). The full length of the court is 13.4&amp;nbsp;metres (44&amp;nbsp;ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98&amp;nbsp;metres (6&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76&amp;nbsp;metres (2&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inch) from the back boundary.

The net is 1.55&amp;nbsp;metres (5&amp;nbsp;ft 1&amp;nbsp;inch) high at the edges and 1.524&amp;nbsp;metres (5&amp;nbsp;ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.

The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.

===Serving===

[[File:Badminton court legal bounds.svg|right|thumb|upright|The legal bounds of a badminton court during various stages of a rally for singles and doubles games]]

When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault.

At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite ''service courts'' (see [[#Playing court dimensions|court dimensions]]). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar to [[tennis]], except that a badminton serve must be hit below waist height and with the racquet shaft pointing downwards, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts, unlike tennis.

When the serving side loses a rally, the server immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a "second serve").

In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.

In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is that each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did ''not'' serve last time.

===Scoring===
{{Main article|Scoring system development of badminton}}

Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served&lt;ref name=laws/&gt; (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.

If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24–22), except when there is a tie at 29-all, in which the game goes to a golden point. Whoever scores this point will win.

At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy first, and their opponents making the leftover the remaining choice.

In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.

The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.

===Lets===

If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on a court (having been hit there by players playing in adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.

If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, the receiver shall be judged to have been ready.

==Equipment==

[[File:Heads of badminton raquets.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Badminton [[racquet]]s]]

Badminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks.

===Racquets===

Badminton [[Racket (sports equipment)|racquets]] are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between {{convert|70|and|95|g|oz|abbr=off}} not including grip or strings.&lt;ref name=oqgysc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/ |title=Badminton Central Guide to choosing Badminton Equipment|author=Kwun|date=28 February 2005|publisher=BadmintonCentral.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311234023/http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/|archivedate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/|title=SL-70|publisher=Karakal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051147/http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/|archivedate=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are composed of many different materials ranging from [[carbon fiber composite|carbon fibre composite]] ([[graphite reinforced plastic]]) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials. [[carbon fibre |Carbon fibre]] has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent [[kinetic energy]] transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminium. Earlier still, racquets were made of wood. Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as  [[carbon nanotubes]] and [[fullerene]] are added to racquets giving them greater durability.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

There is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape. Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an [[wikt:isometric|isometric]] head shape is increasingly common in new racquets.

===Strings===

Badminton strings are thin, high performing strings with thicknesses ranging from about 0.62 to 0.73&amp;nbsp;mm. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 80 to 160&amp;nbsp;[[newton (unit)|N]] (18 to 36 [[pound-force|lbf]]). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 80 and 110 N (18 and 25&amp;nbsp;lbf). Professionals string between about 110 and 160 N (25 and 36&amp;nbsp;lbf). Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker than specified when slack. Ashaway Micropower is actually 0.7mm but Yonex BG-66 is about 0.72mm.

It is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm |title=String tension relating to power and control|publisher=Prospeed |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028080241/http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm |archivedate = 28 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. This is, in fact, incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player:&lt;ref name="oqgysc"/&gt; the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment.
[[File:Badminton Undergrip Flat.jpg|thumb|Badminton Undergrip Flat]]

===Grip===

The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.

Players may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are [[polyurethane|PU]] synthetic grips or towelling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his/her grip more frequently.

There are two main types of grip: ''replacement'' grips and ''overgrips''. Replacement grips are thicker and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Towelling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.

===Shuttlecock===
{{stack|float=right|[[File:ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A shuttlecock with a plastic skirt]]
[[File:Shuttlecocks Yonex Aerosensa 20.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shuttlecock]]s with feathers]]}}
{{Main article|Shuttlecock}}

A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to ''shuttle''; also called a ''birdie'') is a high-drag [[projectile]], with an open [[Cone (geometry)|conical shape]]: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping [[feathers]] embedded into a rounded cork base. The [[Cork (material)|cork]] is covered with thin [[leather]] or synthetic material. [[Nylon (material)|Synthetic]] shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base and a plastic skirt.

Badminton rules also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed:
{{quote|'''3.1''': To test a shuttlecock, hit a full underhand stroke which makes contact with the shuttlecock over the back boundary line. The shuttlecock shall be hit at an upward angle and in a direction parallel to the sidelines.

'''3.2''': A shuttlecock of the correct speed will land not less than 530&amp;nbsp;mm and not more than 990&amp;nbsp;mm short of the other back boundary line.}}

===Shoes===

Badminton [[Athletic shoe|shoes]] are lightweight with soles of [[rubber]] or similar high-grip, non-marking materials.

Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little [[support (structure)|lateral support]]. High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.

[[File:GGOpen Setiadi.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|A female player flies high in USA, 2006]]

===Strokes===

Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either ''forehand'' or ''backhand''. A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.

In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a ''round-the-head'' forehand overhead (a forehand "on the backhand side") rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The ''backhand clear'' is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since the precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court. For the same reason, ''backhand smashes'' tend to be weak.

===Position of the shuttlecock and receiving player===

[[File:BadmintonService.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A player does a forehand service, 2009, Philadelphia]]

The choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above net height, and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. '''In the forecourt''', a high shuttlecock will be met with a ''net kill'', hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation. '''In the midcourt''', a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful ''smash'', also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic ''jump smashes'', where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. '''In the rearcourt''', players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This ''overhead'' hitting allows them to play smashes, ''clears'' (hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents' court), and ''drop shots'' (hitting the shuttlecock softly so that it falls sharply downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.

===Vertical position of the shuttlecock===

[[File:BadmintonJumpSmash.jpg|thumb|upright|A player prepares for a vertical jump smash]]

'''When the shuttlecock is well below net height''', players have no choice but to hit upwards. ''Lifts'', where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents' court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, his only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt, this is called a ''net shot''; in the midcourt or rear court, it is often called a ''push'' or ''block''.

'''When the shuttlecock is near to net height''', players can hit ''drives'', which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rear court. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.

===Spin===

Balls may be spun to alter their bounce (for example, topspin and backspin in tennis) or trajectory, and players may slice the ball (strike it with an angled racquet face) to produce such spin.  The shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, but slicing the shuttlecock does have applications in badminton. (See [[#Basic Strokes|Basic strokes]] for an explanation of technical terms.)
* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction from the direction suggested by the player's racquet or body movement. This is used to deceive opponents.
* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly curved path (as seen from above), and the deceleration imparted by the spin causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path. This can be used to create drop shots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass the net.
* When playing a net shot, slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a ''spinning net shot'' or ''tumbling net shot''. The opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation.

Due to the way that its feathers overlap, a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry. The spin is in a counter-clockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock. This natural spin affects certain strokes: a tumbling net shot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left, rather than from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=The Spin Doctor |title=Power &amp; Precision Magazine |date=July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomechanics===

Badminton [[biomechanics]] have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm.{{sfnp|Kim|2002}} Recent guides to the sport thus emphasize forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/text.asp?section=0001000100070007 |contribution=Badminton Technique |title=Badminton England |url=http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk }}{{cite web |url=http://badmintonengland.co.uk/text.asp?section=0001000100070007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417212505/http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/text.asp?section=0001000100070007 |archivedate=17 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feathers impart substantial drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance. The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable: regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork-first and remain in the cork-first orientation.

One consequence of the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires considerable power to hit it the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racquet sports. The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted (''lobbed'') shuttlecock: the [[parabola]] of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises. With very high serves, the shuttlecock may even fall vertically.

===Other factors===

'''When defending against a smash''', players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.

'''The service''' is restricted by [[#Laws of the game|the Laws]] and presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in tennis, the server's racquet must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net. The server can choose a ''low serve'' into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat ''drive serve''. Lifted serves may be either ''high serves'', where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or ''flick serves'', where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.

===Deception===

Once players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either he is tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or he is forced to delay his movement until he actually sees the shuttle's direction. "Deception" in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, he will often lose the point immediately because he cannot change his direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay his movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.

''Slicing'' and using a ''shortened hitting action'' are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt ''sliced drop shot'' will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or a smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create ''spinning net shots'' (also called ''tumbling net shots''), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning net shot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning net shots are especially important for high-level singles players.

The lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold his racquet ready for a net shot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when she or he notices the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played. A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground. This makes the opponent's task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when he has no time for a big arm swing. A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as ''finger power''. Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=off}} racquet swing.

It is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rear court (for example, drop shots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as net shots).

Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use ''double motion'', where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction. Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction. The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke crosscourt, or vice versa. ''Triple motion'' is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a ''racquet head fake'', where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction but does not require as much time.

==Strategy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}

To win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a net shot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the net shot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.

Deception is also important. Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change his body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.

===Singles===

Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.

In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.

At high levels of play, singles demand extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.badminton-information.com/rules-of-badminton.html|title=Rules of Badminton|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doubles===

Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear court, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rear court attacker plays a drop shot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.

At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.

At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles are the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges. Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.

===Mixed doubles===

[[File:Scottish Schools U12 mixed doubles badminton tournament.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A mixed doubles game – Scottish Schools under 12s tournament, [[Tranent]], May 2002]]

In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can, therefore, produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html |title=Badminton Strategies and Tactics for the Novice and Recreational Player|last=Kumekawa|first=Eugene|publisher=BadmintonPlanet |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070126195758/http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html |archivedate = 26 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in the back.

==Organization==

===Governing bodies===

The Badminton World Federation (BWF) is the internationally recognized governing body of the sport responsible for conduction of tournaments and approaching fair play. Five regional confederations are associated with the BWF:

* Asia: [[Badminton Asia Confederation]] (BAC)
* Africa: [[Badminton Confederation of Africa]] (BCA)
* Americas: [[Badminton Pan Am]] (North America and South America belong to the same confederation; BPA)
* Europe: [[Badminton Europe]] (BE)
* Oceania: [[Badminton Oceania]] (BO)

===Competitions===

[[File:Badminton men's doubles.jpg|thumb|upright|A men's doubles match. The blue lines are those for the badminton court. The other coloured lines denote uses for other sports – such complexity being common in multi-use sports halls.]]

The BWF organizes several international competitions, including the [[Thomas Cup]], the premier men's international team event first held in [[1949 Thomas Cup|1948–1949]], and the [[Uber Cup]], the women's equivalent first held in [[1957 Uber Cup|1956–1957]]. The competitions now take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004. It was further increased to 16 teams in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas and Uber Cups increased to 16 teams|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/badminton/thomas-and-uber-cups-increased-to-16-teams|website=sportskeeda.com|accessdate=25 June 2017|date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sudirman Cup]], a gender-mixed international team event held once every two years, began in 1989. Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament, a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men's doubles and singles, women's doubles and singles, and mixed doubles). Like [[association football]] (soccer), it features a promotion and relegation system at every level. However, the system was last used in [[2009 Sudirman Cup|2009]] and teams competing will now be grouped by world rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sachetat|first1=Raphaël|title=Sudirman Cup to Change Format|url=http://www.badzine.net/2009/05/event-sudirman-cup-to-change-format/|website=Badzine|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Badminton was a demonstration event at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. It became an official [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic]] sport at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]] in [[Badminton at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and its gold medals now generally rate as the sport's most coveted prizes for individual players.

In the [[BWF World Championships]], first held in [[1977 IBF World Championships|1977]], currently only the highest ranked 64 players in the world, and a maximum of four from each country can participate in any category. In both the Olympic and BWF World competitions restrictions on the number of participants from any one country have caused some controversy because they sometimes result in excluding elite world level players from the strongest badminton nations. The Thomas, Uber, and Sudirman Cups, the Olympics, and the BWF World (and [[BWF World Junior Championships|World Junior Championships]]), are all categorized as level one tournaments.

At the start of 2007, the BWF  introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level tournaments aside from those in level one: the [[BWF Super Series]]. This level two tournament series, a tour for the world's elite players, stage twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Finals held at the year-end. Among the tournaments in this series is the venerable [[All England Open Badminton Championships|All-England Championships]], first held in 1900, which was once considered the unofficial world championships of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution-url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/23/sports/EU_SPT_BAD_Super_Series.php |contribution=Badminton Federation Announces 12-event Series |date=23 September 2006 |author=Associated Press |title=International Herald Tribune |url=http://www.iht.com |accessdate=25 October 2008 }}https://web.archive.org/web/20150925045628/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/23/sports/EU_SPT_BAD_Super_Series.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Level three tournaments consist of [[BWF Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix|Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix event]]. Top players can collect the world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments. These include the regional competitions in Asia ([[Badminton Asia Championships]]) and Europe ([[European Badminton Championships]]), which produce the world's best players as well as the [[Pan Am Badminton Championships|Pan America Badminton Championships]].

The level four tournaments, known as International Challenge, International Series, and Future Series, encourage participation by junior players.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution-url=http://www.internationalbadminton.org/archivescontent.asp?pageid={4B7714F9-45C1-4199-B1B7-5B62C57FAE1A} |contribution=New Tournament Structure |date=20 July 2006 |title=International Badminton Federation |url=http://www.internationalbadminton.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134044/http://www.internationalbadminton.org/archivescontent.asp?pageid=%7B4B7714F9-45C1-4199-B1B7-5B62C57FAE1A%7D |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with tennis==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2010}}

Badminton is frequently compared to tennis. The following is a list of manifest differences:
* Scoring: In badminton, a match is played best 2 of 3 games, with each game played up to 21 points. In tennis a match is played best of 3 or 5 sets, each set consisting of 6 games and each game ends when one player wins 4 points or wins two consecutive points at deuce points.  If both teams are tied at "game point", they must play until one team achieves a two-point advantage.  However, at 29{{ndash}}all, whoever scores the golden point will win. In tennis, if the score is tied 6{{ndash}}6 in a set, a tiebreaker will be played, which ends once a player reaches 7 points or when one player has a two-point advantage.
* In tennis, the ball may bounce once before the point ends; in badminton, the rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the floor.
* In tennis, the serve is dominant to the extent that the server is expected to win most of his service games (at advanced level &amp; onwards); a ''break'' of service, where the server loses the game, is of major importance in a match. In badminton, a server has far less an advantage and is unlikely to score an ''ace'' (unreturnable serve).
* In tennis, the server has two chances to hit a serve into the service box; in badminton, the server is allowed only one attempt.
* A tennis court is approximately twice the length and width of a badminton court.
* Tennis racquets are about four times as heavy as badminton racquets, {{convert|10|to|12|oz|g|abbr=off}} versus {{convert|2|to|3|oz|g|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tennis.about.com/od/tennisracquetsfaq/f/faqracquets43.htm|title=What is the ideal weight for a tennis racquet?|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prospeed.com.my/choosing.htm |title=The contribution of technology on badminton rackets|publisher=Prospeed |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011150444/http://prospeed.com.my/choosing.htm |archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennis balls are more than eleven times heavier than shuttlecocks, {{convert|57|g|oz|abbr=off}} versus {{convert|5|g|oz|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/ShefiuAzeez.shtml|title=Mass of a Tennis Ball|year=2000|last=Azeez|first=Shefiu|publisher=Hypertextbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wooster.edu/physics/jrIS/Files/McCreary.pdf |title=A Study of the Motion of a Free Falling Shuttlecock |format=PDF |last=M.

* The fastest recorded tennis stroke is [[Samuel Groth|Samuel Groth's]] {{convert|163.4|mph|km/h|0|abbr=off}} serve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/aussie-smashes-tennis-serve-speed-record-20120513-1ykfk.html | title=Aussie smashes tennis serve speed record | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the fastest badminton stroke during gameplay was [[Lee Chong Wei]]'s {{convert|253|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=off}} recorded smash at the 2015 [[Hong Kong Open (badminton)|Hong Kong Open]].&lt;ref name=record&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/sport/other-sport/article/1944069/smash-hit-lee-chong-wei-credited-fastest-badminton-shot-hong-kong|title=smash-hit-lee-chong-wei-credited-fastest-badminton-shot-hong-kong|publisher=South China Morning Post|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics such as the smash speed, above, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racquet sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve.

While fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games. No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during gameplay.

Badminton and tennis techniques differ substantially. The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton racquets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis, the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racquet swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=off}}. For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racquet swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.

'''Bankers Life Fieldhouse''' is an [[indoor arena]] located in [[Downtown Indianapolis|Downtown]] [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. It opened in November 1999 to replace [[Market Square Arena]]. The arena is the home of the [[Indiana Pacers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and the [[Indiana Fever]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. The Fieldhouse also hosts college basketball games (including the annual [[Big Ten Conference]] tournaments), indoor concerts, and ice hockey.

It was originally named '''Conseco Fieldhouse''', as the [[naming rights]] to the venue were sold to [[CNO Financial Group|Conseco]], a financial services organization based in nearby [[Carmel, Indiana]]. In May 2010, the company renamed itself as CNO Financial Group, but the Conseco name was retained by the Fieldhouse. In December 2011, CNO Financial Group changed the name of the Fieldhouse to Bankers Life Fieldhouse, after one of its subsidiaries, [[Bankers Life and Casualty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bankers Life Knocks Conseco Off Fieldhouse Title|first=Carrie|last=Ritchie|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20111222/BUSINESS/112220323/Bankers-Life-knocks-Conseco-off-fieldhouse-title?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CIndyStar.com&amp;nclick_check=1|newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fieldhouse announced on March 13, 2018, that CNO had decided not to renew its naming sponsorship, which will expire on June 30, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibj.com/articles/67960-fieldhouse-to-lose-bankers-life-moniker-after-insurer-declines-to-renew-naming-deal |title=Fieldhouse to lose Bankers Life moniker after insurer declines to renew naming deal |date=March 13, 2018 |work=[[Indianapolis Business Journal]] |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most other North American sports arenas, the Fieldhouse was designed primarily for basketball. The arena can accommodate an NHL-sized rink, but the seating capacity is reduced to 12,300 for ice hockey, as the seating arrangement is asymmetrical.

==Events==
The first NBA game held at Bankers Life Fieldhouse was on November 6, 1999 when the [[Indiana Pacers]] played their regular-season home opener against the [[Boston Celtics]]. Later that same season, the Pacers made it to the [[2000 NBA Finals]] against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Games 3, 4, and 5 of that championship series were held at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, but the Pacers ended up losing that season's title 4 games to 2.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Some of the games of [[2002 FIBA World Championship]] were played at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, including semifinals and the final.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2009, Bankers Life Fieldhouse was the site for the [[2009 WNBA Finals]]. The [[Indiana Fever]] took on the [[Phoenix Mercury]] for games three and four of that series, but ended up losing the series. Three years later, the Fever hosted the [[2012 WNBA Finals]] for games 3 &amp; 4 and beat the [[Minnesota Lynx]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}
 
Bankers Life Fieldhouse is a host venue for many different events besides home games for the Pacers and Fever.  From 2002 to 2007, the venue served as the site of the [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]] in even numbered years while the tournament was held at the [[United Center]] in Chicago in odd numbered years. In 2008, the tournament was moved to Bankers Life Fieldhouse exclusively for five years, through 2012.  The arena is also a frequent site of the [[Big Ten Conference Women's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Women's Basketball Tournament]]. 2012 will mark the 12th time in 13 years that the tournament has been held at the Fieldhouse. On June 5, 2011, the [[Big Ten Conference]] announced that beginning in 2013 the location of both of the conference basketball tournaments for the following four years would be alternated between the Chicago area and Indianapolis. Bankers Life Fieldhouse would again be the site for both men's and women's events in 2014 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/060511aaa.html |title=Big Ten Announces Future Sites for Football Championship Games and Basketball Tournaments - BIG TEN CONFERENCE Official Athletic Site |publisher=Bigten.org |date= |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[2011 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011 NCAA Women's Final Four]] was also held at the Fieldhouse on April 3 and April 5 of 2011.

==Awards and recognitions==
In 2005 and 2006, Bankers Life Fieldhouse was ranked the No. 1 venue in the NBA according to the Sports Business Journal/Sports Business Daily Reader Survey. In 2006 The Ultimate Sports Road Trip reaffirmed Bankers Life Fieldhouse as the best venue in all 4 of the major sports leagues. "The Ultimate Sports Road Trip has recently concluded a re-scoring and re-evaluation of all 122 franchises in the four major sports, based on our personal visits to each of the teams in a journey that began in 1998. Based on our criteria, Bankers Life Fieldhouse has again withstood scrutiny to be named the "best of the best" in the four major sports. Everything about Bankers Life Fieldhouse is top notch, a sparkling venue in a sparkling city," said Farrell and Kulyk.

In October 2004, the Fieldhouse hosted the 2004 [[FINA]] Short Course World Swimming Championships. A 25 meter 300,000 gallon competition pool and 174,000 gallon warm-up pool were temporarily installed. A total of 71,659 tickets were sold for the four-day event. The crowd on the evening of Saturday, October 11, 2004 set a record for the largest attendance at a U.S. Swimming event outside of the Olympics with 11,488 people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Scoreboard==
In 2012, a giant state-of-the-art scoreboard was added to Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The scoreboard features twin 1080p high definition (HD) video screens, each measuring 50 feet long – extending nearly foul line to foul line – by 21 feet high. In addition to the HD screens running the length of the court, the innovative rectangular scoreboard design is capped by a 25’ by 14’ full 1080p HD video screen facing each baseline. The result of the design is a greatly improved visual experience from nearly every seat in the building. Additionally, a new sound system was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Arena Scoreboard Coming to Bankers Life Fieldhouse|url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/bankers-life-fieldhouse-new-audio-video-display-scoreboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club Deportivo Malacateco-Coatepeque''' is a Guatemalan [[association football|football]] club  based in [[Malacatán]], [[San Marcos (department)|San Marcos]].

They play their home games in the [[Estadio Santa Lucía]].

==History==
Nicknamed ''Los Toros'', the club was founded on 8 September 1962 after a merger of clubs ''Morazán'', ''Interrogación'' and ''Juvenil'' and by initiative of Humberto Bermúdez, Evelio de León, Felipe Sánchez, José María Munguía, José Rivera, Vicente López and Feliciano Boj.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deguate.com/artman/publish/equipos_futbol_guatemala/Deportivo_Malacateco_11914.shtml Deportivo Malacateco] – DeGuate {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty five years later, they earned their historic promotion to ''[[Liga Nacional de Guatemala|Liga Mayor]]'' by defeating [[Juventud Retalteca]] 3–0 (3–2 agg.) in the ''[[Primera División de Ascenso]]'' 2007 ''Clausura'' final. This was also the first time in ''Primera División de Ascenso'' history that the same team won both the ''Apertura'' and ''Clausura'' tournaments, thus being automatically promoted without a need of an "extra" game. In 2008, they were relegated to [[Primera División de Ascenso|Primera División]] after ending in last place in the [[Liga Nacional de Guatemala|Liga Mayor]]. In 2010, the club returned to the top division in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/guat2010.html#2clauplay Guatemala 2009/10] – RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carlos Mercedes Vásquez===
In November 2010, first team squad member [[Carlos Mercedes Vásquez]] was kidnapped and murdered. A note on his body parts claimed he was killed for messing with another man's woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/5860463/carlos-mercedes-vasquez-body-found Carlos Mercedes Vasquez's body found] – ESPN&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
'''Competitive swimwear'''  refers to the [[swimsuit]], clothing, equipment and accessories used in the aquatic sports of [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[synchronized swimming]], [[triathlon]] and [[water polo]].

Some swimsuits are designed specifically for [[Swimming (sport)#Competition|swimming competitions]] where they may be constructed of a [[High-technology swimwear fabric|special low resistance fabric]] that reduces skin drag. For some kinds of swimming and diving, special bodysuits called "diveskins" are worn. These suits are made from [[spandex]] and provide little thermal protection, but they do protect the skin from stings and abrasion. Most competitive swimmers also wear special swimsuits including partial [[bodyskin|bodysuits]], [[racerback]] styles, jammers and racing briefs to assist their glide through the water thus gaining a speed advantage.

Unlike regular swimsuits, which are designed mainly for the aesthetic appearances, swimsuits designed to be worn during competitions are manufactured to assist the athlete in swim competitions. They reduce friction and drag in the water, increasing the efficiency of the swimmer's forward motion. The tight fits allow for easy movement and are said to reduce muscle vibration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swimming-faster.com|title=Speedo fastskin fsii, Speedo Fastskin PRO|website=swimming-faster.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226145220/http://swimming-faster.com/|archivedate=2015-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus reducing drag. This also reduces the possibility that a high forwards dive will remove a divers swimwear. Starting around 2000, in an effort to improve the effectiveness of the swimsuits, engineers have taken to designing them to replicate the skin of sea-based animals, sharks in particular.

In July 2009, [[FINA]] voted to ban non-textile (non-woven) swimsuits in competitive events from 2010. The new policy was implemented to combat the issues associated with performance enhancing swimsuits, hindering the ability to accurately measure the performance of swimmers&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.swimmail.com/News/view/7003 Opportunity In The Suits Crisis]” SwimNews.com, 3 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. Subsequently, the new ruling states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the navel to the knee, and women's counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2537&amp;Itemid=49 |title=Fédération Internationale de Natation – fina.org – FINA GENERAL CONGRESS |author=Administrator |work=fina.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923103550/http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2537&amp;Itemid=49 |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/swimming/8161867.stm FINA bans hi-tech suits from 2010] BBC, 31 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some swimmers use a specialized training suit called drag suits to artificially increase drag during practice. Drag suits are swimwear with an outer layer of looser fabric – often mesh or nylon – to increase resistance against the water and build up the swimmer's endurance. They come in a variety of styles, but most resemble a looser fitting square-cut or swim brief.

==History==
{{Main article|History of competitive swimwear}}
[[File:Franklin 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Five-time Olympic gold medalist [[Missy Franklin]] (of USA) in a common [[one-piece swimsuit]]]]

The history of competitive swimwear has been dominated by concerns over public nudity in the first half of the 20th century and by efforts to reduce water drag in the second half.&lt;ref name=cap2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/swimming/features/newsid_3909000/3909817.stm Swimwear history – from silk to sharks]. BBC&lt;/ref&gt; Those efforts initially lead male swimmers to reduce the early sagging [[one-piece swimsuit]]s down to [[briefs]] only.

With the development of new materials that tightly fit the body and offered lower resistance to water than human skin, this trend was reversed to a complete body coverage from heels to neck and wrists. In 1999, Australian competitive swimmer [[Ian Thorpe]] signed with [[Adidas]] for an undisclosed six-figure sum, to race in their new bodysuit, although the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by [[Speedo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, pp. 162–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe's success in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] wearing the Adidas full-length black polyurethane bodysuit,&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/swimming/klim-relives-the-night-we-smashed-them-like-guitars-20100907-14zms.html|title=Klim relives the night we smashed them like guitars|first=Michael|last=Cowley|date=8 September 2010|publisher=|via=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to other swimmers wearing textile swimwear (males wore legskins, jammers, or briefs, while females wore racerback maillots), led to other swimming manufacturers such as Speedo and [[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]] to create their own rival bodysuits. Thorpe subsequently worked with Adidas which in 2003 released the adidas JETCONCEPT bodysuit, whose design "came from the V-shaped grooves currently used on the wings and fuselage of civil aircraft".&lt;ref name="eurekalert.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-07/aa-apn071803.php|title=adidas presents new bodysuit: the JETCONCEPT|website=EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LZR Racer|LZR Pro and LZR Elite]] lines were launched on 13 February 2008, with the LZR Elite being marketed as "the world's fastest swimsuit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news123416635.html=en Engineering the world's fastest swimsuit]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919084240/http://www.physorg.com/news123416635.html%3Den |date=September 19, 2008 }}. Physorg.com. 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the focus of Speedo's campaign for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], spearheaded by [[Michael Phelps]] of the United States.  They created a holographic (visually generated) video of Phelps wearing the suit which was displayed in London, Sydney, New York, and Tokyo on the day of the suit's release. Speedo's LZR Racer had become so effective by the eve of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] that many swimmers, despite them or their swimming federations having exclusive contracts with other apparel makers, have chosen the LZR Racer over competing bodysuits.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-swimsuits-idUSN1946603220080623|title=Speedo's suit divides swimming world|date=23 June 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that year's Olympics in Beijing, 94% of all swimming races were won in that suit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854154,00.html Time's Best Innovations of 2008].

In 2009, FINA rules and regulations were altered, effective from 1 January 2010. Suits made with polyurethane were banned because they made athletes more buoyant. These rules also banned suits which go above the [[navel]] or below the knee for men and suits which extend past the shoulders or cover the neck for women &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FINA General Rules 2013|url=http://www.fina.org/H2O/docs/rules/FRSA.pdf|publisher=FINA|accessdate=2014-08-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426215139/http://www.fina.org/H2O/docs/rules/FRSA.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FINA stated that it "wishes to recall the main and core principle is that swimming is a sport essentially based on the physical performance of the athlete".&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7944084.stm Fina extends swimsuit regulations]. BBC. 19 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Goggles were used in the crossing of the [[English Channel]] back in 1911, but only in 1970 appeared at international competitions.

With the advent of rubber technology, latex swimming caps became mass-produced in the 1920s, and more efficient silicone caps appeared in the 1970s.

==Suits==

===Bodyskin===
[[File:Unveiling of LZR Racer in NYC 2008-02-13.jpg|thumb|[[LZR Racer]] suit]]
{{further information|LZR Racer#FINA rule changes}}
{{further information|Arena X-Glide#FINA rule changes}}
{{see also|History of competitive swimwear#Non-textile swimsuits}}
A '''bodyskin''' is a style of competitive swimwear worn by both female and male athletes. Bodyskins are normally made of technologically advanced [[lycra]]-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased [[Drag (physics)|drag]] resistance in the water.

The bodyskin resembles the design of a [[Diving suit#Dive skins|dive skin]], commonly used by snorkelers and [[Scuba diving|scuba]] divers for warm weather climates. The primary distinguishing feature is the material from which the bodyskin suit is made.

Some bodysuits provide full body coverage from the ankles to the neck and wrists, such as [[Ian Thorpe]]'s [[adidas]] JETCONCEPT bodysuit which made its debut in 2003, Thorpe previously wore an earlier Adidas black bodysuit design in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="eurekalert.org"/&gt; Sleeveless designs such as the [[Speedo]] [[LZR Racer]] was popular in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]; Speedo also produces a bodyskin designed specifically for the [[backstroke]].&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob |title=Winning Skin |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=8-15|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/winning-skin|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other competing bodysuits include Acquablade, Fastskin, and Sharkskin, which are produced by [[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]], Asics, Descente, Arena, and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].

[[File:Cesar Cielo at 2009 US World Trials.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Brazilian swimmer [[César Cielo]] wearing the Arena X-Glide swimsuit]]

Swimmers reported that bodyskins improved buoyancy. This is true as long as the suits remain dry. As such, they are recommended for distances under 200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://coachsci.sdsu.edu/swim/bodysuit/table.htm | title=Bodysuit Problem | publisher=San Diego State University | work=Swimming Science Journal | accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national coach of a small country stated that the suits need exact sizing and resulting high cost "increas[ed] the disparity between the haves and have nots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://coachsci.sdsu.edu/swim/bodysuit/testimon.htm | title=Testimonies about Bodysuits | publisher=San Diego State University | work=Swimming Science Journal | date=2000-07-20 | accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most technologically advanced fabric swimwear, bodyskins were only commonly used at highly competitive levels of the swimming sport and are known to sell for prices in excess of [[United States dollar|US$]]400.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt; Despite their cost, a single bodysuit can only be used for a handful of races, as getting in and out of the suit repeatedly would damage its form-fitting properties, memorably when [[Ian Thorpe]] tore his Adidas bodysuit right before the 4x100 men's freestyle relay podium ceremony in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

Bodyskins were banned from [[FINA]] competitions from the start of 2010 after many national swimming federations demanded the action, and leading athletes such as [[Michael Phelps]] and [[Rebecca Adlington]] criticised the suits.&lt;ref name=bbcjuly&gt;{{cite news |title=Hi-tech suits banned from January  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/swimming/8161867.stm |newspaper=BBC Sport |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to be used for other purposes, including research.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

=== Briefs ===
{{main article|Swim briefs}}
[[File:Man in Uzzi swim briefs (crop).jpg|thumb|right|A man wearing swim briefs]]
A  '''swim brief''' refers to any [[briefs]] style male [[swimsuit]] such as those worn in competitive [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]]. The popularity of the Australian [[Speedo]] (est. 1928) brand racing brief has led to the use of its name in some countries (e.g. the United States) to refer to any racing brief, regardless of the maker. Occasionally, the Speedo [[genericized trademark]] also applies to [[Competitive swimwear#Square cut|square cut]] swimsuits, but in general the generic term is used in reference to swim briefs. Swim briefs are also referred to as competition briefs, bathers, racer bathers, posing briefs, racing briefs, and colloquially in Australia as "budgie smugglers".&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Daniel (24 November 2006) [http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1796509.htm Vic Liberals play down election costings error]. The World Today&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[underwear]] briefs, swim briefs feature a V-shape front and a solid back providing form-fitting coverage. They typically are worn below the lower waist. They are generally secured by thin banding at the upper thighs and either a [[drawstring]] around the waist or an [[elastic waistband]]. Swim briefs are most often made of a [[nylon]] and [[spandex]] (Lycra) composite, while some longer lasting suits are made from [[polyester]] and still others from other materials. Most swim briefs have a beige or white front lining made of a similar fabric.

=== Drag suit ===
A '''drag suit''' is a pair of baggy squarecut or brief-style trunks that competitive swimmers may wear over their normal suit to provide extra resistance ("drag") from the water. This allows the swimmer to get more out of their training than they would without a drag suit. Drag suits are meant to be worn over a long period of time to wear in the material and possibly tear the fabric.  The more worn-in, torn or ripped the drag suit, the more resistance it provides the swimmer.  Since drag suits make swimming more difficult, swimmers do not wear drag suits in competition.  Drag suits originated as older swimsuits at the end of their useful life that swimmers would then wear over another suit.

=== Kneeskin ===
A '''kneeskin''' is a type of competitive swimwear worn by both male and female athletes. Kneeskins are normally made of technologically advanced [[lycra]]-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased [[Drag (physics)|drag]] resistance in the water.

The kneeskin is similar in design to the full [[bodyskin]] absent the leggings beyond the knee. It also resembles a "shortie" style [[wetsuit]] only made of drag-reducing fabric instead of [[neoprene]] and commonly features a zippered back. Most competitive swimwear brands such as the [[Speedo]] [[LZR Racer]] line, [[Tyr Sport, Inc.]] and Arena Powerskin line produce suits of this type. As with most technologically advanced fabric swimwear, kneeskin suits are only commonly used at highly competitive levels of the swimming sport and are known to sell for prices in excess of [[United States dollar|US$]]200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.articlesgratuits.com/competition-swimwear-id399.php Competition Swimwear] Retrieved 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jammer ===
[[File:Winners jammer.jpg|thumb|right|Jammer swimsuit]]
A '''jammer''' is a style of [[swimsuit]] worn by male swimmers, used mainly in competition to obtain speed advantages. They are generally made of nylon and [[spandex|lycra/spandex]] material, but may be made of polyester, and have a form fitting design to reduce water resistance. They provide moderate coverage from the mid-waist to the area above the knee, somewhat resembling [[cycling shorts]] or [[compression shorts]] worn by many athletes. They provide greater leg coverage than [[swim briefs]] and [[square leg suits]], although they also have slightly more water resistance.

=== Legskin ===
A '''legskin''' is a type of competitive swimwear worn by male swimmers. Most legskins are made of technologically advanced [[lycra]]-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased [[Drag (physics)|drag]] resistance in the water. The legskin covers from the swimmer's mid-waist to his ankle and resembles [[leggings]]. One advantage of the legskin over other suit styles that cover the arms is flexibility, especially for strokes that require broad arm movement.

Since 2009, legskins have been banned for competition swimming by FINA since they gave an unfair advantage to swimmers who wore them; the ban includes bodysuits.

=== Racerback ===
[[File:Swim Cap Colors (2321866320).jpg|right|thumb|Racerback swimsuits.]]
{{see also|One-piece swimsuit}}
A '''racerback''' is a type of women's [[swimsuit]] design common today among competitive swimwear and incorporated into some types of women's clothing. The top-back of the swimsuit is not covered to provide flexibility and movement of the arms during swimming.

=== Square cut ===
[[File:Speedo zwembroek-1.jpg|thumb|Square cut swimsuit.]]
The '''square cut''' or '''square leg style suit''' is a form-fitting male [[swimsuit]] used as a slightly less revealing style than [[swim briefs]] for [[water polo]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], or for recreational wear. Like swim briefs, they are made of a [[nylon]] and [[spandex]] blend. They typically sit low on the waist and high on the thigh, but provide more coverage for the upper leg than briefs. The square-cut style was popular as a recreational swimsuit for men during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jessica|last=Yadegaran|title=Snug suits not for shy beach boys|work=Contra Costa Times|date=2006-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suits of this type are named for the coverage that they provide to the upper thighs due to a square seam opening for the leg. Square leg suits range in appearance from those similar to swim briefs with a slightly straighter front and wider side panelling (eliminating the arc appearance on the leg), to those resembling  [[boxer briefs]] by providing an inch or more of fabric coverage over the upper section of the leg.

The square leg suit of the 1970s made a fashion revival in Australia in 2002 with the introduction of colorful floral and retro geometric patterned suits by swimwear label [[Funky Trunks]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The style is popular amongst competitive swimmers for pool training and for recreational swimmers in the pool and at the beach.

'''''Downhill Racer''''' is a 1969 American [[sports film|sports]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Robert Redford]], [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Camilla Sparv]],&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Michael Ritchie (director) |title=Downhill Racer |medium=DVD |publisher=The Criterion Collection |location=New York |year=2009 |origyear=1977 AFI audio seminar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the [[directorial debut]] of [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Ritchie |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Ritchie-American-film-director |accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[James Salter]], based on the 1963 novel ''The Downhill Racers'' by [[Oakley Hall]], the film is about a talented downhill skier who joins the [[United States]] [[United States Ski Team|ski team]] in [[Europe]] to compete in [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|international skiing competitions]].  [[Sylvester Stallone]] appeared in one scene as an extra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stallonezone.com/main/1970/10/sly-scores.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''Downhill Racer'' was filmed on location in [[Kitzbühel]] and [[Sankt Anton am Arlberg]] in Austria, [[Wengen]], Switzerland, [[Megève]] and [[Grenoble]] in France, and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Idaho Springs, Colorado|Idaho Springs]] in Colorado, United States.&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt; The film received positive reviews upon its theatrical release,&lt;ref name=sidj1169&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1969/11/24/611073/how-to-succeed-at-racing-without-really-racing |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Jenkins |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Jenkins |title=How to succeed in racing without really racing |date=November 24, 1969 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Roger Ebert]] calling it "the best movie ever made about sports—without really being about sports at all."&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt;

==Plot==
American downhill skier David Chappellet ([[Robert Redford]]) arrives in [[Wengen]], Switzerland, to join the U.S. ski team, along with fellow newcomer D. K. Bryan (Kenneth Kirk). Both men were sent for by team coach Eugene Claire ([[Gene Hackman]]) to replace one of his top skiers who was recently injured during an [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships|FIS]] competition. Raised in the small town of Idaho Springs, Colorado, Chappellet is a loner with a single-minded focus on becoming a skiing champion, and shows little interest in being a team player. After refusing to race at the [[Lauberhorn ski races|Lauberhorn]] because of a late starting position, he makes his European skiing debut at the [[Arlberg-Kandahar]] in Austria, where he finishes in an impressive fourth position. In the final race of the season at the [[Hahnenkamm, Kitzbühel#Hahnenkamm race|Hahnenkamm-Rennen]] in [[Kitzbühel]], Austria, he crashes.

That summer, Chappellet joins the team in Oregon for off-season training, and visits his father at his home in Idaho Springs, but they have little to say to each other. Chappellet drives into town and picks up an old girlfriend and they make love in the back seat of his father's old Chevrolet. Afterwards, he shows little interest in the girl's feelings. Later, when his father asks him why he is wasting his life on skiing, Chappellet reveals that he is racing as an amateur to become an Olympic champion. His father observes, "The world's full of 'em."&lt;ref name=sidj1169/&gt;

Back in France that winter, Chappellet wins the Grand Prix de Megève in France and soon attracts the attention of Machet ([[Karl Michael Vogler]]), a ski manufacturer who wants Chappellet to use his skis for the advertising value. Chappellet is more interested in Machet's attractive assistant Carole Stahl ([[Camilla Sparv]]). After a chance encounter at a bakery, he and Carole spend some time with each other. They meet up again in Wengen, ski the slopes together, and eventually make love.

At Kitzbühel, Chappellet wins the Hahnenkamm, but afterwards his cockiness alienates his teammates and his coach who feel he is only out for himself. The team's top racer, Johnny Creech ([[Jim McMullan]]), tells assistant coach Mayo ([[Dabney Coleman]]), "He's never been for the team, and he never will be." Mayo responds, "Well it's not exactly a team sport, is it?" Chappellet finishes the season with several impressive victories ensuring his place on next season's Olympic team.

During the off-season, Chappellet and Carole continue to see each other. At the start of the third season, he calls her from [[Megève]] asking to spend Christmas with her. After waiting several days alone, Chappellet realizes that she is not coming. He travels to Zurich to Machet's office to find her, but learns she is spending Christmas with her family. The next week, Chappellet runs into Carole in Wengen and is annoyed that she never called and that she is with another man. After a brief confrontation, he realizes their relationship is over.

Two weeks before the Olympics, after a day of training at Wengen, Chappellet challenges Creech to a one-on-one race, and the two take off to the bottom as the coaches looks on in horror. On the way down, Chappellet forces Creech into the stone wall of a narrow-arched bridge ([[Jungfrau railway]] overpass ''Wasserstation''), and Creech barely escapes injury. The next day, during the Lauberhorn race, Creech is seriously injured during his run, leaving Chappellet as the team's best hope for an Olympic gold medal.

At the Winter Olympics, with Austrian champion Max Meier in first place, Chappellet uncorks one of his best runs, beating Meier's time and ending up in first place with all the highly-ranked racers having already run. He is thronged by elated fans and teammates in the finish area. However, on the course, an unheralded German skier in a later seed is turning in very fast split times. The fans fall quiet, and Chappellet takes notice of the German, watching nervously. As the German approaches the final schuss, he crashes, and Chappellet becomes an Olympic gold medal champion. The German makes his way to the finish area, and Chappellet looks into his eyes briefly before being carried off in victory.

==Production==

===Screenplay===
The screenplay for ''Downhill Racer'' is loosely based on the 1963 novel ''The Downhill Racers'' by [[Oakley Hall]]. In 1966, the film rights to the book passed from director Mark Robson to [[Paramount Pictures]] for producer Steve Alexander and screenwriter Graham Ferguson. After attempts to develop the project stalled, the new head of Paramount production, [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]], used the project to entice [[Roman Polanski]], a skiing enthusiast, to direct the film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' for the studio. Although Robert Redford passed on Polanski's offer to star in both films, the young actor soon attached himself to the skiing film, taking it on as a pet project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/interview-with-robert-redford|author=Ebert, Roger|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|title=INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT REDFORD|date=15 June 1969|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redford soon persuaded novelist [[James Salter]] to write a screenplay for the film, introducing him to Polanski and his partner, Gene Gutowski, who agreed to work on the film.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt;

James Salter prepared notes for the story, which did not resemble Hall's novel—Salter had not even read the book. Salter's starting point for the story was provided by Polanski, who told the writer that the film should be a modern-day ''High Noon'', where the sheriff is killed and someone is called in to replace him. For the film, the "sheriff" is the lead racer on the team who breaks his leg, and Chappellet is called in to replace him. Focused on directing ''Rosemary's Baby'', Polanski soon left the project, and the studio sued Redford for walking away from the starring role. Redford later revived the project by pitching the story to [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]] owner Charles Bluhdorn. Soon after, Redford found his director and decided to make the film cheaply in Europe. Charles Bluhdorn, who was Austrian, may have influenced the decision on film locations; he created the production company Wildwood.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt;

In January 1968, Redford and Salter traveled to Grenoble and accompanied the U. S. ski team — traveling on buses, sleeping in hallways, taking in the atmosphere, and observing the athletes. One night in Grenoble, they discussed the central character of David Chappellet. Salter's inspiration for the character was the [[Alpine skiing at the 1964 Winter Olympics – Men's slalom|1964 Olympic silver medal]] winner [[Billy Kidd]] of [[Vermont]], who conveyed an "arrogant and aloof" quality.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; Redford, however, saw the Chappellet character as being more like [[Spider Sabich]], the dynamic skier from rural [[California]], who finished fifth that year in the [[Alpine skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics – Men's slalom|slalom]]. While the character ultimately took on aspects of both role models, Salter's original scenes of tense dynamics between Chappellet and the coach survived the writing process.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; The original inspiration for the character is said to be [[Colorado]]'s [[Buddy Werner]] of [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], (Chappellet was said to be from Idaho Springs, Colorado). Werner burst upon the downhill racing scene in Europe in the late 1950s and was the first American to win an F.I.S. downhill race. He was known for a reckless style but broke his leg in training two months before the [[Alpine skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Winter Olympics]] at [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort|Squaw Valley]] in which he would have been a favorite for a medal in the downhill. Werner died in an avalanche in Switzerland in 1964, while performing for a film crew.

===Crew===
As director Michael Ritchie admired the work of British director [[Ken Loach]], Ritchie hired [[Brian Probyn]] and Kevin Sutton, the cameraman and sound man from Loach's film ''[[Poor Cow]]''.&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt;

===Filming===
''Downhill Racer'' was filmed on location in [[Wengen]], Switzerland, [[Kitzbühel]] and [[Sankt Anton am Arlberg]] in Austria, [[Megève]] and [[Grenoble]] in France, and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Idaho Springs, Colorado|Idaho Springs]] in Colorado, United States.&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt; Parts of the film were also shot at [[Sundance Resort|Sundance]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the skiing footage was shot from January 11 to February 1, [[1969 Alpine Skiing World Cup|1969]], during four [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] races: Internationales [[Lauberhorn ski races|Lauberhorn]] in Wengen, Internationales [[Hahnenkamm, Kitzbühel|Hahnenkamm]]-Rennen in Kitzbühel, Grand Prix de Megève, and [[Arlberg-Kandahar]] in Sankt Anton am Arlberg.&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt; The off-season scenes were filmed in Colorado: the track scene at [[Colorado Buffaloes#Facilities|Potts Field]] on the east campus of the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]] in Boulder,&lt;ref name=potts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=600&amp;ATCLID=325144 |publisher=University of Colorado Athletics |title=Potts Field |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hometown street scenes in Idaho Springs, {{convert|30|mi|-1|spell=in}} west of [[Denver]].&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt; The interior scenes of Chappellet's Idaho Springs house were filmed at [[Paramount Studios]] in [[Southern California|southern]] [[California]].&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt;

[[Sylvester Stallone]] appeared as an extra in the restaurant scene.&lt;ref&gt;https://s12.postimg.org/4fdyk94ul/Untitled4.png&lt;/ref&gt; A rare theater book listed that he was in this film.&lt;ref&gt;https://d2r1vs3d9006ap.cloudfront.net/s3_images/1344516/RackMultipart20160111-14978-27crn0-score_inline.jpg?1452544957&lt;/ref&gt; As Stallone was only an extra, he has no billing in the credits, and this book is now a very rare, collectors item.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stallonezone.com/main/labels/1970.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Downhill Racer'' was released to theaters in the United States in late [[1969 in film|1969]], premiering in New York City on November 6.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Downhill Racer (1969) |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/14515/Downhill-Racer/overview |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-released in the U.S. in July 1984 at the FILMEX: Los Angeles International Film Exposition for a 50-hour Sports Movie Marathon on July 5–20.&lt;ref name="tcm-misc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Downhill Racer Miscellaneous Notes |work=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4533/Downhill-Racer/misc-notes.html |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Downhill Racer'' was released on DVD in Region 2 format on August 13, 2007 by Paramount Home Entertainment.

The film was released just two weeks after ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', giving Redford two box office hits at the same time.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
In his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four out of four stars, calling it "the best movie ever made about sports—without really being about sports at all."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=Downhill Racer |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 22, 1969 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/downhill-racer-1969 |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to praising the performances of Redford and Hackman, Ebert noted how well the film balanced the exciting action sequences and the less glamorous aspects of an athlete's life.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; Ebert wrote:
{{quote|Without bothering to explain much of the technical aspect of skiing, ''Downhill Racer'' tells us more about the sport than we imagined a movie could. The joy of these action sequences is counterpointed by the daily life of the ski amateur. There are the anonymous hotel rooms, one after another, and the deadening continual contact with the team members, and the efforts of the coach ... to hold the team together and placate its financial backers in New York. And there is Chappellet's casual affair with a girl ..., who seems to be a sort of ski groupie. She wants to make love to him, and does, but he is so limited, so incapable of understanding her or anything beyond his own image, that she drops him. He never does quite understand why. The movie balances nicely between this level, and the exuberance of its outdoor location photography. And it does a skillful job of involving us in the competition without really being a movie about competition. In the end, ''Downhill Racer'' succeeds so well that instead of wondering whether the hero will win the Olympic race, we want to see what will happen to him if he does.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt;}}

In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Roger Greenspun]] called ''Downhill Racer'' "a very good movie".&lt;ref name="greenspun"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenspun |first=Roger |title=For 'Downhill Racer,' Time Is the Master |work=The New York Times |date=November 7, 1969 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E04E2DB153DEF34BC4F53DFB7678382679EDE |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the lead character David Chappellet, Greenspun observed, "His world is that international society of the well-exercised inarticulate where the good is known as 'really great,' and the bad is signified by silence. In appreciating that world, its pathos, its narcissism, its tensions, and its sufficient moments of glory, ''Downhill Racer'' succeeds with sometimes chilling efficiency."&lt;ref name="greenspun"/&gt;

In his review for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, [[Richard Schickel]] praised the film for both its esthetic beauty and its depiction of the brutal realities of competition.&lt;ref name="schickel"&gt;{{Citation|last=Schickel |first=Richard |title=The Brutal Beauty of Ski Racing |journal=Life |volume=67 |number=23 |page=18 |date=December 5, 1969 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFAEAAAAMBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schickel wrote:
{{quote|''Downhill Racer'' is precisely what we have waited so long to see—a small, tense, expertly made (and, on occasion, surprisingly funny) film about a newly chic form of athletic competition—Alpine skiing. ... That insistence on the heart of the matter, winning or losing, is not the least of Downhill's virtues, but there are others. Quite obviously, they include capturing on color film the sheer beauty of the white world in which racers live. Here the director, Michael Ritchie, splendidly exploits a couple of paradoxes. From a distance, the skiers seem to have the effortless natural grace of birds in flight. Close up, though, he makes us see they are engaged in a brutal, breath-stealing ordeal, and the contrast gripped me as strongly as anything I have recently seen on the screen. Then there's the other paradox—that this agonizing effort takes place, unlike that of any other sport, with the competitor alone in a sea of silence.&lt;ref name="schickel"/&gt;}}

With the encouragement of her father, she soon began to participate in and win some beauty contests. She also landed a few modeling jobs, but at 15, she took a break from acting to work in an export company café, where she remained for four years, to help her family pay for their house.

At 18, she met the state coordinator of [[Minas Gerais]], who invited her to live in [[Divinópolis]] and prepared to participate in international beauty contests. She visited various countries such as [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Belarus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[United States]] (where she stayed for three months) and [[Bahamas]].

Before [[Miss Universe Brazil]], Debora competed in [[Miss Earth Brazil|Miss Terra Brasil]] 2009 where she became 3rd runner-up or Miss Terra-Fogo (Miss Earth-Fire).

In 2013, Lyra represented Brazil at the world finals of the Miss Multiverse pageant in the Dominican Republic, she won and became the 4th Miss Multiverse winner.

'''[[Egypt]]''' competed at the '''[[1972 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]].  The North African nation made its Olympic debut in 1912.

The Egyptian contingent included 28 male athletes, 1 female athlete and 18 officials. Because of the [[Munich massacre]], some members of the Egyptians contingent left the Olympics early.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120808032119/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1972/1972s1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equestrianism''' (from [[Latin]] equester, equestr-, equus, ''horseman'', ''horse''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/equestrian |title=equestrian – definition of equestrian by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; more often known as '''horse riding''' ([[British English]]) or '''horseback riding''' ([[American English]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=equitaci%C3%B3n |title=equitación – Diccionario Inglés-Español |publisher=Wordreference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the skill of riding, [[Driving (horse)|driving]], [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]] or [[Equestrian vaulting|vaulting]] with [[horse]]s. This broad description includes the use of horses for practical [[working animal|working]] purposes, transportation, recreational activities, artistic or cultural exercises, and [[animals in sport|competitive sport]].

==Overview of equestrian activities==

[[File:Tibetan equestrian.JPG|thumb|left|A young [[Tibet]]an rider. Horse riding is an essential means of transportation in parts of the world where the landscape does not permit other means.]]
Horses are [[horse training|trained]] and ridden for practical working purposes, such as in [[Mounted police|police work]] or for controlling herd animals on a [[ranch]]. They are also used in [[Horse#Sport|competitive sports]] including, but not limited to, [[dressage]], [[endurance riding]], [[eventing]], [[reining]], [[show jumping]], [[tent pegging]], [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]], [[polo]], [[horse racing]], [[driving (horse)|driving]], and [[rodeo]] (see additional equestrian sports listed later in this article for more examples).  Some popular forms of competition are grouped together at [[horse show]]s where horses perform in a wide variety of disciplines. Horses (and other [[equid]]s such as [[mule]]s) are used for non-competitive recreational riding such as [[fox hunting]], [[trail riding]], or hacking. There is public access to horse trails in almost every part of the world; many parks, [[ranch]]es, and public [[stable]]s offer both guided and independent riding. Horses are also used for [[therapeutic horseback riding|therapeutic]] purposes both in specialized para-equestrian competition as well as non-competitive riding to improve human health and emotional development.

[[Horses]] are also [[driving (horse)|driven]] in [[harness racing]], at [[horse show|horse shows,]] and in other types of exhibition such as [[historical reenactment]] or ceremony, often pulling [[carriage]]s. In some parts of the world, they are still used for practical purposes such as [[farm]]ing.

Horses continue to be used in public service: in traditional ceremonies (parades, funerals), [[police horse|police]] and volunteer mounted patrols and for [[mounted search and rescue]].

[[Riding hall]]s enable the training of horse and rider in all weathers as well as indoor competition riding.

==History of horse use==
[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|Prehistoric cave painting, depicting a horse and rider]]
{{Main|Domestication of the horse|Horses in warfare}}
Though there is controversy over the exact date horses were [[domestication|domesticated]] and when they were first ridden, the best estimate is that horses first were ridden approximately 3500 BC. Indirect evidence suggests that horses were ridden long before they were driven. There is some evidence that about 3,000 BC, near the [[Dnieper River]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], people were using [[Bit (horse)|bits]] on horses, as a stallion that was buried there shows teeth wear consistent with using a bit.&lt;ref name=Chamberlin69&gt;Chamberlin, J. Edward ''Horse: How the Horse has Shaped Civilization'' New York:BlueBridge 2006 {{ISBN|0-9742405-9-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most unequivocal early [[archeology|archaeological]] evidence of equines put to working use was of horses being driven. [[Chariot]] burials about 2500 BC present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as [[working animal]]s. In ancient times chariot warfare was followed by the use of [[horses in warfare|war horses]] as light and heavy [[cavalry]]. The horse played an important role throughout human history all over the world, both in warfare and in peaceful pursuits such as [[transportation]], [[trade]] and [[agriculture]]. Horses lived in North America, but died out at the end of the [[Ice Age]]. Horses were brought back to North America by European explorers, beginning with the second voyage of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in 1493.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Deb (1998) 'Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship.''

==Horse racing==
{{Main|Horse racing|Harness racing|Parimutuel gambling}}
Humans appear to have long expressed a desire to know which horse or horses were the fastest, and [[horse racing]] has ancient roots. [[Gambling]] on horse races appears to go hand-in hand with racing and has a long history as well. [[Thoroughbred]]s have the pre-eminent reputation as a racing breed, but other breeds also race.

===Types of horse racing===
Under saddle

* [[Thoroughbred horse racing]] is the most popular form worldwide. In the UK, it is known as [[flat racing]] and is governed by the [[Jockey Club]] in the United Kingdom. In the USA, horse racing is governed by [[The Jockey Club]].
* [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechasing]] involves racing on a track where the horses also jump over obstacles. It is most common in the UK, where it is also called [[National Hunt]] racing.
* [[American Quarter Horse]] racing—races over distances of approximately a quarter-mile. Seen mostly in the United States, sanctioned by the [[American Quarter Horse Association]].
* [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Akhal-Teke]], [[Appaloosa]]s, [[American Paint Horse]]s and other light breeds are also raced worldwide.
* [[Endurance riding]], a sport in which the [[Arabian horse]] dominates at the top levels, has become very popular in the United States and in Europe. The [[Federation Equestre International]] (FEI) governs international races, and the American Endurance Ride Conference (AERC) organizes the sport in North America. Endurance races take place over a given, measured distance and the horses have an even start. Races are usually {{convert|50|to|100|mi|km}}, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses' vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Additional awards are usually given to the best-conditioned horses who finish in the top 10. Limited distance rides of about {{convert|25|-|20|mi}} are offered to newcomers.
* [[Ride and Tie]] (in North America, organized by Ride and Tie Association). Ride and Tie involves three equal partners: two humans and one horse. The humans alternately run and ride.

[[Show jumping]]:
*[[Show jumping]] is when a horse carries a rider over an obstacle also commonly known as a jump. There are usually multiple jumps in a show and if the horse hits the jump then they will get points deducted in a show.

In harness:
* Both light and heavy breeds as well as ponies are raced in harness with a [[sulky]] or racing bike. The [[Standardbred]] dominates the sport in both [[trot (horse gait)|trotting]] and [[Pacing (horse gait)|pacing]] varieties.
* The United States Trotting Association organizes [[harness racing]] in the United States.
* Harness racing is also found throughout Europe, New Zealand and Australia.

==International and Olympic disciplines==
{{Main|Equestrian at the Olympics|International Federation for Equestrian Sports}}
Equestrian events were first included in the modern [[Olympic Games]] in 1900. By 1912, all three Olympic disciplines still seen today were part of the games. The following forms of competition are recognized worldwide and are a part of the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] at the Olympics. They are governed by the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI).
* [[Dressage]] ("training" in [[French language|French]]) involves the progressive training of the horse to a high level of [[impulsion]], [[collection (horse)|collection]] and obedience. Competitive dressage has the goal of showing the horse carrying out, on request, the natural movements that it performs without thinking while running loose.
* [[Show jumping]] comprises a timed event judged on the ability of the horse and rider to jump over a series of obstacles, in a given order and with the fewest refusals or knockdowns of portions of the obstacles.
* [[Eventing]], also called ''combined training'', ''horse trials'', the ''three-day event'', ''the Military'' or ''the complete test'', puts together the obedience of dressage with the athletic ability of show jumping, the fitness demands the [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country jumping]] phase. In the last-named, the horses jump over fixed obstacles, such as logs, stone walls, [[bank (obstacle)|banks]], [[ditch (obstacle)|ditches]] and [[water (obstacle)|water]], trying to finish the course under the "optimum time." There was also the 'Steeple Chase' Phase, which is now excluded from most major competitions to bring them in line with the Olympic standard.

The additional internationally sanctioned but non-Olympic disciplines governed by the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] are: [[combined driving]]; [[endurance riding|endurance]]; [[reining]]; and [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]]. These disciplines are part of the [[FEI World Equestrian Games]] every four years and may hold their own individual World Championships in other years. The FEI also recognizes [[horseball]] and [[tent pegging]] as its two regional disciplines.

===Para-equestrian disciplines===
[[Para-equestrian]] competition at the international level, including the [[Equestrian at the Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], are also governed by the FEI and offer the following competition events:
* Para-Equestrian Dressage is conducted under the same rules as conventional Dressage, but with riders divided into different competition grades based on their functional abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508135709/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage |date=May 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Para-Equestrian Driving places competitors in various grades based on their skill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/driving/about-para-equestrian-driving ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501195554/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/driving/about-para-equestrian-driving |date=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haute École==
{{Main|Classical dressage}}
The ''haute école'' ([[French language|F.]] "high school"), an advanced component of [[Classical dressage]], is a highly refined set of skills seldom used in competition but often seen in demonstration performances.

Leading haute ecole demonstration teams include:
* The [[Cadre Noir]] in [[Saumur]], [[France]].
* The [[Spanish Riding School]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
* The [[Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre]] at [[Queluz National Palace]], [[Portugal]].
* [[Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art]] in [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Spain]].
* [[South African Lipizzaners]] of [[Midrand]] in [[South Africa]].

==Horse shows==
{{Main|Horse show}}

[[Horse show]]s are held throughout the world with a tremendous variety of possible events, equipment, attire and judging standards used. However, most forms of horse show competition can be broken into the following broad categories:
* [[Equitation]], sometimes called ''seat and hands'' or ''horsemanship'', refers to events where the rider is judged on form, style and ability.
* ''Pleasure, flat'' or ''under saddle'' classes feature horses who are ridden on the flat (not jumped) and judged on manners, performance, movement, style and quality.
* ''Halter, in-hand breeding'' or ''conformation'' classes, where the horse is led by a handler on the ground and judged on conformation and suitability as a breeding animal.
* ''Harness'' classes, where the horse is [[Driving (horse)|driven]] rather than ridden, but still judged on manners, performance and quality.
* ''Jumping'' or ''Over Fences'' refers broadly to both [[show jumping]] and [[show hunter]], where horses and riders must jump obstacles.

=="English" riding==
{{Main|English riding}}
{{See also|Hunt seat| Equitation|Show jumping|Dressage|Riding Horse|Saddle seat|Jumpers|Hunters}}
In addition to the classical Olympic events, the following forms of competition are seen. In North America they are referred to as "[[English riding]]" in contrast with western riding; elsewhere in the world, if a distinction is necessary, they are usually described as "classic riding":
* [[Hunt seat]] or [[Show hunter|Hunter]] classes judge the movement and the form of horses suitable for work over fences. A typical [[show hunter]] division would include classes over fences as well as "Hunter under Saddle" or "flat" classes (sometimes called "hack" classes), in which the horse is judged on its performance, manners and movement without having to jump. Hunters have a long, flat-kneed trot, sometimes called "daisy cutter" movement, a phrase suggesting a good hunter could slice daisies in a field when it reaches its stride out. The over fences classes in [[show hunter]] competition are judged on the form of the horse, its manners and the smoothness of the course. A horse with good jumping form snaps its knees up and jumps with a good [[bascule (horse)|bascule]]. It should also be able to canter or gallop with control while having a stride long enough to make a proper number of strides over a given distance between fences. Hunter classes differ from jumper classes, in which they are not timed, and equitation classes, in which the rider's performance is the focus. Hunter style is based on fox hunting, so jumps in the hunter division are usually more natural colors than the jumps in a jumper division.
* [[Eventing]], [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]], described under "Olympic disciplines," above are all "English" riding disciplines that in North America sometimes are loosely classified within the "hunt seat" category.
* [[Saddle seat]], is a primarily American discipline, though has recently become somewhat popular in [[South Africa]], was created to show to best advantage the animated movement of high-stepping and gaited breeds such as the [[American Saddlebred]] and the [[Tennessee Walking Horse|Tennessee Walker]]. Many [[Arabian horse|Arabians]] and [[Morgan horse|Morgans]] are also shown saddle seat in the United States. There are usually three basic divisions. ''Park'' divisions are for the horses with the highest action. ''Pleasure'' divisions still emphasis animated action, but to a lesser degree, with manners ranking over animation. ''Plantation'' or ''Country'' divisions have the least amount of animation (in some breeds, the horses are flat-shod) and the greatest emphasis on manners.
* [[Show hack]] is a competition seen primarily in the United Kingdom, Australia and other nations influenced by British traditions, featuring horses of elegant appearance, with excellent way of going and self-carriage. A related event is [[riding Horse]].

=="Western" riding==
{{Main|Western riding}}
{{see also|Reining||Western pleasure|Rodeo|Cutting (sport)}}
[[Western riding]] evolved from the cattle-working and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]], and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the [[cowboy]] on [[ranch]]es in the [[American West]].

Though the differences between English and Western riding appear dramatic, there are many similarities. Both styles require riders to have a solid seat, with the hips and shoulders balanced over the feet, with hands independent of the seat so as to avoid disturbing the balance of the horse and interfering with its performance.

The most noticeable feature of western style riding is in the saddle, which has a substantial tree that provides greater support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a [[Lasso|lariat]] after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to be attached to the saddle.

Western horses are asked to perform with a loose rein, controlled by one hand. The standard western bridle lacks a [[noseband]] and usually consists of a single set of reins attached to a [[curb bit]] that has somewhat longer and looser [[bit shank|shanks]] than the curb of an English [[double bridle|Weymouth]] bridle or a [[pelham bit]]. Two styles of Western [[rein]]s developed: The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the closed-end "[[Romal]]" reins of the California tradition, which have a long single attachment on the ends that can be used as a [[quirt]]. Modern [[rodeo]] competitors in timed events sometimes use a closed rein without a ''romal''.

Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed [[cowboy hat]]. [[Cowboy boot]]s, which have pointed toes and higher heels than a traditional riding boot, are designed to prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged—most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called [[chaps]]. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in [[rodeo]], [[Cutting (sport)|cutting]] and [[reining]] competitions, especially for men, though sometimes both men and women wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.

Show events such as [[Western pleasure]] use much flashier equipment, unlike the English traditions where clothing and tack is quiet and unobtrusive. Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver. The rider may add a jacket or vest, and women's clothing in particular features vivid colors and even, depending on current fads, rhinestones or sequins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbyhorseinc.com/|title=Horse Show Apparel, Attire, Accessories|website=Hobby Horse Clothing Company, Inc.|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western horses are asked to have a brisk, ground-covering walk, but a slow, relaxed jog [[trot (horse gait)|trot]] that allows the rider to sit the saddle and not post. The Western version of the [[canter]] is called a ''lope'' and while collected and balanced, is expected to be slow and relaxed. Working western horses seldom use a sustained hand gallop, but must be able to accelerate quickly to high speed when chasing cattle or competing in [[rodeo]] speed events, must be able to stop quickly from a dead run and "turn on a dime."

==Harness==
[[File:Welsh-A-Buggy.jpg|thumb|left|A Welsh pony in fine harness competition]]
{{Main|Driving (horse)}}
Horses, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s are driven in [[Horse harness|harness]] in many different ways. For working purposes, they can pull a [[plow]] or other [[farm]] equipment designed to be pulled by animals. In many parts of the world they still pull [[wagon]]s for basic hauling and transportation. They may draw [[carriage]]s at ceremonies, in parades or for tourist rides.

As noted in "horse racing" ''above'', horses can race in harness, pulling a very lightweight cart known as a [[sulky]]. At the other end of the spectrum, some [[draft horse]]s compete in [[horse pulling]] competitions, where single or teams of horses and their drivers vie to determine who can pull the most weight for a short distance.

In [[horse show]] competition, the following general categories of competition are seen:
* [[Combined driving]], an internationally recognized competition where horses perform an arena-based "dressage" class where precision and control are emphasized, a cross-country "marathon" section that emphasizes fitness and endurance, and a "stadium" or "cones" obstacle course.
* [[Draft horse showing]]: Most [[draft horse]] performance competition is done in harness.
* [[Pleasure driving]]: Horses and ponies are usually hitched to a light cart shown at a walk and two speeds of trot, with an emphasis on manners.
* [[Fine harness]]: Also called "Formal driving," Horses are hitched to a light four-wheeled cart and shown in a manner that emphasizes flashy action and dramatic performance.
* [[Roadster (horse)|Roadster]]: A horse show competition where exhibitors wear [[racing silks]] and ride in a sulky in a style akin to [[harness racing]], only without actually racing, but rather focusing on manners and performance.
* [[Carriage]] driving, using somewhat larger two or four wheeled carriages, often restored [[antique]]s, judged on the turnout/neatness or suitability of horse and carriage.

==Rodeo==
{{main|Rodeo}}

Rodeo events include the following forms of competition:

===Timed events===
* [[Barrel racing]] and [[pole bending]] – the timed speed and agility events seen in [[rodeo]] as well as [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]] or [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|O-Mok-See]] competition. Both men and women compete in speed events at gymkhanas or O-Mok-Sees; however, at most professional, sanctioned rodeos, barrel racing is an exclusively women's sport. In a barrel race, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In pole bending, horse and rider run the length of a line of six upright poles, turn sharply and weave through the poles, turn again and weave back, then return to the start.
* [[Steer wrestling]] – Also known as "Bulldogging," this is a rodeo event where the rider jumps off his horse onto a steer and 'wrestles' it to the ground by grabbing it by the horns. This is probably the single most physically dangerous event in rodeo for the cowboy, who runs a high risk of jumping off a running horse head first and missing the steer or of having the thrown steer land on top of him, sometimes horns first.
* Goat tying – usually an event for women or pre-teen girls and boys, a goat is staked out while a mounted rider runs to the goat, dismounts, grabs the goat, throws it to the ground and ties it in the same manner as a calf. This event was designed to teach smaller or younger riders the basics of calf roping without the more complex need to also lasso the animal.

===Roping===
Roping includes a number of timed events that are based on the real-life tasks of a working cowboy, who often had to capture calves and adult [[cattle]] for [[livestock branding|branding]], medical treatment and other purposes. A lasso or [[Lasso|lariat]] is thrown over the head of a [[calf (animal)|calf]] or the horns of adult cattle, and the animal is secured in a fashion dictated by its size and age.
* [[Calf roping]], also called "tie-down roping," is an event where a calf is roped around the neck by a [[Lasso|lariat]], the horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws it to the ground and ties three feet together. (If the horse throws the calf, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work. The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope) This activity is still practiced on modern working ranches for [[brand]]ing, medical treatment, and so on.
* [[Team roping]], also called "heading and heeling," is the only rodeo event where men and women riders may compete together. Two people capture and restrain a full-grown steer. One horse and rider, the "header," lassos a running steer's horns, while the other horse and rider, the "heeler," lassos the steer's two hind legs. Once the animal is captured, the riders face each other and lightly pull the steer between them, so that it loses its balance, thus in the real world allowing restraint for treatment.
* [[Breakaway roping]] – an easier form of calf roping where a very short lariat is used, tied lightly to the saddle horn with string and a flag. When the calf is roped, the horse stops, allowing the calf to run on, flagging the end of time when the string and flag breaks from the saddle. In the United States, this event is primarily for women of all ages and boys under 12, while in some nations where traditional calf roping is frowned upon, riders of both genders compete.

==="Rough Stock" competition===
[[File:Horses abreast IMG 5342.jpg|thumb|Small herd of rough stock in Texas.]]
In spite of popular myth, most modern "broncs" are not in fact wild horses, but are more commonly spoiled riding horses{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} or horses bred specifically as bucking stock.
* Bronc riding – there are two divisions in rodeo, [[bareback bronc]] riding, where the rider rides a bucking horse holding onto a leather [[surcingle]] or rigging with only one hand, and [[saddle bronc]] riding, where the rider rides a modified western saddle without a horn (for safety) while holding onto a braided lead rope attached to the horse's halter.
* Bull Riding – though technically not an equestrian event, as the cowboys ride full-grown bulls instead of horses, skills similar to bareback bronc riding are required.

===International rodeo===
* [[Australian rodeo]]
* [[Chilean rodeo]]

==Other equestrian activities==
[[File:PoloGirlsHorses.jpg|thumb|Girls and their horses preparing for a [[polo]] game]]
There are many other forms of equestrian activity and sports seen worldwide. There are both competitive events and [[pleasure riding]] disciplines available.

===Arena sports===
* Arena [[polo]] and [[Cowboy polo]]
* [[Pato]] (Argentina's national sport)
* [[Charreada]], the highest form of Mexican horsemanship based on a mixture of Spanish and Native traditions.
* [[Equestrian vaulting]]: In vaulting, a [[surcingle]] with two hoops at the top is attached around a horse's [[horse anatomy|barrel]]. The horse also wears a [[bridle]] with [[side reins]]. The vaulter is [[longeing|longed]] on the horse, and performs [[gymnastics|gymnastic]] movements while the horse walks, trots, and canters.
* [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|Gymkhana]], also known as ''O-Mok-See'' in the western United States.
* [[Reining]]

===Horse sports that use cattle===
* [[Bullfighting]] (''[[rejoneador|rejoneo]]'')
* [[Campdrafting]], a type of cattle-working competition popular in [[Australia]]
* [[Cutting (sport)|Cutting]]
* [[Team penning]]
* [[Working cow horse]]

===Defined area sports===
* [[Buzkashi]], a sport originating on the [[steppes]] of central [[Asia]], now the national sport of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].
* [[Horseball]]
* [[Jousting]] and [[Skill at Arms]], events involving use of lances, swords and completion of obstacles. There are stand-alone competitions and also are often seen at [[historical reenactment]]s, [[Renaissance Fair]]s and [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] events.
* [[Mounted Games]], a sport where games are played in a relay-style with two to five members per team at very high speed
* [[Polo]], a team game played on horses, involves riders using a long-handled [[mallet]] to drive a ball on the ground into the opposing team's [[goal (sport)|goal]] while the opposing team defends their goal
* [[Polocrosse]]
* [[Tent pegging]]
* [[Mounted archery]]

===Cross-country sports===
* [[Competitive Mounted Orienteering]], a form of orienteering on horses (but unrelated to [[orienteering]]) – consists of three stages: following a precise route marked on a map, negotiation of obstacles and control of paces.
* [[Techniques de Randonnée Équestre de Compétition|Le Trec]], which comprises three phases – trail riding, with jumping and correct basic flatwork. Le Trec, which is very popular in Europe, tests the partnership's ability to cope with an all-day ride across varied terrain, route finding, negotiating natural obstacles and hazards, while considering the welfare of the horse, respecting the countryside and enjoying all it has to offer.
* [[Competitive trail riding]], a [[pace race]] held across terrain similar to [[endurance riding]], but shorter in length (25 – {{convert|35|mi|km}}, depending on class). Being a form of [[pace race]], the objective is not to finish in the least time. Instead, as in other forms of [[judged trail ride|judged trail riding]], each competitor is graded on everything including physical condition, campsite and horse management. Horsemanship also is considered, including how the rider handles the trail and how horse is handled and presented to the judge and vet throughout the ride. The horse is graded on performance, manners, etc. "Pulse and respiration" stops check the horse's recovery ability. The judges also set up obstacles along the trail and the horse and rider are graded on how well they perform as a team. The whole point is the partnership between the horse and rider.
* [[Cross Country Jumping]], a jumping course that contains logs and natural obstacles mostly. The common clothes worn are usually brighter colors and less conservative.
* [[Endurance riding]], a competition usually of 50 to {{convert|100|mi|km}} or more, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses' vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Additional awards are usually given to the best-conditioned horses who finish in the top 10.
* [[Fox hunting]]
* Hacking, or [[pleasure riding]].
* [[Hunter Pacing]] is a sport where a horse and rider team travel a trail at speeds based the ideal conditions for the horse, with competitors seeking to ride closest to that perfect time. Hunter paces are usually held in a series. Hunter paces are usually a few miles long and covered mostly at a canter or gallop. The horsemanship and management skills of the rider are also considered in the scoring, and periodic stops are required for veterinarians to check the vital signs and overall soundness of the horses.
* [[Ride and Tie]] is a form of [[endurance riding]] in which teams of 3 (two humans and one horse) alternate running and riding.
* [[steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]], a distance horse race with diverse fence and ditch obstacles.
* [[Trail Riding]], pleasure riding any breed horse, any style across the land.

==Health issues==
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- mention risks of driving, esp collision w motor vehicles;  also spinal injury --&gt;
Handling, riding and driving horses has a number of health risks.

Riding has some inherent risks, as when mounted, the rider's head may be up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ground, and the horse may travel at a speed of up to {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Approximately 100 hours of experience are required to achieve a substantial decline in the risk of injury. The survey authors conclude that efforts to prevent equestrian injury should focus on novice equestrians.

===Mechanisms of injury===
The most common injury is falling from the horse, followed by being kicked, trampled and bitten. About 3 out of 4 injuries are due to falling, broadly defined.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Most injuries result from falls (80%)", ''Horse riding during pregnancy'', MS Rogers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1987|title=Riding and other equestrian injuries: Considerable severity|journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=22–24|doi=10.1136/bjsm.21.1.22|pmc=1478604|pmid=3580722|author=R.

===Head injuries===
Horseback riding is one of the most dangerous sports, especially in relation to head injury. Statistics from the United States, for example, indicate that about 30 million people ride horses annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deloitte|first1=C|title=National economic impact of U.S. horse industry|url=http://www.horsecouncil.org/nationaleconomics.php|website=American Horse Council Foundation|date=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203123251/http://www.horsecouncil.org/nationaleconomics.php|archivedate=2010-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, about 67,000 people are admitted to the hospital each year from injuries sustained while working with horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loder R | year = 2008 | title = The demographics of equestrian-related injuries in the United States: injury patterns, orthopedic specific injuries, and avenues for injury prevention | journal = The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and Critical Care | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 447–60 | doi=10.1097/ta.0b013e31817dac43 | pmid=18695484}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15,000 of those admittances are from traumatic brain injuries.

Head injuries are especially traumatic in horseback riding.

The use of riding helmets substantially decreases the likelihood and severity of head injuries. When a rider falls with a helmet, he or she is five times less likely to experience a traumatic brain injury than a rider who falls without a helmet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Helmets work by crushing on impact and extending the length of time it takes the head to stop moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke CN, Tsuei BJ, Butler KL | year = 2008 | title = Equine-related injury: a retrospective analysis of outcomes over a ten-year period | url = | journal = The American Journal of Surgery | volume = 195 | issue = 5| pages = 702–04 | doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2007.11.007 | pmid=18424291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, helmet usage rates in North America are estimated to be between eight and twenty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Worley GH | year = 2010 | title = Promoting the use of equestrian helmets: another opportunity for injury prevention | url = | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 263–64 | doi=10.1016/j.jen.2010.01.007| pmid = 20457328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a helmet has sustained an impact from falling, that part of the helmet is structurally weakened, even if no visible damage is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-exclusives/helmet-replacement-strategy.aspx|title=Helmet Replacement Strategy|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helmet manufacturers recommend that a helmet that has undergone impact from a fall be replaced immediately.

===Rules on helmet use in competition===

Many organizations mandate helmet use in competition or on show grounds, and rules have continually moved in the direction of requiring helmet use. In 2011, the United States Equestrian Federation passed a rule making helmet use mandatory while mounted on competition grounds at U.S. nationally rated eventing competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-news/2011/01/27/eventing-dressage-helmet-rule.aspx|title=New Helmet Rules for Eventing and Dressage Passed at USEF Convention|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, the United States Dressage Federation made helmet use in competition mandatory for all riders under 18 and all riders who are riding any test at Fourth Level and below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usef.org/_IFrames/RuleBook/Changes/2011.aspx|title=2011 Rule Changes|website=United States Equestrian Federation|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a rider competing at Prix St. Georges and above is also riding a test at Fourth Level or below, he or she must also wear a helmet at all times while mounted.

===Riding astride===
The idea that riding a horse astride could injure a woman's sex organs is a historic, but sometimes popular even today, misunderstanding or misconception, particularly that riding astride can damage the [[hymen]].&lt;ref name="pmid12346860"&gt;{{cite journal

==Criticism of horses in sport==
{{see also|Horse racing|Rodeo}}
Organized welfare groups, such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]], and [[animal rights]] groups such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], have been known to criticise some horse sports with claims of [[animal cruelty]].

[[Horse racing]] is a popular equestrian sport which is practiced in many nations around the world. It is inextricably associated with [[gambling]], where in certain events, stakes can become very high. Despite its illegality in most competitions, these conditions of extreme competitiveness can lead to the use of performing-enhancing drugs and extreme training techniques, which can result in negative side effects for the horses' well-being.
The races themselves have also proved dangerous to the horses – especially [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]], which requires the horse to jump hurdles whilst galloping at full speed. This can result in injury or death to the horse, as well as the jockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/705194.stm | work=BBC News | title=Should steeplechases be banned? | date=2000-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by animal welfare group [[Animal Aid]] revealed that approximately 375 racehorses die yearly, with 30% of these either during or as a result of injuries from a race.&lt;ref name="animalaid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/ALL/1665// |title=Bred To Death: Background Notes |publisher=Animal Aid |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510144228/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/ALL/1665// |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also highlighted the increasing frequency of race-related illnesses, including bleeding lungs (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) and gastric ulcers.&lt;ref name="animalaid" /&gt;

Animal rights groups are also primarily concerned that certain sports or training exercises may cause unnecessary pain or injuries to horse athletes. Some specific training or showing practices are so widely condemned that they have been made illegal at the national level and violations can incur criminal penalties. The most well-known is ''soring,'' a practice of applying a caustic ointment just above the hooves of a [[Tennessee Walking Horse]] to make it pick up its feet higher. However, in spite of a federal law in the United States prohibiting this practice and routine inspections of horse shows by inspectors from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], soring is still widespread and difficult to eliminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/lameness/soring_030706/|title=EQUUS Special Report: Why Soring Persists|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909111123/http://www.equisearch.com/article/soring_030706|archivedate=9 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some events themselves are also considered so abusive that they are banned in many countries. Among these are horse-tripping, a sport where riders chase and rope a loose-running horse by its front legs, throwing it to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idausa.org/facts/horsetripping.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315182541/http://www.idausa.org/facts/horsetripping.html |date=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary effects of racing have also recently been uncovered. A 2006 investigation by [[The Observer]] in the UK found that each year 6,000–10,000 horses are slaughtered for consumption abroad, a significant proportion of which are horses bred for racing.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/01/horseracing.sport | work=The Guardian | first=Antony | last=Barnett | title=The slaughtered horses that shame our racing | date=2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A boom in the number of foals bred has meant that there is not adequate resources to care for unwanted horses. Demand has increased for this massive breeding programme to be scaled back.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Despite over 1000 foals being produced annually by the Thoroughbred [[horse industry]], 66% of those bred for such a purpose were never entered into a race, and despite a life expectancy of 30 years, many are killed before their fifth birthday.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

== Horse riding on coinage ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:2003 Greece 10 Euro OS Horse Riding front.jpg|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Horse Riding commemorative coin]]]] --&gt;
Horse riding events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the €10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Horse Riding commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. On the composition of the obverse of this coin, the modern horseman is pictured as he jumps over an obstacle, while in the background the ancient horseman is inspired by a representation on a black-figure vase of the 5th century BC.

For the 2012 Olympics, the Royal Mint has produced a 50p coin showing a horse jumping a fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/shop/london_2012_50p_sports_collection_equestrian|title=London 2012 50p Sports Collection – Equestrian|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mounted rider from the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is featured on a 1973 Canadian quarter dollar coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdncoin.com/kb_results.asp?ID=39|title=1973 Canadian 25 Cent Mountie Quarter – Small Bust vs Large Bust|publisher=Canadian Coin &amp; Currency|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FLN football team''' (in {{lang-ar|[[Image:Loudspeaker.svg|12px|Lire|link=Media:Ar-FLN soccer team.oga]]&amp;nbsp; [[Media:Ar-FLN soccer team.oga|فريق جبهة التحرير الوطني لكرة القدم]]}},&lt;ref&gt;Pronunciation in Arabic is {{Audio|Ar-FLN soccer team.oga|''fariq jabhate al-taḥrir al-watani''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in {{lang-fr|Équipe du FLN de football}}), also known as ''Le onze de l'indépendance'' ({{lang-en|The eleven of the Independence}}) was a team made up mainly of professional players in France, who then joined the Algerian independence movement of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front (FLN)]], and assisted in organizing football matches against national football teams.

==History==
The team was founded on {{date|13-4-1958|en football}}.&lt;!-- In the infobox, the date of the first match is listed as June 1, 1957. this apparent inconsistency needs clarification. --&gt; The role of this team was primarily psychological, in order to show the [[Metropolitan France|French metropolitans]] that even professional footballers were involved in the cause, even to the extent of renouncing their status. The French authorities easily obtained the non-recognition of the team by FIFA. Despite the prohibition on play, the FLN team engaged in a world tour of about eighty meetings, including [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. These games were widely used by pro-independence propaganda. The team existed from [[1958 in association football|1958]] to [[1962 in association football|1962]], bequeathing its place in [[1963 in association football|1963]] to its legitimate successor, the [[Algeria national football team]].

'''Fallen Footwear''' is an american [[Skate shoe|skateboarding footwear]] and [[Clothing|apparel]] brand founded by professional [[skateboarder]] [[Jamie Thomas]] in 2003, after leaving [[Circa (company)|Circa]]. The company which was out of the market for almost two years (2016-2017) has now been acquired for a global re-launch by Town Connection, an investment group with its headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

==History==
In 2003, it was announced that Fallen Footwear would be manufactured and distributed by [[DC Shoes]] under license from Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Fallen Footwear is Born |publisher=ESPN |date=September 25, 2003 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1628368&amp;type=story |accessdate=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The agreement was canceled in 2005 after DC was acquired by [[Quiksilver]]. It was an amicable separation, and DC President Ken Block said that Fallen was "recognized as the top new emerging footwear brand in the skateboard industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=DC Parts With Stevie Williams, Fallen |publisher=ESPN |date=September 15, 2004 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1882093&amp;type=story|accessdate=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoes were sold and distributed through Thomas' [[Black Box Distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DA133EF937A15752C1A9609C8B63|title=Action Sports; In Board Sports, Insiders' Status Makes Gear Sell|last=Higgins|first=Matt|date=November 24, 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2016, Jamie Thomas announced on [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]] and its homepage that Fallen was disbanding operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BEEs3rSLiyF/ |title=Fallen Footwear on Instagram: "It is with a thankful &amp; humble heart that I announce that Spring 2016 will be Fallen Footwear’s last season. I would like to thank the past…" |website=Instagram |access-date=2016-04-12 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

January 1, 2018 was officially dated as the moment of Fallen's worldwide trademark acquirement{{Clarification|what does this mean?|date=March 2018}} by Town Connection while planning for a global re-launch sometime along this year. 

==Products==
Fallen was known for their shoes, flannel, hoodies, T-shirts, snapbacks, book bags, jeans/shorts, and skateboarding videos.
The more popular shoes are, "The Clipper", "The Patriot", "The Rival" ,"Trooper" and the "Forte".
At its peak, Fallen had 17 models in over 50 colors.

Since Spring 2016, Fallen no longer created products. In a note on Fallen's website, Jamie Thomas states that "The Fallen mission has always been to work with skateshops and support skateboarding with everything that we do. Unfortunately, this has become increasingly more difficult for skate shoe brands. Rather than waiver from this mission, we are choosing to bow out."&lt;ref&gt;https://fallenfootwear.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is sometime along this year (2018) that new owners plan to bring to the market the most expected brand classics with some added new styles. Apparel will also be available at selected territories.

==Films/videos==
In 2008, Fallen released a skate video titled "Ride the Sky". The video features Billy Marks, Brian Hansen, Chris Cole, Gilbert Crockett, James Hardy, Jamie Thomas, Josh Harmony, Matt Bennett, Tommy Sandoval, and Tony Cervantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://vimeo.com/18461636|title = Fallen "Ride The Sky"|date = 2008|accessdate = 2015-09-19|website = Vimeo|publisher = Vimeo|last = Insane|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallen began a documentary, "Roads Less Traveled".

==Team==
As of January 2015, the Fallen pro riders were [[Jamie Thomas]], Tommy Sandoval, Brian "Slash" Hansen, Dane Burman, Jon Dickson and Tony Cervantes.

In 2011, longtime rider Chris Cole left Fallen to skate for [[DC Shoes]]

FedExField was built as a replacement for the Redskins' prior venue, [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in Washington, D.C. In 1994 [[Jack Kent Cooke]] sought to build a new stadium on the grounds adjacent to [[Laurel Park Racecourse]] along [[Whiskey Bottom Road|Whiskey Bottom]] and Brock Bridge roads. Lack of parking facilities and support prompted a second site selection.&lt;ref&gt;Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke is seeking a special exception that would allow a $160 million National Football League stadium in an industrial zone east of Laurel in Anne Arundel County. The Redskins also hope for variances from county codes on matters such as parking and landscaping for the 78,600-seat stadium, Baltimore Sun, Aug 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium opened in 1997 as '''Jack Kent Cooke Stadium''', in honor of the recently deceased owner of the team, and the stadium site was known as [[Raljon, Maryland|Raljon]] from the first names of Cooke's sons – "Ralph" and "John". Notably, Cooke was able to register Raljon with the [[United States Postal Service]] as a legal alternate address for the 20785 [[zip code]] of [[Landover, Maryland]], where the stadium is located, and went to some lengths to require media to use Raljon in [[dateline]]s from the stadium.  This ended when [[Daniel Snyder]] bought the Redskins from the Cooke estate, and the Redskins now give the stadium's address as Landover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-08-20/news/9908200062_1_jack-kent-cooke-cooke-stadium-cooke-died | title=Goodbye to Raljon, and good riddance | publisher=Baltimore Sun | date=August 20, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FedExField Redskins fans.jpg|thumb|left|[[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] fans at FedExField in October 2003.]]
A special exit, Exit 16 (Arena Drive), was built from [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Interstate 495]], the Capital Beltway.

After Snyder's purchase, the stadium's naming rights were sold to [[FedEx]] in November 1999 for an average of $7.6 million per year. The waiting list for Redskins season tickets was reportedly over 160,000 names long.  However, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Redskins ticket office employees improperly sold tickets directly to ticket brokers for several years before the practice was discovered in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Grimaldi, James V. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/01/AR2009090103984_pf.html Washington Redskins Sold Brokers Tickets Despite Wait List]. [[The Washington Post]], 2009-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Redskins have never sold out the entire stadium, the team has not had a game [[NFL on television|blacked out on local television]] since 1972 (when home game broadcasts were banned outright) because it does not count "premium club level seating" when calculating sellouts (their sellout streak dates to 1965, eight years before the new blackout rules were implemented).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scarce Tactics: Just How Much Demand is There for Skins Tickets These Days?|first=Dave|last=McKenna|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=1961|newspaper=Washington City Paper|date=July 6, 2007|access-date=2009-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131034330/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=1961|archive-date=2010-01-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2010 Redskins fans set the NFL regular-season home paid attendance records. In 2005 the team drew a record 716,998 fans overall. The December 30, 2007, 27–6 win against the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] was the most watched game in Redskins history, with 90,910 fans in the stands to see Washington clinch a playoff spot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=33398 FedExField: New Single-Game Attendance Mark]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2000, the [[1999 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] defeated the [[1999 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] 27–13 in the first NFL playoff game at FedExField.  On December 29, 2002, the [[2002 Washington Redskins season|Redskins]] defeated the [[Cowboys–Redskins rivalry|rival]] [[2002 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], 20–14.  This game was [[Darrell Green]]'s final game.  He played 20 seasons with the Redskins. The game also broke a 10-game losing streak to the Cowboys.

The stadium has five levels – the Lower Level, the Club Level, the Lower and Upper Suite Levels, and the Upper Level.  The Lower, Club, and Upper Levels are all named after important figures of the Redskins, NFL, and [[Washington, D.C.]] area.  The Lower Level is officially named "[[George Preston Marshall]] Lower Level", The Club is named "[[Joe Gibbs]] Club Level, and The Upper Level is called "[[Pete Rozelle]] Upper Level."  The Suite Levels have 243 suite, lounge, and Owner's Club luxury boxes and 15,044 club seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redskins.studiotigaapps.net/media/67577/fedexfield.pdf FedExField is the premier stadium in the National Football League] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104004944/http://redskins.studiotigaapps.net/media/67577/fedexfield.pdf |date=2014-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Daniel Snyder purchased the Redskins, five rows of "Dream Seats" were installed in front of what had been the first row of the lower level, extending down almost to the level of the field.  Seats in the previous first row of the lower level were not tall enough to see over the players on the sidelines.

==Notable events==

===College football===
FedExField hosts the annual Prince George's Classic college football game, which is a game usually between two historically black universities. It has hosted several other college football games as well, including the 1998 game between the [[1998 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|University of Notre Dame]] and the [[Navy Midshipmen football|United States Naval Academy]]. the 2004 Black Coaches Association Classic between the [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California Trojans]] and the [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech Hokies]], and the [[Army–Navy Game|112th Army–Navy Game]].

===Soccer===
FedExField is not well known as a [[soccer]] venue, as [[D.C. United]] of [[Major League Soccer]] elected to remain at [[RFK Stadium]] after the new stadium's opening. They began playing at [[Audi Field]] within the city in 2018.

FedExField has been used for some international soccer matches — both for the United States and also for El Salvador. On March 28, 2015, Argentina defeated El Salvador at FedExField before a crowd of 53,978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/03/28/no-messi-but-argentina-is-still-too-much-for-el-salvador "No Messi, but Argentina is still too much for El Salvador"].&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 2014, the stadium hosted a doubleheader. Spain, the 2010 World Cup winner, defeated El Salvador 2–0 in a warm-up match in front of a crowd of 53,267 before the 2014 World Cup; in the other game of the doubleheader, D.C. United played Columbus Crew to a scoreless draw in D.C. United's first time hosting an MLS regular season game at FedExField.

It hosted four preliminary matches and one quarterfinal doubleheader in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1999|1999 Women's World Cup]]. On July 1, 1999, the [[United States women's national soccer team]] defeated the German women's national team 3–2 in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1999]] quarterfinals.

FedExField has also hosted a number of club soccer exhibition matches. During the July 2005 [[Football World Series|World Series of Football]], D.C. United hosted [[Chelsea F.C.]] there; the 31,473 spectators represented D.C. United's third-highest ever home attendance.  On August 9, 2009, D.C. United hosted another international friendly against [[Real Madrid]] at FedExField. On July 30, 2011, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] ended its 2011 summer tour with a 2–1 win over [[F.C. Barcelona]] at FedExField in front of 81,807 fans. This represented the largest soccer crowd in D.C.-area history.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} FedExField was used on July 29, 2014, in the [[2014 International Champions Cup|International Champions Cup]] as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] played [[Inter Milan]]; the game ended in a 0-0 draw and the shootout was won by Manchester United 5-3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationalchampionscup.com/news/?article_id=112 Man United defeats Inter in Shootout] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140806043515/http://internationalchampionscup.com/news/?article_id=112 |date=2014-08-06 }} ICC.com July 30, 2014 Retrieved July 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On July 26, 2017, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] played [[F.C. Barcelona]] again at the FedExField as part of [[2017 International Champions Cup|International Champions Cup]]. This time the Catalan club secured a narrow 1-0 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in front of 80,162 fans, with [[Neymar]]'s last goal for [[F.C. Barcelona]] being the difference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalchampionscup.com/matches/170 Barcelona	1 - 0 Manchester United] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728220101/http://www.internationalchampionscup.com/matches/170 |date=2017-07-28 }}, 26 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 2018, FedEx Field hosted a [[2018 International Champions Cup]] match between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Juventus]]. Real Madrid won 3-1.

FedExField is currently being considered as a [[2026 FIFA World Cup]] venue. It is currently up against 16 other venues around the United States, including [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]] in nearby [[Baltimore]]; the final list of 10 stadiums will be decided in 2020 or 2021.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/world-cup/news/world-cup-2026-what-are-the-host-cities-in-usa-mexico-and-canada-going-to-be/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and potential replacement==
Many fans feel FedExField does not compare favorably with [[RFK Stadium]]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'''s rankings of "NFL Fan Value Experience" rated FedExField 28th out of 31 NFL stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/10/29/fvi.redskins/|title=NFL Fan Value Experience: Washington Redskins|date=November 7, 2007|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Redskins owner [[Daniel Snyder]] was meeting with Washington, D.C., officials about building a new stadium in order to return the team to the District. There were also reportedly meetings with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.nbc12.com/decisionvirginia/2014/08/mcauliffe-and-snyder-have-met-to-discuss-redskins-stadium.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Next 2 D.C.

Problems were created when the design of the stadium was modified in an effort to maximize revenue.  Over the years, "party zones" requiring paid membership (such as the Touchdown Club and Tailgate Club) have sprouted on the concourse outside the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Next 2 D.C. Stadium Deals Might Smell a Bit McCartney|first=Robert|last=Fisher|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/miseries-of-attending-a-redskins-game/2013/01/05/ccf1bdc8-56d5-11e2-a613-ec8d394535c6_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 6, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Entrances adjacent to the "party zones" are no longer accessible to fans who do not purchase a "party zone" membership.  Installation of "Dream Seats" are another modification of the stadium that has increased revenue.  The original architect calculated the lowest possible height at which the first row could be set in order to still see the field over the players standing on the sideline.  In 2005, eight years after the stadium opened, 1,488 premium "dream seats" in three rows were added in front of what was the first row when the stadium was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/19/AR2005081901898.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Thomas | last=Heath | title=Redskins' Revenue Reaches $300 Million | date=August 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because some of these seats are too low to see over the players on the sideline, occupants of these seats stand in order to see the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeskins.com/showthread.php?369427-Fedex-Dream-Seats-question%26p%3D9123231%26viewfull%3D1#post9123231 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101033029/http://www.extremeskins.com/showthread.php?369427-Fedex-Dream-Seats-question&amp;p=9123231&amp;viewfull=1 |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 off-season, nearly 10,000 seats were removed from the upper deck to reduce capacity to around 83,000, making FedExField the second-largest venue in the NFL during the 2011 season.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; A Redskins team official admitted that the seats were removed due to lack of demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/FedEx-Field-official-Redskins-removed-seats-they-couldnt-sell.html FedExField Official: Redskins Removed Seats They Couldn't Sell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224330/http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/FedEx-Field-official-Redskins-removed-seats-they-couldnt-sell.html |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012 offseason, 4,000 additional seats were removed to make way for new suites and party decks and the stadium's capacity dropped to 79,000.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;  The seats that were removed permit the team to continue to sell out and avoid the NFL television black-out rule.  In December 2013, the Redskins set a record for the lowest announced attendance ever at FedExField with 56,247, most likely because of the team's poor record at the time and inclement weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/wp/2013/12/08/redskins-set-lowest-fedex-field-attendance-mark/ | work=The Washington Post | title=Redskins set lowest FedEx Field attendance mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance in the 2014 season averaged less than 78,000 per game, and never rose above 81,000. On June 1, 2015, ''The Washington Post'' reported that another 4,000 to 6,000 seats, primarily in the top eight rows of the upper decks, were tarped off using chain link fencing and tarps during the 2015 off-season. Team officials said the removals were made due to "season ticket holder feedback", and declined to say how exactly many seats had been removed.&lt;ref name=steinallen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Dan|last2=Allen|first2=Scott|title=For Third Time in Six Years, Redskins Remove Seats From FedEx Field|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/for-third-time-in-six-years-redskins-remove-seats-from-fedex-field/2015/06/01/555299d6-088a-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=June 1, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the stadium has made traveling to it through public transportation difficult and time-consuming. The stadium is about half a mile away from the [[Morgan Boulevard (WMATA station)|Morgan Boulevard]] station, the nearest [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station to the stadium.  Furthermore, federal regulations prohibit publicly paid shuttle service from public transit agencies as long as a private service is available. Since this method is not cost effective, fans taking public transportation must walk to and from the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-08-06/news/36778504_1_private-bus-shuttle-fedex-field | work=The Washington Post | first=Eric M. | last=Weiss | title=Metro Shuttle To FedEx Field Is Scuttled | date=August 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That trip usually takes as long as 20 minutes on most days.

More recently, the field had fallen under considerable criticism for the poor quality of the grass surface.  In 2013, the Redskins installed Latitude 36 sod and also installed a new drainage system along the sidelines.

'''Hillsborough Stadium''', often referred to as '''Hillsborough''', is a 39,732-capacity [[association football]] [[stadium]] located in [[Owlerton]], a north-western suburb of [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. It has been the home ground of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] since its opening in 1899.&lt;ref name="About Hillsborough"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hillsborough Stadium – About Hillsborough |url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/club/hillsborough_stadium/|publisher=Sheffield Wednesday Football Club|accessdate=20 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319052922/http://www.swfc.co.uk/club/hillsborough_stadium/|archivedate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ground has received little investment since it was built in 1899 it is still regarded as "a beautiful ground oozing character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/leagues/hillsborough-sheffield-wednesday.html |work= Football Ground Guide |title=Sheffield Wednesday |publisher=Duncan Adams |accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two large two-tiered stands and two large single-tiered stands, all of them covered. All four stands are of a similar capacity with the South Stand being the largest and the West Stand, usually housing the away supporters, the smallest.

On 15 April 1989, the ground was the scene of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in which 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans were crushed to death at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final. The subsequent [[Taylor Report]] into the disaster led to a series of safety improvements at the ground and other stadiums around the country, including the requirement for clubs in the top two divisions in England to have all-seater stadiums, and the withdrawal of perimeter fencing around the pitch.

Plans by the club to renovate the stadium and expand the capacity to 44,825 have been approved by [[Sheffield City Council]] with the aim of hosting [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids#England|World Cup]] matches. The playing surface has been recently upgraded to the [[Desso GrassMaster]] system, also including a complete replacement of the [[under-soil heating]] and drainage systems, while the scoreboard was replaced by a modern 'big screen' prior to the 2015-16 season. The stadium previously played host to [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] football in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] and [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]] respectively.

The stadium’s capacity has currently been temporarily reduced to 34,854 on safety grounds, although work is continuing to restore its maximum capacity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/sheffield-wednesday-club-announce-increase-in-stadium-capacity-ahead-of-steel-city-derby-1-8761985&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hillsborough Clock.JPG|thumb|right|The famous 124-year-old clock atop the current South Stand]]
During the [[1898–99 in English football|1898–99]] season Sheffield Wednesday were told that the land rented at Olive Grove would be needed for railway expansions.&lt;ref name="Wednesday!"&gt;{{harvnb|Farnsworth|1982|p=}}{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were allowed to remain there for the rest of that season but had to find a new ground for the next season. Several locations were considered but fell through for various reasons. An alternative was offered by the [[Midland Railway|Midland Railway Company]] but it did not meet the requirements of the club.

Finally James Willis Dixon of [[Hillsborough House]], owner of the Silversmiths James Dixon &amp; Sons, offered a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} site at Owlerton, a sparsely populated area of land to the northwest of the city. The land was part of the Hillsborough House estate which was being sold off by the Dixons. It was successfully bought for £5,000 plus costs. Soil was dumped at both ends of the ground to level out the ground which was initially meadowland covered with [[dandelion]]s. The 2,000 capacity stand at Olive Grove was then transported to the new site and was joined by a newly-built 3,000 capacity stand for the start of the next season.&lt;ref name="Football in Sheffield"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Percy|title=Football in Sheffield|publisher=S. Paul|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first match to be played was on 2 September 1899 against [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]]. The match was kicked off by the [[Lord Mayor of Sheffield]] [[William Clegg]], himself a former Wednesday player. It was a Chesterfield player, Herbert Munday, who scored the first goal at the new stadium but Wednesday came back to win the game 5–1. Despite the location of the ground several miles outside the city boundaries and a poor public transport service the new ground averaged 3,000 supporters for the first three months.&lt;ref name="Wednesday!" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Map Data"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pybus|first=Sylvia|title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps, Sheffield (Hillsborough) 1902 (Notes)|publisher=Ordnance Survey|year=1905|isbn=1-84151-939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
The ground was known as the ''Owlerton Stadium'' until 1914, when it was renamed ''Hillsborough'' to coincide with a series of ground improvements. The ground took its new name from the newly created parliamentary constituency.&lt;ref name="About Hillsborough"/&gt; The ground proved to be lucky for Wednesday with the first 8 years proving to be their most successful so far. They included their first league wins in the [[1902–03 in English football|1902–03]] and
[[1903–04 in English football|1903–04]]. This was followed by a second [[FA Cup]] in 1907.

The first FA Cup semi-final to be held at the stadium was a replay between [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 3 April 1912.&lt;ref name="Sheffield Football"&gt;{{harvnb|Farnsworth|1995|pages=}}{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crowd of 20,050 saw an extra time goal give West Brom the win. This was followed by its first international on 10 April 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farnsworth|1982|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; A match between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] was watched by 25,536. The game ended with England winning 5–4. The following two seasons saw Hillsborough host two more FA Cup semi-finals, both between [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farnsworth|1982|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowds for these matches were 43,320 and 49,282 respectively. The highest ever attendance was 72,841 on 17 February 1934 for an [[FA Cup]] 5th-round game against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

After the end of the [[1912–13 in English football|1912–13]] season a record profit was announced by the club.&lt;ref name="New Stand"&gt;{{harvnb|Farnsworth|1982|pages=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money was invested in a replacement for the Olive Grove stand on the south side of the stadium. The banking on the Spion Kop was also increased in size. The new south stand was completed in time for the first round of the FA Cup on 1 October 1913 against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. It cost £18,000 and included 5,600 seats plus terracing at the front. New offices, dressing rooms, refreshment rooms and a [[English billiards|billiard]] room were also part of the new stand. The second round tie went to a replay on 4 February 1914, which was held in front of a record home crowd of 43,000.&lt;ref name="New Stand" /&gt; However the match was remembered for the collapse of the new retaining wall at the Penistone Road end. It caused 70 injuries and caused the match to be suspended while the casualties were taken to the infirmary.

===Post war===
During the post war era Hillsborough rose to be one of the top stadia in the country. It hosted a total of 27 FA Cup semi-finals. In 1966, the stadium was selected as one of the venues for the [[Football World Cup]], hosting first round matches involving [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], and [[Spain national football team|Spain]], as well as a quarterfinal in which West Germany beat Uruguay 4–0.

Demolition of the North Stand began in 1960 and work began on a new £150,000 stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farnsworth|1982|pages=203–204, 211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new stand, designed by local firm Husband &amp; Co, was {{convert|360|ft|m}} in length. It was only the second stand in the country, after one at [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]'s [[Old Showground]], to be built with a cantilever roof and the first to run the full length of the pitch.&lt;ref name="North Stand"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'My Sheffield Jobs' North Stand|url=http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Hillsborough/0,,10304~1032659,00.html|publisher=FL Interactive|accessdate=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened on 23 August 1961 by [[Stanley Rous]], secretary of the Football Association. The 10,008 capacity all-seater stand almost doubled the [[seating capacity]] of Hillsborough from 9,000 to 16,000.

The ground held its first national cup final in 1977 when it played host to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] final replay. A crowd of 52,135 watched a 1–1 draw leading to another replay. At the end of the 1980s the ground held three successive FA Cup semis ending with the events that changed the nature of football grounds throughout the country.

===Hillsborough disaster===
{{Main|Hillsborough disaster}}
On 15 April 1989, the ground was the scene of the worst tragedy in [[Sport in England|English sporting history]] when [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] faced [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in an [[FA Cup]] semi-final. During the match, 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death. Official investigations into the disaster criticised Sheffield Wednesday for not acting upon previous incidents (especially the 1981 FA Cup semi-final) that had shown the potential for crushing at Hillsborough.&lt;ref name = "families"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19577033 |title=Hillsborough report: Key findings |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leppings Lane end of the ground did not hold a valid safety certificate; it had not been updated since 1979.&lt;ref name = "families"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/hillsborough-families-sheffield-wednesday-manslaughter-charge |first=David |last=Conn |title=Hillsborough families call for Sheffield Wednesday manslaughter inquiry |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=19 September 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations of the [[Taylor Report]] led to a series of improvements to safety at grounds across the United Kingdom. The terraces at Hillsborough were converted to all seated accommodation over the following four years, and the fences around the pitch were replaced with low safety-barricades to allow incursion onto the playing surface in case of emergency.

====Memorial====
Outside the ground, near the main entrance on Parkside Road, is a memorial to the 96 fans that lost their lives at Hillsborough in 1989, during the FA Cup Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The memorial was unveiled on the tenth anniversary of the tragedy, 15 April 1999. It reads: ''In memory of the 96 men, women, and children who tragically died and the countless people whose lives were changed forever. FA Cup semi-final Liverpool v Nottingham Forest. 15 April 1989. "You’ll never walk alone."'' The memorial suffered minor damage in the [[Hillsborough Stadium#Hillsborough flood|Hillsborough Flood]]; however, it was easily and swiftly repaired.

===All-seater era===
[[File:Hillsborough Stadium Plan.png|thumb|Plan of Hillsborough and the surrounding area]]

In 1996, Hillsborough was host to several fixtures at the [[Euro 96]] competition and in particular was host to the [[Denmark national football team|Danish squad]]. The [[Roligan|Danish fans]] endeared themselves to the local population with their fanatical support and exemplary behaviour, and were particularly popular amongst local landlords—a number of Sheffield public houses had to order emergency supplies of beer and cigarettes.

In 1997 Hillsborough hosted the [[1997 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]] replay between [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. It was won by Leicester by one goal to nil. Later the same year Middlesbrough returned to Hillsborough for an FA Cup semi-final replay in which they beat [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] by three goals to nil.

The record attendance since the ground was made all-seated was on 2 February 2000 in a [[Premier League]] game against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and was watched by 39,640 fans. In recent years average attendances at Hillsborough have remained high relative to the lower leagues they have participated in:

*[[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]]: 23,638 ([[Football League Championship]])
*[[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]]: 24,853 ([[Football League Championship]])
*[[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]]: 23,100 ([[Football League One]])
*[[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]]: 22,336 ([[Football League Second Division|Division Two]])

On 25 June 2007, the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]] burst its banks during a period of severe weather in the area and the whole ground was flooded with several feet of water.&lt;ref name = "flood"/&gt; Changing rooms, restaurants and kitchens, offices and superstore were all affected, with repairs costing millions of [[pound sterling|pounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2007/07/10/flood_damage_hillsborough_ground.shtml |title=Flood damage at Hillsborough |work=BBC Sheffield &amp; South Yorkshire |publisher=BBC |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clean-up effort took months, although Sheffield Wednesday fixtures were only slightly affected as the floods occurred in the close season.&lt;ref name = "flood"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-472901/Owls-blues-flood-damage.html |title=Owls get blues over flood damage |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial to the floods was unveiled on 25 June 2008 under the South Stand.

===North Stand===
[[File:Hillsborough-North-Stand-08--2-.jpg|left|thumb|The North Stand (Cantilever) at Hillsborough]]

*Original stand built: 1899–1903
*Current stand built:1960–61
*Capacity: 9,255 (seated)
*Current Sponsor (2017/19): Chansiri
The north stand is the third largest stand at the ground, running along the north side of the pitch.
The original North Stand was built between 1899 and 1903. It was unique at the time, as it had facilities for both men and women, and a slight semicircle which gave a good view of the pitch at any angle (though the supporting pillars did cause some obstruction). The area at the front of the stand was a grass bank until the early 1900s when it was made into a terrace. The stand was joined to the original North West Terrace until the late 1950s when the club decided to build a brand new stand. The current North Stand was opened in 1961. It is only the second football stand in Britain to have a [[cantilever]] roof. Hence some fans know it as "the cantilever". It was the first stand in the country to run the entire length of the pitch. The first cantilever stand in English football at [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United's]] Old Show Ground only covered the centre of the pitch. Following the formal opening of the stand in August 1961, a celebration match was played on 22 October 1961 when Wednesday met Santos of Brazil with their new star Pele in the team. Pele's goal helped Santos to a 4–2 win. When opened, the stand held 10,000 but the capacity has been reduced more recently to make room for spectators with disabilities and also to widen the exit aisles for safety. 

The architectural critic Sir [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] called the cantilever stand "interesting and unexpected".{{sfn|Pevsner|Radcliffe|1967|p=465}} This is the only mention of a football ground in his ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|Buildings of England]]'' series of architectural guides.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The opinion of [[Simon Inglis]], an historian of sports and architecture, is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is not a misplaced line in this remarkable stand. From any angle (it) is quite breathtaking. It is like an architect’s model of the dream stand of the future, a space age stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===West Stand (Leppings Lane End)===
[[File:Hillsborough West Stand.jpg|thumb|Hillsborough West Stand (Leppings Lane end)]]

*Original Stand built: about 1900
*Current Stand built: 1961–65
*Capacity: 6,658 (seated)
*Current Sponsor (2017/18): 
The West stand houses the visiting supporters at Hillsborough on match days. It is a two tier structure with 2,494 seats in the lower half, and 4,164 seats in the upper enclosure. The stand is adjoined to the North West Corner which is an overspill zone for away fans (1,337 seats), though in the match against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.]] (5-5-12), the West Stand was used by home fans while Wanderers fans used the North West Corner.
The original stand built at the turn of the century was a covered terrace housing up to 3,000 fans. In the 1920s this was joined by the North West terrace before the Leppings Lane stand was replaced by a 12,000 capacity partially covered terrace. Before the [[Football World Cup 1966|1966 World Cup]] the West Stand was demolished again and replaced by a two-tiered structure with 4,471 seats in the upper tier and retaining a [[wiktionary:terrace|terrace]] in front of the stand. 

After the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989 the lower tier terrace was closed for two years and its fencing covered with blue tarp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9IdRY7Yh4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=4580 |title=Sheffield Wednesday - The Official Review Of Barclays League Division One 1988-89 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the remainder of the 1988-89 season. The terrace remained out of use for 1989-90,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITN/1989/08/19/BSP190889012/?s=hillsborough |title=Hillsborough: Crowd Safety Measures: |publisher=Itnsource.com |date=19 August 1989 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its fences were removed entirely prior to the 1990–91 season. The terrace was converted to 2,294 seats and re-opened in time for the 1991–92 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dabgLweRFIs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=206 |title=Sheffield Wednesday - The Complete Story 1991-92 League Season |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North West Corner was the last section of the stand to be made all seated, adding another 1,337 seats to the structure. The old wooden seats in the upper tier were replaced with bigger plastic ones in 1997. During the 2012–13 season the first row of seats were removed from the lower tier, after an incident involving [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] supporters when a minor pitch invasion took place. In the summer of 2013 small gates were installed at the front of the gangways in order to keep fans at bay.

===South Stand===
[[File:Hillsborough South Stand.JPG|left|thumb|The South Stand starting to fill up for the last match of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season]]

*Original stand built: 1899–1903
*Current stand built: 1913–15
*Extended: 1995
*Total stand capacity: 11,352 (all-seater)
*Current Sponsor (2017/18): 
The largest stand at Hillsborough situated on the banks of the river Don. It has a large lower tier with 8,275 seats (including the directors box) and an upper tier known as the 'Grand Stand' with 3,077 seats. The nearest four blocks of seating to the east on the Upper tier are used as the club's Family enclosure. The first South Stand was first built at [[Olive Grove]], but moved with the club in the summer of 1899 to the new site at [[Owlerton]] where it was rebuilt brick by brick. The famous clock was also moved to Hillsborough. The modern stand, the oldest remaining stand at the ground, was built between 1913 and 1915 for a fee exceeding £17,000 to a design by [[Archibald Leitch]]. The stand had 5,600 seats as well as room for 11,000 standing fans. The clock was salvaged from the old stand and put on the new one. 

The modern stand has seen a series of improvements, the first being a conversion to an all-seated stand in 1965 ahead of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] and latest being a major £7&amp;nbsp;million re-development for the [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1996]] international competition when an upper tier ([[Grandstand]]) of 3,077 extra seats, a new roof, 30 executive boxes, two conference suites, a bar, a restaurant and a range of office space were added. Again, the famous clock was saved and put on the new stand. The South Stand is the most recognisable of the four stands at Hillsborough and still bears the original now-famous and easily recognisable clock face and [[finial]] from the very first stand, which was brought from Olive Grove. The stand houses the main reception, media and hospitality boxes, Press box, Television gantry, as well as the ground's family enclosure, five modern refreshment kiosks and four bars. It also features concourse television sets relaying live coverage of the match as well as highlights at [[half-time]]. The team changing room and dug-outs are also situated here.

===Spion Kop===
[[File:Hillsborough's Spion Kop stand.jpg|thumb|The large spion kop stand at Hillsborough]]

*Built: 1914
*Capacity: 11,210 (seated)
*Current Sponsor (2017/18): 
Named after a hill that was the scene of a famous battle in the [[Second Boer War]], the [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Spion Kop]] is built into a natural hill at the east end of the ground and houses the most vocal of Wednesday supporters. It is usually simply referred to by fans as '''The Kop'''. In 1914 concrete terracing was installed on the bank, which was further extended in 1927. The final expansion of the hill came in 1954. The stand remained open to the elements until a roof was added in 1986 after fans raised money to contribute to the cost. When the roof was added, the stand was 'squared' off to make it symmetrical so that the roof was used fully. Due to this, the Kop was extended, so the capacity rose from 16,000 to 22,000. 

After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, the stand's blue fences were at first retained. However, for the 1989-90 season, the gates allowing egress to the pitch were painted white and kept open throughout all matches, including the Steel City derby on 21 November 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEaDljXTuJs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=70 |title=Sheffield Wednesday - The Official Review Of Barclays League Division 1 - 1989/90 |publisher=YouTube |date=21 November 1989 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kop was the last part of the Wednesday ground to be converted to all-seater accommodation, the change finally coming in 1993 to comply with new [[FA Premier League]] regulations following the [[Taylor Report]]. The capacity was hence halved, but the Kop remains one of the largest single tier stands in Britain. A large [[concourse]] area was added in 2004, partially funded by the [[Wednesdayite|Owls Trust]].

===North West Corner===
[[File:Hillsborough-North-West-Terrace.jpg|left|thumb|The North-West Corner at Hillsborough]]

*Original stand built: 1919–20
*Current stand built: January 1965 – May 1966
*Current Sponsor: None
*Capacity: 0 
The North West Corner, or North West terrace as it is sometimes still referred to as, despite now being all seated is the only major section of the stadium to remain uncovered (the other area is the Kop Corner). The original North West Terrace was built between 1919 and 1920 to adjoin both the North Stand and West Stand, but was demolished in early 1965 and replaced in mid 1966, in time for the [[1966 World Cup]]. The terrace was not in use for two years, and seats were installed in 1991 along with the Leppings Lane terrace. The stand failed to gain a safety certificate for the 2007–08 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swfc.co.uk/page/Hillsborough/0,,10304~1032662,00.html "The Carlsberg West Stand"], SWFC.co.uk, Retrieved 17 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years it had only been used as overspill for away fans when both the upper and lower tiers of the West Stand have been filled, however in the 2011–12 season, with Wednesday needing to better or match the result of their neighbours to gain promotion on the final day of the season, the Corner was opened to visiting Wycombe Wanderers fans, with the West Stand used by home supporters. Whilst not being used for seating, the Corner has recently been used as extra advertising space, with advertising boards on the back wall, and more recently a large 'My Sheffield Jobs' seat covering appearing alongside their sponsorship of the North Stand. It is sponsored by Handley Brown. This corner is to be roofed, under the Hillsborough stadium Upgrade plans, yet no work has yet been done, due to owners of the nearby terraces complaining. This corner is commonly nicknamed the 'Crows Nest' by Wednesdayites.The corner is still unable to gain a safety certificate and remains unused by fans. Television company Sky use the corner for their temporary studios and technical area for televised games.

===Kop Corner===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Kop Corner at Hillsborough.png|thumb|The Kop Corner at Hillsborough]] --&gt;

*Built: 1986
*Sponsored by (2017/18):
*Capacity: 400 (Though this 400 is included in the overall Spion Kop capacity of 11,210)
The Kop Corner is a small filling section which is adjoined to the Main Spion Kop. It is the second largest area of the ground to remain uncovered, after the North West Corner. This corner is usually just referred to as part of the Spion Kop, as is its capacity, and it is rare to see it referred to as a separate area. The Kop Corner was a lot larger before the installation of the Spion Kop roof in 1986, but a crane was needed to lift the roof, and the Kop Corner was destroyed so the crane could get in. Part of the corner was rebuilt, which is the present day area. Seats were installed in 1993 to correspond with the Taylor report, as was the rest of the Kop. This area was to be extended, and fully filled in under Sheffield Wednesday's ground renovation plans. The corner is well known amongst Wednesdayites as the location of Paul Gregory, aka 'Tango Man' on match days, along with his 'Wolverhampton Owls' flag and is often referred to as 'Tango's corner' by the Wednesdayites.

===South West Corner (Stadium Control area)===
[[File:Hillsborough scoreboard.jpg|thumb|The Hillsborough scoreboard, showed displaying the "T-fault"]]
The stadium control area is in the southwest area of the ground, between the South and West stands. The most dominant feature is the video scoreboard. The current scoreboard was installed in May 2015 and replaced an older electronic dot-matrix style electronic scoreboard.

The old electronic scoreboard was one of the first electric scoreboards in an English football ground, installed in 1991 in time for the 1991–92 season. For the majority of the match, this showed the score and time, but as of the 2011–12 season, the board showed advertisements every few minutes. Before and after the match, information like team line-ups, fixtures, and other results were shown. The scoreboard had become somewhat of a cult icon of Hillsborough Stadium and Sheffield Wednesday as a whole, loved by the fans for its retro looks and "T-fault", where a series of lights making a T shape light up between animations due to a wiring fault, which had not been fixed on purpose by the club both as a joke and also because of its love by the fans. One of the most popular "T-fault" situations was when announcing the score of fierce rivals Sheffield United - the scoreboard displayed "Shhhhhhhh...", then, after a brief pause, "T", and only then did it announce the score.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Below the scoreboard is the stadium control building, where all the technical aspects of the stadium are controlled (e.g. lighting, announcements, CCTV). At the base of the area is a very small section of disused terrace, which has still not been converted to seating. It is only used as a congregation area for the police and stewards, and has not held fans since the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.

===Owls Megastore and Ticket Office===
The '''Owls Megastore''' is the official Sheffield Wednesday club shop, underneath the North Stand. It sells all the merchandise, and also the tickets for matchdays. It and the neighbouring ticket office were severely damaged in the Hillsborough Flood. The wall separating the ticket office and club shop was subsequently demolished, and a much larger Owls Megastore opened a few months later, with the ticket office now in one of the corners of the shop. Before the re-development, the Owls Megastore was two storey, but it has now been changed to one.

===Hillsborough Stadium Footbridge===
[[File:Hillsborough - Stadium footbridge.JPG|thumb|top|right|Hillsborough Stadium Footbridge]]
A bridge was built across the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]] in 1996, to provide access to the refurbished South Stand, ahead of Euro 96. It connects Parkside Road and the surrounding area to the main entrance to Hillsborough Stadium.

===Dooley's Restaurant, Sheridan Suite, and other south stand internal facilities===
Several restaurants, such as Dooley's and the Sheridan Suite, are under the south stand. Other areas include the 1867 Lounge, various bars, and a wide range of office space. Board rooms, meeting halls and business suites are also here.

The stadium is located in the north west of the city roughly three miles from the city centre.&lt;ref name="Directions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directions To Hillsborough|url=http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Hillsborough/0,,10304~1032964,00.html|publisher=SWFC.co.uk|accessdate=12 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is mainly residential with a number of shops and a shopping centre located at nearby Hillsborough Corner. Views of the area can be enjoyed from hills located to the west.

The stadium is sandwiched between [[Hillsborough Park]] to the south and terrace housing to the north. The [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]] also runs alongside the stadium to the south. The Spion Kop backs straight onto Penistone Road, a major dual carriageway leading to the city centre, while there is some space between the West Stand and Leppings Lane.

==Upgrade works==
===2017===
Sheffield Wednesday did not secure promotion to the [[The Premier League|Premier League]] in the 2015/16 season, and so some of the long-term upgrade plans have been delayed. However in July 2017 some upgrade and improvement works commenced with completion before the first league home game in August 2017:
* Increase in the congregation area at the rear of the Kop
* Installation of a new bar at the rear of the Kop
* New printed banner over the Leppings Lane face of the West Stand
* New fire suppression systems in all concourse Kiosk
* LED Perimeter boards
During the 2015/6 season the club installed a completely new [[Point of sale|EPOS]] system on the concourses

===Future plans===
Sheffield Wednesday announced in the summer of 2009 plans for a £22&amp;nbsp;million upgrade of the stadium and an increase in capacity to 44,825 from the current 39,732 with no viewing restrictions. These plans were to be completed by 2013 and would bring the stadium up to [[FIFA]] standards for hosting [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] matches.

For reference, the details of the plans are as follows:

*Removing the current pillars that support the roof of the Kop and installing an 'iconic' roof structure
*Adding a corner between North Stand and the Kop with a medium-sized round hole underneath the seats to let wind get onto the pitch
*Adding a roof to the North-West Corner
*Removing the pillars and roof from the West Stand and replacing the roof
*Removing the present tier on the West Stand so that the inclination of the present day upper tier continues to pitch level
*Adding a new tier above the present upper tier on the West Stand with a 'new specific learning zone' between the new upper tier and present upper tier
*Renovation of the exterior appearance of the West Stand
*Demolition of the mega-store and gymnasium behind the North Stand
*The extension of the North Stand to create the 'biggest classroom in Europe' as well as 'enterprise zones' and 17 boxes

==Records==
The highest attendance recorded at Hillsborough was in the [[FA Cup]] fifth round on 17 February 1934. A total of 72,841 turned up to see a 2–2 draw with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref name="clubrecords"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest attendance recorded since work to convert the stadium to an all-seater venue was completed in 1993 was for a [[Premier League]] match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 2 February 2000. The game was watched by 39,640 fans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The lowest average attendance at Hillsborough came in the first season after its opening ([[1899–00 in English football|1899–00]]) when each game was attended by an average crowd of just 6,800 fans, mainly because the new stadium, then called ''Owlerton Stadium'', was a fraction of the size it is today.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The largest gate receipts taken from a match at Hillsborough was for the [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] game between [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] on 19 June 1996.

Hillsborough still holds the record for the highest attendance for a third tier football match in Britain. 49,309 spectators turned up on 26 December 1979, one of the most memorable days in SWFC history, when the Owls beat Sheffield United 4–0 in a top of the table clash, now known as the Boxing Day Massacre.

The largest receipts for a club game at Hillsborough were for the [[FA Cup]] semi-final replay between [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 22 April 1997 and totalled £680,965.&lt;ref name="clubrecords"/&gt; The game was watched by 30,339 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Jack Jumping''', also known as '''Skibock''' in [[Europe]], is an [[action sport]] that involves descending a slope that is covered with snow on a Jackjumper.  The Jackjumper is a [[skiing]] device with a bench seat attached to a ski. The seat may be solidly mounted with a post, or sprung mounted with a [[Shock absorber|shock-absorbing]] device. The origins of Jack Jumping, as well as its name, remain a mystery.  The earliest Jackjumpers date to the mid- to late 1800s. Early [[patent]]s for Jackjumpers were granted in the 1920s and the 1930s.  Jackjumpers in the US, and Skibocks in Europe, are used today for both sport and [[recreation]].  There are numerous competitive events scheduled each year on both continents.&lt;ref name=vermont&gt;[http://www.visitvermont.com/events/item/jack-jump-world-championships jack-jump world championships]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest Jackjumpers were made in [[New England]] in the mid- to late 1800s.  While many early Jackjumpers were homemade, Jackjumpers that were manufactured in the late 1800s can be found in museums and private collections.
The oldest patent issued for a Jackjumper goes back to 1914. The first European patent was registered in 1929 in the [[Federal Institute of Intellectual Property]] ([[Switzerland]]).
There are many legends as to the origins of Jack Jumping.  Some claim the earliest ones were made from barrel staves for skis and handcrafted wooden posts and seats. These Jackjumpers are said to be used by [[Lumberjack|loggers]].  Others say is originated as a toy for children to enjoy in the winter. Whatever the case of origin, both adults and children alike have enjoyed Jackjumpers for over a century.
[[File:Jack jumpers.jpg|thumb|Antique Jack Jumpers]]

==Competition events==

Most Jackjumper competitions, such as the Jack Jump World Championships held at [[Mount Snow]], [[Vermont]] each year are downhill [[:wikt:slalom|slalom]] racing. Slalom Jackjumping is similar to [[slalom skiing]].  Participants complete on downhill race course constructed by laying out a series of gates.  In slalom competitions, two Jackjumpers race downhill through sets of gates to the finish line.&lt;ref name=vermont/&gt;

In Europe The first Skibock World Championship took place on TschentenAlp on 19 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelboden.ch Adelboden.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eaglebrook School]] in [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield, MA]] has been holding Jackjumping races at their Winter Carnival for over eighty years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaglebrook.org/podium/default.aspx?t=204&amp;bl=javascript:history.go(-1);&amp;nid=510923 Eaglebrook School]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Frame''' (1733 at [[Warlingham]], [[Surrey]] – 11 October 1796 probably at [[Dartford]], [[Kent]]) was an English [[cricket]]er and arguably the first great fast bowler in the game's history.  His first-class career spanned the [[1749 English cricket season|1749]] to [[1774 English cricket season]]s.

He was described by [[John Nyren]] as one of the [[Hambledon Club]]’s greatest opponents and as "the other principal with Lumpy" (i.e., [[Edward "Lumpy" Stevens]]).  Nyren says he remembers little of Frame, except that he was an unusually stout man for a cricketer.&lt;ref name=JN&gt;[[Ashley Mote]], ''John Nyren's "The Cricketers of my Time"'', Robson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Frame was only 16 when he first played in an [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] on Friday 2 &amp; Saturday 3 June 1749 for [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] v [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] at [[Dartford Brent]].  Surrey won by 2 wickets.&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1750, he played for Surrey in three matches against Kent and [[Frame (Surrey cricketer)|his brother]] was in the same team each time.&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt;

Frame moved to Dartford while still a young man and was chiefly associated with [[Dartford Cricket Club]] and the [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent county team]].&lt;ref name=LL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1746.html |title=From Lads to Lord's – profile |accessdate=2011-06-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153251/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1746.html#frame |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last known top-class appearance was for [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] v [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] at [[Vine Cricket Ground|Sevenoaks Vine]] on Friday 8 &amp; Saturday 9 July 1774.  Hampshire, who had [[Edward "Lumpy" Stevens|Lumpy]] as a given man, won by 169 runs.&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826)'', Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground is the home of the football clubs [[SK Sturm Graz]] and [[Grazer AK]].

==History==
Originally, the stadium was named after [[bodybuilder]], actor and former [[Governor of California|governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who was born near [[Graz]]. It was built from 2000 to early 2001 and is owned by ''Stadion Liebenau Betriebs GmbH''. It opened with the game [[Grazer AK]] vs. [[SK Sturm Graz]] on 9 July 1997 (0:4).

In December 2005, when Schwarzenegger did not stop the [[execution]] of [[Stanley Tookie Williams]], an intense discussion in his hometown began about what to do with the stadium that bore his name. After some days, Schwarzenegger revoked the city of Graz's right to the use of his name, ending the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schwarzenegger in Austrian spat|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4544798.stm|accessdate=22 April 2017|work=BBC News|date=20 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 26 December 2005 the name was removed from the stadium.&lt;ref name="Name change"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/international/europe/26cnd-austria.html |title=Hometown Snubs Schwarzenegger Over Death Penalty |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-12-27 |accessdate=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining part '''Stadion Graz-Liebenau''' was removed on 17 February 2006 and on 18 February 2006 the stadium was renamed to UPC-Arena. In March 2016 the Austrian insurance company Merkur Versicherung secured the rights to bear a name and the stadium was renamed to '''Merkur-Arena'''.

== Facts ==
The Merkur-Arena has an official capacity of 15,400 in 27 sectors. The away fans are normally in sector 8, which has a capacity of about 750. When more away fans are expected, sector 9 with about 750 seats is also given to the away team and sometimes even also sector 10. At [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] games of the [[SK Sturm Graz]], some additional platforms were built so that the stadium had a capacity of 16,000 spectators. Furthermore, the stadium has a [[wheelchair]] area.
The first game in the "new" '''UPC-Arena''' was the 125th derby between [[SK Sturm Graz]] and [[Grazer AK]] (4:0).
The field equipped with a lawn heating has a size of 105 x 68 metres.

The stadium hosted a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 7|World Cup qualifier]] between [[Austrian national football team|Austria]] and [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] on 5 September 2009 which ended in 3–1 victory for the home team. It also hosted an international friendly between [[England National Football Team|England]] and [[Japanese national football team|Japan]] on 30 May 2010. England had been training in Irdning, a small village in the [[Austrian Alps]], in preparation for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. The match ended 2–1 to England, courtesy of two [[own goal]]s by Japan.

'''St Mirren Park''', more commonly known as '''Love Street''', was a [[association football|football]] stadium located on Love Street in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], [[Scotland]]. At one time the stadium was capable of accommodating almost 50,000 spectators, however in its final years it had an all-seated capacity of 10,800. Until its closure in 2009, it was the home ground of [[St Mirren F.C.]].

The football grounds on Love Street were registered as '''Fullerton Park''' for St Mirren's first season there as they were originally rented from a Mr Fullerton. The ground's record attendance was 47,438 for a match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 1949. St Mirren completed construction of their new [[St Mirren Park]] in December 2008. St Mirren played their last game at Love Street, against [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], on 3 January 2009.

==Early years at Love Street==
When [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] began to play on Love Street in the mid-1890s football clubs were still very much in their infancy and moved from ground to ground renting from local landowners. The best deal available was commonly a ten-year lease and by the time St Mirren arrived at Love Street, the club was only 17 years old and playing on its fifth rented ground. They had previously played on four sites in the north of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]; Shortroods Estate (1877 to 1878), Abingdon Park (1878 to 1879), Thistle Park, Greenhill Road (1879 to 1882), and [[Westmarch (stadium)|Westmarch Estate]], Greenhill Road (1882 to 1894).&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt; Paisley clubs [[Abercorn F.C.|Abercorn]], who played at [[Underwood Park, Paisley|Underwood Park]], and St Mirren joined the [[Scottish Football League]] when it started in [[1890–91 in Scottish football|1890–91]].&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt;

[[File:Mainstand.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Old Main Stand]]

Following twelve years playing at Westmarch, St Mirren moved in 1894 in response to a 100% rent increase by the landlord who appeared to have lost interest in hosting football on his land. The club found a former brickworks at the foot of Love Street which could be rented for an initial ten years on reasonable terms. The land at [[Westmarch (stadium)|Westmarch]] had been laid out with two pitches, a grandstand and pavilion; the Love Street site was substantially smaller, barely wide enough to lay a [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] with some spare ground behind the [[Association football pitch#Goals|goals]]; it was poorly drained and without grass. However, it would give St Mirren the significant advantage of being nearer to Paisley town centre than any of the other football clubs in the town. Furthermore, the site was already well known to the townsfolk as an entertainment venue, as it was where travelling [[circus]]es set up their [[Big top (circus)|Big Top]].

The original Love Street site housed the re-built club pavilion behind the Love Street end goal, and a new grandstand, squeezed along the full length of the pitch with five rows of seats and a total capacity of 1,000. St Mirren played their first home game at Love Street, a 3–0 defeat to Celtic, on 8 September 1894.

Shortly after the original ten-year lease ran out, the club was almost forced to move away from Love Street, much as it had already been from [[Westmarch (stadium)|Westmarch]]. With the club approaching Mr Fullerton with an offer to buy the site, the landowner tried to take advantage of the situation by setting a lofty price, together with an ultimatum to either buy or face a hefty increase in rent. The club hastily looked for alternatives, and began negotiations with the owners of the Shortroods Estate where St Mirren had played for its first season. However, with the prospect of losing out altogether, Mr Fullerton backed down, reducing his asking price to £3,900 and thus Saints purchased and stayed at Love Street.&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt;

Over the course of the next fifteen years the club’s aim was to expand the site by buying the land that bordered on two sides – towards the town and round onto Greenock Road. However, it was not until 1920 that the land was finally secured and St Mirren owned pretty much the site that it occupied through to its closure.

==Development of Love Street==
With a large site now owned, and the football pitch about to be moved 40 yards towards the town, the club had plans in 1921 for a 60,000 capacity ground with a large oval sweep of earth embankments on three sides, with the fourth side taken up by a 4,500 seater [[grandstand]] set up above a 3,000 capacity [[Terrace (stadium)|terraced enclosure]], with a 440-yard [[Track and field athletics|running track]] round the pitch. However, before building began, the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom]] tightened its grip and costs more than doubled in the space of six months.

The part of the project to suffer most was the grandstand as the final price of the stadium rose from an estimate of £17,500, for the full plans, to around £30,000 for the scaled-down version that was completed six months later. The grandstand was reduced in size by almost two-thirds with the steel framework clad in corrugated sheeting to further reduce costs. The St Mirren Directors' intention was to eventually complete the original plans for a full-length grandstand on Love Street in stages as funds permitted, however this did not materialise.

After 1921 there were no major changes to the grounds until the late 1950s when the North Bank was covered and [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] installed. Twenty years later new floodlight pylons were installed and plans appeared for redeveloping St Mirren Park as an [[all-seater stadium]]. There was also talk of incorporating airport car-parking, or a hotel, or commercial office space.

Love Street became a designated ground under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act in 1977, which prompted the local government to demand alterations.&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt; In the summer of 1979, the Love Street End terracing was knocked down and rebuilt ten yards from the goal. There was more talk of covering the new family enclosure at Cairter’s Corner and installing a stadium clock and even one suggestion to re-locate in [[Renfrew District]] Council’s proposed £200 million national stadium planned for a site across the railway line from Greenhill Road.

With the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) preferring to redevelop [[Hampden Park]], St Mirren remained at Love Street and seats were installed on the North Bank terrace in 1991.&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt; Four years later, after the owner of a large building company had joined the club's [[board of directors]], the 3,015 seat Caledonia Stand was built in a deal that saw some of the club’s land sold for development as housing.&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt; There were also plans to have a similar stand built at the Love Street End but the bottom fell out of the construction industry and there was the near closure of St Mirren in 1998.

St Mirren won the [[1999–2000 Scottish First Division]] and were promoted to the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL) as [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] champions. In order to meet SPL regulations in their first season in the top flight, the club had to carry out further work on the stadium, installing seating on the Love Street terrace.&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
{{wide image|Love Street Stadium, Paisley, Scotland.jpg|1000px|alt=View from the old family end corner at Love Street|View from the old family end corner at Love Street}}

==The stands==
At the time of the stadium closing, the 1921 main stand remained situated on the southern (town) side of the stadium. The largest stand was the West Stand (Caledonia Street), which housed away fans. The North Bank stand was sponsored by former shirt-sponsors [[LDV Group|LDV]] and was where the most vocal home fans usually sat. The most recently built stand, the East Stand, or [[Reid Kerr College]] Stand, was on the Love Street side of the stadium and became used as the home support's Family Stand .

==Floodlights==
In the 1950s the club had a unique problem when it came to installing floodlights at Love Street. The ground was on the direct approach path for [[aircraft]] to the [[Glasgow International Airport#History|local airport]] which, at that time, was a mere three miles east, in [[Renfrew]]. This meant that as well involving Paisley Town Council, Saints’ plans also had to satisfy three [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]] departments - the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Civil Aviation]], the [[Air Ministry]] and The [[Admiralty]].

Initially there were roof-line lights set all the way along the newly built North Bank cover and the grandstand opposite. But, because the stand was considerably shorter than full-length there also had to be two pylons built to light the corners of the pitch on the stand side. And these could not be very tall because of the flight-path. They ended up therefore as two, strangely squat-looking, 40-foot pylons that weren’t even as tall as the stand roof and had three rows of lights .

Nonetheless, there came complaints from pilots that the pylon to the right of the stand was confusing their approach and a black-out order was imposed whilst aviation charts had this new landmark added. It then took a further eight months for the Air Ministry to run tests and finally pass the system fit for use. The first match under the floodlights was on 13 February 1959 against [[Peebles Rovers F.C.|Peebles Rovers]] in the [[Scottish Cup]], a match St Mirren won 10–0.&lt;ref name = "inglis474"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the airport was moved to less than a mile north of St Mirren Park and its current site in Abbotsinch, Paisley; later becoming known as [[Glasgow International Airport]]. Almost immediately the club was being asked by the media when they would install "proper" floodlights, as the system was not highly regarded. Club finances at the time were extremely tight, with only two full-time employees, and so there was no possibility that money could be spent on improving the floodlights.

It took until 1978, with a new set of Directors at the helm and a Development Fund put in motion that 90-foot high pylons were erected.

==Under-soil heating==
One of the criteria for admittance to the SPL, following promotion in the 2005–06 season, was that the pitch was equipped with [[under-soil heating]]. As the club was already planning to move to a new site, it was faced with installing an expensive heating system that might only be used for one season, a financial burden they would struggle to meet. The Directors considered requesting a period of grace from the SPL, but in the end decided to go ahead with installing the system.&lt;ref name="bbc4948310"&gt;

==Move to new stadium==
{{main|St Mirren Park}}
On 16 August 2005 the [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]] and [[Renfrewshire Council]] granted permission for the club to sell Love Street for [[supermarket]] development and allow the club to build a new stadium in Greenhill Road, [[Ferguslie Park]], Paisley. The sale of their old ground financed the new stadium and cleared the financial debts of the club. In April 2007 it was announced that a deal had been struck with [[Tesco]]. Under this deal Tesco would pay for the construction of the new [[St Mirren Park]], an 8,000 seat stadium. Work on the new ground started on 9 January 2008.

The last match to be played at Love Street, a goalless draw between St Mirren and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], took place before a sell-out crowd on 3 January 2009. The club officially moved into the new St Mirren Park on Wednesday 21 January 2009. The local authorities subsequently refused planning permission for a supermarket on the Love Street site.&lt;ref name = "housing"/&gt; As of February 2012, it is planned to be used for housing.&lt;ref name = "housing"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2012/02/13/site-of-new-tesco-in-paisley-close-to-being-cleared-87085-30307761/ |title=Site of new Tesco in Paisley close to being cleared |first=Alison |last=Rennie |work=Paisley Daily Express |publisher=Scottish &amp; Universal Newspapers |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance records==
St Mirren played in five Scottish Cup semi-finals at home on the original Love Street Grounds. Crowds regularly reached 10,000 and peaked at 16,000 for the 1906 semi-final clash with [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]]. Following the ground's redevelopment, a visit of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in the 1923–24 Scottish Cup took the ground attendance record above 40,000 for the first time and twelve months later Celtic came to Love Street and the attendance record rose to 47,428.

During the post-[[World War II]] boom in attendances, the record was broken again on 20 August 1949 with another visit by Celtic, this time in a [[Scottish League Cup]] match in front of a crowd of 47,438.&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt;

Once the Love Street End had been squared off, the capacity fell and the largest crowd was another visit of Celtic in the [[1979–80 Scottish Cup]] [[Scottish Cup 1979-80#Fourth round|fourth round replay]] when 27,166 squeezed inside, leaving huge queues on Love Street locked out.

At the time of closure, the all-seated capacity was 10,800. The highest attendance under that capacity was 10,261 for an SPL game against [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]].

==Other football matches at Love Street==
St Mirren hosted a [[Women's association football|women's football]] match at Love Street in 1895. The ground has been a regular venue for schoolboy internationals, [[Scottish Junior Cup]] semi-finals, and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland Under-21]] internationals. In 1904 the [[Scottish Football League]] played the [[Irish Football League]] in front of 10,000 fans.

In 1923, 25,000 fans watched [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] played [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in the [[British Home Championship]]. Local rivals [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]] played their home games at Love Street for part of 1949. The deal was that St Mirren got to keep the stand and enclosure takings from the games. Morton also played a Scottish Cup tie against Rangers at Love Street in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/643311.stm|title=Cup tie court battle continues|publisher=BBC News|date=16 February 2000|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, it was used as a venue for one match in the [[UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]] hosted by Scotland.

==Other sports at Love Street==
St Mirren was a Football and Athletic Club until 1905 and annual sports such as [[running#Running as a sport|running]] and [[Bicycle racing|cycling]] events would have been a feature of the summer months. It is known that there was a Scottish Inter-Region [[rugby union]] match played there in 1897 and at least one dog handicap race run around the track in the early years of the 20th century.

St Mirren tried to introduce [[greyhound racing]] on a regular basis in the early 1930s,&lt;ref name = "inglis474"/&gt; and spent money on upgrading the track. The first meeting was held on 14 October 1932 and the track was independent (unlicensed). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =420|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only three weeks after the first race the SFA declared a ban on greyhound racing at football grounds and the club lost money on the venture. When the ban was lifted, and St Mirren was approached to resume racing, the club declined.

In 1938, a World Title [[Flyweight]] [[boxing]] match was scheduled to take place at the stadium involving Scotland’s first-ever world champion boxer [[Benny Lynch]]. Again money was spent with an anticipated pay-back from a 30,000 crowd. The event turned sour when Lynch was stripped of his title in the days before the fight for failing by a large margin to make the weight. It went ahead as a non-title bout but Lynch’s fans felt badly let down and the turnout was poor.

[[Paisley Lions]] [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] team raced in the [[Speedway British League Division Two|British National Speedway League]] at Love Street for two seasons in 1975 and 1976. The first meeting was held on 5 April 1975 in front of a crowd of over 6,000.&lt;ref name="HBS"&gt;{{cite book

'''Mile One Centre''' is an indoor arena and entertainment venue located in [[Downtown St. John's|downtown]] [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada. The arena opened in May 2001, as '''Mile One Stadium''', replacing [[Memorial Stadium (St. John's)|Memorial Stadium]]. The centre's name comes from it being located at the beginning of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. At full capacity the arena can seat 7,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big Night Planned to Celebrate Opening of Mile One Stadium|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2001/04/17/nf_mile170401.html|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=April 7, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The arena is the home of the [[St. John's Edge]] of the [[National Basketball League of Canada]] and the [[Newfoundland Growlers]] of the [[ECHL]]. 

==Naming rights==
Though the centre's name is often assumed to be a generic name based solely on the building's location, Mile One Centre is in fact among the many North American sports venues that have raised funds by selling their [[naming rights]]. In the case of Mile One, [[brewing company]] [[Molson]] initially acquired the naming rights for 10 years (2001-2011), as well as other privileges such as being the venue's exclusive beer supplier, for $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsvenues.com/pdf/names.pdf Revenues From Sports Venues - Naming Rights], retrieved August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Molson then resold the naming rights to [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]], then-owner of [[Cable Atlantic]] (and later [[premier of Newfoundland and Labrador]]), for $600,000. Before the centre opened, however, Williams sold Cable Atlantic to [[Rogers Communications]] in order to pursue politics, but retained the naming rights personally. Ultimately Williams chose to name the centre based on the venue's geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Venue's Name Game Takes New Twist|first=Don|last=Muret|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4568492-1.html|work=Amusement Business|date=April 9, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mile One" is a [[trademark]] owned by the Williams family's charitable foundation, not the city, meaning that the centre can only use the "Mile One" name so long as it has the family's permission to do so. This implies that if and when Williams's rights expire and are not renewed, the centre might be forced to find a new name, regardless of whether or not a new sponsor is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canadian Trade-Mark Data: application no. 1084108|url=http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do?lang=eng&amp;status=&amp;fileNumber=1084108&amp;extension=0&amp;startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1|publisher=[[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hockey==
[[File:AHL (12491532913).jpg|thumb|left|Interior of Mile One Centre]]
The building was originally home to the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] of the [[American Hockey League]]. The Leafs played out of the centre from 2001–2005 before relocating to [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] to become the [[Toronto Marlies]]. [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] (MLSE) stated that the relocation was necessary to better monitor prospects for the co-owned [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baby Leafs to Leave St. John's After 14 Seasons|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2004/08/09/babyleafs040809.html|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=August 10, 2004|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Craig Dobbin|The Dobbin family]] were granted an expansion [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) franchise in 2004 to be later named the [[St. John's Fog Devils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saint John, St. John's Awarded QMJHL Franchises|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/12/01/qmjhlexpansion041201.html|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=December 1, 2004|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fog Devils began playing at Mile One Centre in 2005. However, the Fog Devils would relocate to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], after three seasons in St. John's to become the [[Montreal Junior Hockey Club]]. Many reasons were attributed to the Fog Devils' demise including lack of fan support, a poor lease agreement and high travel costs. The Fog Devils' departure left Mile One Centre without a major tenant for the first time since the building opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's Official: Fog Devils Sold|first=Robin|last=Short|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/index.cfm?sid=102045&amp;sc=83|newspaper=[[The Telegram]]|location=St. John's|date=January 26, 2008|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional hockey returned to St. John's in 2011 when [[Winnipeg]]-based [[True North Sports and Entertainment]] announced a lease agreement with former Newfoundland and Labrador premier [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]] that saw their AHL franchise (formerly known as the [[Manitoba Moose]]) relocated to the Mile One Centre.  The [[St. John's IceCaps]] played their inaugural season in 2011–12 and as the minor league affiliate of True North's [[National Hockey League]] team, the [[Winnipeg Jets]]. In honour of this development, the [[Kraft Hockeyville]] pre-season game between the Jets and the [[Ottawa Senators]] (which was originally to be held in [[Conception Bay]] when announced as it was prior to the relocation of the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] to become the Jets, causing the Moose to become the IceCaps) was moved to the Mile One Centre.&lt;ref name=gm89&gt;{{cite news |title=NHL Set to Play Preseason Games All Over World|first=James|last=Mirtle|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/globe-on-hockey/nhl-set-to-play-preseason-games-all-over-world/article2124179/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=August 9, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, it was announced that the Jets would move their AHL team from St. John's back to Winnipeg as the Moose in 2015–16. The IceCaps' organization was then able to get the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' AHL team, the [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]], to relocate to St. John's for the start of the 2015–16 season, retaining the IceCaps name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnsicecaps.com/article/st-johns-new-home-for-montreal-canadiens-ahl-team/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150313033207/http://www.stjohnsicecaps.com/article/st-johns-new-home-for-montreal-canadiens-ahl-team/ |archivedate=2015-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was only a temporary move while the Canadiens built a rink for their AHL team in [[Laval, Quebec]]. In 2017, the Canadiens' owned franchise left and became the [[Laval Rocket]].

In 2018, after a year without a hockey tenant at Mile One, St. John's was granted an [[ECHL]] expansion team with the [[Newfoundland Growlers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.echl.com/board-governors-approves-changes-2018-19-season |title=BOARD OF GOVERNORS APPROVES CHANGES FOR 2018-19 SEASON |publisher=ECHL |date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basketball==
After long negotiations, the arena became the home to the [[St. John's Edge]] of the [[National Basketball League of Canada]] beginning with the 2017–18 season bringing professional basketball to St. John's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/stjohns-deal-national-basketball-league-1.4295504 |title=St. John's city council approves agreement to bring pro basketball to Mile One |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sporting events==
The arena hosts the annual [[Herder Memorial Trophy]] tournament, the largest hockey tournament in the province. It hosted the [[2001–02 AHL season|2002 AHL All-Star Game]] and the [[2013–14 AHL season|2014 AHL All-Star Game]] in which the AHL All-Stars faced [[Färjestad BK]] of the [[Swedish Hockey League]]. 

On September 22, 2014, Mile One Centre held two split squad preseason games for the Ottawa Senators vs. the [[New York Islanders]]. New York won both games 3–2, the latter game on a shootout. The Senators faced the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] at Mile One for another preseason game on September 27, 2015.

A [[National Basketball Association]] exhibition game between the [[Toronto Raptors]] and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in 2003, was cancelled on game night due to an excess of condensation built up on the playing surface due to the inside temperature.

Other hosted sporting events include:
* [[2004 World U-17 Hockey Challenge]]
* [[2005 Skate Canada International]]
* [[2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts]]
* 2008 5th World Junior Street &amp; Ball Hockey Championship
* During the 2010-2011 hockey season, [[Hockey Canada]] used the arena as host venue for the [[Four Nations Cup]] and the [[2011 Telus Cup|Telus Cup]].

The arena hosted the [[2017 Tim Hortons Brier]], the Canadian men's [[curling]] championship.

==Other events==
The [[Juno Awards of 2002|Juno Awards]] were presented at Mile One Centre on April 14, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St. John's Enjoying Host Role at Junos|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/04/14/junos_sunday020414.html|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=April 14, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the first time the awards show officially went on the road outside the provinces of [[Ontario]] or [[British Columbia]]. In January 2009, it was announced that the [[Juno Awards of 2010|Junos]] were returning to Mile One Centre in April 2010. This made [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] the first city to host the awards show for a second time since they started traveling the country in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2010 Junos Set for St. John's|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2009/01/22/juno-stjohns.html|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mile One Centre was the main venue for the third annual [[Avalon Expo]] sci-fi/comics/pop-culture convention on August 25–27, 2017.

The '''National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame''', located in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], is a [[hall of fame]] and museum dedicated to men's [[college basketball]].&lt;ref name=NCBHF_about_us&gt;{{cite web|title=about us|url=https://collegebasketballexperience.com/about/?v=3a52f3c22ed6|publisher=National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The museum is an integral portion of the [[College Basketball Experience]] created by the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), located at the [[Sprint Center]]. The hall is meant as a complement to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], with a focus strictly on those who have contributed greatly to college basketball.

On November 17, 2006 the NABC honored around 180 players, coaches and other notable contributors to college basketball by inducting them into the founding class of the Hall of Fame.  [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Bill Russell]], [[Dean Smith]], [[John Wooden]], and the family of [[James Naismith]], were selected to represent the inaugural class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nabc.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/111806aaa.html|title=Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame to induct founding class|publisher=NABC|accessdate=2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] has indicated it will help with the exhibits.  The other interactive portions of the College Basketball Experience are called 'The Entry Experience,' 'The Fan Experience,' and 'The Game.' The NABC recently renamed the Guardians Classic college tournament the [[CBE Classic]] to help promote it.

'''Old Deer Park''' is an area of open space within [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], [[England]]. It covers {{convert|147|ha|acre}} of which {{convert|90.4|ha|acre|-1}} is not in public ownership, largely sports grounds for the sports of rugby and golf.&lt;ref name="Wilkie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kimwilkie.com/pages/projects/lon/lon_odp.html |title=Old Deer Park Landscape Strategy |year=2000 |first=Kim |last=Wilkie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/str_kew.pdf |title=Kew |publisher=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The park is bounded generally by the [[River Thames|Thames]] to the west, [[Kew Gardens]] to the north, and across [[A316 road|a trunk road]] urban areas of [[Richmond, London|Richmond town]] to the east and south. Owned by the [[Crown Estate]], the park forms part of a larger retained historic and biodiverse landscape incorporating part of Richmond, [[Kew]] and [[Isleworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/urban/our-portfolio/regional/regional-assets/|title=Our Portfolio|publisher=[[Crown Estate]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest, western parts of the park constitute [[flood-meadow|flood storage areas]], which provide emergency flood relief around [[Richmond Lock and Footbridge|Richmond semi-tidally submerged Lock]].

Old Deer Park's heritage as a historic royal landscape in a favoured riverside location has become compromised over recent decades by instances of inappropriate recreational and parking development, general neglect, and insufficient control of tree planting. A long-term strategy is now being implemented to arrest and reverse this decline.&lt;ref name="Wilkie"/&gt;

==History==
In the mid-16th century, [[Richmond Palace]] was a favourite residence of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and in 1574 she granted "Our park of Isleworth otherwise called the Newe Parke of Richmonde" to [[Edward Bacon (died 1618)|Edward Bacon]]. This statement was made even though [[Isleworth]] parish and manor lay on the Middlesex bank opposite the Surrey bank of Richmond &amp;mdash; the [[Syon Abbey|Abbey of Syon]] in Isleworth was tied to that  [[Sheen Priory|of Sheen]] on the other respective bank, which had jointly for centuries owned the estate.

In the year of the [[Elizabeth I of England#Death|death of Elizabeth]] at Richmond, 1603, a hunting park was established by [[King James I of England|King James I]] by adding monastic land to the existing park and creating an enlarged area of {{convert|370|acre|km2}}. This then became known as The New Park of Richmond. The present name "Old Deer Park" was adopted after 1637 upon the establishment by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] of the much larger [[Richmond Park]] on the other side of the town.

The majority of park is now occupied by the [[Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club]], and this has been so since 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmsgc.co.uk/club/history/|title=History |publisher=[[Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club]] |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the club's boundaries are two 18-hole courses, plus a separate area within which lies the Grade I [[listed building|listed]] [[King's Observatory]],&lt;ref name="KO listing"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1357729 |desc=Kew Observatory|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; established by King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] in 1769. To the south-west of the Observatory, under the fairway of the 14th hole of the outer golf course, lie the foundations of the former Carthusian [[Sheen Priory]], founded by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] in 1414.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cloake |first=John |authorlink=John Cloake |title=Richmond's Great Monastery, The Charterhouse of Jesus of Bethlehem of Shene |publisher=[[Richmond, London#Societies|Richmond Local History Society]] |volume=6, |date=November 1990 |page=51 | isbn=978-0950819860| postscript=. (diagram).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the railway line westwards from [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond Station]] in 1847/8 restricted the access from [[Richmond Green]] to Old Deer Park, except for one narrow bridge. Eighty-five years later a new arterial road (the [[A316 road|"Great Chertsey Road"]]), complete with a high ramped approach to a new bridge over the Thames ([[Twickenham Bridge]]&amp;nbsp;– built in 1933), was also constructed across the southern end of the park, close to and roughly parallel with the railway. This heightened the sense of separation between town and park&amp;nbsp;– alleviating this problem is also part of the new strategy.&lt;ref name="Wilkie"/&gt;

Beside the River Thames in the park are a pair of stone [[obelisks]]. They were built in 1769 and were originally used by the King's Observatory to observe the [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun that year. However, a legend says that they were erected in the 18th century as memorials to two men who lost their lives in a [[duel]] over a woman, who drowned herself in the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/11/the_obelisks.html|title=The Obelisks|publisher=St Margaret's Community site|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was used to accommodate 5,000 of the 8,000 [[Boy Scout|Scouts]] attending the [[1st World Scout Jamboree]] in 1920. The public open spaces are occasionally used for [[circus]]es,  [[funfair]]s and other events.

The Old Deer Park has been used a venue for [[cricket]] since at least 1867, when Richmond played a [[United South of England Eleven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/709_misc.html |title=Other matches played on Old Deer Park | publisher=Cricket Archive |accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its history, the ground has played host to a number of [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex Second XI]] and [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey Second XI]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/709_minc.html |title=Minor Counties Championship Matches played on Old Deer Park | publisher=Cricket Archive |accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/709_sec.html |title=Second XI Championship Matches played on Old Deer Park  | publisher=Cricket Archive |accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/709_set.html |title=Second XI Trophy Matches played on Old Deer Park | publisher=Cricket Archive |accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite historically being within Surrey, the ground has played host to [[List-A cricket|List-A]] matches involving [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], the first of which saw them [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] in the 2000 Norwich Union National League. In 2001 the [[Middlesex Cricket Board]] played their only List-A match at the ground in the [[2001 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy]] against [[Berkshire County Cricket Club|Berkshire]].  From 2000 to 2004, the ground held 5 List-A matches, the last of which saw Middlesex play [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]] in the 2004 [[totesport League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/709_a.html |title=List-A Matches played on Old Deer Park | publisher=Cricket Archive |accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the [[2003 Twenty20 Cup]] against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], Middlesex have used the ground for six [[Twenty20]] matches to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/709_tt.html |title=Twenty20 Matches played on Old Deer Park | publisher=Cricket Archive |accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
