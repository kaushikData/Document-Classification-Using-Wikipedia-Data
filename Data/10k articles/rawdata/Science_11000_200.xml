It is hypothesised that the accretion of Earth began soon after the formation of the calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions and the meteorites. Because the exact amount of time this accretion process took is not yet known, and the predictions from different accretion models range from a few million up to about 100 million years, the exact age of Earth is difficult to determine. It is also difficult to determine the exact age of the [[oldest dated rocks|oldest rocks]] on Earth, exposed at the surface, as they are [[aggregate (geology)|aggregates]] of minerals of possibly different ages.

Studies of [[stratum|strata]], the layering of rocks and earth, gave [[natural history|naturalists]] an appreciation that Earth may have been through many changes during its existence.

In the mid-18th century, the naturalist [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] suggested that Earth had been created separately from, and several hundred thousand years before, the rest of the universe. Lomonosov's ideas were mostly speculative. In 1779 the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte du Buffon]] tried to obtain a value for the age of Earth using an experiment: He created a small globe that resembled Earth in composition and then measured its rate of cooling. This led him to estimate that Earth was about 75,000 years old.

Other naturalists used these hypotheses to construct a [[History of the Earth|history of Earth]], though their timelines were inexact as they did not know how long it took to lay down stratigraphic layers.&lt;ref name=Brookfield/&gt; In 1830, geologist [[Charles Lyell]], developing ideas found in [[James Hutton]]'s works, popularized the concept that the features of Earth were in perpetual change, eroding and reforming continuously, and the rate of this change was roughly constant. This was a challenge to the traditional view, which saw the history of Earth as static,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} with changes brought about by intermittent [[Disaster|catastrophes]]. Many naturalists were influenced by Lyell to become "uniformitarians" who believed that changes were constant and uniform.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Early calculations==

He assumed that Earth had formed as a completely molten object, and determined the amount of time it would take for the near-surface to cool to its present temperature. His calculations did not account for [[Earth#Heat|heat produced]] via [[radioactive decay]] (a process then unknown to science) or, more significantly, [[convection]] inside the Earth, which allows more heat to escape from the interior to warm rocks near the surface.&lt;ref name="England et al 2007"/&gt; Even more constraining were Kelvin's estimates of the age of the Sun, which were based on estimates of its thermal output and a theory that the Sun obtains its energy from gravitational collapse; Kelvin estimated that the Sun is about 20 million years old.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4AWPFdyrWIC|title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth|last=Burchfield|first=Joe D.|date=1990-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226080437|location=|pages=69 ff|language=en|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214145555/https://books.google.com/books?id=s4AWPFdyrWIC|archivedate=2018-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|title=Kelvin's age of the Earth paradox revisited|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=105|issue=B6|pages=13155–13158|bibcode=2000JGR...10513155S|doi=10.1029/2000JB900028|last1=Stacey|first1=Frank D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]]

Geologists such as [[Charles Lyell]] had trouble accepting such a short age for Earth. For biologists, even 100 million years seemed much too short to be plausible. In [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of [[evolution]], the process of random heritable variation with cumulative [[natural selection|selection]] requires great durations of time.  (According to modern biology, the total evolutionary history from the beginning of life to today has taken place since [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago]], the amount of time which passed since the [[last universal ancestor]] of all living organisms as shown by geological dating.&lt;ref name="Oldest Fossil Found"&gt;{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |date=November 13, 2013 |title=Oldest fossil found: Meet your microbial mom |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131113/DAA1VSC01.html |work=[[Excite]] |location=Yonkers, NY |publisher=[[Mindspark Interactive Network]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2015-03-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629230719/http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131113/DAA1VSC01.html |archivedate=June 29, 2015 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt;)

In a lecture in 1869, Darwin's great advocate, [[Thomas Huxley|Thomas H. Huxley]], attacked Thomson's calculations, suggesting they appeared precise in themselves but were based on faulty assumptions. The physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (in 1856) and astronomer [[Simon Newcomb]] (in 1892) contributed their own calculations of 22 and 18 million years respectively to the debate: they independently calculated the amount of time it would take for the Sun to condense down to its current diameter and brightness from the nebula of gas and dust from which it was born.&lt;ref name=Dal14-17&gt;Dalrymple (1994) pp. 14–17&lt;/ref&gt; Their values were consistent with Thomson's calculations. However, they assumed that the Sun was only glowing from the heat of its [[gravitational contraction]]. The process of solar [[nuclear fusion]] was not yet known to science.

In 1895 [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] challenged Kelvin's figure on the basis of his assumptions on conductivity, and [[Oliver Heaviside]] entered the dialogue, considering it "a vehicle to display the ability of his [[operational calculus|operator method]] to solve problems of astonishing complexity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul J. Nahin]] (1985) [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4321749 Oliver Heaviside, Fractional Operators, and the Age of the Earth], [[IEEE Transactions on Education]] E-28(2): 94–104, link from [[IEEE Explore]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists backed up Thomson's figures. [[Charles Darwin]]'s son, the astronomer [[George Darwin|George H. Darwin]], proposed that Earth and [[Moon]] had broken apart in their early days when they were both molten. He calculated the amount of time it would have taken for [[tidal acceleration|tidal friction]] to give Earth its current 24-hour day. His value of 56 million years added additional evidence that Thomson was on the right track.&lt;ref name=Dal14-17/&gt;

The last estimate Thomson gave, in 1897, was: "that it was more than 20 and less than 40 million year old, and probably much nearer 20 than 40".&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple (1994) pp. 14, 43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 and 1900, [[John Joly]] calculated the rate at which the oceans should have accumulated [[Halite|salt]] from [[erosion]] processes, and determined that the oceans were about 80 to 100 million years old.&lt;ref name=Dal14-17/&gt;

==Radiometric dating==
{{Main article|Radiometric dating}}

===Overview===
By their chemical nature, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[mineral]]s contain certain [[Chemical element|elements]] and not others; but in rocks containing radioactive isotopes, the process of [[radioactive decay]] generates exotic elements over time. By measuring the [[concentration]] of the stable end product of the decay, coupled with knowledge of the [[half life]] and initial concentration of the decaying element, the age of the rock can be calculated.&lt;ref name=nichols&gt;{{cite book | author=Nichols, Gary | title=Sedimentology and Stratigraphy | chapter=21.2 Radiometric Dating | pages=325–327 | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | date=2009 | isbn=978-1405193795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical radioactive end products are [[argon]] from decay of [[potassium]]-40, and [[lead]] from decay of [[uranium]] and [[thorium]].&lt;ref name=nichols/&gt; If the rock becomes molten, as happens in Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], such nonradioactive end products typically escape or are redistributed.&lt;ref name=nichols/&gt; Thus the age of the oldest terrestrial rock gives a minimum for the age of Earth, assuming that no rock has been intact for longer than the Earth itself.

===Convective mantle and radioactivity===
In 1892, Thomson had been made [[Lord Kelvin]] in appreciation of his many scientific accomplishments. Kelvin calculated the age of the Earth by using [[heat conduction|thermal gradients]], and he arrived at an estimate of about 100 million years.&lt;ref name="kp"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Kelvin, Perry and the Age of the Earth | first1=Philip C. | last1=England | first2=Peter | last2=Molnar | first3=Frank M. | last3=Richter | journal=American Scientist | volume=95 | issue=4 | date=2007 | pages=342–349 | doi=10.1511/2007.66.3755 | url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/EART_206/09-0108/Supplemental/England%20et%2007%20AmSci%2095-342.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702103828/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/EART_206/09-0108/Supplemental/England%20et%2007%20AmSci%2095-342.pdf | archivedate=2010-07-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not realize that the Earth [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] was convecting, and this invalidated his estimate. In 1895, [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] produced an age-of-Earth estimate of 2 to 3 billion years using a model of a convective mantle and thin crust.&lt;ref name="kp" /&gt;  Kelvin stuck by his estimate of 100 million years, and later reduced it to about 20 million years.

The discovery of [[radioactivity]] introduced another factor in the calculation. After [[Henri Becquerel]]'s initial discovery in 1896, [[Maria Sklodowska-Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] discovered the radioactive elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]] in 1898; and in 1903, Pierre Curie and [[Albert Laborde]] announced that radium produces enough heat to melt its own weight in ice in less than an hour. Geologists quickly realized that this upset the assumptions underlying most calculations of the age of Earth.
These had assumed that the original heat of the Earth and Sun had dissipated steadily into space, but radioactive decay meant that this heat had been continually replenished.  George Darwin and John Joly were the first to point this out, in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Invention of radiometric dating===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Radioactivity, which had overthrown the old calculations, yielded a bonus by providing a basis for new calculations, in the form of [[radiometric dating]].
[[Image:Ernest Rutherford 1908.jpg|thumb|Ernest Rutherford in 1908.]]
[[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] jointly  had continued their work on radioactive materials and concluded that radioactivity was due to a spontaneous transmutation of atomic elements. In radioactive decay, an element breaks down into another, lighter element, releasing alpha, beta, or [[Gamma ray|gamma]] [[radioactive decay|radiation]] in the process. They also determined that a particular isotope of a radioactive element decays into another element at a distinctive rate. This rate is given in terms of a "[[half-life]]", or the amount of time it takes half of a mass of that radioactive material to break down into its "decay product".

Some radioactive materials have short half-lives; some have long half-lives. [[Uranium]] and [[thorium]] have long half-lives, and so persist in Earth's crust, but radioactive elements with short half-lives have generally disappeared. This suggested that it might be possible to measure the age of Earth by determining the relative proportions of radioactive materials in geological samples. In reality, radioactive elements do not always decay into nonradioactive ("stable") elements directly, instead, decaying into other radioactive elements that have their own half-lives and so on, until they reach a [[stable element]]. These "[[decay chain]]s", such as the uranium-radium and thorium series, were known within a few years of the discovery of radioactivity and provided a basis for constructing techniques of radiometric dating.

The pioneers of radioactivity were chemist [[Bertram B. Boltwood]] and the energetic Rutherford. Boltwood had conducted studies of radioactive materials as a consultant, and when Rutherford lectured at Yale in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=E. | last=Rutherford | date=1906
 | title=Radioactive Transformations
 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons
 | location=London }} Reprinted by Juniper Grove (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-60355-054-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Boltwood was inspired to describe the relationships between elements in various decay series. Late in 1904, Rutherford took the first step toward radiometric dating by suggesting that the [[alpha particle]]s released by radioactive decay could be trapped in a rocky material as [[helium]] atoms. At the time, Rutherford was only guessing at the relationship between alpha particles and helium atoms, but he would prove the connection four years later.

Soddy and [[Sir William Ramsay]] had just determined the rate at which radium produces alpha particles, and Rutherford proposed that he could determine the age of a rock sample by measuring its concentration of helium. He dated a rock in his possession to an age of 40 million years by this technique. Rutherford wrote,

{{quote|I came into the room, which was half dark, and presently spotted Lord Kelvin in the audience and realized that I was in trouble at the last part of my speech dealing with the age of the Earth, where my views conflicted with his. To my relief, Kelvin fell fast asleep, but as I came to the important point, I saw the old bird sit up, open an eye, and cock a baleful glance at me! Then a sudden inspiration came, and I said, "Lord Kelvin had limited the age of the Earth, provided no new source was discovered. That prophetic utterance refers to what we are now considering tonight, radium!" Behold! the old boy beamed upon me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title=Rutherford: Being the life and letters of the Rt. Hon. Lord Rutherford, O. M.
 | publisher=Cambridge University Press
 | location=Cambridge }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rutherford assumed that the rate of decay of radium as determined by Ramsay and Soddy was accurate, and that helium did not escape from the sample over time. Rutherford's scheme was inaccurate, but it was a useful first step.

Boltwood focused on the end products of decay series. In 1905, he suggested that [[lead]] was the final stable product of the decay of radium. It was already known that radium was an intermediate product of the decay of uranium. Rutherford joined in, outlining a decay process in which radium emitted five alpha particles through various intermediate products to end up with lead, and speculated that the radium-lead decay chain could be used to date rock samples. Boltwood did the legwork, and by the end of 1905 had provided dates for 26 separate rock samples, ranging from 92 to 570 million years. He did not publish these results, which was fortunate because they were flawed by measurement errors and poor estimates of the half-life of radium. Boltwood refined his work and finally published the results in 1907.&lt;ref name="Boltwood" /&gt;

Boltwood's paper pointed out that samples taken from comparable layers of strata had similar lead-to-uranium ratios, and that samples from older layers had a higher proportion of lead, except where there was evidence that lead had [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]] out of the sample. His studies were flawed by the fact that the decay series of thorium was not understood, which led to incorrect results for samples that contained both uranium and thorium. However, his calculations were far more accurate than any that had been performed to that time. Refinements in the technique would later give ages for Boltwood's 26 samples of 410 million to 2.2 billion years.&lt;ref name="Boltwood" /&gt;

===Arthur Holmes establishes radiometric dating===
Although Boltwood published his paper in a prominent geological journal, the geological community had little interest in radioactivity.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Boltwood gave up work on radiometric dating and went on to investigate other decay series. Rutherford remained mildly curious about the issue of the age of Earth but did little work on it.

[[Robert Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh|Robert Strutt]] tinkered with Rutherford's helium method until 1910 and then ceased. However, Strutt's student [[Arthur Holmes]] became interested in radiometric dating and continued to work on it after everyone else had given up. Holmes focused on lead dating, because he regarded the helium method as unpromising. He performed measurements on rock samples and concluded in 1911 that the oldest (a sample from Ceylon) was about 1.6 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple (1994) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; These calculations were not particularly trustworthy. For example, he assumed that the samples had contained only uranium and no lead when they were formed.

More important research was published in 1913. It showed that elements generally exist in multiple variants with different masses, or "[[isotope]]s". In the 1930s, isotopes would be shown to have nuclei with differing numbers of the neutral particles known as "[[neutrons]]". In that same year, other research was published establishing the rules for radioactive decay, allowing more precise identification of decay series.

Many geologists felt these new discoveries made radiometric dating so complicated as to be worthless.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Holmes felt that they gave him tools to improve his techniques, and he plodded ahead with his research, publishing before and after the First World War. His work was generally ignored until the 1920s, though in 1917 [[Joseph Barrell]], a professor of geology at Yale, redrew geological history as it was understood at the time to conform to Holmes's findings in radiometric dating. Barrell's research determined that the layers of strata had not all been laid down at the same rate, and so current rates of geological change could not be used to provide accurate timelines of the history of Earth.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Holmes' persistence finally began to pay off in 1921, when the speakers at the yearly meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] came to a rough consensus that Earth was a few billion years old, and that radiometric dating was credible. Holmes published ''The Age of the Earth, an Introduction to Geological Ideas'' in 1927 in which he presented a range of 1.6 to 3.0 billion years. No great push to embrace radiometric dating followed, however, and the die-hards in the geological community stubbornly resisted. They had never cared for attempts by physicists to intrude in their domain, and had successfully ignored them so far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/Badash_AgeEarthDebate_SciAmer89.pdf The Age of the Earth Debate Badash, L ''Scientific American'' 1989 esp p95] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105173355/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/Badash_AgeEarthDebate_SciAmer89.pdf |date=2016-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing weight of evidence finally tilted the balance in 1931, when the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] of the US [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] decided to resolve the question of the age of Earth by appointing a committee to investigate. Holmes, being one of the few people on Earth who was trained in radiometric dating techniques, was a committee member, and in fact wrote most of the final report.&lt;ref name = Dal7778&gt;Dalrymple (1994) pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Arthur Holmes' report concluded that radioactive dating was the only reliable means of pinning down geological time scales.  Questions of bias were deflected by the great and exacting detail of the report. It described the methods used, the care with which measurements were made, and their error bars and limitations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Modern radiometric dating===
[[Radiometric dating]] continues to be the predominant way scientists date geologic timescales. Techniques for radioactive dating have been tested and fine-tuned on an ongoing basis since the 1960s.  Forty or so different dating techniques have been utilized to date, working on a wide variety of materials. Dates for the same sample using these different techniques are in very close agreement on the age of the material.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Possible [[radioactive contamination|contamination]] problems do exist, but they have been studied and dealt with by careful investigation, leading to sample preparation procedures being minimized to limit the chance of contamination.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Why meteorites were used====
An age of 4.55 ± 0.07 billion years, very close to today's accepted age, was determined by [[Clair Cameron Patterson]] using uranium-lead isotope dating (specifically [[lead-lead dating]]) on several meteorites including the [[Canyon Diablo (meteorite)|Canyon Diablo meteorite]] and published in 1956.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Patterson | first=Claire | title=Age of meteorites and the earth | journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta | url=http://es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/Patterson_AgeEarth_GeoCosmoActa56.pdf | date=1956 | volume=10 | issue=4 | pages=230–237 | accessdate=2009-07-07 | doi=10.1016/0016-7037(56)90036-9 | bibcode=1956GeCoA..10..230P | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621045217/http://es.ucsc.edu/%7Ercoe/eart206/Patterson_AgeEarth_GeoCosmoActa56.pdf | archivedate=2010-06-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Paterson isochron animation.gif|thumb|left|350px|Lead isotope isochron diagram showing data used by Patterson to determine the age of the Earth in 1956.]]
The quoted age of Earth is derived, in part, from the Canyon Diablo meteorite for several important reasons and is built upon a modern understanding of cosmochemistry built up over decades of research.

Most geological samples from Earth are unable to give a direct date of the formation of Earth from the solar nebula because Earth has undergone differentiation into the core, mantle, and crust, and this has then undergone a long history of mixing and unmixing of these sample reservoirs by [[plate tectonics]], [[weathering]] and [[hydrothermal circulation]].

All of these processes may adversely affect isotopic dating mechanisms because the sample cannot always be assumed to have remained as a closed system, by which it is meant that either the parent or daughter [[nuclide]] (a species of atom characterised by the number of neutrons and protons an atom contains) or an intermediate daughter nuclide may have been partially removed from the sample, which will skew the resulting isotopic date. To mitigate this effect it is usual to date several minerals in the same sample, to provide an [[isochron]]. Alternatively, more than one dating system may be used on a sample to check the date.

Some meteorites are furthermore considered to represent the primitive material from which the accreting solar disk was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=Carlson, R. W.| author2=Tera, F.

Nevertheless, ancient [[Archean|Archaean]] lead [[ores]] of [[galena]] have been used to date the formation of Earth as these represent the earliest formed lead-only minerals on the planet and record the earliest homogeneous lead-lead isotope systems on the planet. These have returned age dates of 4.54 billion years with a precision of as little as 1% margin for error.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple (1994) pp. 310–341&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canyon Diablo meteorite====
{{Further information|Canyon Diablo (meteorite)}}{{Further information|Age of the Solar System}}

[[Image:Barringer Crater aerial photo by USGS.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Meteor Crater|Barringer Crater]], Arizona where the Canyon Diablo meteorite was found.]]

The [[Canyon Diablo (canyon)|Canyon Diablo]] meteorite was used because it is both large and representative of a particularly rare type of meteorite that contains [[sulfide]] minerals (particularly [[troilite]], FeS), metallic [[nickel]]-[[iron]] alloys, plus silicate minerals.
This is important because the presence of the three mineral phases allows investigation of isotopic dates using samples that provide a great separation in concentrations between parent and daughter nuclides. This is particularly true of uranium and lead. Lead is strongly [[chalcophile|chalcophilic]] and is found in the sulfide at a much greater concentration than in the silicate, versus uranium. Because of this segregation in the parent and daughter nuclides during the formation of the meteorite, this allowed a much more precise date of the formation of the solar disk and hence the planets than ever before.

[[Image:Canyon-diablo-meteorite.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fragment of the Canyon Diablo iron meteorite.]]

The age determined from the Canyon Diablo meteorite has been confirmed by hundreds of other age determinations, from both terrestrial samples and other meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

This is interpreted as the duration of formation of the solar nebula and its collapse into the solar disk to form the Sun and the planets. This 50 million year time span allows for accretion of the planets from the original solar dust and meteorites.

The moon, as another extraterrestrial body that has not undergone plate tectonics and that has no atmosphere, provides quite precise age dates from the samples returned from the Apollo missions. Rocks returned from the Moon have been dated at a maximum of 4.51 billion years old. [[Martian meteorites]] that have landed upon Earth have also been dated to around 4.5 billion years old by [[lead-lead dating]]. Lunar samples, since they have not been disturbed by weathering, plate tectonics or material moved by organisms, can also provide dating by direct [[electron microscope]] examination of [[cosmic ray]] tracks. The accumulation of dislocations generated by high energy cosmic ray particle impacts provides another confirmation of the isotopic dates. [[Environmental radioactivity#Activation products from cosmic rays|Cosmic ray dating]] is only useful on material that has not been melted, since melting erases the crystalline structure of the material, and wipes away the tracks left by the particles.

Altogether, the concordance of age dates of both the earliest terrestrial lead reservoirs and all other reservoirs within the Solar System found to date are used to support the fact that Earth and the rest of the Solar System formed at around 4.53 to 4.58 billion years ago.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''Aviator Glacier''' is major valley glacier in Antarctica that is over {{convert|60|mi|km}} long and {{convert|5|mi|km}} wide, descending generally southward from the plateau of [[Victoria Land]] along the west side of [[Mountaineer Range]], and entering [[Lady Newnes Bay]] between [[Cape Sibbald]] and [[Hayes Head]] where it forms the '''Aviator Glacier Tongue'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Find the Data |title=Glacier: Aviator Glacier, Antarctica |url=http://antarctica-geography.findthedata.org/l/532/Aviator-Glacier |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701114303/http://antarctica-geography.findthedata.org/l/532/Aviator-Glacier |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 July 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A glacier is a mass of ice with sufficient thickness to flow away from the source area in lobes, tongues or masses. Glaciers are usually found at high altitudes or high elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= TravelsRadiate |title= Aviator Glacier Tongue |url= http://www.travelsradiate.com/antarctica/antarctica/6635495-aviator-glacier-tongue.html |accessdate= 10 May 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120914072642/http://www.travelsradiate.com/antarctica/antarctica/6635495-aviator-glacier-tongue.html |archivedate= 14 September 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The glacier was photographed from the air by Captain W.M. Hawkes, [[US Navy]], on the historic first flight from New Zealand to [[McMurdo Sound]] on December 17, 1955. An attempt to reconnoiter it by helicopter and to land a party of the NZGSAE on it had to be abandoned when USS ''Glacier'' was damaged in pressure ice in December 1958. Named by NZGSAE, 1958–59, as a tribute to the hazardous work of pilots and other airmen in Antarctic exploratory and scientific operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Find the Data |title=Glacier: Aviator Glacier, Antarctica |url=http://antarctica-geography.findthedata.org/l/532/Aviator-Glacier |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701114303/http://antarctica-geography.findthedata.org/l/532/Aviator-Glacier |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 July 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviator Glacier Tongue==
The Aviator Glacier Tongue in Antarctica is a seaward extension of Aviator Glacier into the Ross Sea, between Wood Bay and Lady Newness Bay along the coast of Victoria Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Find the Data |title=Glacier: Aviator Glacier Tongue, Antarctica |url=http://antarctica-geography.findthedata.org/l/533/Aviator-Glacier-Tongue |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709045847/http://antarctica-geography.findthedata.org/l/533/Aviator-Glacier-Tongue |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This floating [[ice tongue]] extends into the water for about {{convert|25|km|mi|0}}.
The name was recommended by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in association with Aviator Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Find the Data |title=Glacier: Aviator Glacier Tongue, Antarctica |url=http://antarctica-geography.findthedata.org/l/533/Aviator-Glacier-Tongue |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709045847/http://antarctica-geography.findthedata.org/l/533/Aviator-Glacier-Tongue |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2342">'''Bolaamphiphiles''' (also known as ''bolaform surfactants'',
''bolaphiles'', or ''alpha-omega-type surfactants'') are [[amphiphilic]] molecules that have [[hydrophilic]] groups at both ends of a sufficiently long [[hydrophobic]] [[hydrocarbon]] chain. Compared to single-headed [[amphiphiles]], the introduction of a second head-group generally induces a higher solubility in water, an increase in the [[critical micelle concentration]] (cmc), and a decrease in aggregation number. The aggregate morphologies of bolaamphiphiles include spheres, cylinders, disks, and vesicles. Bolaamphiphiles are also known to form helical structures that can form monolayer microtubular self-assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;P/ Mosae Selvakumar et al, J. Mol. Struct. 919 (2009) 72-78&lt;/ref&gt;

''Carbon Shift: How Peak Oil and the Climate Crisis Will Change Canada (and Our Lives)'' is a 2009 non-fiction book edited by [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]] and Nick Garrison that collects six essays that discusses the issues of [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lorinc|first=jOHN|title=The Danger of Inaction: A Chat With Thomas Homer-Dixon|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/the-danger-of-inactiona-chat-with-thomas-homer-dixon/|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was first published in hardcover by [[Random House of Canada]] in 2009 under the title ''Carbon Shift: How the Twin Crises of Oil Depletion and Climate Change Will Define the Future'', and became a national bestseller.  In 2010, the paperback was published by [[Vintage Canada]], a division of Random House Canada, the sub-title then changing to ''How Peak Oil and the Climate Crisis Will Change Canada (and Our Lives)''.

==Synopsis==
''Carbon Shift'' encompasses six essays by experts in the fields of economics, geology, politics, and science. The essays argue points such as humanity's potential for exhausting the supply of non-renewable fuels and what could be done to prevent this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">A '''Chapman function''' describes the integration of atmospheric [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] along a slant path on a spherical earth, relative to the vertical case. It applies for any quantity with a concentration [[exponential decay|decreasing exponentially]] with increasing [[altitude]]. To a first approximation, valid at small [[zenith]] [[angle]]s, the Chapman function for [[absorption (optics)|optical absorption]] is equal to 

:&lt;math&gt;\sec(z),\ &lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is the [[zenith]] angle and sec denotes the [[secant function]]. 

The Chapman function is named after [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]].

'''Control theory''' in [[Control engineering|control systems engineering]] is a subfield of [[mathematics]] that deals with the control of continuously operating [[dynamical system]]s  in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without ''delay or overshoot'' and ensuring control [[Stability theory|stability]].

To do this, a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' with the requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the ''error'' signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is ''feedback control'', which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a "final control element", such as a [[control valve]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Stuart (1992). A history of control engineering, 1930-1955. IET. p. 48. {{ISBN|978-0-86341-299-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the [[block diagram]]. In it the [[transfer function]], also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the [[differential equation]]s describing the system.

Control theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=On Governors |date=1868 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=100 |issue= |pages= |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/On_Governors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Control theory was further advanced by [[Edward Routh]] in 1874, [[Jacques Charles François Sturm|Charles Sturm]] and in 1895, [[Adolf Hurwitz]], who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria; and from 1922 onwards, the development of [[PID control]] theory by [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280–309 |issue=2 |ref=harv  |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although a major application of control theory is in control systems engineering, which deals with the design of [[process control]] systems for industry, other applications range far beyond this.  As the general theory of feedback systems, control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs.

==History==
[[File:Boulton and Watt centrifugal governor-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Centrifugal governor]] in a [[Boulton &amp; Watt engine]] of 1788]]

Although control systems of various types date back to antiquity, a more formal analysis of the field began with a dynamics analysis of the [[centrifugal governor]], conducted by the physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868, entitled ''On Governors''.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1867"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maxwell, J.C.|year=1868|title=On Governors|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume=16|pages=270–283|doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055|jstor=112510}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2008-04-14--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This described and analyzed the phenomenon of [[self-oscillation]], in which lags in the system may lead to overcompensation and unstable behavior. This generated a flurry of interest in the topic, during which Maxwell's classmate, [[Edward John Routh]], abstracted Maxwell's results for the general class of linear systems.&lt;ref name=Routh1975&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, [[Adolf Hurwitz]] analyzed system stability using differential equations in 1877, resulting in what is now known as the [[Routh–Hurwitz theorem]].&lt;ref name=Routh1877&gt;{{cite book

A notable application of dynamic control was in the area of manned flight. The [[Wright brothers]] made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds.

By [[World War II]], control theory was becoming an important area of research. [[Irmgard Flügge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control systems, and applied the [[bang–bang control|bang-bang principle]] to the development of [[autopilot|automatic flight control equipment]] for aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flugge-Lotz|first1=Irmgard|last2=Titus|first2=Harold A.|title=Optimum and Quasi-Optimum Control of Third and Fourth-Order Systems|journal=Stanford University Technical Report|date=October 1962|issue=134|pages=8–12|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/621137.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallion|first1=Richard P.|editor1-last=Sicherman|editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=Carol Hurd|editor3-last=Kantrov|editor3-first=Ilene|editor4-last=Walker|editor4-first=Harriette|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period: A Biographical Dictionary|date=1980|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9781849722704|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of application for discontinuous controls included [[fire-control system]]s, [[guidance system]]s and [[electronics]].

A [[Centrifugal governor]] is used to regulate the windmill velocity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.302.5633&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Control Theory: History, Mathematical Achievements and Perspectives | E. Fernandez-Cara1 and E. Zuazua]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems. For example, [[Stabilizer (ship)|ship stabilizers]] are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally.  In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.

The [[Space Race]] also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics.

==Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control==
[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|A [[block diagram]] of a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] using a [[feedback loop]] to control the process variable by comparing it with a desired value, and applying the difference as an error signal to generate a control output to reduce or eliminate the error.]]
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|400px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
Fundamentally, there are two types of control loops: open loop control and closed loop (feedback) control.

In open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the "process output" (or "controlled process variable" - PV). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, but neither is linked.

In closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on feedback from the process in the form of the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the "Reference input" or  "set point". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.&lt;ref&gt;"Feedback and control systems" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is "a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970
|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise; "A ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1969|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
An example of a control system is a car's [[cruise control]], which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant ''desired'' or ''reference'' speed provided by the driver. The ''controller'' is the cruise control, the ''plant'' is the car, and the ''system'' is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's [[throttle]] position which determines how much power the engine delivers.

A primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control.  However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an ''[[open-loop controller]]'' because there is no [[feedback]]; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.

In a ''[[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control system]]'', data from a sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, the difference between the input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed.  The central idea of these control systems is the ''feedback loop'', the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.

==Classical control theory==
{{main|Classical control theory}}

To overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], control theory introduces [[feedback]].
A [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|outputs]] of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is "fed back" as input to the process, closing the loop.

Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:
* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)
* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact
* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized
* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations
* improved reference tracking performance

In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.

A common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].

==Closed-loop transfer function==
{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}
The output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to a comparison with the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.

This is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).

[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]

If we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = P(s) U(s)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;U(s) = C(s) E(s)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \left( \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)F(s)} \right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If &lt;math&gt;|P(s)C(s)| \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if &lt;math&gt;|F(s)| \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.

==PID feedback control==
{{main |PID Controller}}
[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or "set point", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]
A '''proportional–integral–derivative controller ''' ('''PID controller''') is a  [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] control technique widely  used in control systems.

A PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal.

The theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.
The [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design.

If ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and &lt;math&gt;e(t)=r(t)- y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the tracking error, a PID controller has the general form

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \int e(\tau)\text{d}\tau + K_D \frac{\text{de(t)}}{\text{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters &lt;math&gt; K_P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_D&lt;/math&gt;, often iteratively by "tuning" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well-established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if [[MIMO]] systems are considered.

Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation

:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right) e(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with the PID controller transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right).&lt;/math&gt;

As an example of tuning a PID controller in the closed-loop system &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, consider a 1st order plant given by

:&lt;math&gt;P(s) = \frac{A}{1 + sT_P}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_P&lt;/math&gt; are some constants. The plant output is fed back through

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{1}{1 + sT_F}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_F&lt;/math&gt; is also a constant. Now if we set &lt;math&gt;K_P=K\left(1+\frac{T_D}{T_I}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_D=KT_D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_I=\frac{K}{T_I}&lt;/math&gt;, we can express the PID controller transfer function in series form as

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) =  K \left(1 + \frac{1}{sT_I}\right)(1 + sT_D)&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging &lt;math&gt;P(s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C(s)&lt;/math&gt; into the closed-loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, we find that by setting

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{A},   T_I = T_F,   T_D = T_P&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H(s) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. With this tuning in this example, the system output follows the reference input exactly.

However, in practice, a pure differentiator is neither physically realizable nor desirable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=K.H. |last2=Chong |first2=G.C.Y. |last3=Li |first3=Y. |date=2005 |title=PID control system analysis, design, and technology |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1453566 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Control Systems and Technology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=559–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a [[Lead–lag compensator|phase-lead compensator]] type approach or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off are used instead.

==Linear and nonlinear control theory==
The field of control theory can be divided into two branches:
* ''[[Linear control theory]]'' – This applies to systems made of devices which obey the [[superposition principle]], which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input.  They are governed by [[linear equation|linear]] [[differential equation]]s.  A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called ''[[linear time invariant]]'' (LTI) systems.   These systems are amenable to powerful [[frequency domain]] mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the [[Laplace transform]], [[Fourier transform]], [[Z transform]], [[Bode plot]], [[root locus]], and [[Nyquist stability criterion]].  These lead to a description of the system using terms like [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[frequency response]], [[eigenvalue]]s, [[gain (electronics)|gain]], [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]], [[zeros and poles]], which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest. 
* ''[[Nonlinear control theory]]'' – This covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle, and applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are nonlinear.  These systems are often governed by [[nonlinear differential equation]]s.  The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems.  These include [[limit cycle]] theory, [[Poincaré map]]s, [[Lyapunov function|Lyapunov stability theorem]], and [[describing function]]s.  Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using [[numerical method]]s on computers, for example by [[simulation|simulating]] their operation using a [[simulation language]].  If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be [[linearization|linearized]] by approximating them by a linear system using [[perturbation theory]], and linear techniques can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/simulink/slref/trim.html trim point]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis techniques - frequency domain and time domain==
Mathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories:
* ''[[Frequency domain]]'' – In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s, the mathematical [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing the system's input, output and feedback are represented as functions of [[frequency]].  The input signal and the system's [[transfer function]] are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a [[transform (mathematics)|transform]] such as the [[Fourier transform]], [[Laplace transform]], or [[Z transform]].  The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the ''[[differential equation]]s'' that represent the system are replaced by ''[[algebraic equation]]s'' in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve.  However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above.
* ''[[Time-domain state space representation]]'' – In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s are represented as functions of time.  With this model, the system being analyzed is represented by one or more [[differential equation]]s.  Since frequency domain techniques are limited to [[linear function|linear]] systems, time domain is widely used to analyze real-world nonlinear systems.   Although these are more difficult to solve, modern computer simulation techniques such as [[simulation language]]s have made their analysis routine.
In contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain [[state space (controls)|state space]] representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the "time-domain approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. "State space" refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State space &amp; linear systems|series=Schaum's outline series |publisher=McGraw Hill|author=Donald M Wiberg|isbn=0-07-070096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Terrell, William|title=Some fundamental control theory I: Controllability, observability, and duality —AND— Some fundamental control Theory II: Feedback linearization of single input nonlinear systems|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=106|year=1999|pages=705–719 and 812–828|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/some-fundamental-control-theory-i-controllability-observability-and-duality-and-some-fundamental|doi=10.2307/2589614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System interfacing - SISO &amp; MIMO==
Control systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs.
* [[Single-input single-output system|Single-input single-output]] (SISO) – This is the simplest and most common type, in which one output is controlled by one control signal.  Examples are the cruise control example above, or an [[audio system]], in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output is the sound waves from the speaker. 
* [[MIMO|Multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) – These are found in more complicated systems.  For example, modern large [[telescope]]s such as the [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] and [[MMT Observatory|MMT]] have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an [[actuator]].  The shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a MIMO [[active optics]] control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane, to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion, contraction, stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the [[wavefront]] due to turbulence in the atmosphere.  Complicated systems such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and human [[cell (biology)|cells]] are simulated by a computer as large MIMO control systems.

==Topics in control theory==

===Stability===

The ''stability'' of a general [[dynamical system]] with no input can be described with [[Lyapunov stability]] criteria.
*A [[linear system]] is called [[BIBO stability|bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable]] if its output will stay [[bounded function|bounded]] for any bounded input.
*Stability for [[nonlinear system]]s that take an input is [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS), which combines Lyapunov stability and a notion similar to BIBO stability.

For simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time '''linear systems'''.

Mathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its [[transfer function]] must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero.  Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside
* in the open left half of the [[complex plane]] for continuous time, when the [[Laplace transform]] is used to obtain the transfer function.
* inside the [[unit circle]] for discrete time, when the [[Z-transform]] is used.
The difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions. The continuous Laplace transform is in [[Cartesian coordinates]] where the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is the real axis and the discrete Z-transform is in [[circular coordinates]] where the &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; axis is the real axis.

When the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]]; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.

If a system in question has an [[impulse response]] of

:&lt;math&gt;\ x[n] = 0.5^n u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

then the Z-transform (see [[Z-transform#Example 2 (causal ROC)|this example]]), is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

which has a pole in &lt;math&gt;z = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; (zero [[imaginary number|imaginary part]]). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is ''inside'' the unit circle.

However, if the impulse response was

:&lt;math&gt;\ x[n] = 1.5^n u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

then the Z-transform is

:&lt;math&gt;\ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - 1.5z^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

which has a pole at &lt;math&gt;z = 1.5&lt;/math&gt; and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one.

Numerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the [[root locus]], [[Bode plot]]s or the [[Nyquist plot]]s.

Mechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use [[Ship stability#Stabilizer fins|antiroll fins]] that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.

===Controllability and observability===
{{Main| Controllability|Observability}}

[[Controllability]] and [[observability]] are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed ''stabilizable''. Observability instead is related to the possibility of ''observing'', through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.

From a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every "bad" state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the [[eigenvalues]] of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.

Solutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.

===Control specification===
Several different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones ([[PID controller]]), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially [[robotics]] or aircraft cruise control).

A control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have &lt;math&gt;Re[\lambda] &lt; -\overline{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that &lt;math&gt;Re[\lambda]&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Another typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an [[integrator]] in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.

Other "classical" control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system. These include the [[rise time]] (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ([[settling time]], quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to [[robust control|robustness]] (see after).

Modern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE,ISA,CQI).

===Model identification and robustness===
A control system must always have some robustness property. A [[robust control]]ler is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This requirement is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible.

;System identification
{{details|System identification}}
The process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called [[system identification]]. This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its [[transfer function]] or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, in the case of a [[Damping#Example: mass–spring–damper|mass-spring-damper]] system we know that &lt;math&gt; m \ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \Beta \dot{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Even assuming that a "complete" model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called "nominal parameters") are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.

Some advanced control techniques include an "on-line" identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated ("identified") while the controller itself is running. In this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues, for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight, the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.

;Analysis
Analysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using [[Nyquist diagram|Nyquist]] and [[Bode diagram]]s. Topics include [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain and phase margin]] and amplitude margin. For MIMO (multi-input multi output) and, in general, more complicated control systems, one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section). I.e., if particular robustness qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties.

;Constraints
A particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: [[model predictive control]] (see later), and [[anti-wind up system (control)|anti-wind up systems]]. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.

==System classifications==

===Linear systems control===
{{Main|State space (controls)}}
For MIMO systems, pole placement can be performed mathematically using a [[State space (controls)|state space representation]] of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.

===Nonlinear systems control===
{{Main|Nonlinear control}}
Processes in industries like [[robotics]] and the [[aerospace industry]] typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., [[feedback linearization]], [[backstepping]], [[sliding mode control]], trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on [[Lyapunov's theory]]. [[Differential geometry]] has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.  Control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states.&lt;ref name=Shi_Gu_et_al&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Gu Shi|year = 2015 |title = Controllability of structural brain networks (Article Number 8414) |journal = Nature Communications |quote = Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure.  |laysummary = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html |doi = 10.1038/ncomms9414|issue = 6 |display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1406.5197|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8414G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decentralized systems control===
{{Main|Distributed control system}}
When the system is controlled by multiple controllers, the problem is one of decentralized control. Decentralization is helpful in many ways, for instance, it helps control systems to operate over a larger geographical area. The agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions.

===Deterministic and stochastic systems control===
{{Main|Stochastic control}}

A stochastic control problem is one in which the evolution of the state variables is subjected to random shocks from outside the system. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks.

==Main control strategies==
Every control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For [[linear system]]s, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]]'s Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen.

;List of the main control techniques

*[[Adaptive control]] uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the [[aerospace industry]] in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.
*A [[hierarchical control system]] is a type of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[networked control system]].
*[[Intelligent control]] uses various AI computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A novel fuzzy framework for nonlinear system control| journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems | year=2010 | last=Liu |first1=Jie |author2=Wilson Wang |author3=Farid Golnaraghi |author4=Eric Kubica | volume=161 | issue=21 | pages=2746–2759 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2010.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to control a [[dynamic system]].
*[[Optimal control]] is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain "cost index": for example, in the case of a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC) and [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the "optimal control" structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in [[process control]].
*[[Robust control]] deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design.  Controllers designed using ''robust control'' methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=Paul|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Robustness of Adaptation in Controlled Self-Adjusting Chaotic Systems |journal=Fluctuation and Noise Letters |date=2002|doi=10.1142/S0219477502000919}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness.  Examples of modern robust control techniques include [[H-infinity loop-shaping]] developed by [[Duncan McFarlane]] and [[Keith Glover]] of [[Cambridge University]], United Kingdom, [[Sliding mode control]] (SMC) developed by [[Vadim Utkin]], and safe protocols designed for control of large heterogeneous populations of electric loads in Smart Power Grid applications.&lt;ref name='TCL1'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Safe Protocols for Generating Power Pulses with Heterogeneous Populations of Thermostatically Controlled Loads |author=N. A. Sinitsyn. S. Kundu, S. Backhaus |journal=[[Energy Conversion and Management]]|volume=67|year=2013|pages=297–308|arxiv=1211.0248|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2012.11.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robust methods aim to achieve robust performance and/or [[Stability theory|stability]] in the presence of small modeling errors.
*[[Stochastic control]] deals with control design with uncertainty in the model. In typical stochastic control problems, it is assumed that there exist random noise and disturbances in the model and the controller, and the control design must take into account these random deviations.
*[[Energy-shaping control]] view the plant and the controller as energy-transformation devices. The control strategy is formulated in terms of interconnection (in a power-preserving manner) in order to achieve a desired behavior.
*[[Self-organized criticality control]] may be defined as attempts to interfere in the processes by which the [[self-organized]] system dissipates energy.

==People in systems and control==
{{Main|People in systems and control}}
Many active and historical figures made significant contribution to control theory including
* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] invented the [[Z-transform]] in his work on [[probability theory]], now used to solve discrete-time control theory problems. The Z-transform is a discrete-time equivalent of the [[Laplace transform]] which is named after him.
* [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of [[bang-bang control|discontinuous automatic control]] and applied it to [[autopilot|automatic aircraft control systems]].
* [[Alexander Lyapunov]] in the 1890s marks the beginning of [[stability theory]].
* [[Harold Stephen Black|Harold S. Black]] invented the concept of [[negative feedback amplifier]]s in 1927. He managed to develop stable negative feedback amplifiers in the 1930s.
* [[Harry Nyquist]] developed the [[Nyquist stability criterion]] for feedback systems in the 1930s.
* [[Richard Bellman]] developed [[dynamic programming]] since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=[[Richard Bellman]] |date=1964 |title=Control Theory |url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v211/n3/pdf/scientificamerican0964-186.pdf |magazine=[[Scientific American]] |volume=211 |issue=3 |pages=186–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] co-developed the [[Wiener filter|Wiener–Kolmogorov filter]] in 1941.
* [[Norbert Wiener]] co-developed the Wiener–Kolmogorov filter and coined the term [[cybernetics]] in the 1940s.
* [[John R. Ragazzini]] introduced [[digital control]] and the use of [[Z-transform]] in control theory (invented by Laplace) in the 1950s.
* [[Lev Pontryagin]] introduced the [[Pontryagin's minimum principle|maximum principle]] and the [[Bang-bang control|bang-bang principle]].
* [[Pierre-Louis Lions]]  developed [[viscosity solutions]] into stochastic control and [[optimal control]] methods.
* [[Rudolf Kalman]]  pioneered the [[state-space]] approach to systems and control. Introduced the notions of [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. Developed the [[Kalman filter]] for linear estimation.
* [[Ali H. Nayfeh]]  who was one of the main contributors to Non-Linear Control Theory and published many books on Perturbation Methods
* [[Jan Camiel Willems|Jan C. Willems]] Introduced the concept of dissipativity, as a generalization of [[Lyapunov function]] to input/state/output systems.The construction of the storage function, as the analogue of a Lyapunov function is called, led to the study of the [[linear matrix inequality]] (LMI) in control theory.  He pioneered the behavioral approach to mathematical systems theory.

In some cases the organisation may not even be aware that the data is being collected.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/06/17/the-api-briefing-the-challenge-of-governments-dark-data/|title=The API Briefing: the Challenge of Government’s Dark Data|work=digitalgov.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM]] estimate that roughly 90 percent of data generated by [[sensor]]s and [[analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital conversions]] never get used.&lt;ref name="IBM3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digging up dark data: What puts IBM at the forefront of insight economy {{!}} #IBMinsight|url = http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/30/ibm-is-at-the-forefront-of-insight-economy-ibminsight/|website = SiliconANGLE|accessdate = 2015-11-03|language = en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an industrial context, dark data can include information gathered by sensors and [[telematic]]s.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/teradata/2015/02/19/factories-of-the-future-the-value-of-dark-data/|title=TeradataVoice: Factories Of The Future: The Value Of Dark Data|author=Teradata|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations retain dark data for a multitude of reasons, and it is estimated that most companies are only analyzing 1% of their data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/big-data-challenge-transformation-manufacturing-industry? The big data challenge of transformation for the manufacturing industry]&lt;/ref&gt; Often it is stored for regulatory compliance&lt;ref&gt;[https://spotlessdata.com/blog/dark-data-data-cleansing Are you using your dark data effectively]&lt;/ref&gt; and record keeping.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some organizations believe that dark data could be useful to them in the future, once they have acquired better analytic and [[business intelligence]] technology to process the information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r1soft.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dark Data: What is it and Why Should I Care?|url = http://www.r1soft.com/blog/dark-data-what-is-it-and-why-should-i-care|website = www.r1soft.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because storage is inexpensive, storing data is easy. However, storing and securing the data usually entails greater expenses (or even risk) than the potential return profit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
A lot of dark data is unstructured, which means that the information is in formats that may be difficult to categorise, be read by the computer and thus analysed. Often the reason that business do not analyse their dark data is because of the amount of resources it would take and the difficulty of having that data analysed.  According to [[Computer Weekly]], 60% of organisations believe that their own [[business intelligence]] reporting capability is "inadequate" and 65% say that they have "somewhat disorganised content management approaches".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dark data could halt big data’s path to success|url = http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Dark-data-could-halt-big-datas-path-to-success|website = ComputerWeekly|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance ==
Useful data may become dark data after it becomes irrelevant, as it is not processed fast enough. This is called "perishable insights" in "live flowing data". For example, if the geolocation of a customer is known to a business, the business can make offer based on the location, however if this data is not processed immediately, it may be irrelevant in the future. According to IBM, about 60 percent of data loses its value immediately.&lt;ref name="IBM3"/&gt; Not analysing data immediately and letting it go 'dark' can lead to significant losses for an organisation in terms of not identifying fraud, for example, fast enough and then only addressing the issue when it is too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deriving Value from Data Before It Goes Dark|url = http://insidebigdata.com/2015/10/12/deriving-value-from-data-before-it-goes-dark/|website = insideBIGDATA|accessdate = 2015-11-04|first = Daniel|last = Gutierrez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage ==
According to the [[The New York Times|New York Times]], 90% of energy used by data centres is wasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Data Centers Waste Vast Amounts of Energy, Belying Industry Image|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2012-09-22|access-date = 2015-11-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = James|last = Glanz}}&lt;/ref&gt; If data was not stored, energy costs could be saved. Furthermore, there are costs associated with the underutilisation of information and thus missed opportunities. According to Datamation, "the storage environments of EMEA organizations consist of 54 percent dark data, 32 percent Redundant, Obsolete and Trivial data and 14 percent business-critical data. By 2020, this can add up to $891 billion in storage and management costs that can otherwise be avoided."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Enterprises are Hoarding 'Dark' Data: Veritas - Datamation|url = http://www.datamation.com/storage/enterprises-are-hoarding-dark-data-veritas.html|website = www.datamation.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuous storage of dark data can put an organisation at risk, especially if this data is sensitive. In the case of a breach, this can result in serious repercussions. These can be financial, legal and can seriously hurt an organisation's reputation. For example, a breach of private records of customers could result in the stealing of sensitive information, which could result in [[identity theft]]. Another example could be the breach of the company's own sensitive information, for example relating to [[research and development]]. These risks can be mitigated by assessing and auditing whether this data is useful to the organisation, employing strong encryption and security and finally, if it is determined to be discarded, then it should be discarded in a way that it becomes unretrievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Dangers of Dark Data and How to Minimize Your Exposure|url = http://www.cio.com/article/2686755/data-analytics/the-dangers-of-dark-data-and-how-to-minimize-your-exposure.html|website = CIO|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==
It is generally considered that as more advanced computing systems for analysis of data are built, the higher the value of dark data will be. It has been noted that "data and analytics will be the foundation of the modern industrial revolution".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Of course, this includes data that is currently considered "dark data" since there are not enough resources to process it. All this data that is being collected can be used in the future to bring maximum productivity and an ability for organisations to meet consumers' demand. Furthermore, many organisations do not realise the value of dark data right now, for example in healthcare and education organisations deal with large amounts of data that could create a significant "potential to service students and patients in the manner in which the consumer and financial services pursue their target population".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leveraging Dark Data: Q&amp;A with Melissa McCormack - Predictive Analytics Times - predictive analytics &amp; big data news|url = http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/patimes/leveraging-dark-data-qa-melissa-mccormack/4109/|website = Predictive Analytics Times|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ernst Ruska Electron Microscope - Deutsches Museum - Munich-edit.jpg|thumb|right|Electron microscope constructed by [[Ernst Ruska]] in 1933]]

An '''electron microscope''' is a microscope that uses a beam of accelerated [[electron]]s as a source of illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light [[photon]]s, electron microscopes have a higher [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] than [[optical microscope|light microscope]]s and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A [[scanning transmission electron microscope]] has achieved better than 50&amp;nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]] resolution in [[annular dark-field imaging]] mode&lt;ref name="erni"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.096101|title=Atomic-Resolution Imaging with a Sub-50-pm Electron Probe|year=2009|author=Erni, Rolf|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=102|page=096101|pmid=19392535|last2=Rossell|first2=MD|last3=Kisielowski|first3=C|last4=Dahmen|first4=U|issue=9|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102i6101E| url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cs0m4vr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[magnification]]s of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most [[light microscope]]s are limited by [[diffraction]] to about 200&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.

Electron microscopes have [[electron optics|electron optical lens]] systems that are analogous to the glass lenses of an optical light microscope.

Electron microscopes are used to investigate the [[ultrastructure]] of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including [[microorganisms]], [[cell (biology)|cells]], large [[molecules]], [[biopsy]] samples, [[metals]], and [[crystalline|crystals]]. Industrially, electron microscopes are often used for quality control and [[failure analysis]]. Modern electron microscopes produce electron [[micrograph]]s using specialized digital cameras and [[frame grabber]]s to capture the images.

According to [[Dennis Gabor]], the physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] tried in 1928 to convince him to build an electron microscope, for which he had filed a patent.&lt;ref&gt;Dannen, Gene (1998)  [http://www.dannen.com/budatalk.html Leo Szilard the Inventor: A Slideshow (1998, Budapest, conference talk)]. dannen.com&lt;/ref&gt; The first prototype electron microscope, capable of four-hundred-power magnification, was developed in 1931 by the physicist [[Ernst Ruska]] and the electrical engineer [[Max Knoll]].&lt;ref&gt;Mathys, Daniel, Zentrum für Mikroskopie, [[University of Basel]]: ''Die Entwicklung der Elektronenmikroskopie vom Bild über die Analyse zum Nanolabor'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The apparatus was the first practical demonstration of the principles of electron microscopy.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/ruska-autobio.html |title=Ernst Ruska Autobiography |accessdate=2010-01-31 |author=Ruska, Ernst |year=1986 |publisher=Nobel Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, [[Reinhold Rudenberg]], the scientific director of [[Siemens-Schuckertwerke]], obtained a patent for an electron microscope.

{{Main|Transmission electron microscope}}

[[File:Transmission Electron Microscope operating principle.ogg|thumb|upright=1.5|Operating principle of a transmission electron microscope]]

The original form of the electron microscope, the [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM), uses a [[high voltage]] [[electron beam]] to illuminate the specimen and create an image. The electron beam is produced by an [[electron gun]], commonly fitted with a [[tungsten]] filament [[cathode]] as the electron source. The electron beam is accelerated by an [[anode]] typically at +100 k[[Electronvolt|eV]] (40 to 400 keV) with respect to the cathode, focused by [[electrostatic]] and [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] lenses, and transmitted through the specimen that is in part transparent to electrons and in part [[Electron scattering|scatters]] them out of the beam. When it emerges from the specimen, the electron beam carries information about the structure of the specimen that is magnified by the [[objective lens]] system of the microscope. The spatial variation in this information (the "image") may be viewed by projecting the magnified electron image onto a fluorescent viewing screen coated with a [[phosphor]] or [[scintillator]] material such as zinc sulfide. Alternatively, the image can be photographically recorded by exposing a [[photographic film]] or [[photographic plate|plate]] directly to the electron beam, or a high-resolution phosphor may be coupled by means of a lens optical system or a [[fibre optic]] light-guide to the sensor of a [[digital camera]]. The image detected by the digital camera may be displayed on a monitor or computer.

The resolution of TEMs is limited primarily by [[spherical aberration]], but a new generation of hardware correctors can reduce spherical aberration to increase the resolution in [[high-resolution transmission electron microscopy]] (HRTEM) to below 0.5 [[angstrom]] (50 [[picometre]]s),&lt;ref name="erni" /&gt; enabling magnifications above 50 million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/scale_of_things.html |title=The Scale of Things |date=2006-05-26 |publisher=Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201175106/http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/scale_of_things.html |archivedate=2010-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of HRTEM to determine the positions of atoms within materials is useful for nano-technologies research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = O'Keefe MA |author2 = Allard LF |title = Sub-Ångstrom Electron Microscopy for Sub-Ångstrom Nano-Metrology|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/821768-E3YVgN/native/821768.pdf |publisher=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information – Sponsored by OSTI |format=PDF |date=2004-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission electron microscopes are often used in [[electron diffraction]] mode. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are that the specimen need not be a single crystal or even a polycrystalline powder, and also that the Fourier transform reconstruction of the object's magnified structure occurs physically and thus avoids the need for solving the [[phase problem]] faced by the X-ray crystallographers after obtaining their X-ray diffraction patterns of a single crystal or polycrystalline powder.

One major disadvantage of the transmission electron microscope is the need for extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a [[focused ion beam]]. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers, and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.

===Serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM)===
One application of TEM is serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM), for example in analyzing the connectivity in volumetric samples of brain tissue by imaging many thin sections in sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Yoo, Inwan, David GC Hildebrand, Willie F. Tobin, Wei-Chung Allen Lee, and Won-Ki Jeong. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FcE0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=%22serial+section+electron+microscopy%22+ssem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif6O69ncPbAhWOHHwKHULMDMYQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22serial%20section%20electron%20microscopy%22%20ssem&amp;f=false "ssEMnet: Serial-section Electron Microscopy Image Registration using a Spatial Transformer Network with Learned Features"] In Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis and Multimodal Learning for Clinical Decision Support, pp. 249-257.

=== Scanning electron microscope (SEM) ===

[[File:Scanning Electron Microscope.ogv|thumb|upright=1.5|Operating principe of a scanning electron microscope]]

{{Main|Scanning electron microscope}}
[[File:Bacillus subtilis image.jpg|thumb|Image of bacillus subtilis taken with a 1960s electron microscope]]
The SEM produces images by probing the specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across a rectangular area of the specimen ([[raster scan]]ning). When the electron beam interacts with the specimen, it loses energy by a variety of mechanisms. The lost energy is converted into alternative forms such as heat, emission of [[secondary emission|low-energy secondary electrons]] and high-energy backscattered electrons, light emission ([[cathodoluminescence]]) or [[X-ray]] emission, all of which provide signals carrying information about the properties of the specimen surface, such as its topography and composition. The image displayed by an SEM maps the varying intensity of any of these signals into the image in a position corresponding to the position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated. In the SEM image of an ant shown below and to the right, the image was constructed from signals produced by a secondary electron detector, the normal or conventional imaging mode in most SEMs.

Generally, the image resolution of an SEM is lower than that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high-resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with [[environmental scanning electron microscope]]s (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.[[File:Ant SEM.jpg|thumb|right|An image of an [[ant]] in a scanning electron microscope]]

=== Color ===
In their most common configurations, electron microscopes produce images with a single brightness value per pixel, with the results usually rendered in [[grayscale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Jeremy|title=Under the Microscope: A Hidden World Revealed|year=1987|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-39940-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30A5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, often these images are then colorized through the use of feature-detection software, or simply by hand-editing using a graphics editor. This may be done to clarify structure or for aesthetic effect and generally does not add new information about the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Electron Microscopy|url=http://www.fei.com/uploadedfiles/documents/content/introduction_to_em_booklet_july_10.pdf|publisher=FEI Company|accessdate=12 December 2012|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some configurations information about several specimen properties is gathered per pixel, usually by the use of multiple detectors.&lt;ref name="ColourInSEMImaging"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antonovsky |first=A. |year=1984 |title=The application of colour to sem imaging for increased definition |journal=Micron and Microscopica Acta |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=77–84 |doi=10.1016/0739-6260(84)90005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In SEM, the attributes of topography and material contrast can be obtained by a pair of backscattered electron detectors and such attributes can be superimposed in a single color image by assigning a different primary color to each attribute.&lt;ref name=ColorSEMImages2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danilatos |first=G.D. |year=1986 |title= Colour micrographs for backscattered electron signals in the SEM|journal=Scanning |volume=9 |issue= 3|pages=8–18|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1986.tb04287.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a combination of backscattered and secondary electron signals can be assigned to different colors and superimposed on a single color micrograph displaying simultaneously the properties of the specimen.&lt;ref name=ColorSEMImages3&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danilatos |first=G.D. |year=1986 |title= Environmental scanning electron microscopy in colour|journal=J. Microscopy |volume=142 |pages=317–325|doi=10.1002/sca.4950080104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of detectors used in SEM have analytical capabilities, and can provide several items of data at each pixel. Examples are the [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and [[Cathodoluminescence microscope]] (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced [[luminescence]] in (for example) geological specimens.  In SEM systems using these detectors, it is common to color code the signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared.  Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal, which is not modified in any way.

=== Reflection electron microscope (REM) ===
In the '''reflection electron microscope''' (REM) as in the TEM, an electron beam is incident on a surface but instead of using the transmission (TEM) or secondary electrons (SEM), the reflected beam of [[Elastic scattering|elastically scattered electrons]] is detected. This technique is typically coupled with [[RHEED|reflection high energy electron diffraction]] (RHEED) and ''reflection high-energy loss spectroscopy (RHELS)''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Another variation is spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy ([[SPLEEM]]), which is used for looking at the microstructure of [[magnetic domain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncem.lbl.gov/frames/spleem.html |publisher=National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) |title=SPLEEM |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529185331/http://ncem.lbl.gov/frames/spleem.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) ===
{{Main|Scanning transmission electron microscopy}}
The STEM rasters a focused incident probe across a specimen that (as with the TEM) has been thinned to facilitate detection of electrons scattered ''through'' the specimen. The high resolution of the TEM is thus possible in STEM. The focusing action (and aberrations) occur before the electrons hit the specimen in the STEM, but afterward in the TEM. The STEMs use of SEM-like beam rastering simplifies [[annular dark-field imaging]], and other analytical techniques, but also means that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion. Often TEM can be equipped with the scanning option and then it can function both as TEM and STEM.

== Sample preparation ==
[[File:Golden insect 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|An insect [[sputter coating|coated in gold]] for viewing with a scanning electron microscope]]
Materials to be viewed under an electron microscope may require processing to produce a suitable sample. The technique required varies depending on the specimen and the analysis required:
* ''Chemical [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]'' – for biological specimens aims to stabilize the specimen's mobile macromolecular structure by chemical crosslinking of [[protein]]s with [[aldehyde]]s such as [[formaldehyde]] and [[glutaraldehyde]], and [[lipid]]s with [[osmium tetroxide]].
* ''[[Negative stain]]'' – suspensions containing nanoparticles or fine biological material (such as viruses and bacteria) are briefly mixed with a dilute solution of an electron-opaque solution such as ammonium molybdate, uranyl acetate (or formate), or phosphotungstic acid. This mixture is applied to a suitably coated EM grid, blotted, then allowed to dry. Viewing of this preparation in the TEM should be carried out without delay for best results. The method is important in microbiology for fast but crude morphological identification, but can also be used as the basis for high-resolution 3D reconstruction using EM tomography methodology when carbon films are used for support. Negative staining is also used for observation of nanoparticles.
* ''[[Cryofixation]]'' – freezing a specimen so rapidly, in [[liquid ethane]], and maintained at liquid nitrogen or even [[liquid helium]] temperatures, so that the water forms [[Amorphous ice|vitreous (non-crystalline) ice]]. This preserves the specimen in a snapshot of its solution state. An entire field called [[cryo-electron microscopy]] has branched from this technique. With the development of [[cryo-electron microscopy]] of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), it is now possible to observe samples from virtually any biological specimen close to its native state.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* ''Dehydration'' – or replacement of [[water]] with organic solvents such as [[ethanol]] or [[acetone]], followed by [[critical point drying]] or infiltration with embedding [[resins]]. Also [[freeze drying]].
* ''Embedding, biological specimens'' – after dehydration, tissue for observation in the transmission electron microscope is embedded so it can be sectioned ready for viewing. To do this the tissue is passed through a 'transition solvent' such as [[propylene oxide]] (epoxypropane) or [[acetone]] and then infiltrated with an [[epoxy]] [[resin]] such as [[Araldite]], Epon, or [[Durcupan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* ''Embedding, materials'' – after embedding in resin, the specimen is usually ground and polished to a mirror-like finish using ultra-fine abrasives. The polishing process must be performed carefully to minimize scratches and other polishing artifacts that reduce image quality.
* ''Metal shadowing'' – Metal (e.g. [[platinum]]) is evaporated from an overhead electrode and applied to the surface of a biological sample at an angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=R. C.|last2=Wyckoff|first2=R. W.|date=1945-06-08|title=Electron shadow micrography of the tobacco mosaic virus protein|journal=Science |volume=101|issue=2632|pages=594–596|doi=10.1126/science.101.2632.594|pmid=17739444|bibcode=1945Sci...101..594W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface topography results in variations in the thickness of the metal that are seen as variations in brightness and contrast in the electron microscope image.
* ''Replication'' – A surface shadowed with metal (e.g. platinum, or a mixture of carbon and platinum) at an angle is coated with pure carbon evaporated from carbon electrodes at right angles to the surface. This is followed by removal of the specimen material (e.g. in an acid bath, using enzymes or by mechanical separation&lt;ref name="Juniper"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=B.E.|last1=Juniper|first2=D.E.|last2=Bradley|journal=Journal of Ultrastructure Research|volume=2|issue=1|year=1958|pages=16–27|title=The carbon replica technique in the study of the ultrastructure of leaf surfaces|doi=10.1016/s0022-5320(58)90045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to produce a surface replica that records the surface ultrastructure and can be examined using transmission electron microscopy.
* ''Sectioning'' – produces thin slices of the specimen, semitransparent to electrons. These can be cut on an [[ultramicrotome]] with a glass or [[diamond]] knife to produce ultra-thin sections about 60–90&amp;nbsp;nm thick. Disposable [[glass knives]] are also used because they can be made in the lab and are much cheaper.
* ''[[Staining]]'' – uses heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[uranium]] or [[tungsten]] to scatter imaging electrons and thus give contrast between different structures, since many (especially biological) materials are nearly "transparent" to electrons (weak phase objects). In biology, specimens can be stained "en bloc" before embedding and also later after sectioning. Typically thin sections are stained for several minutes with an aqueous or alcoholic solution of [[uranyl acetate]] followed by aqueous lead citrate.&lt;ref name=Reynolds63&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reynolds | first=E.

The cold fractured surface (sometimes "etched" by increasing the temperature to about −100&amp;nbsp;°C for several minutes to let some ice sublime) is then shadowed with evaporated platinum or gold at an average angle of 45° in a high vacuum evaporator. The second coat of carbon, evaporated perpendicular to the average surface plane is often performed to improve the stability of the replica coating. The specimen is returned to room temperature and pressure, then the extremely fragile "pre-shadowed" metal replica of the fracture surface is released from the underlying biological material by careful chemical digestion with acids, [[hypochlorite]] solution or [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]] detergent. The still-floating replica is thoroughly washed free from residual chemicals, carefully fished up on fine grids, dried then viewed in the TEM.
* ''Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling (FRIL)'' – the freeze-fracture method has been modified to allow the identification of the components of the fracture face by immunogold labeling. Instead of removing all the underlying tissue of the thawed replica as the final step before viewing in the microscope the tissue thickness is minimized during or after the fracture process. The thin layer of tissue remains bound to the metal replica so it can be immunogold labeled with antibodies to the structures of choice. The thin layer of the original specimen on the replica with gold attached allows the identification of structures in the fracture plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1987-03-01|title=Immunolocalization of MP70 in lens fiber 16-17-nm intercellular junctions|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=104|issue=3|pages=565–572|pmc=2114558|pmid=3818793|author1=Gruijters|first1=W.

* ''Ion beam milling'' – thins samples until they are transparent to electrons by firing [[ions]] (typically [[argon]]) at the surface from an angle and sputtering material from the surface. A subclass of this is [[focused ion beam]] milling, where [[gallium]] ions are used to produce an electron transparent membrane in a specific region of the sample, for example through a device within a microprocessor. Ion beam milling may also be used for cross-section polishing prior to SEM analysis of materials that are difficult to prepare using mechanical polishing.
* ''Conductive coating'' – an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited either by high vacuum evaporation or by low vacuum sputter coating of the sample. This is done to prevent the accumulation of static electric fields at the specimen due to the electron irradiation required during imaging. The coating materials include gold, gold/palladium, platinum, tungsten, graphite, etc.
* ''[[ground (electricity)|Earthing]]'' – to avoid electrical charge accumulation on a conductively coated sample, it is usually electrically connected to the metal sample holder. Often an [[electrically conductive adhesive]] is used for this purpose.

== Disadvantages ==
Electron microscopes are expensive to build and maintain, on the order of other complex machines such as airplanes. Microscopes designed to achieve high resolutions must be housed in stable buildings (sometimes underground) with special services such as magnetic field canceling systems.  Operating the electron microscope requires  specialized training and continuing practice and education.

The samples largely have to be viewed in [[vacuum]], as the molecules that make up air would scatter the electrons.

Scanning electron microscopes operating in conventional high-vacuum mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore non-conductive materials require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.). The low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible the observation of non-conductive specimens without coating.  Non-conductive materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or environmental) scanning electron microscope.

Small, stable specimens such as [[carbon nanotubes]], [[diatom]] frustules and small mineral crystals (asbestos fibres, for example) require no special treatment before being examined in the electron microscope. Samples of hydrated materials, including almost all biological specimens have to be prepared in various ways to stabilize them, reduce their thickness (ultrathin sectioning) and increase their electron optical contrast (staining). These processes may result in ''[[Visual artifact#In microscopy|artifacts]]'', but these can usually be identified by comparing the results obtained by using radically different specimen preparation methods. Since the 1980s, analysis of [[cryofixation|cryofixed]], vitrified specimens has also become increasingly used by scientists, further confirming the validity of this technique.&lt;ref name="Adrian1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adrian |first=Marc |author2=Dubochet, Jacques |author3=Lepault, Jean |author4= McDowall, Alasdair W.  |year=1984 |title=Cryo-electron microscopy of viruses |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5954 |pages=32–36 |doi=10.1038/308032a0 |pmid=6322001|bibcode = 1984Natur.308...32A |url=https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_BEC796503260 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sabanay1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sabanay |first=I. |author2=Arad, T. |author3=Weiner, S. |author4= Geiger, B.  |year=1991|title=Study of vitrified, unstained frozen tissue sections by cryoimmunoelectron microscopy |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=227–236 |pmid=1795028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasas |first=S. |author2=Dumas, G. |author3=Dietler, G. |author4=Catsicas, S. |author5= Adrian, M.  |year=2003 |title=Vitrification of cryoelectron microscopy specimens revealed by high-speed photographic imaging |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=211 |issue=1 |pages=48–53 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2818.2003.01193.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3367">'''Karl Ludwig Felix Machatschki''' (22 September 1895 &amp;ndash; 17 February 1970) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]]. 

He was born in [[Arnfels]] (near [[Leibnitz]]) in [[Styria]], [[Austria]]. He studied at the [[University of Graz]], obtaining his [[habilitation]] in 1925; in 1927 he joined the group of [[Victor Goldschmidt]] in [[Oslo]] for one year. In 1930 he was appointed as a professor at the [[University of Tübingen]].

'Fermentation in food processing' is the process of converting [[carbohydrate]]s to [[alcohol]] or organic acids using [[microorganisms]]—[[yeast]]s or [[bacteria]]—under [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions. [[Fermentation]] usually implies that the action of microorganisms is desired. The science of fermentation is known as [[zymology]] or zymurgy.

The term fermentation sometimes refers specifically to the chemical conversion of [[sugar]]s into [[ethanol]], producing alcoholic drinks such as [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[cider]]. However, similar processes take place in the [[leavening]] of [[bread]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by yeast activity), and in the preservation of sour foods with the production of [[lactic acid]], such as in  [[sauerkraut]] and [[yogurt]].

Other widely consumed fermented foods include [[vinegar]], [[olives]], and [[cheese]]. More localised foods prepared by fermentation may also be based on beans, grain, vegetables, fruit, honey, dairy products, fish, meat, or tea.

Natural fermentation precedes human history. Since ancient times, humans have exploited the fermentation process. The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation was 13,000 year old residues of a beer with the consistency of gruel, in a cave near Haifa in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='World's oldest brewery' found in cave in Israel, say researchers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45534133 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=15 September 2018 |date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early alcoholic drink, made from fruit, rice, and honey, dates from 7000 to 6600 BC, in the [[Neolithic China|Neolithic Chinese]] village of [[Jiahu]],&lt;ref name="mcgovern"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=McGovern | first1=P.

The French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] founded [[zymology]], when in 1856 he connected yeast to fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fermentation |url=http://www.coe.uga.edu/ttie/documents/biotech.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530081705/http://www.coe.uga.edu/ttie/documents/biotech.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
When studying the fermentation of sugar to [[alcohol]] by [[yeast]], Pasteur concluded that the fermentation was catalyzed by a vital force, called "[[Vitalism|ferments]]", within the yeast cells.  The "ferments" were thought to function only within living organisms.  "Alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dubos, J. |year= 1951 |title= Louis Pasteur: Free Lance of Science, Gollancz. Quoted in Manchester K. L. (1995) Louis Pasteur (1822–1895)--chance and the prepared mind |journal=Trends in Biotechnology |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=511–515 |pmid=8595136 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(00)89014-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote.

Nevertheless, it was known that yeast extracts can ferment sugar even in the absence of living yeast cells. While studying this process in 1897, the German chemist and zymologist [[Eduard Buchner]] of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], [[Germany]], found that sugar was fermented even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1907/buchner-bio.html Nobel Laureate Biography of Eduard Buchner at http://nobelprize.org]&lt;/ref&gt; by an enzyme complex secreted by yeast that he termed ''[[zymase]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/press.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1929|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1907 he received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his research and discovery of "cell-free fermentation".

One year earlier, in 1906, [[ethanol fermentation]] studies led to the early discovery of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=A. | last=Harden |author2=Young, W.J. | title=The Alcoholic Ferment of Yeast-Juice | work=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London | edition=Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character | volume=78 |date=October 1906 | pages=369–375 | issue=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beer and bread.jpg|thumb|Beer and bread, two major uses of fermentation in food]]

Food fermentation is the conversion of sugars and other [[carbohydrate]]s into [[alcohol]] or preservative [[organic acid]]s and [[carbon dioxide]]. All three products have found human uses. The production of alcohol is made use of when fruit [[juice]]s are converted to [[wine]], when grains are made into [[beer]], and when foods rich in starch, such as [[potato]]es, are fermented and then distilled to make spirits such as [[gin]] and [[vodka]]. The production of [[carbon dioxide]] is used to [[leavening agent|leaven]] bread. The production of organic acids is exploited to preserve and flavor vegetables and dairy products.&lt;ref name="HuiMeunier-Goddik2004"&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Hui YH, Meunier-Goddik L, Josephsen J, Nip WK, Stanfield PS |title=Handbook of Food and Beverage Fermentation Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PC_O7u1NPZEC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=2004 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-5122-7 |pages=27 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food fermentation serves five main purposes: to enrich the diet through development of a diversity of flavors, aromas, and textures in food substrates; to preserve substantial amounts of food through [[lactic acid]], [[alcohol]], [[acetic acid]], and [[alkaline]] fermentations; to enrich food substrates with protein, [[essential amino acids]], and vitamins; to eliminate [[antinutrients]]; and to reduce cooking time and the associated use of fuel.&lt;ref name=Steinkraus&gt;{{cite book |editor=Steinkraus, K.H. |date=1995 |title=Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods |publisher=Marcel Dekker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
[[Alaska]] has witnessed a steady increase of cases of [[botulism]] since 1985.&lt;ref name=Alaska&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/phtn/botulism/alaska/alaska.asp |title=Why does Alaska have more botulism |author= |work= |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. federal agency) |accessdate=18 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807175105/http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/phtn/botulism/alaska/alaska.asp |archivedate=7 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has more cases of botulism than any other state in the United States of America. This is caused by the traditional [[Eskimo]] practice of allowing animal products such as whole fish, fish heads, [[walrus]], [[sea lion]], and [[whale]] flippers, [[beaver]] tails, seal oil, and birds, to ferment for an extended period of time before being consumed. The risk is exacerbated when a [[plastic container]] is used for this purpose instead of the old-fashioned, traditional method, a grass-lined hole, as the ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' bacteria thrive in the anaerobic conditions created by the air-tight enclosure in plastic.&lt;ref name="Alaska" /&gt;

A '''fuzzy associative matrix''' expresses [[fuzzy logic]] rules in tabular form. These rules usually take two variables as input, mapping cleanly to a two-dimensional matrix, although theoretically a matrix of any number of dimensions is possible.

Suppose a professional is tasked with writing fuzzy logic rules for a video game monster. In the game being built, entities have two variables: hit points (HP) and firepower (FP):

{|border=1
! HP/FP !! Very low HP !! Low HP !! Medium HP !! High HP !! Very high HP
|-
! Very weak FP
| Retreat! || Retreat! || Defend || Defend || Defend
|-
! Weak FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Defend || Attack || Attack
|-
! Medium FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack!
|-
! High FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack!
|-
! Very high FP
| Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack! || Full attack!
|}

This translates to:

 IF MonsterHP IS VeryLowHP AND MonsterFP IS VeryWeakFP THEN Retreat
 IF MonsterHP IS LowHP AND MonsterFP IS VeryWeakFP THEN Retreat
 IF MonsterHP IS MediumHP AND MonsterFP is VeryWeakFP THEN Defend

Multiple rules can fire at once, and often will, because the distinction between "very low" and "low" is fuzzy. If it is more "very low" than it is low, then the "very low" rule will generate a stronger response. The program will evaluate all the rules that fire and use an appropriate [[defuzzification]] method to generate its actual response.

An implementation of this system might use either the matrix or the explicit IF/THEN form. The matrix makes it easy to visualize the system, but it also makes it impossible to add a third variable just for one rule, so it is less flexible.

There is no inherent pattern in the matrix. It appears as if the rules were just made up, and indeed they were. This is both a strength and a weakness of fuzzy logic in general. It is often impractical or impossible to find an exact set of rules or formulae for dealing with a specific situation. For a sufficiently complex game, a mathematician would not be able to study the system and figure out a mathematically accurate set of rules. However, this weakness is intrinsic to the realities of the situation, not of fuzzy logic itself. The strength of the system is that even if one of the rules is wrong, even greatly wrong, other rules that are correct are likely to fire as well and they may compensate for the error.

This does not mean a fuzzy system should be sloppy. Depending on the system, it might get away with being sloppy, but it will underperform. While the rules are fairly arbitrary, they should be chosen carefully. If possible, an expert should decide on the rules, and the sets and rules should be tested vigorously and refined as needed. In this way, a fuzzy system is like an [[expert system]]. (Fuzzy logic is used in many true expert systems, as well.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9605">The '''Gerber Method''' is a primary and historic chemical test to determine the [[fat content of milk|fat content]] of substances, most commonly milk and cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coopersnuthouse.com/maclib/OilAssayDeterminationInMacadamia.html |title=An Analytical Assay for the Determination of Oil Content in Macadamia |accessdate=2008-09-04 |author=Ionel Rosenthal |author2=Uzi Merin |author3=Gita Popel |author4=Solange Bernstein |author5=Amnon Kadman |year=1985 |publisher=Agricultural Research Organization, Israel |quote=Fast and accurate test methods were developed for this purpose. Two, basically similar, methods are in use: the Gerber and the Babcock methods (Atherton &amp; Newlander. 1977). The Gerber method is the standard one in most European countries, whereas the Babcock is more common in many states of the U.S.A., although the Gerber method is also employed. Both methods are based on the digestion of all milk components, except oil, by concentrated sulfuric acid and the separation of the oil from the aqueous phase by centrifugation in special glassware, called butyrometers. In addition to fluid milk products, the Gerber test can be used for the assay of fat in cream, concentrated milk, ice cream, cheeses and sausages (Pearson, 1970), provided that special both-ends-open butyrometers are employed. The very similar Babcock method, with various digesting reagents, has been applied satisfactorily to fish products (Horwitz, 1975).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gerber Method is the primary testing method in [[Europe]] and much of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Ceirwyn S. |title=Analytical Chemistry of Foods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOD6N_J4jnoC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50 |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-28 |year=1994 | publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1298-5 |pages=50–51 |quote=Gerber method.  This is a method used extensively in the UK and Europe for the routine estimation of fat in dairy products.  Specific Gerber tubes, or butyrometers, have been designed for specific dairy products such as whole milk, skimmed milk, cream and cheese.  Methods have been developed for these particular products and also for other dairy products, such as butter and ice cream, by using butyrometers designed for one of the above specific products and modifying the procedure for the alternative products.  Thus, the fat content of butter may be measured by using cream butyrometers and that of ice cream by using whole milk or cheese butyrometers, appropriate modifications to the method being undertaken.&lt;br/&gt; The procedure involves measuring a specified amount of dairy product into the butyrometer, and adding concentrated sulfuric acid (to dissolve the non-fat milk solids) and [[amyl alcohol]] to aid the separation of fat and aqueous phases.  Water is added where necessary to bring the liquid levels to a point where the fat level is on the scale.  The addition of the sulfuric acid causes the temperature of the mixture to increase and the fat to liquif, additional warming in a water bath is occasionally necessary to effect complete liquifying of the fat and also the solubilisation of the non-fat solids.  The mixture is centrifuged in a special Gerber centrifuge for a set time at 1100 rpm, and then the tubes are placed in a water bath to standardize the samples before the fat reading is read off the calibrated scale of the butyrometer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fairly similar [[Babcock test]] is used primarily in the [[United States]], although the Gerber Method also enjoys significant use in the U.S. as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Ceirwyn S. |title=Analytical Chemistry of Foods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOD6N_J4jnoC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50 |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-28 |year=1994 | publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1298-5 |pages=50–51 |quote=Babcock method.  The principle of the Babcock method is similar to that of the Gerber described above.  It differs from the Gerber method in the nature of the glassware used and in the specification of dividers or calipers to measure the length of the fat column.  The Babcock method is widely used in the USA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gerber Method was developed and patented by Dr. [[Niklaus Gerber]] of [[Switzerland]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Badertscher | first = René |author2=Thomas Berger |author3=Rolf Kuhn | title = Densitometric determination of the fat content of milk and milk products | journal = International Dairy Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–23 | publisher = Elsevier Ltd | date = January 2007 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T7C-4JVSVDJ-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d77226eea5d66f5a35e404eaad519351 | doi = 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.013 | accessdate = 2008-08-28 | quote = The fat content of a milk product is an important indication of quality, both economically and physiologically. In the dairy industry, it is mainly determined by using ‘‘quick methods’’. Spectrometric measuring methods are often used. However, these methods have to be calibrated, which is costly. Many laboratories, therefore, are using a method developed by the Swiss chemist and dairy-owner Niklaus Gerber, patented in 1891 under the name ‘‘Acid-Butyrometrie’’. This method is still used because it is simple, fast, low-cost and suitable for a relatively high sample throughput. However, butyrometry has several disadvantages. The determination cannot be automated and involves a certain risk in handling highly concentrated sulphuric acid, especially while reading the butyrometer. Handling the butyrometer requires practical skills, which has a negative effect on the robustness of the method. A great disadvantage is the varying definition of fat compared with the reference methods. In the latter, fat is always defined by extraction with a non-polar solvent. In the butyrometric method, this extraction step is missing. Several attempts have been made to harmonize the fixed butyrometer scale with the values from reference analysis. Even with the costly gravimetric reference methods, attempts were made to automate or simplify the procedure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milk fat is separated from proteins by adding sulfuric acid. The separation is facilitated by using [[amyl alcohol]] and centrifugation. The fat content is read directly via a special calibrated butyrometer.  Gerber developed specialized [[butyrometer]]s (tubes), [[pipettes]], and [[centrifuges]].  Water baths built specifically for the Gerber tubes are often used.

The test is still in widespread use today and is the basis for numerous national and international standards such as ISO 2446, International Dairy Federation (FIL) Regulation 105, BS 696 (United Kingdom), and IS 1223 (India). Larger facilities may prefer to use faster analysis techniques such as [[infrared spectroscopy]] as these greatly reduce the potential for user error and reduce the time and COSHH requirements.

The test continues to be improved and standardized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Association of analytical chemists (AOAC) recommends Gerber test | magazine = Dairy Field | publisher = Stagnito Publishing | date = July 2002 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3846/is_200207/ai_n9110179 | quote = Research was recently published in the Journal of AOAC International, which concludes that the Gerber method be adopted as an official first action for testing butterfat in whole milk. The Gerber method is used worldwide as a simple and rapid method for determining the fat in raw and processed milk. It was first recognized in the United States in 1960 and remains an approved volumetric procedure in Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products. However, it had never gained status as an official method by AOAC. Additionally, the volume of the test portion has not been internationally agreed upon. | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems likely to be encountered during Gerber butterfat content determination ==

The two major defects associated with the Gerber method include:
# '''Charring''' - is observed as tiny black specs at the fat/non-fat interface in the butyrometer. This problem is due to charring of the milk proteins by the concentrated Gerber acid. It could also arise as a result of pouring the milk sample directly onto the acid in the butyrometer. To avoid charring, first, ensure the acid concentration is right. Secondly, while adding the milk sample, let it flow on the side of the butyrometer to avoid violent reaction when it drops on the surface of the acid.
# '''Light colored fat column (with or without brown specs at the interface)''' - may affect your ability to read the fat content correctly. This problem is due to weak acid, which fails to dissolve all the milk non-fat content. To avoid this problem, use sufficient volumes of the Gerber acid at the correct concentration.

The '''International Society for Knowledge Organization''', or '''ISKO''', is the principal [[professional association]] for scholars of [[knowledge organization]], knowledge structures, [[classification]] studies, and [[information]] organization and structure. Founded in 1989, ISKO's mission is "to advance conceptual work in knowledge organization in all kinds of forms, and for all kinds of purposes, such as databases, libraries, dictionaries and the Internet."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isko.org/about.html|title=About ISKO|website=www.isko.org|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interdisciplinary association, ISKO's worldwide membership draws from fields such as [[information science]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[library science]], [[archive]] studies, [[science studies]], and [[computer science]]. ISKO "promotes research, development and applications of [[knowledge organization systems]] that advance the philosophical, psychological and semantic approaches for ordering knowledge; provides the means of communication and networking on knowledge organization for its members; and functions as a connecting link between all institutions and national societies, working with problems related to the conceptual organization and processing of knowledge."&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;  

== Publications ==
The Society publishes the [[academic journal]] ''[[Knowledge Organization (journal)|Knowledge Organization]]'' as the official bi-monthly journal of ISKO. Founded in 1973 by Dr. Ingetraut Dahlberg, the first President of ISKO, it began publication the following year under the banner [[Knowledge Organization (journal)|International Classification]]. In 1993 the title was changed to its present form. The journal publishes original research articles relating to general ordering theory, philosophical foundations of knowledge and its artifacts, theoretical bases of classification, data analysis and reduction. It also describes practical operations associated with indexing and classification. In addition to being a technical resource, the journal traces the history of knowledge organization and discusses questions of education and training in classification.

The organization also holds biennial [[Academic conference|international conferences.]] 

== Chapters ==
ISKO officially recognizes national chapters in [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. ISKO cooperates with international and national organizations such as [[UNESCO]], the [[European Commission]], the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]], the [[Association for Information Science and Technology]], the Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services, and the [[Infoterm|International Information Centre for Terminology]].

The '''JASON Project''' is a  [[US]] [[middle school]] science [[curriculum]] program that is designed to motivate and inspire students to pursue interests and careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

The JASON Project's approach to science education immerses students in real-world situations where they are mentored by scientists from organizations like [[NASA]], [[NOAA]], the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], and parent company [[National Geographic Society]]. JASON creates these connections using educational games, videos, live interactivity and social networking to embed its partners' research in the curriculum.

== History ==
The JASON Project was started in 1989 by Dr. [[Robert Ballard]], the oceanographer who discovered the wreck of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The JASON Project - History  | url=http://www.jason.org/public/WhatIs/AboutHistory.aspx | accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JASON Foundation for Education was founded in 1990 as a [[501(c)(3)|501(c)(3) non-profit organization]] to administer the project. The Foundation became a subsidiary of the [[National Geographic Society]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=National Geographic Assumes Stewardship of JASON Foundation for Education | work=nationalgeographic.com | url=http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&amp;siteID=1&amp;cid=1121783412571 | accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project won a scientific public engagement award from the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and ''Computerworld's'' [[Computerworld Smithsonian Award|Smithsonian Award]] for its use of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Oleson | first1 =John Peter | last2 =Pollini | first2 =John | date =October 2017 | title =Anna Marguerite McCann, 1933–2017 | url =https://www.ajaonline.org/sites/default/files/1214_Oleson_0.pdf | journal =American Journal of Archaeology | volume =121 | issue =4 | doi =10.3764/aja.121.4.0685 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20171026043716/https://www.ajaonline.org/sites/default/files/1214_Oleson_0.pdf | archive-date =October 26, 2017 | access-date =October 30, 2017 | page=687 | deadurl =no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The JASON curricula are available in print and free online, aligned to national and state standards. The JASON Mission Center contains all student and teacher content, communications systems, digital experiences, and tools to manage, assess and track student performance and online usage. 

JASON curricula are available free online, free print-on-demand and in print editions for purchase.

[[Image:KAT5MILE8.jpg|thumb|Kat-5 at mile 8 in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge]]
'''Kat-5''' is an [[autonomous vehicle]] created by [http://www.graymatterinc.com/ Team Gray], an organization comprising employees from [http://www.grayinsco.com The Gray Insurance Company] and students from [[Tulane University|Tulane University's]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20010201071200/http://www.eng.tulane.edu/ School of Engineering], for the 2005 [[DARPA Grand Challenge]].  

==The vehicle==
Kat-5 is a 2005 [[Ford Escape]] Hybrid modified with the sensors and actuators needed for autonomous operation.  It has an INS/GPS (Inertial Navigation System/Global Positioning System) from [http://www.oxts.co.uk Oxford Technical Solutions] and [[LIDAR]] units from [http://www.sick.com SICK] and [http://www.rieglusa.com Riegl].  Kat-5 finished the 2005 [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] and placed fourth with a time of 7 hours, 30 minutes, only 37 minutes behind [[Stanley (vehicle)|Stanley]], the winner of the competition.  Kat-5 is powered by almost 100% pure [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and runs both the [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]] operating systems.

Kat-5 uses oscillating LIDARs and information from the INS/GPS unit to create a picture of the surrounding environment.  This information is then used to build a path for the vehicle to follow.  Kat-5's primary electrical system, used to run the computers and drive-by-wire system, is powered by the standard electrical system of the vehicle while the 24-volt system, used to power the LIDAR sensors, is powered by six [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s on the roof platform of the vehicle.

During the National Qualification Event of the Grand Challenge, Kat-5 suffered 2 major crashes and one stall (due to a faulty circuit breaker) before finally completing three runs.  The last run completed was done flawlessly with Kat-5 avoiding every obstacle and passing through all 50 required gates.  The vehicle was given a pole position of 16 going into the Grand Challenge Event in Primm, NV.

[[Image:KAT5BEERBOTTLE0034.jpg|thumb|Kat-5 navigates through Beer Bottle Pass, touted as the most difficult section of the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge.]]On the morning of October 8, 2005, Kat-5 left the starting line without a hitch and began the 132-mile journey through the surrounding desert.  Although given the opportunity to stop at sunset and continue the race the following morning, the team chose to allow their vehicle to finish that night since darkness would have no effect on the vehicle's performance.

[[Image:KAT5FINISH20054726.jpg|thumb|Kat-5 is the fourth vehicle to cross the finish line at the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Its official time was 7 hours, 30 minutes.]]After crossing the finish line, it was found that Kat-5 had completed the entire race using only 7 gallons of fuel, averaging a little less than 19 miles per gallon.  The vehicle averaged 17.5 miles per hour throughout the course of the race.  It was later discovered that a small software bug had caused the vehicle to slow to a crawl in the wider segments of the race.

==The team==
Team Gray was made up of IT professionals from within the company and students from Tulane University’s Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering departments.  Eric Gray, President and Director of The Gray Exploration Company and The Gray Oil &amp; Gas Company, was the leader of the team.  The primary development team consisted of six people:

* Matt Dooner &amp;mdash; Junior in Tulane University's Computer Science department
* Keith Goeller &amp;mdash; CIO of Gray &amp; Company, Inc. and MBA from Tulane University's A.B. Freeman School of Business
* Powell Kinney &amp;mdash; Senior in Tulane University's Biomedical Engineering department
* Jorge Nagel &amp;mdash; Master's student in Tulane University's Mechanical Engineering department
* Carl Schneider &amp;mdash; Manager of Information Systems for Gray &amp; Company, Inc. and MBA candidate in Tulane University's A.B. Freeman School of Business
* Paul Trepagnier &amp;mdash; Software Development Manager for Gray &amp; Company, Inc. and Ph.D. student in Tulane University's Computer Science department

==Development==
The team developed Kat-5 in a period of six actual months (three weeks were lost to [[Hurricane Katrina]]) at a total cost of approximately $650,000.  The physical value of the vehicle when it ran on October 8 was estimated to be $150,000.

'''''Let Them Eat Precaution: How Politics is Undermining the Genetic Revolution in Agriculture''''' is a 2005 book edited by American author and journalist [[Jon Entine]], about how politics is affecting the use of genetically modified food. The 10 contributing authors from the United States and the United Kingdom provide insights into the benefits of agricultural biotechnology, offer an international perspective on why some groups are opposed to it, and suggest potential solutions to the controversy.

==Overview==
Resistance to [[GMO]] food production and use comes from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms: European Union|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/eu.php|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU evokes the [[Precautionary Principle]] in much of their opposition to GMO's.''Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle'', noted that, "The precautionary principle is not defined in the [[Treaties of the European Union|Treaty]], which prescribes it [the Precautionary Principle] only once – to protect the environment. But in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary-objective-scientific-evaluation indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that potentially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or [and] plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection [for what] chosen for the Community.".&lt;ref name=EU-Comm-PP&gt;Commission of the European Communities.  2 February 2000 [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-96_en.htm Communication From The Commission on the Precautionary Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also opposition from environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, organic advocates and Christian Aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 World Organizations That Have Taken a Stand against GMOs|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/10-world-organizations-have-taken-stand-against-gmos|website=ORGANIC CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Entine|first1=Jon|title=Let Them Eat Precaution|date=2006|publisher=AEI|isbn=0-8447-4200-7|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book much of the arguments in favor of GMO's center around the advantages they provide and the general scientific consensus of the safety of GMO foods.

==Background==
This book grew out of a 2003 conference, "Food Biotechnology, the Media, and Public Policy", held at the [[American Enterprise Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotechnology, the Media, and Public Policy  Health Care|url=https://www.aei.org/publication/biotechnology-the-media-and-public-policy/|website=American Enterprise Ins|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Entine, the editor, is an adjunct fellow at the institute and a scholar in residence at [[Miami University]] in Ohio.

==Reception==
"Let Them Eat Precaution does a superb job of educating the reading public on the basic issues of genetically modified foods. The distinguished authors provide a devastating point-by-point refutation of the anti-GMO activists' false claims, providing a reasoned, scientifically grounded perspective on this critical issue. As the Marie Antoinette title implies, though the affluent may be leading the charge against GMO foods, it is the poor who are most likely to suffer the effects of activists that falsely claim to speak for the world's poor." —Thomas DeGregori, professor of economics, University of Houston, and author of Origins of the Organic Agriculture Debate.&lt;ref name="cover"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Entine|first1=Jon|title=Let Them Eat Precaution|date=2006|publisher=AEI|isbn=0-8447-4200-7|page=cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A well-funded global antibiotech activist campaign, abetted by European Union regulators more interested in political pandering than good science, threatens to starve millions of the world's poorest people by denying them access to environmentally safer and higher yielding biotech crops. The distinguished experts assembled in Let Them Eat Precaution make it abundantly clear that humanity's health and well-being depend on innovation, not a technological freeze in the name of the "precautionary principle," which demands perfect safety from all new technologies. The contributors carefully document not only the policy challenges facing agricultural biotechnology but the real benefits—from a massive reduction in pesticide use to a slew of new pharmaceuticals and vitamin-enriched foods—that may never come to fruition if antiscience advocacy groups prevail in this battle of ideas." —Ronald Bailey, author of Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution and science correspondent for Reason magazine&lt;ref name="cover"/&gt;

"This fine volume fills a very useful role in the ongoing debate over the use of biotechnology in foods and pharmaceuticals. Let Them Eat Precaution covers every aspect of the issue, catalogs what is known about GM crops, and helps us understand the ideological basis for opposition to the use of this life-saving technology. The antibiotechnology campaigns are denying food to starving millions—a high price to pay for ideology. " —Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, Mo.&lt;ref name="cover"/&gt;

"The book would be appropriate for a college-level course in science communication or in agricultural or science policy. Scientists involved in molecular biology and related research might find the book helps them better understand how something that they may think is a safe and exciting scientific discovery is not readily accepted by others in society." - Martin Marshall Senior Associate Director ARP and Assistant Dean, Professor Agricultural Economics, Purdue University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Marshall|title=The Agricultural Biotechnology Debate|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/289.full|website=Oxford Journals|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most American states have made a state fossil designation, in many cases during the 1980s. It is common to designate one species in which fossilization has occurred, rather than a single specimen, or a category of fossils not limited to a single species.

Some states that lack an explicit state fossil have nevertheless singled out a fossil for formal designation as a [[List of U.S. state dinosaurs|state dinosaur]], [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|rock, gem or stone]].

The following are list of [[astronomer]]s, [[astrophysicist]]s and other notable people who have made contributions to the field of [[astronomy]]. They may have won major prizes or awards, developed or invented widely used techniques or technologies within astronomy, or are directors of major observatories or heads of space-based telescope projects.

The following is a list of notable astronomers.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Name !! Country !! Born !! Died !! Notable For
|-
| [[Aryabhata]] || India || 476 || 550
|Aryabhata correctly insisted that the earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth. Solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. Aryabhata calculated the [[sidereal rotation]] (the rotation of the earth referencing the fixed stars)
|-
| [[Marc Aaronson]] || [[United States|USA]] || 1950 || 1987
|His work concentrated on three fields: the determination of the [[Hubble constant]] (H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) using the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the study of [[Carbon star|carbon rich stars]], and the velocity distribution of those stars in [[Dwarf spheroidal galaxy|dwarf spheroidal galaxies]].

Aaronson was one of the first astronomers to attempt to image [[dark matter]] using infrared imaging. He imaged infrared halos of unknown matter around galaxies that could be dark matter.

==Colors==
===Black===
{{Main|Black|Shades of black}}
Black is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete absorption of light. Like white and grey, it is an achromatic color, literally a color without hue.
{{Shades of black|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Blue===
{{Main|Blue|Shades of blue}}
Blue is a color, the perception of which is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a [[wavelength]] of roughly 440–490&amp;nbsp;nm. It is considered one of the additive [[primary color]]s.
{{Shades of blue|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Brown===
{{Main|Brown|Shades of brown}}
Brown colors are dark or muted shades of reds, oranges, and yellows on the RGB and CMYK color schemes. In practice, browns are created by mixing two complementary colors from the RYB color scheme (combining all three primary colors). In theory, such combinations should produce black, but produce brown because most commercially available blue pigments tend to be comparatively weaker{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}; the stronger red and yellow colors prevail, thus creating the following tones. Brown can also be made if multiple paint colours are added to each other.
{{Shades of brown|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Cyan===
{{Main|Cyan|Shades of cyan}}
Cyan is any of the colors in the blue-green range of the [[visible spectrum]], i.e., between approximately 490 and 520&amp;nbsp;nm. It is considered one of the main[[subtractive color|subtractive]] [[primary color]]s. Cyan is sometimes considered green or blue because of the way we see it and is not found in the rainbow even though blue and green are together.
{{Shades of cyan|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Green===
{{Main|Green|Shades of green}}
Green is a color, the perception of which is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a [[wavelength]] of roughly 520–570&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]]. It is considered one of the additive [[primary color]]s.
{{Shades of green|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Grey===
{{Main|Grey|Shades of gray}}
Achromatic grays are colors between black and white with no hue. Chromatic grays are achromatic grays mixed with ''warm hues'' such as yellow (warm grays) ''or cool hues'' such as azure ''(''cool grays''). This gray color template includes both achromatic and chromatic grays.
{{ Shades of gray|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Magenta===
{{Main|Magenta|Shades of magenta}}
Magenta is variously defined as a purplish-red, reddish-purple, or a mauvish–crimson color. On color wheels of the RGB and CMY color models, it is located midway between red and blue, opposite green. Complements of magenta are evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a [[wavelength]] of roughly 500–530&amp;nbsp;nm. It is considered one of the [[subtractive color|subtractive]] [[primary color]]s.
{{Shades of magenta|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Orange===
{{Main|Orange (colour)|Shades of orange}}
Orange is the color in the visible spectrum between red and yellow with a [[wavelength]] around 585&amp;nbsp;– 620&amp;nbsp;nm. In the [[HSV color space]], it has a hue of around 30°.
{{Shades of orange|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Pink===
{{Main|Pink|Shades of pink}}
Pink is any of a number of similar colors evoked by light, consisting predominantly of a combination of both the longest, and shortest wavelengths discernible by the human eye, in the [[wavelength]] ranges of roughly 625–750&amp;nbsp;nm and 380-490&amp;nbsp;nm.
{{Shades of pink|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Purple===
{{Main|Violet (color)|Shades of violet|Purple|Shades of purple}}
Violet refers to any colour perceptually evoked by light with a predominant [[wavelength]] of roughly 380–450&amp;nbsp;nm. Tones of violet tending towards the blue are called indigo. Purple colors are colors that are various blends of violet or blue light with red light.
{{Shades of violet|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Red===
{{Main|Red|Shades of red}}
Red is any of a number of similar colors evoked by [[light]], consisting predominantly of the longest wavelengths discernible by the human eye, in the [[wavelength]] range of roughly 625–750 [[Nanometre|nm]]. It is considered one of the [[additive color|additive]] [[primary color]]s.
{{Shades of red|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===White===
{{Main|White|Shades of white}}
White is a balanced combination of all the colors of the [[visible light spectrum]], or of a pair of [[complementary color]]s, or of three or more colors, such as [[additive primary]] colors. It is a neutral or achromatic (''without color'') color, like [[black]] and [[gray]].
{{Shades of white|nocategory=yes|state=plain}}

===Yellow===
{{Main|Yellow|Shades of yellow}}
Yellow is the color of light with wavelengths predominately in the range of roughly 570–580&amp;nbsp;nm. In the HSV color space, it has a hue of around 60°. It is considered one of the [[subtractive color|subtractive]] [[primary color]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71685">There are a number of documented cases of historical figures and distinguished members of society who were '''kidney stone formers'''. This condition is caused by nephrolithiasis, which are more commonly known as [[kidney stone]]s, or urolithiasis, where the stone forms in the urinary system. These are crystal deposits that can accrete in the [[urinary system]] when certain [[chemical substance]]s become concentrated in the [[urine]].&lt;ref name=chiras2007&gt;{{cite book

 | pmc=421787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the condition of having a kidney or bladder stone was referred to as "the stone" or "the gravel".

In certain cases, kidney stone formation played a pivotal role in history. Most notably, some members of the royalty and military leaders became debilitated at important moments, such as [[Napoleon III of France]]&lt;ref name=Kertzer/&gt; during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 and [[Athenian]] commander [[Nicias]] in the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] of 415-413 BC.&lt;ref name=hanson/&gt; Despite this condition,  artists such as [[Arthur Sullivan]]&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt; and [[Michel de Montaigne]]&lt;ref name=montaigne/&gt; managed to produce historically distinguished works; providing an example of perseverance in the face of severe and chronic pain. The medical advances of the twentieth century have allowed patients to survive the condition, whereas in the past it may have proven debilitating or fatal (as shown by the examples below).&lt;ref name=moran2006&gt;{{cite conference

Kidney stones can reach exceptional size. In December 2003, a kidney stone weighing 356 g (12.5&amp;nbsp;oz) was removed from the right kidney of Peter Baulman of Australia. At its widest point, the stone measured 11.86&amp;nbsp;cm (4.66&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As of August 2006, the most kidney stones ever passed naturally was 5,704 by Canadian Donald Winfield. The largest number removed through surgery was 728, during a three-hour operation upon Mangilal Jain of India, on January 27, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* On October 19, 2005, while working on the set of ''[[Boston Legal]]'', actor [[William Shatner]] was taken to the emergency room for lower back pain. He eventually passed a kidney stone, but recovered and soon returned to work. Shatner sold his kidney stone in 2006 for $75,000 to [[GoldenPalace.com]]. The money went to a housing charity, and a home was built for a family which had lost theirs in [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Marc D. Hauser''' (born October 25, 1959) is an American [[evolutionary biologist]] and a researcher in [[primate]] behavior,  [[animal cognition]] and human behavior. Hauser was a [[Harvard University]] professor from 1998 to 2011, regarded as "a leader in the field of animal and human cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/education/21harvard.html | work=The New York Times | first=Nicholas | last=Wade | title=Harvard Finds Marc Hauser Guilty of Scientific Misconduct | date=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Harvard found him guilty of [[scientific misconduct]], and a year later he resigned.&lt;ref name="crimson20100914"&gt;{{Cite news |title = Marc Hauser's Fall From Grace |url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/9/14/hauser-lab-research-professor/ |newspaper = [[The Harvard Crimson]] |date = September 14, 2010 |accessdate = October 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crimson20110719"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/7/19/marc-hauser-resigns-psychology-harvard/ | work = [[Harvard Crimson]] | title = Embattled Professor Marc Hauser Will Resign from Harvard | first = Gautam | last = Kumar |author2=Julia Ryan | date = July 19, 2011 | accessdate = October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because his research was financed by government grants, the [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Research Integrity]] of the [[Health and Human Services]] Department also investigated, finding in 2012 that Hauser had fabricated data, manipulated experimental results, and published falsified findings.&lt;ref name="Boston-Globe"&gt;Johnson, C., 2012.

== Research and publications ==
Hauser's research lies at the intersection of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]]. It was aimed at understanding the processes and consequences of cognitive evolution. His observations and experiments focused on nonhuman animals and humans of different ages and mental competence, incorporating methodology and theory from ethology, infant cognitive development, evolutionary theory, cognitive neuroscience and neurobiology.

==Scientific misconduct==

In 2007, Harvard University announced an internal investigation of alleged [[scientific misconduct]] by Hauser. 
In August 2010, the investigators found him solely responsible for eight counts of misconduct, and he took a year's leave of absence.&lt;ref name="crimson20100914"/&gt;
In July 2011, Hauser resigned his faculty position at Harvard, effective August 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="crimson20110719"/&gt;

In his resignation, Hauser stated that he had "some exciting opportunities in the private sector" involving education for high-risk teenagers, but that he might go back to academia "in the years to come."&lt;ref name="chronicle-resignation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marc Hauser Resigns From Harvard|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Marc-Hauser-Resigns-From/128296/|work =[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=July 19, 2011 | first = Tom | last = Bartlett | accessdate = October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2013, Hauser's LinkedIn profile&lt;ref name="linkedin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/mdhauser|title=Marc Hauser}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed him as a co-founder of the website [[Gamience]], claiming "Scientifically-based games that address global health problems of self-control."

In September 2012, after conducting a separate investigation, the [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Research Integrity]] (ORI) found Hauser guilty of scientific misconduct.&lt;ref name="Boston-Globe"/&gt;  
They concluded that Hauser had fabricated data in one study, manipulated results in multiple experiments, and incorrectly described how studies were conducted.  The ORI barred Hauser from certain types of research and required that other research be conducted under supervision.&lt;ref&gt;NIH, 2012. [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-12-149.html ''Findings of Research Misconduct''] Press release, September 10, 2012 [Accessed September 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
They published a notice stating:

&lt;blockquote style="border:1px solid #eee; padding-left:6px;"&gt;
Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has taken final action in the following case: &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Details, retractions, and replication  ===

The details of this investigation were not publicly released, and the lack of transparency evoked substantial speculation. Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in August 2010, [[Nicholas Wade]] summarized:

{{Quote|There is a wide spectrum of scientific sins, ranging from wrist-slap offenses like bad data storage at one end, to data fabrication at the other. It is still not clear where on this spectrum Dr. Hauser's errors may fall. He has admitted only to unspecified "mistakes," not to misconduct.&lt;ref name="nytimes3"&gt;{{cite news | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | authorlink = Nicholas Wade | date = 20 August 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/education/21harvard.html | title = Harvard Finds Scientist Guilty of Misconduct | work = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On August 20, 2010, Michael Smith, Dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, released a statement confirming that an internal investigation had found Hauser guilty of eight counts of scientific misconduct.&lt;ref name="HarvMag"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAS Dean Smith Confirms Scientific Misconduct by Marc Hauser |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/breaking-news/harvard-dean-details-hauser-scientific-misconduct|work=Harvard Magazine|accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three counts involved published papers, and five involved unpublished studies. The statement said that Harvard was cooperating with further investigations by the US [[Office of Research Integrity]], the [[National Science Foundation]] Office of Inspector General, and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. They stated that they would conduct their own review and make their conclusions available to the public.&lt;ref name="chronicle-confirms"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard Confirms 'Hausergate'|url=http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Harvard-Confirms-Hausergate/26198/|accessdate=2010-08-26|newspaper=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 paper published in the journal ''Cognition'' was retracted.&lt;ref name="boston_globe1"&gt;{{cite news | first = Carolyn | last = Johnson | date = August 10, 2010 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2010/08/10/author_on_leave_after_harvard_inquiry/ | title = Author on leave after Harvard inquiry | work = [[Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognition-retraction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monkey business? 2002 Cognition paper retracted as prominent psychologist Marc Hauser takes leave from Harvard|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/monkey-business-2002-cognition-paper-retracted-as-prominent-psychologist-marc-hauser-takes-leave-from-harvard/|publisher = [[RetractionWatch]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In this paper, Hauser and his collaborators concluded that [[Cottontop tamarin|cotton-top tamarin monkeys]] could learn simple rule-like patterns.

In two additional published papers, some field notes or video recordings were "incomplete", although Hauser and his co-author replicated the experiments.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | authorlink = Nicholas Wade | date = August 12, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/education/13harvard.html | title = Inquiry on Harvard Lab Threatens Ripple Effect | work = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rspb-2010-7"/&gt; The ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]'' published the replication of the missing data in an addendum to one of the papers.&lt;ref name="rspb-2010-7"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hauser MD, Wood JN | title =Replication of 'Rhesus monkeys correctly read the goal-relevant gestures of a human agent'. | year = 2011 | journal = Proc.

In April 2011 Hauser and Justin Wood (coauthor of the original paper) replicated the results of the 2007 ''Science'' study and published them—as an addendum—in the journal.&lt;ref name="Miller 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=Science Publishes Replication of 2007 Hauser Study|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/science-publishes-replication-of.html?ref=hp|accessdate=May 3, 2011|work = [[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser &amp; Wood 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = J.

Charles Gross published an article in The Nation that detailed the Hauser case (Disgrace: On Marc Hauser. A case of scientific misconduct at Harvard).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/disgrace-marc-hauser/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other controversy and allegations ==
In August 2010, after the initial allegations came out, various publications published other accusations and speculations about Hauser's research, often citing reports by his former students and research assistants.

[[Michael Tomasello]], another well-known animal cognition researcher, claimed that some of Hauser's previous students personally told him that there "was a pattern and they had specific evidence".&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt; Tomasello also stated, prior to the official announcement, that he had information from "a Harvard faculty member and from former students of Dr. Hauser" that the investigation found evidence for eight counts of scientific misconduct;&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Inquiry at Marc Hauser's Harvard Lab, a Raid and Then a 3-Year Wait|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/14/education/14harvard.html?pagewanted=2|page=2|work=New York Times|date=August 13, 2010 | first=Nicholas | last=Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt; this statement was later confirmed by Harvard's dean (see previous section).&lt;ref name="USA-Today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Updated: Harvard says Marc Hauser guilty of science misconduct |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/08/marc-hauser-harvard-science-misconduct-/1|accessdate=2010-08-26|newspaper=USA Today|date=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' reported the contents of allegations made by a former research assistant of Hauser. The former research assistant stated that Hauser falsely coded videotapes of monkey behavior, resisted research assistants and students' requests to have them re-coded by another observer and pressured his students to accept his data analysis.  When they re-coded the data without Hauser's permission, they allegedly found Hauser's coding bore little relation to what was on the tapes. According to the document, several other lab members had similar run-ins with Hauser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Document-Sheds-Light-on/123988/ |title=Document Sheds Light on Investigation at Harvard|publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=2010-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[New Scientist]]'' claimed that Harvard opened its investigation of Hauser's lab after students who had worked there made allegations of data falsification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aldhous|first=Peter|title=Misconduct probe in Harvard animal morality lab|date=August 20, 2010|journal=New Scientist|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19331-misconduct-probe-in-harvard-animal-morality-lab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry Altmann, the editor of ''Cognition'', subsequently posted his personal conclusion that Hauser fabricated data as part of a deception, after being given a summary of the relevant portions of Harvard's inquiry.&lt;ref name="altmann"&gt;{{cite web|last=Altmann|first=Gerry|title=Harvard misconduct: setting the record straight|url=http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/me/mind/blog/blog.html|accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-27Aug"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=Journal Editor Says He Believes Retracted Hauser Paper Contains Fabricated Data|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/08/journal-editor-says-he-believes.html|accessdate=2010-08-27|newspaper=Science Insider|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe-27Aug"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Carolyn|title=Journal editor questions Harvard researcher's data|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/08/journal_editor.html|accessdate=2010-08-27|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-27Aug"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|title=Harvard Researcher May Have Fabricated Data|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/science/28harvard.html?hp|accessdate=2010-08-27|newspaper=New York Times|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Altmann noted that the conclusion of fabrication was his own conjecture, and not that of the Harvard investigation, which offered no explanation for discrepancies between the video record and the published paper.&lt;ref name="altmann"/&gt;

=== Related issues at Harvard ===
While Harvard confirmed that misconduct was committed by Hauser, scientists continued to criticize Harvard over a lack of transparency in the investigation. However, Harvard stated that "in cases where the government concludes scientific misconduct occurred, the federal agency makes those findings publicly available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/education/13harvard.html?_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1348741556-BD4rXkNWm/ABwDH794ZTlA | work=The New York Times | first=Nicholas | last=Wade | title=Inquiry on Harvard Lab Threatens Ripple Effect | date=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hauser took a year-long leave of absence from Harvard in 2010, he was at first still planning to teach at the Harvard Extension School, which generated further controversy.  On September 1, 2010, his classes at the Extension School were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2010/09/01/citing_misconduct_inquiry_harvard_professor_cancels_classes/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson | title=Citing misconduct inquiry, Harvard professor cancels classes | date=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In April 2011, he was barred from teaching in the Psychology department or any other Arts and Sciences department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-04-21/news/29459892_1_marc-hauser-scientific-misconduct-embattled-harvard |work=The Boston Globe |title=Embattled Harvard professor barred from teaching |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006150942/http://articles.boston.com/2011-04-21/news/29459892_1_marc-hauser-scientific-misconduct-embattled-harvard |archivedate=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unreplicable cotton-top tamarin study ===

In 1995, Hauser reported that [[cotton-top tamarin]]s can recognize themselves in a mirror.&lt;ref name="pnas-95"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=M|author2=J. Kralik |author3=C. Borro-Mahan |author4=M. Garret |author5=J. Oser |title=Self-recognition in primates: Phylogeny and the salience of species-typical features|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=November 1995|volume=92|issue=23|pages=10811–10814|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.23.10811|pmid=7479889|pmc=40702}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon G. Gallup]] questioned Hauser's findings, and reviewed some video recordings of Hauser's experiment, saying that "when I played the videotapes [for Hauser's experiments], there was not a thread of compelling evidence — scientific or otherwise — that any of the tamarins had learned to correctly decipher mirrored information about themselves.''&lt;ref name="boston_globe1"/&gt; 
Upon requesting the remaining videotapes, Gallup was informed that the other tapes had been stolen.&lt;ref name="Economist-26Aug"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientific misconduct: Monkey business?|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16886218?story_id=16886218&amp;CFID=141739115&amp;CFTOKEN=94865933|accessdate=2010-08-28|newspaper=Economist|date=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Anderson, Gallup published a critical response to Hauser's article.&lt;ref name="pmid9521801"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = JR | last2 = Gallup | first2 =  | year = 1997 | title = Self-recognition in Saguinus?

Their criticism of Hauser's paper stated that the coding criteria were described in insufficient detail to code the monkeys' behavior and that, according to their assessment, the cotton-top tamarins did not show the behavior that they considered as evidence for mirror recognition in chimpanzees or other great apes.&lt;ref name="pmid9521801"/&gt;

Hauser and a co-author published a reply to these criticisms, clarifying their coding criteria.&lt;ref name="hauser-mirror-resp1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/anbe.1997.0549|last=Hauser|first=MD|author2=J.

However, in 2001 Hauser reported that his subsequent attempts to replicate the experiments were unsuccessful, observing no evidence for the previously claimed result.&lt;ref name="tamarins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=Marc|author2=Cory Thomas Miller |author3=Katie Liu |author4=Renu Gupta |title=Cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) fail to show mirror-guided self-exploration|journal=American Journal of Primatology|date=March 2001|volume=53|issue=3|pmid=11253848|pages=131–137|doi=10.1002/1098-2345(200103)53:3&lt;131::AID-AJP4&gt;3.0.CO;2-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4387">A '''Master of Physics''' (or '''MPhys (Hons)''' ) honours [[academic degree|degree]] is a specific [[master's degree]] for courses in the field of [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/documents/ucasguides/scottishguide2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102074249/http://ucas.com/documents/ucasguides/scottishguide2010.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the MPhys is an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] award available after pursuing a four-year course of study at a [[university]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/education/Careers/Publications/file_31428.pdf|title=Education|website=Iop.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]] the course has a five-year duration. In some universities, the degree has the variant abbreviation '''MSci'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ugstudy/courses/physicsandastronomy/msci-physics.aspx|title=Physics MSci - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/coursefinder/courses/79936.html|title=MSci Physics|website=Qmul.ac.u|accessdate=2 September 2017k}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/physics/physics-msci.aspx|title=Undergraduate degree course/programme in Physics MSc F302i – School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham - University of Birmingham|website=Birmingham.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2015/physics/msci-physics/|title=MSci Physics - Study at Bristol - University of Bristol|website=Bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/careers/i-am-at-school-college/undergraduate-courses/page_57508.html|title=Undergraduate courses|website=Iop.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are taught courses, with a [[research]] element in the final year — this can vary from a small component to an entire year working with a research group — and are not available as [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] qualifications in most cases, although depending on institution the final year can be considered as approximately equivalent to an [[Master of Science|MSc]].

===Structure===
In terms of course structure, MPhys degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from [[bachelor's degree]]s with [[lecture]]s, [[laboratory]] work, [[coursework]] and [[exam]]s each year. Usually one, or more commonly two, substantial projects are to be completed in the fourth year which may well have research elements. At the end of the second or third years, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to be reached to allow progression into the final year. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard [[British undergraduate degree classification]] scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail', as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified.

===Degree schemes===
It is usual for there to be some variation in the MPhys schemes, to allow for students to study the area of physics which most interests them. For example, [[Lancaster University]]'s physics department offer the following&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/physics/ugAdmissions/index.htm|title=Physics|website=Lancs.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; schemes:
*MPhys Physics
*MPhys Physics, [[Astrophysics]] and [[Cosmology]]
*MPhys Physics with [[Particle Physics]] and Cosmology
*MPhys Physics with [[Space Science]]
*MPhys Physics with Biomedical Physics
*MPhys [[Theoretical Physics]]
*MPhys Theoretical Physics with [[Mathematics]]

These schemes will usually incorporate the same core modules with additional scheme specific modules. Students tend to take all the same core modules during their first year and start to specialise in their second year. In some cases, optional modules can be taken from other schemes.

[[File:Mutualist flag.jpg|thumb|Mutualist flag]]
'''Mutualism''' is an [[Economics|economic theory]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[anarchist school of thought|school of thought]] that advocates a society with free markets and ''occupation and use'', or ''[[usufruct]]'' property norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mutualist.org/|title=Introduction|publisher=Mutualist.org|date=|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One implementation of this scheme involves the establishment of a [[Mutual savings bank|mutual-credit bank]] that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a version of the [[labor theory of value]] holding that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism originated from the writings of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].

Mutualists disagree with the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed that he had never intended "to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose".&lt;ref&gt;''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem'', Edited by Henry Cohen. Vanguard Press, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as they ensure the worker's right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support [[Market (economics)|market]]s and [[property]] in the product of labor. However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called "possession")&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt;—thus advocating [[personal property]], but not [[private property]].

Although mutualism is similar to the economic doctrines of the 19th-century [[Anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]], unlike them mutualism is in favor of large industries.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock|Woodcock, George]]. ''[[Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements]]'', Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, mutualism has been retrospectively characterized sometimes as being a form of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin A. ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'' [http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Preface] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v8wrbTrn?url=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html|date=2010-12-21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism as well.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul.

Mutualists have distinguished mutualism from [[state socialism]] and do not advocate state control over the means of production. [[Benjamin Tucker]] said of Proudhon that "though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, [Proudhon] aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few...by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin, ''State Socialism and Anarchism'', [http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html State Socialism and Anarchism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117030925/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html|date=1999-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism, and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] and social anarchist thinkers.]]
As a term, "mutualism" has seen a variety of related uses. [[Charles Fourier]] first used the French term ''mutualisme'' in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;Fourier, Charles, ''Traité'' (1822), cited in Arthur E. Bestor, Jr., "The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (Jun., 1948), 259–302.&lt;/ref&gt; although the reference was not to an economic system. The first use of the noun "mutualist" was in the ''New-Harmony Gazette'' by an American [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;''New-Harmony Gazette'', I, 301–02 (14 June 1826) cited in Arthur E. Bestor, Jr., "The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (Jun., 1948), 259–302.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1830s, a labor organization in Lyons, France called themselves the "Mutuellists".

===French origins===
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements. Broadview Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; In ''What Is Mutualism?'', [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] gives his own account of the origin of the term, claiming that "[t]he word "mutualism" seems to have been first used by [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]], an English writer, in 1832".&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. What is Mutualism?&lt;/ref&gt; When John Gray's 1825 ''Lecture on Human Happiness'' was first published in the United States in 1826, the publishers appended the ''Preamble and constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests, located at Valley Forge''. 1826 also saw the publication of the ''Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests at [[Kendal, Ohio]]''.

By 1846, Proudhon was speaking of "mutualité" in his writings and he used the term "mutuellisme", at least as early as 1848, in his "Programme Révolutionnaire". [[William B. Greene]], in 1850, used the term "mutualism" to describe a mutual credit system similar to that of Proudhon. In 1850, the American newspaper ''The Spirit of the Age'', edited by William Henry Channing, published proposals for a "mutualist township" by Joshua King Ingalls&lt;ref&gt;Joshua King Ingalls, "A Practical Movement for Transition," Spirit of the Age, II, 13 (March 30, 1850), pp. 202–04.&lt;/ref&gt; and Albert Brisbane,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Brisbane, "The Mutualist Township," The Spirit of the Age, II, 12 (March 23, 1850), 179–83.;  II, 13 (March 30, 1850), 200-202.&lt;/ref&gt; together with works by Proudhon,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, "The Coming Era of Mutualism," ''Spirit of the Age'', I, 7 (August 18, 1849), 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt; William B. Greene, [[Pierre Leroux]], and others.

During the [[Second French Republic]] (1848–1852), Proudhon had his biggest public effect through his involvement with four newspapers: ''Le Représentant du Peuple'' (February 1848 – August 1848); ''Le Peuple'' (September 1848 – June 1849); ''La Voix du Peuple'' (September 1849 – May 1850); and ''Le Peuple de 1850'' (June 1850 – October 1850). His polemical writing style, combined with his perception of himself as a political outsider, produced a cynical, combative journalism that appealed to many French workers but alienated others. He repeatedly criticised the government's policies and promoted reformation of credit and exchange. He tried to establish a popular bank ([[Banque du peuple]]) early in 1849, but despite over 13,000 people signing up (mostly workers), receipts were limited falling short of 18,000FF and the whole enterprise was a failure from the beginning. {{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Proudhon ran for the [[constituent assembly]] in April 1848, but was not elected, although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besançon, and Lille, France. He was successful in the complementary elections of June 4 and served as a deputy during the debates over the [[National Workshops]], created by the February 25, 1848 decree passed by Republican [[Louis Blanc]]. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. He was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence.

Proudhon was surprised by the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France]]. He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed "the first republican proclamation" of the new republic. But he had misgivings about the new provisional government, headed by [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure|Dupont de l'Eure]] (1767–1855), who since the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849&lt;!-- which month? --&gt;, ''Solution du problème social'' ("[[Solution of the Social Problem]]"), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from [[capitalists]] and [[financiers]] to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold.

===Ideological development===
Mutualism has been associated with two types of currency reform. [[Labor notes (currency)|Labor notes]] were first discussed in [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] circles and received their first practical test in 1827 in the [[Cincinnati Time Store|Time Store]] of former [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] member and [[individualist anarchist]] [[Josiah Warren]]. Mutual banking aimed at the monetization of all forms of wealth and the extension of free credit. It is most closely associated with [[William B. Greene]], but Greene drew from the work of Proudhon, [[Edward Kellogg (economist)|Edward Kellogg]], and William Beck, as well as from the land bank tradition.

Mutualism can in many ways be considered "the original anarchy", since Proudhon was the first to identify himself as an [[anarchist]]. Though mutualism is generally associated with anarchism, it is not ''necessarily'' anarchist. Historian [[Wendy McElroy]] reports that [[American individualist anarchism]] received an important influence of 3 European thinkers. "One of the most important of these influences was the french political philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon whose words "Liberty is not the Daughter But the Mother of Order" appeared as a motto on ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''{{'}}s masthead"&lt;ref name="mises"&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf][[Wendy McElroy]]&lt;span&gt;. "The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (influential individualist anarchist publication of [[Benjamin Tucker]]). For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster: "It is apparent...that [[Proudhon]]ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]&amp;nbsp;... William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213201445/http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html |date=2016-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1850, Greene became active in labor reform.&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; He was elected vice-president of the New England Labor Reform League, the majority of the members holding to Proudhon's scheme of mutual banking; and in 1869 president of the Massachusetts Labor Union.&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; He then publishes ''Socialistic, Mutualistic, and Financial Fragments'' (1875).&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; He saw mutualism as the synthesis of "liberty and order".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; His "associationism...is checked by individualism..."Mind your own business", "Judge not that ye be not judged". Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason, he demands "mutuality" in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt;

Benjamin Tucker, editor of the anarchist publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', later connected his economic views with those of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Karl Marx]], taking sides with Proudhon and Josiah Warren: {{quote|The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his “Wealth of Nations,” – namely, that labor is the true measure of price&amp;nbsp;... Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy&amp;nbsp;... This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew&amp;nbsp;... That the work of this interesting trio should have been done so nearly simultaneously would seem to indicate that Socialism was in the air, and that the time was ripe and the conditions favorable for the appearance of this new school of thought. So far as priority of time is concerned, the credit seems to belong to Warren, the American, – a fact which should be noted by the stump orators who are so fond of declaiming against Socialism as an imported article. Benjamin Tucker. ''Individual Liberty''&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/benjamin-tucker-individual-liberty ''Individual Liberty'' by Benjamin Tucker]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===19th century Spain===
[[File:Pi y margall.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Francesc Pi i Margall]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]] briefly [[President of Spain|President]] of the [[First Spanish Republic]] and main Spanish translator of Proudhon´s works]]
Mutualist ideas found a fertile ground in the nineteenth century in Spain. In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal ''El Porvenir'' in A Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon´s ideas.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22753/anarchism/66525/Anarchism-in-Spain#ref539322 "Anarchism" at the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catalan people|Catalan]] politician [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to [[George Woodcock]]: "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's".&lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or “[[Cantonalism|cantonalist]]”, political system on Proudhonian lines".&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Pi i Margall was a dedicated theorist in his own right, especially through book-length works such as ''La reacción y la revolución'' (''Reaction and Revolution'' from 1855), ''Las nacionalidades'' (''Nationalities'' from 1877) and ''La Federación'' (''The Federation'' from 1880). For prominent [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Rudolf Rocker]]: "The first movement of the Spanish workers was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pi y Margall, leader of the Spanish Federalists and disciple of Proudhon. Pi y Margall was one of the outstanding theorists of his time and had a powerful influence on the development of libertarian ideas in Spain. His political ideas had much in common with those of [[Richard Price]], [[Joseph Priestly]] [''sic''], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a Socialist economic order".&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/rudolf-rocker-anarchosyndicalism "Anarchosyndicalism" by [[Rudolf Rocker]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internationalism===
For historian of the [[First International]] G. M. Stekloff: "In April, 1856, there arrived from Paris a deputation of Proudhonist workers whose aim it was to bring about the foundation of a Universal League of Workers. The object of the League was the social emancipation of the working class, which, it was held, could only be achieved by a union of the workers of all lands against international capital. Since the deputation was one of Proudhonists, of course this emancipation was to be secured, not by political methods, but purely by economic means, through the foundation of productive and distributive co-operatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch02.htm History of The First International by G. M. Stekloff. London. Martin Lawrence Limited]&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was in the 1863 elections that for the first time workers' candidates were run in opposition to bourgeois republicans, but they secured very few votes...agroup of working-class Proudhonists (among whom were Murat and Tolain, who were subsequently to participate in the founding of the (First) International issued the famous Manifesto of the Sixty, which, though extremely moderate in tone, marked a turning point in the history of the French movement. For years and years the bourgeois liberals had been insisting that the revolution of 1789 had abolished class distinctions. The Manifesto of the Sixty loudly proclaimed that classes still existed. These classes were the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The latter had its specific class interests, which none but workers could be trusted to defend. The inference drawn by the Manifesto was that there must be independent working-class candidates".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch03.htm History of The First International by G. M. Stekloff. London. Martin Lawrence Limited]&lt;/ref&gt; For Stekloff, "the Proudhonists, who were at that date the leaders of the French section of the International. They looked upon the International Workingmen's Association as a sort of academy or synagogue, where Talmudists or similar experts could "investigate" the workers' problem; where in the spirit of Proudhon they could excogitate means for an accurate solution of the problem, without being disturbed by the stresses of a political campaign. Thus Fribourg, voicing the opinions of the Parisian group of the Proudhonists (Tolain and Co.) assured his readers that “the International was the greatest attempt ever made in modern times to aid the proletariat towards the conquest, by peaceful, constitutional, and moral methods, of the place which rightly belongs to the workers in the sunshine of civilisation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch04.htm History of The First International by G. M. Stekloff. London. Martin Lawrence Limited]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Belgian Federation threw in its lot with the anarchist International at its Brussels Congress, held in December, 1872...those taking part in the socialist movement of the Belgian intelligentsia were inspired by Proudhonist ideas which naturally led them to oppose the Marxist outlook".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch23.htm History of The First International by G.

Proudhon supported [[Worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms]] and associations&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', pp. 190–01,&lt;br /&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, pp. 110, 112&lt;/ref&gt; for "we need not hesitate, for we have no choice ... it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers&amp;nbsp;... because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two ... castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society" and so "it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into [[feudalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;''General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 215–16, 277&lt;/ref&gt; As for capital goods (man-made, non-land, "[[means of production]]"), mutualist opinions differs on whether these should be commonly managed public assets or private property.

Mutualism also had a considerable influence in the [[Paris Commune]]. [[George Woodcock]] manifests that "a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the [[Collectivist anarchism|libertarian collectivists]] Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and [[Elisée Reclus]] and Louise Michel".&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George (1962). Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. The World Publishing Company. {{ISBN|978-0140168211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{See also|Cost the limit of price}}
The primary aspects of mutualism are [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]], mutualist credit, contract (or federation/confederation) and gradualism (or dual-power). Mutualism is often described by its proponents as advocating an "anti-capitalist free market". Mutualists argue that most of the economic problems associated with capitalism each amount to a violation of the ''cost principle'', or as [[Josiah Warren]] interchangeably said: "Cost the limit of price". It was inspired by the [[labor theory of value]], which was popularized, though not invented, by [[Adam Smith]] in 1776 (Proudhon mentioned Smith as an inspiration). The labor theory of value holds that the actual price of a thing (or the "true cost") is the amount of labor that was undertaken to produce it. In Warren's terms, cost should be the "limit of price", with "cost" referring to the amount of labor required to produce a good or service. Anyone who sells goods should charge no more than the cost to himself of acquiring these goods.

===Free association===
Mutualists argue that association is only necessary where there is an organic combination of forces. For instance, an operation that requires specialization and many different workers performing their individual tasks to complete a unified product, i.e. a factory. In this situation, workers are inherently dependent on each other—and without association they are related as subordinate and superior, master and wage-slave.

An operation that can be performed by an individual without the help of specialized workers does not require association. Proudhon argued that peasants do not require societal form and only feigned association for the purposes of solidarity in abolishing rents, buying clubs, ''et cetera''. He recognized that their work is inherently sovereign and free. In commenting on the degree of association that is preferable, Proudhon said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In cases in which production requires great division of labour, it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among the workers... because without that they would remain isolated as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two industrial castes of masters and wage workers, which is repugnant in a free and democratic society. But where the product can be obtained by the action of an individual or a family... there is no opportunity for association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualism.de/mutu/mutu.htm |title=Some background about the name: What is mutualism? |publisher=Mutualism.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Proudhon, mutualism involved creating "industrial democracy", a system where workplaces would be "handed over to democratically organised workers' associations&amp;nbsp;... We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic".&lt;ref&gt;Guerin, Daniel (ed.) ''No Gods, No Masters'', AK Press, vol. 1, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; He urged "workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism". This would result in "Capitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed".&lt;ref&gt;''The General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 277, 281&lt;/ref&gt; Workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives.

As Robert Graham notes: "Proudhon's market socialism is indissolubly linked to his notions of industry democracy and workers' self-management".&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction", ''General Idea of the Revolution'', p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; K. Steven Vincent notes in his in-depth analysis of this aspect of Proudhon's ideas that "Proudhon consistently advanced a program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction of the economy to the workers". For Proudhon, "strong workers' associations&amp;nbsp;... would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis".&lt;ref&gt;''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism,'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984, pp. 156, 230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutual credit===
{{Main|Mutual credit}}
Mutualists argue that [[free banking]] should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on the means of production, and landlords have a monopoly on land. Banks are essentially creating money by lending out deposits that do not actually belong to them, then charging interest on the difference. Mutualists argue that by establishing a democratically run [[Mutual savings bank|mutual bank]] or [[credit union]], it would be possible to issue free credit so that money could be created for the benefit of the participants rather than for the benefit of the bankers. Individualist anarchists noted for their detailed views on mutualist banking include [[Proudhon]], [[William B. Greene]] and [[Lysander Spooner]]. Some modern forms of mutual credit are [[LETS]] and the [[Ripple monetary system]] project.

In a session of the French legislature, Proudhon proposed a government-imposed [[income tax]] to fund his mutual banking scheme, with some tax brackets reaching as high as 33{{fraction|1|3}} percent and 50 percent, which was turned down by the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edwin Robert. 1911. The Income Tax: A Study of the History, Theory and Practice of Income Taxation at Home and Abroad. The MacMillan Company. p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; This income tax Proudhon proposed to fund his bank was to be levied on rents, interest, debts and salaries.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Richard D. E. 1991. Baudelaire and the Second Republic: Writing and Revolution. Oxford University Press. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corkran, John Frazer. 1849. History of the National Constituent Assembly, from May, 1848. Harper &amp; Brothers. p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Proudhon's proposed law would have required all capitalists and stockholders to disburse one sixth of their income to their tenants and debtors, and another sixth to the national treasury to fund the bank.&lt;ref name="Martin, Henri p. 189"&gt;Martin, Henri, &amp; Alger, Abby Langdon. A Popular History of France from the First Revolution to the Present Time. D. Estes and C.E. Lauria. p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

This scheme was vehemently objected to by others in the legislature, including [[Frédéric Bastiat]];&lt;ref name="Martin, Henri p. 189" /&gt; the reason given for the income tax's rejection was that it would result in economic ruin and that it violated "the right of property".&lt;ref&gt;Augello, Massimo M., Luigi, Marco Enrico. 2005. Economists in Parliament in the Liberal Age. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; In his debates with Bastiat, Proudhon did once propose funding a national bank with a voluntary tax of 1%.&lt;ref&gt;"Suppose that all the producers in the republic, numbering more than ten millions, tax themselves, each one, to the amount of only one per cent of their capital&amp;nbsp;... Suppose that by means of this tax a bank be founded, in Competition with the Bank (miscalled) of France, discounting and giving credit on mortgages at the rate of one-half of one per cent." Henry Cohen, ed. ''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem.'' Vanguard Press, 1927. pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon also argued for the abolition of all taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cohen, ed. ''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem.'' Vanguard Press, 1927. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract and federation===
Mutualism holds that producers should exchange their goods at cost-value using systems of "contract". While Proudhon's early definitions of cost-value were based on fixed assumptions about the value of labor-hours, he later redefined cost-value to include other factors such as the intensity of labor, the nature of the work involved, ''et cetera''. He also expanded his notions of "contract" into expanded notions of "federation". As Proudhon argued,

{{quote|I have shown the contractor, at the birth of industry, negotiating on equal terms with his comrades, who have since become his workmen. It is plain, in fact, that this original equality was bound to disappear through the advantageous position of the master and the dependent position of the wage-workers. In vain does the law assure the right of each to enterprise&amp;nbsp;... When an establishment has had leisure to develop itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself a body of patrons, what can a workman do against a power so superior?&lt;ref&gt;System of Economical Contradictions, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Gradualism and dual-power===
{{Main|Dual power (leftist theory)}}
Dual power is the process of building alternatives institutions to the ones that already exist in modern society. Originally theorized by Proudhon, it has become adopted by many anti-state movements like [[Autonomism]] and [[Agorism]]. Proudhon described it as: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political institutions, out of the sight of statemen and priests, society is producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a new order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy...&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century.'' Translated by John Beverly Robinson. New York: Haskell House Publishers, Ltd., 1923, 1969 [1851]. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dual power should not be confused with the [[Dual power (Russian_Revolution)|Dual Power]] popularized by [[Vladimir Lenin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=The Dual Power|date=April 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/may/20.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=Has Dual Power Disappeared?|date=May 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch11.htm|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|title=Dual Power|date=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also theorized by Proudhon, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Murray|last=Bookchin|title=The Third Revolution: Popular Movements in the Revolutionary Era|volume=Volume 2|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=1996|page=115|quote=Proudhon made the bright suggestion, in his periodical ''Le Représentant du peuple'' (April 28, 1848), that the mass democracy of the clubs could become a popular forum where the social agenda of the revolution could be prepared for use by the [[Constituent Assembly]]—a proposal that would essentially have defused the potency of the clubs as a potentially rebellious dual power.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is referring to a more specific scenario where a revolutionary entity intentionally maintains the structure of the previous political institutions until the power of the previous institution is weakened enough such that the revolutionary entity can overtake it entirely. Dual-power as implemented by Mutualists and Agorists is the development of the alternative institution itself, which can create the Leninist scenario.

==Criticisms==
In Europe, a contemporary critic of Proudhon was the early [[anarcho-communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]].&lt;ref name="Dejacque"&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle – Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__150_years_of_Libertarian.html%5D The [[An Anarchist FAQ|Anarchist FAQ]] Editorial Collective. "150 years of Libertarian"]. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121228075826/http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__150_years_of_Libertarian.html%5D|date=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike and against Proudhon, he argued that "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature".&lt;ref name="Graham2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham|first=Robert|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas: from Anarchy to Anarchism (300 Ce to 1939)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9c9nQgAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Black Rose Books|isbn=978-1-55164-251-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"l'Echange", article in ''Le Libertaire'' no 6, September 21, 1858, New York. [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/libertaire/n06/lib01.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam. Anarchist-Communism"&gt;Déjacque criticized French [[Mutualism (economy)|mutualist]] anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as far as "the Proudhonist version of [[Ricardian socialism]], centred on the reward of labour power and the problem of exchange value. In his polemic with Proudhon on women's emancipation, Déjacque urged Proudhon to push on 'as far as the abolition of the contract, the abolition not only of the sword and of capital, but of property and authority in all their forms,' and refuted the commercial and wages logic of the demand for a 'fair reward' for 'labour' (labour power). Déjacque asked: 'Am I thus... right to want, as with the system of contracts, to measure out to each—according to their accidental capacity to produce—what they are entitled to?' The answer given by Déjacque to this question is unambiguous: 'it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.' [...] For Déjacque, on the other hand, the communal state of affairs—the phalanstery 'without any hierarchy, without any authority' except that of the 'statistics book'—corresponded to 'natural exchange,' i.e. to the 'unlimited freedom of all production and consumption; the abolition of any sign of agricultural, individual, artistic or scientific property; the destruction of any individual holding of the products of work; the demonarchisation and the demonetarisation of manual and intellectual capital as well as capital in instruments, commerce and buildings."[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alain_Pengam__Anarchist-Communism.html#toc2 Alain Pengam. "Anarchist-Communism"]&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to New York, he was able to serialise his book in his periodical ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement social''. Published in 27 issues from June 9, 1858 to February 4, 1861, ''Le Libertaire'' was the first anarcho-communist journal published in the United States.

One area of disagreement between mutualists and anarcho-communists stems from Proudhon's advocacy of [[money]] and later [[labour voucher]]s to compensate individuals for their labor as well as markets or [[artificial market]]s for goods and services. [[Peter Kropotkin]], like other anarcho-communists, advocated the abolition of labor remuneration and questioned "how can this new form of wages, the [[Labour voucher|labor note]], be sanctioned by those who admit that houses, fields, mills are no longer private property, that they belong to the commune or the nation?".&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-wage-system The Wage System, Freedom Pamphlets No. 1, New Edition 1920]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George Woodcock]], Kropotkin believed that a wage system in any form, whether "administered by Banks of the People or by workers' associations through [[Labour voucher|labor cheques]]" is a form of compulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. Broadview Press 2004. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collectivist anarchism|Collectivist anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]] was an adamant critic of Proudhonian mutualism as well,&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. [[The Spanish Anarchists]]. AK Press. 1996. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; stating: "How ridiculous are the ideas of the individualists of the Jean Jacques Rousseau school and of the Proudhonian mutualists who conceive society as the result of the free contract of individuals absolutely independent of one another and entering into mutual relations only because of the convention drawn up among men. As if these men had dropped from the skies, bringing with them speech, will, original thought, and as if they were alien to anything of the earth, that is, anything having social origin".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism by Murray Bookchin, from Maximoff, Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism from pro-market sectors has been common as well. Economist [[George Reisman]] charges that mutualism supports exploitation when it does not recognize a right of an individual to protect land that he has mixed his labor with if he happens to not be using it. Reisman sees the seizure of such land as the theft of the product of labor and has said: "Mutualism claims to oppose the exploitation of labor, i.e. the theft of any part of its product. But when it comes to labor that has been mixed with land, it turns a blind eye out foursquare on the side of the exploiter".&lt;ref&gt;Reisman, George. Mutualism's Support for the Exploitation of Labor and State Coercion. [http://blog.mises.org/archives/005219.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutualism today==
[[Kevin Carson]] is a contemporary mutualist and author of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]''. In its preface, Carson describes this work as "an attempt to revive [[individualist anarchist]] political economy, to incorporate the useful developments of the last hundred years, and to make it relevant to the problems of the twenty-first century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html][[Kevin Carson]]&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy.'' {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v8wrbTrn?url=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html|date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary mutualists are among those involved in the [[Alliance of the Libertarian Left]] and in the [[Voluntary Cooperation Movement]].

Carson holds that [[capitalism]]{{Ref|capitalism}} has been founded on "an act of robbery as massive as feudalism" and argues that capitalism could not exist in the absence of a state. He says "[i]t is state intervention that distinguishes capitalism from the free market".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin. [http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Mutualist Political Economy] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v8wrbTrn?url=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html |date=2010-12-21 }}, Preface&lt;/ref&gt; He does not define capitalism in the idealized sense, but says that when he talks about "capitalism" he is referring to what he calls "[[actually existing capitalism]]". He believes the term "''laissez-faire'' capitalism" is an oxymoron because capitalism, he argues, is "organization of society, incorporating elements of tax, usury, landlordism, and tariff, which thus denies the Free Market while pretending to exemplify it". However, he says he has no quarrel with anarcho-capitalists who use the term "''laissez-faire'' capitalism" and distinguish it from "actually existing capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.democraticunderground.com/111631888]&lt;/ref&gt; He says he has deliberately chosen to resurrect an old definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin A. [https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_7.pdf Carson's Rejoinders]. Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 20, No. 1 (Winter 2006): 97–136, pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt; However many Anarchists including Mutualists continue to use the term and do not consider it an old definition of the term. &lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain. ''An Anarchist FAQ Volume One'', AK Press, 2007, pp. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson argues that the centralization of wealth into a [[class hierarchy]] is due to state intervention to protect the [[ruling class]] by using a money monopoly, granting [[patent]]s and [[subsidies]] to corporations, imposing discriminatory [[taxation]] and intervening militarily to gain access to international markets. Carson's thesis is that an authentic [[free market economy]] would not be capitalism as the separation of labor from ownership and the subordination of labor to capital would be impossible, bringing a class-less society where people could easily choose between working as a freelancer, working for a [[living wage|fair wage]], taking part of a cooperative, or being an entrepreneur. As did Tucker before him, he notes that a mutualist free market system would involve significantly different property rights than capitalism is based on, particularly in terms of land and intellectual property.{{ref|carsonIronFist}}

==Notes and references==
===Notes===
#{{note|middleway}} "Involved with radical politics and in his contact with the Marxists, he [Proudhon] soon rejected their doctrine, seeking rather a middle way between socialist theories and classical economics." — Irving Horowitz, The Anarchists, 1964, Dell Publishing
#{{note|capitalism}} Some critics object to the use of the term ''capitalism'' in reference to historical or actually existing economic arrangements, which they term ''[[mixed economies]]''. They reserve the term for the ''abstract ideal'' or ''future possibility'' of a genuinely free market. This sort of ''free-market capitalism'' may closely follow Carson's ''free-market anti-capitalism'' in its practical details except for the fact that Carson does not recognize a right of an individual to protect land that he has transformed through labor or purchased to be protected when he is not using it. Carson, like other mutualists, only recognize occupancy and use as the standard for retaining legitimate control over something. According to Carson, "For mutualists, occupancy and use is the only legitimate standard for establishing ownership of land, regardless of how many times it has changed hands. An existing owner may transfer ownership by sale or gift; but the new owner may establish legitimate title to the land only by his own occupancy and use. A change in occupancy will amount to a change in ownership. Absentee landlord rent, and exclusion of homesteaders from vacant land by an absentee landlord, are both considered illegitimate by mutualists. The actual occupant is considered the owner of a tract of land, and any attempt to collect rent by a self-styled landlord is regarded as a violent invasion of the possessor's absolute right of property. (p.&amp;nbsp;200. of Carson's "Mutualist Political Economy").

The '''OK-GLI''' ({{lang-ru|Орбитальный корабль для горизонтальных лётных испытаний, ОК-ГЛИ|translit=Orbital'nyy korabl' dlya gorizontal'nykh lotnykh ispytaniy|lit=Orbital ship for horizontal flight tests}}), also known as Buran Analog '''BST-02''' (БТС-02), was a test vehicle ("Buran aerodynamic analogue") in the [[Buran programme]]. It was constructed in 1984, and was used for 25 test flights between 1985 and 1988 before being retired. It is now an exhibit at the [[Technik Museum Speyer]] in Germany.

== Construction ==
The development of the Buran began in the late 1970s as a response to the U.S. [[Space Shuttle program]]. The construction of the orbiters began in 1980, and by 1984 the first full-scale Buran was rolled out. The first [[sub-orbital flight|suborbital]] test flight of a scale-model took place as early as July 1983. As the project progressed, five additional scale-model flights were performed.

The OK-GLI (Buran Analog BST-02) test vehicle ("Buran aerodynamic analogue") was constructed in 1984. It was fitted with four [[Saturn AL-31|AL-31]] jet engines mounted at the rear (the fuel tank for the engines occupied a quarter of the cargo bay). This Buran could take off under its own power for flight tests, in contrast to the American ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' test vehicle, which was entirely unpowered and relied on an air launch.

The jets were used to take off from a normal landing strip, and once it reached a designated point, the engines were cut and the OK-GLI glided back to land.  This provided invaluable information about the handling characteristics of the Buran design, and significantly differed from the carrier plane/air drop method used by the US and the ''Enterprise'' test craft.

== Test flights ==

Nine taxi tests and twenty-five test flights of the OK-GLI were performed,&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k26.com/buran/Info/Timeline/buran-energia_timeline_history.html |title=Buran Energia Timeline History |publisher=Krzys Kotwicki |accessdate=4 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the vehicle was "worn out". All tests and flights were carried out at [[Baikonur]].

=== Zhukovsky Air Base ===
[[File:Orbiter.jpg|thumb|OK-GLI at MAKS-1997]]
[[File:Buran3.jpg|thumb|OK-GLI in Sydney]]
After the program was cancelled, the OK-GLI was stored at [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]], near [[Moscow]], where it was displayed during the annual [[MAKS (air show)|MAKS air show]].

=== Sydney, Australia ===
In 2000, the OK-GLI was sold to an Australian company called the [[Buran Space Corporation]], owned by Australian astronaut [[Paul Scully-Power]]. It was disassembled and transported by ship to [[Sydney]], Australia, via [[Gothenburg]], Sweden;&lt;ref name="transport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.procargo.fi/buran.html |title=Transporting the Russian Space shuttle Buran |publisher=ProCargo |accessdate=2 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210101748/http://www.procargo.fi/buran.html |archivedate=10 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving on 9 February 2000 and appeared as a static tourist attraction under a large temporary structure in [[Darling Harbour]] for a few years.&lt;ref name="australia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suburbia.com.au/~colinc/buran/buran.htm |title=Buran Analogue/002 in Sydney |website=Suburbia.com.au |accessdate=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="australia_2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-021000a.html |title=Russian shuttle lands down under |work=[[collectSPACE]] |first=Robert Z. |last=Pearlman |date=10 February 2000 |accessdate=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon reassembly, the OK-GLI was put on display in a temporary enclosure for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney. Visitors could walk around and inside the vehicle (a walkway was built along the cargo bay), and plans were in place for a tour of various cities in Australia and Asia. The owners went into bankruptcy after the Olympics, and the vehicle was moved into the open air and stored for a year, in a fenced-in parking lot and protected by nothing more than a large tarpaulin, where it suffered deterioration and repeated vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/spacecraft/q0241.shtml |title=Analog Buran Test Vehicle |website=Aerospaceweb.org |accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OK-GLI was then offered for sale, including by a radio auction on the American [[KFWB|News 980 KFWB-AM]] with a starting price of {{US$|6 million}},&lt;ref name="shuttle_sale_1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/news/spacehistory/buran_auction_020509.html |title=Russian Shuttle Buran, Slightly Used, Goes Up for Auction Today |work=Space.com |first=Jim |last=Banke |date=9 May 2002 |accessdate=3 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115220343/http://space.com/news/spacehistory/buran_auction_020509.html |archivedate=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it did not receive any genuine bids.&lt;ref name="shuttle_sale_2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/news/spacehistory/buran_auction_ends_020523.html |title=Auction Fails to Sell Buran, Russian Shuttle Remains Available |work=Space.com |first=Jim |last=Banke |date=23 May 2002 |accessdate=3 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829214834/http://space.com/news/spacehistory/buran_auction_ends_020523.html |archivedate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahrain ===
In September 2004 a team of German journalists found the OK-GLI in Bahrain, having been abandoned after it was on display as an attraction of the 2002 "Bahrain Summer" festival.&lt;ref name="Buran-energia OK-GLI page"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buran-energia.com/bourane-buran/bourane-modele-gli.php |title=Analog shuttle, OK - GLI |website=Buran-energia.com |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shuttle_found"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/weltall/kurioser-fund-sowjet-shuttle-am-persischen-golf-aufgetaucht-a-319316.html |title=Kurioser Fund: Sowjet-Shuttle am Persischen Golf aufgetaucht |trans-title=Strange find: Soviet shuttle found in the Persian Gulf |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |first=Markus |last=Becker |date=22 September 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then bought by the [[Sinsheim Auto &amp; Technik Museum]], to be transported to Germany in 2005.&lt;ref name="german_museum"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/weltall/ueberraschender-handel-sinsheimer-museum-kauft-den-sowjet-shuttle-a-319521.html |title=Überraschender Handel: Sinsheimer Museum kauft den Sowjet-Shuttle |trans-title=Surprising trade: Sinsheimer museum buys the Soviet shuttle |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |first=Markus |last=Becker |date=23 September 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to legal issues, it remained in Bahrain for several years, pending settlement of an international court case over fees.&lt;ref name="bahrain legal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.gdnonline.com/NewsDetails.aspx?date=04/07/2015&amp;storyid=185595 |title=Buran case review set |work=[[Gulf Daily News]] |date=19 June 2007 |accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technik Museum Speyer, Germany ===

}}

On 4 March 2008 the OK-GLI began its journey by sea to the [[Technik Museum Speyer]] where it was refurbished and serves as a walk-in exhibit.&lt;ref name="going to Germany"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/touchdown-at-technical-museum-russian-space-shuttle-navigates-rhine-river-a-545835.html |title=Touchdown at Technical Museum: Russian Space Shuttle Navigates Rhine River |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |agency=Reuters |date=7 April 2008 |accessdate=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journey got off to an inauspicious start when, during the transfer from the storage barge to the ship, there was a failure of the aft spreader (part of the lifting mechanism) and the tail of the vehicle dropped from just above [[Deck (ship)|deck]] height to the bottom of the [[hold (ship)|hold]]. No one was hurt and both the ship and vehicle seemed to suffer only minor damage.

Taking an '''objective approach''' to an issue means having due regard for the known valid [[evidence]] (relevant [[fact]]s, logical implications and viewpoints and human purposes) pertaining to that issue. If relevant valid evidence is denied, an objective approach is impossible. An objective approach is particularly important in [[science]], and in decision-making processes which affect large numbers of people (e.g. [[politics]]).

==Science==
Scientific progress can be regarded as a three-way contest between rival theories and a stock of evidence held in common. If rival interpretations are denied or if evidence is denied, then this impairs the possibility for rational debate and criticism, and consequently the growth of knowledge. On that ground, many scientists have proclaimed themselves in favour of freedom of thought and expression. If evidence is falsified as for example in conducting a control experiment knowledge is gained leading to the progress of an objective argument as the falsification resembles proof.

==Politics==
In decisions affecting large numbers of people (such as in politics) ignoring relevant evidence or alternative interpretations could lead to policies which, although perhaps well-intentioned, have the opposite effect of what was really intended.

In this context, it is often argued{{Weasel-inline|date=July 2014}} that although [[democracy]] might hamper swift, decisive action, it is nevertheless the best guarantee that all relevant facts and interpretations are included in the decision-making process, resulting in policies with greater long-term benefits.
549749

==Criticism==
Taking an "objective approach" may not always be relevant, particularly in cases where it is impossible to be objective either because the relevant facts and viewpoints necessary are lacking, or because it is the [[subjectivity|subjective]] opinion or response that happens to be important. Thus it is possible to take an "objective approach" inappropriately in situations which call for an expression of subjective thought or feeling.

Sometimes it is argued that an objective approach is impossible because people will naturally take a partisan, self-interested approach.
That is, they will select out those views and facts which agree with their own (cf. [[confirmation bias]]). However this view fails to explain why, for example, people will do things which are not in their self-interest, based on what they believe to be an objective approach.

==Neutrality==
A scientist or politician may never be "neutral" (they may have a vested interest in particular theories or policies) but they might also take an objective approach in the sense of remaining open to alternative viewpoints and new evidence.

In a [[rationality|rational]] discourse, such an "open-minded" stance is important, especially because it may not be known in advance which facts and arguments are truly relevant to resolving an issue. A "closed" stance would foreclose discussion and debate, usually on the assumption that the relevant facts and arguments are already known and judged.

==Authority==
Taking an objective approach often contrasts with arguments from [[authority]], where it is argued that ''X'' is true because an authority ''Y'' says so. The presumption is that ''Y'' is an authority capable of taking the most objective approach. But it may be necessary to evaluate the view of ''Y'' against other authorities likewise claiming to take an objective approach. This is an important aspect of academic [[scholarly method]] in the modern sense. Also, note that Wikipedia is not an uncontroversial (and some would argue not objective) source, and one should consider this when using it for research (which you should not do uncritically or unreservedly).

--&gt;
'''Orfeu Bertolami''' ([[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], 1959) is a [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] who works in problems of  [[astrophysics]], [[cosmology]], [[general relativity]] and [[quantum gravity]]. He worked at [[Instituto Superior Técnico]]  in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] from 1991 to 2010. He is currently professor at [[Departamento de Física e Astronomia]] of the Faculdade de Ciências da [[Universidade do Porto]]. 
&lt;!--  Studied ...  --&gt;

He is the author of a book to raise the awareness of the public on science about the [[history of ideas]] in astronomy, cosmology and theories of gravity (in Portuguese) and of a technical text on the aspects of gravity and propulsion in space published by the European Space Agency:

* ''O Livro das Escolhas Cósmicas'', Editora Gradiva 2006
* ''Gravity Control and Possible Influence on Space Propulsion: A Scientific Study'', European Space Agency 2002

In particular, Bertolami studied [http://inspirehep.net/record/427737/ baryogengesis], the [http://www.springerlink.com/content/6hp1201534v745h0/ cosmological constant problem] and its connection with the [https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3110 equivalence principle], the [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0202064 generalized Chaplygin gas model] of unification of  [[Dark Energy]] (to explain the [[cosmic acceleration]]) and [[Dark Matter]] (to explain the flattening of the [[rotation curves of galaxies]]) and some [[Modified models of gravity]] with [https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1733 non-minimal coupling between curvature and matter]. He has also worked on the [[Pioneer Anomaly]], which was shown to be most likely due to 
[https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0041 on-board thermal effects] and [https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1103.5222 reflection of the generated radiation]. Most recent work concerns [http://inspirehep.net/record/1335733/ extensions of quantum mechanics based on phase-space noncommutativity].

A '''palindromic prime''' (sometimes called a '''palprime''') is a [[prime number]] that is also a [[palindromic number]]. Palindromicity depends on the [[Radix|base]] of the numbering system and its writing conventions, while primality is independent of such concerns. The first few [[decimal]] palindromic primes are:
:[[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[101 (number)|101]], [[131 (number)|131]], [[151 (number)|151]], 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929, … {{OEIS|id=A002385}} 

Except for 11, all palindromic primes have an odd number of digits, because the [[divisibility test]] for 11 tells us that every palindromic number with an even number of digits is a multiple of 11.  It is not known if there are infinitely many palindromic primes in base 10. The largest known {{As of|2014|03|lc=on}} is (320,237 digits):
:10&lt;sup&gt;320236&lt;/sup&gt; + 10&lt;sup&gt;160118&lt;/sup&gt; + (137×10&lt;sup&gt;160119&lt;/sup&gt; + 731×10&lt;sup&gt;159275&lt;/sup&gt;) × (10&lt;sup&gt;843&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)/999 + 1.
It was found in 2014 by David Broadhurst. The previous record was 
10&lt;sup&gt;314727&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;8×10&lt;sup&gt;157363&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, found by Darren Bedwell in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=53 ''The Top Twenty: Palindrome'']&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is known that, for any base, [[almost all]] palindromic numbers are composite,&lt;ref&gt;William D. Banks, Derrick N. Hart, Mayumi Sakata, February 1, 2008 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0405056.pdf "Almost All Palindromes Are Composite"]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the ratio between palindromic composites and all palindromes below ''n'' tends to 1.

In [[binary numeral system|binary]], the palindromic primes include the [[Mersenne prime]]s and the [[Fermat prime]]s. All binary palindromic primes except binary 11 (decimal 3) have an odd number of digits; those palindromes with an even number of digits are divisible by 3. The sequence of binary palindromic primes begins (in binary):
:11, 101, 111, 10001, 11111, 1001001, 1101011, 1111111, 100000001, 100111001, 110111011, ... {{OEIS|id=A117697}}

The palindromic primes in [[duodecimal|base 12]] are: (using reversed two and three for ten and eleven, respectively)
:2, 3, 5, 7, Ɛ, 11, 111, 131, 141, 171, 181, 1Ɛ1, 535, 545, 565, 575, 585, 5Ɛ5, 727, 737, 747, 767, 797, Ɛ1Ɛ, Ɛ2Ɛ, Ɛ6Ɛ, ...

Due to the [[superstition|superstitious]] significance of the numbers it contains, the palindromic prime 1000000000000066600000000000001 is known as [[Belphegor's Prime]], named after [[Belphegor]], one of the seven princes of [[Hell]]. Belphegor's Prime consists of the number [[666_(number)#The_Number_of_the_Beast|666]], on either side enclosed by [[13 (number)#Unlucky_13|thirteen]] zeroes and a one. Belphegor's Prime is an example of a '''beastly palindromic prime''' in which a prime ''p'' is palindromic with 666 in the center. Another beastly palindromic prime is 700666007.&lt;ref&gt;See Caldwell, ''Prime Curios!'' (CreateSpace, 2009) p. 251, quoted in {{cite news | last =Wilkinson | first =Alec | title =The Pursuit of Beauty | newspaper =The New Yorker | date =February 2, 2015 | url =http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/pursuit-beauty | accessdate = January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ribenboim defines a '''triply palindromic prime''' as a prime ''p'' for which: ''p'' is a palindromic prime with ''q'' digits, where ''q'' is a palindromic prime with ''r'' digits, where ''r'' is also a palindromic prime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paulo Ribenboim]], ''The New Book of Prime Number Records''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''p'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;11310&lt;/sup&gt; + 4661664{{e|5652}} + 1, which has ''q'' = 11311 digits, and 11311 has ''r'' = 5 digits. The first (base-10) triply palindromic prime is the 11-digit 10000500001. It's possible that a triply palindromic prime in base 10 may also be palindromic in another base, such as base 2, but it would be highly remarkable if it were also a triply palindromic prime in that base as well.

[[Image:london-park-system.jpg|thumb|right|The County of London Park System, planned by [[Patrick Abercrombie]] in 1943-4|300px]]  A '''park system''', also known as an open space system, is a network of green spaces that are connected by public walkways, bridleways or cycleways. The concept first emerged with the need to minimize fragmentation of natural environments and was referred to as "[[Wildlife corridor|patch and corridor]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahern|first1=Jack|title=Greenways as a Planning Strategy|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|date=1995|volume=33|pages=131–155|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/016920469502039V/1-s2.0-016920469502039V-main.pdf?_tid=40541390-2eb5-11e7-81ea-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1493674346_9ae3299e8869afa5e4604041c0ca6552|doi=10.1016/0169-2046(95)02039-v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[landscape architecture]], the park system is collaborating with the idea of planning [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]], which run through urban and rural areas. These systems can serve the landscape through ecological, recreational, social, cultural, and healthful measures, and are designed with intentions of [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the earliest park systems, in London, came into existence by chance. As London expanded around former royal parks in the nineteenth century, [[St. James's Park]], [[Green Park]] and [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] became part of the urban area. This arrangement was admired in France and adopted for the nineteenth century re-planning of Paris by [[Baron Haussmann]]. It was also admired by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and used to create the famous [[Emerald Necklace]] in Boston. Another example is [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s Adirondack Park concept. These green networks were part of the nineteenth century [[Garden city movement|Garden City Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zube|first=Ervin H.|date=1995|title=Greenways and the U.S. National Park System|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0169204694020114/1-s2.0-0169204694020114-main.pdf?_tid=b9cbffaa-2eb8-11e7-9307-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1493675838_474529eabbfc6b0dd0ddea0aa781e5a6|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=33|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/0169-2046(94)02011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1927, the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission]] was formed to plan and acquire parklands along stream valley corridors in the then-rural northern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C.  Over 33,000 acres (130&amp;nbsp;km²) are now protected in the [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] portion and provide welcome green space in this urbanized region.  A major proposal for a park system was included in [[Patrick Abercrombie]]'s 1943-4 [[County of London Plan]].

The largest continuous urban parks system in [[North America]] is the [[North Saskatchewan River valley parks system]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada, which is {{convert|7400|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size and {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, and also includes 22 ravines, which have a combined total length of {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Ribbon&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edmonton.ca/environmental/documents/Ribbon_of_GreenMaster_Plan.pdf#xml=http://search1.edmonton.ca/texis/ThunderstoneSearchService/pdfhi.txt?query=north+saskatchewan+river+valley&amp;pr=www.edmonton.ca&amp;prox=page&amp;rorder=750&amp;rprox=250&amp;rdfreq=0&amp;rwfreq=0&amp;rlead=750&amp;rdepth=0&amp;sufs=1&amp;order=r&amp;cq=&amp;id=4d9aed517 | title=Ribbon of Green: North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravine System Master Plan | publisher=City of Edmonton | accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest urban parks system in [[Australia]] is the [[Western Sydney Parklands]], which is {{convert|5280|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size and {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/planmanagement/draft/WesternSydneyRPPOMFinalDraft.pdf |title=Western Sydney Regional Park Draft Plan of Management |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=16 May 2013 |quote=It is approximately 5,280 hectares in size and is the largest urban park in Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pioneer Venus Multiprobe''', also known as '''Pioneer Venus 2''' or '''Pioneer 13''' was a spacecraft launched in 1978 to explore [[Venus]] as part of [[NASA]]'s [[Pioneer program]]. This part of the mission included a spacecraft Bus which was launched from Earth carrying one large and three smaller probes, which after separating penetrated the Venusian atmosphere at a different location, returning data as they descended into the planets thick atmosphere. The entry occurred on December 9, 1978.


==In context==
There was also an orbiter launched this year also, part of the overall [[Pioneer Venus project]] along with this entry probe mission. Whereas the probes entered the atmosphere in 1978, the orbiter would stay in orbit throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s. (see [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]]) The next major mission was the Magellan spacecraft, which was an orbiter capable mapping Venus by seeing through its opaque clouds with radar.

Another NASA entry probe mission was the [[Galileo probe]], which was for planet Jupiter.

== Spacecraft ==
[[File:Pioneer Venus 2 inspection.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Pioneer Venus Bus with probes attached]]
The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe bus was constructed by the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], built around the HS-507 [[spacecraft bus|bus]]. It was cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of {{convert|2.5|m}} and a mass of {{convert|290|kg}}. Unlike the probes, which did not begin making direct measurements until they had decelerated lower in the atmosphere, the bus returned data on Venus' upper atmosphere.

The bus was targeted to enter the Venusian atmosphere at a shallow entry angle and transmit data until destruction by the heat of atmospheric friction. The objective was to study the structure and composition of the atmosphere down to the surface, the nature and composition of the clouds, the radiation field and energy exchange in the lower atmosphere, and local information on atmospheric circulation patterns. With no [[heat shield]] or [[parachute]], the bus made upper atmospheric measurements with two instruments:

* '''BIMS''' - an [[ion]] [[mass spectrometer]] to determine the origin and long-term development of the Venusian atmosphere, the dynamics of the upper atmosphere layers, its energy balance and the effect of [[solar radiation]] and [[interplanetary space]] on those layers. This instrument had a range of 1 to 46 [[Atomic mass|u]], used 6 W of power and weighed {{convert|5|kg|lb}}.
* '''BNMS''' - a neutral mass [[spectrometer]]. This made measurements of the interaction between the [[solar wind]] and [[Venus]], the photochemistry of the upper layers of and heat distribution in the [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venusian atmosphere]]. It had a range of 1 to 60 u, weighed {{convert|1|kg|lb}}, and used ~1W of power.

The spacecraft operated down to an altitude of about 110&amp;nbsp;km before disintegrating.

== Probes ==
The spacecraft carried one large and three small atmospheric probes, designed to collect data as they descended into the [[atmosphere of Venus]]. The probes did not carry photographic instruments, and were not designed to survive landing – the smaller probes were not equipped with parachutes, and the larger probe's parachute was expected to detach as it neared the ground. All four probes continued transmitting data until impact; however, one survived and continued to transmit data from the surface.

=== Large probe ===
[[File:Pioneer Venus Large Probe.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Pioneer Venus Large Probe opens its parachute (Artist's rendition)]]
The Large probe carried seven experiments, contained within a sealed spherical pressure vessel. The science experiments were:
* '''LNMS''' - neutral [[mass spectrometer]] to measure the atmospheric composition
* '''LGC''' - [[gas chromatograph]] to measure the atmospheric composition
* '''LSFR''' - solar flux radiometer to measure solar flux penetration in the atmosphere
* '''LIR''' - infrared radiometer to measure distribution of infrared radiation
* '''LCPS''' - cloud particle size spectrometer to measure particle size and shape
* '''LN''' - [[nephelometer]] to search for cloud particles
* temperature, pressure, and acceleration sensors

This pressure vessel was encased in a nose cone and aft protective cover. After deceleration from initial atmospheric entry at about {{convert|11.5|km/s}} near the equator on the night side of Venus, a [[parachute]] was deployed at 67&amp;nbsp;km altitude. The large probe was about {{convert|150|cm}} in diameter and the pressure vessel itself was {{convert|73.2|cm|in|sp=us}} in diameter.

=== Small probes ===
[[File:Smallvenusprobe.gif|thumb|upright|A small probe (1-antenna, 2-temperature sensor, 3-frontal protection, 4-hermetic container, 5-nephelometer, 6-radiometer)]]
[[File:Entry-points-for-Pioneer-Venus-Atmosphere-probes.png|thumb|right|250px|Entry of Pioneer Venus Multiprobe]]
[[File:Pioneer-Venus-large-prode-descent-sequence.png|thumb|right|250px|Pioneer Venus Large Probe descent sequence]]

Three identical small probes, around {{convert|0.8|m}} in diameter, were deployed. These probes consisted of spherical pressure vessels surrounded by an aeroshell, but unlike the large probe, they had no parachutes and the aeroshells did not separate from the probes.

The science experiments were:&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/pioneer_venus.html |title=Pioneer Venus Project Information |work=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center |accessdate=2016-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a neutral [[mass spectrometer]] to measure the atmospheric composition
* a [[gas chromatograph]] to measure the atmospheric composition
* '''SNFR''' - [[Radiant flux|solar flux radiometer]] to measure solar flux penetration in the atmosphere
* an infrared radiometer to measure distribution of infrared radiation
* '''MTUR''' - cloud particle size spectrometer to measure particle size and shape
* '''SN''' - [[nephelometer]] to search for cloud particles
* '''SAS''' - temperature, pressure, and acceleration sensors

The radio signals from all four probes were also used to characterize the winds, turbulence, and propagation in the atmosphere. The small probes were each targeted at different parts of the planet and were named accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/pvprobes.html Pioneer Venus Probes]. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''North probe''' entered the atmosphere at about 60 degrees north latitude on the day side.
* The '''Night probe''' entered on the night side.
* The '''Day probe''' entered well into the day side, and was the only one of the four probes which continued to send radio signals back after impact, for over an hour.

== Launch ==
The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe was launched by an [[Atlas-Centaur|Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1AR]] rocket, which flew from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 36|Launch Complex 36A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. The launch occurred at 07:33 on August 8, 1978, and deployed the Multiprobe into [[heliocentric orbit]] for its coast to Venus.

== Arrival at Venus ==
Prior to the Multiprobe reaching Venus, the four probes were deployed from the main bus. The large probe was released on November 16, 1978, and the three small probes on November 20.

All four probes and the bus reached Venus on December 9, 1978. The large probe was the first to enter the atmosphere, at 18:45:32 UTC, followed over the next 11 minutes by the other three probes. The bus entered the atmosphere at 20:21:52 UTC, and returned its last signal at 20:22:55 from an altitude of {{convert|110|km|mi}}.

The four probes transmitted data until they impacted the surface of Venus. The Day Probe survived impact, returning data from the surface for over an hour.

== Scientific results ==

Below the altitude of 50&amp;nbsp;km the temperatures measured by the four probes are identical to within a few degrees. They are between 448&amp;nbsp;°C and 459&amp;nbsp;°C (838&amp;nbsp;°F and 858&amp;nbsp;°F) on the surface. The ground pressure is between 86.2 bar and 94.5 bar. Nephelometers identified three [[cloud]] layers with different characteristics. The most remarkable discovery was that the ratio of [[Argon|&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;argon]] / [[Argon|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;argon]] [[isotope]]s much higher than in the atmosphere which seems to indicate that the genesis of the [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venusian atmosphere]] is very different from that of [[Earth]]. The reconstituted trajectory of atmospheric probes was determined that the wind averaged a speed of 200&amp;nbsp;m/s in the middle cloud layer at 50&amp;nbsp;m/s at the base of these clouds and just 1&amp;nbsp;m/s at the ground. Overall data from airborne sensors confirmed, while specifying the data obtained by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space probe [[Venera]] program that preceded this mission.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Ulivi et David M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10045">The '''Rocket City Space Pioneers''' (RCSP) was one of 29 teams from 17 different countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/teams |title=Teams |publisher=Google Lunar XPRIZE |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; officially registered and in the competition for the [[Google Lunar X Prize|Google Lunar X PRIZE]] (GLXP) during 2010–2012.

The RCSP was drawn from [[Alabama]] businesses, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations.  It announced entry into the competition on 7 September 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/space-news/2010/09/huntsville_team_will_race_othe.html |title=Huntsville team will race others to land new rover on the moon &amp;#124; AL.com |publisher=Blog.al.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and departed from the competition after the team was acquired by [[Moon Express]] in December 2012.

==History==
In December 2012, the Rocket City Space Pioneers team was acquired by one of the other Google Lunar X-Prize teams, [[Moon Express]], from [[Dynetics]] for an undisclosed sum.  The new agreement makes [[Tim Pickens]], the former lead of the RCSP team, the Chief Propulsion Engineer for MoonEx.&lt;ref name=nsw20121220&gt;{{cite news |last=Lindsey|first=Clark |title=MoonEx Acquires RCSP of Dynetics |url=http://www.newspacewatch.com/articles/moonex-acquires-rcsp-of-dynetics.html |accessdate=2012-12-21 |newspaper=NewSpace Watch |date=2012-12-20 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Rocket City Space Pioneers' stated primary mission was to capture the GLXP $20 million Grand Prize, as well as the $4 million Apollo Heritage Bonus Prize.

The RCSP was developing a low-cost [[lunar rover|lunar lander/rover system]] for conducting commercial and scientific missions on [[the Moon]].  This system was intended to be capable of making a soft landing on the Moon and deploying a robotic rover. It was to be launched from the Earth by a medium-lift [[launch vehicle]] as part of a larger payload, then taken to a lunar orbit by a “tug” rocket-propulsion unit, and finally dropped to the Moon’s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/teams/rocket-city-space-pioneers/about/ |title=Teams |publisher=Google Lunar XPRIZE |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight Sequence===
A [[Falcon 9]] two-stage rocket, built by [[SpaceX]], was notionally planned to be launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] to place several metric tons of payload into a [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit]] (GTO). This RCSP payload was planned to consist of a primary payload, multiple rideshare payloads, and a tug (an [[EELV Secondary Payload Adapter|ESPA]] ring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moog.com/products/spacecraft-payload-interfaces/heavy-lift.-excess-capacity.-small-satellites/ |title=ESPA: The EELV Secondary Payload Adapter - Heavy Lift. Excess Capacity. Small Satellites. |publisher=Moog |date=2007-03-08 |accessdate=2015-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221170625/http://www.moog.com/products/spacecraft-payload-interfaces/heavy-lift.-excess-capacity.-small-satellites/ |archivedate=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an added propulsion module). Once in [[Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit]], the primary payload was to be deployed, along with three secondary payloads. The tug, containing the remaining three payloads, was to have separated from the Falcon 9 second stage and perform a [[Trans Lunar Injection]] burn. As the tug neared the Moon, it was planned to make a final braking burn, inserting it with its payloads in a [[Lunar orbit|Low Lunar Orbit]] (LLO)

Once in LLO, the tug was to have deployed the remaining three payloads, including the RCSP lander. The lander/rover will have its own small retrorocket, and, after being jettisoned from the tug, was projected to conduct a braking maneuver to land softly on the lunar surface. Once on the surface, the lander, would deploy a small rover for the required exploration.

===Surface Exploration===
As initially planned by the RCSP team, the rover was to have been capable of driving at least {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} when it reached the lunar surface; this is twice the required GXLP roving distance. The rover was projected to be approximately {{convert|30|*|30|*|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in size and less than {{convert|10|kg|0|abbr=on}} in mass. The early design included a plan to leave the rover tethered to the lander, with all external control and communications through this multi-circuit tether. The rover was to have carried two or more high-definition video cameras and possibly other sensors. The lander was to contain the system for communicating with the control center on the Earth, possibly being relayed through the orbiting tug.

The specific landing site and exploration traverse was never announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lee Billings |url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/print/preserving_tranquility/ |title=Preserving Tranquility § |publisher=Seedmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team members==
The RCSP is based in and named after [[Huntsville, Alabama]] (widely known as "The Rocket City"). Huntsville has been a leader in rocket development and space exploration since the arrival of [[Wernher von Braun]] and his team in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Bob; ''Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun'', Naval Institute Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">'''Shape-memory coupling''' is a system for connecting pipes using [[shape-memory alloy]]s. In its typical form the technique uses an internally ribbed sleeve of alloy such as [[Tinel]] that is slightly smaller in diameter than the pipes it is to connect. The sleeve is cooled in [[liquid nitrogen]] then, in this low-temperature state, mechanically expanded with a [[mandrel]] to fit easily over the two pipe ends to be joined. After fitting, it is allowed to rewarm, when the memory effect causes the sleeve to shrink back to its original smaller size, creating a tight joint.

It was first produced in the late 1960s or early 1970s by the Raychem Corporation under the trade name CryoFit. Manufacture of these couplings for aerospace hydraulic connections was later transferred to AMCI (Advanced Metal Components Inc.) and then later to [http://www.aerofit.com Aerofit Products Inc.] Additional products using the same shape-memory alloy technology are produced under Cryolive and CryoFlare trade names.

The '''Smith Breeden Prize''' is an annual prize given to authors with the best [[finance]] [[research]] papers [[academic publishing|published]] in the ''[[Journal of Finance]]'' in any area other than [[corporate finance]].

==The Award==
Each year the associate [[Editing|editors]] of the Journal of Finance award five papers for excellence.  The two best [[finance]] papers in the subfield of corporate finance and the three best other papers from among all those papers that appeared in the first five issues of that year and in the December issue from the previous year are awarded prizes at the annual [[American Finance Association]] in January of the following year. Currently the Smith Breeden prizes are [[U.S. Dollar|$]]10,000 for first place and $5,000 for second, but these amounts may change from time to time.  Although the prize is funded by [[Smith Breeden Associates Inc.]], the administration of the Smith Breeden Prize is the responsibility of the Editor of The Journal of Finance and is carried out in conjunction with the selection of the [[Brattle Prize]]s. Associate Editors vote for the best two corporate finance papers (for the Brattle Prizes) and the best three other papers (for the Smith-Breeden Prizes). The papers receiving the most votes in their categories receive the prizes; however, a paper may not win in both categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afajof.org/journal/prizes.asp|accessdate=2007-09-10|title=Prizes and Awards|publisher=American Finance Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811072448/http://www.afajof.org/journal/prizes.asp|archivedate=2007-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal of Finance is one of the most prestigious and highly cited journals in finance and economics.  Each year hundreds of papers are submitted for publication.  In 2006, there were 1239 submissions (1037 new manuscripts), 86 articles published, and 8 Smith Breeden Prize nominees from which 1 first place winning paper and two second place distinguished papers were chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afajof.org/journal/edreport.asp|accessdate=2007-09-10|title=Journal of Finance Editor's Report|publisher=American Finance Association|date=2007-03-13|author=Harvey, Cam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taufik Akbar''' (born January 8, 1951 in [[Medan]]) is an [[Indonesia]]n [[engineer]] and former [[astronaut]] candidate.

After graduating at the [[Institut Teknologi Bandung|Bandung Institute of Technology]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Electrical Engineering in 1975, he worked as a telecommunication engineer. While working for [[Telkom (Indonesia)|Telkom]] in the development of the [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellite system, he was selected to take part in the Space Shuttle mission [[STS-61-H]] as a [[Payload specialist|Payload Specialist]] in October 1985. While [[Pratiwi Sudarmono]] was chosen to be in the flight crew, he was supposed to be her backup on the mission. However, after the [[STS-51-L|Challenger disaster]] the deployment of commercial satellites like the Indonesian [[Palapa B-3]] planned for that mission was canceled, thus the mission never took place. The satellite was later launched with a [[Delta rocket]].

After his astronaut career, he continued to work for Telkom. Within 1990-92, he was General Manager Telecommunication Planning, Executive General Manager for Palapa Satellites Operation (1992–1993), President Director of Aplikanusa Lintasarta (1994–2000). In 2000, he became Director of Human Resources.

'''''The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World''''' ({{lang-da|Verdens sande tilstand}}, literal translation: ''The True State of the World'') is a book by Danish environmentalist author [[Bjørn Lomborg]], controversial for its claims that [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], declining [[energy]] resources, [[deforestation]], [[extinction|species loss]], [[water crisis|water shortages]], certain aspects of [[global warming]], and an assortment of other global [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]] are unsupported by statistical analysis of the relevant data. It was first [[publishing|published]] in [[Danish language|Danish]] in 1998, while the English edition was published as a work in [[environmental economics]] by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/economics/natural-resource-and-environmental-economics/skeptical-environmentalist-measuring-real-state-world?format=PB|title=The Skeptical Environmentalist|website=Cambridge University Press|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the scope of the project, comprising the range of topics addressed, the diversity of data and sources employed, and the many types of conclusions and comments advanced, ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' does not fit easily into a particular scientific discipline or methodology. Although published by the [[social science]]s division of Cambridge University Press, the findings and conclusions were widely challenged on the basis of [[natural science]]. This interpretation of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' as a work of [[environmental science]] generated much of the controversy and debate that surrounded the book.

==The author==
{{Main|Bjørn Lomborg}}

[[Image:Bjørn Lomborg small.JPG|thumb|left|100px|Bjørn Lomborg]]
Prior to becoming the Director of the [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]] and Adjunct Professor at the [[Copenhagen Business School]], Bjørn Lomborg was an Associate Professor of [[Political Science]] at the [[University of Aarhus]].

Some critics{{Who|date=July 2011}} focus on his lack of training or professional experience in the environmental sciences or [[economics]]. Supporters {{Who|date=June 2012}}argue his research is an appropriate application of his expertise in [[cost-benefit analysis]], a standard analytical tool in policy assessment. His advocates further note that many of the scientists and environmentalists who criticized the book are not themselves environmental policy experts or experienced in cost-benefit research.

==Origins==
In numerous interviews, Lomborg ascribed his motivation for writing ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' to his personal convictions, making clear that he was a pro-environmentalist and [[Greenpeace]] supporter. He has stated that he began his research as an attempt to counter what he saw as anti-[[ecology|ecological]] arguments by [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] in an article in ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'', but changed his mind after starting to analyze data. Lomborg describes the views he attributes to environmental campaigners as the "[[Litany]]", which he at one time claims to have affirmed, but purports to correct in his work.

===Methods===
The general analytical approach employed by Lomborg is based on cost-benefit analyses as employed in economics, social science, and the formulation and assessment of government policy. Much of Lomborg's examination of his Litany is based on statistical data analysis, therefore his work may be considered a work of that nature. Since it examines the costs and benefits of its many topics, it could be considered a work in economics, as categorized by its publisher. However, ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' is methodologically eclectic and cross-disciplinary, combining interpretation of data with assessments of the media and human behavior, evaluations of scientific theories, and other approaches, to arrive at its various conclusions.

In arriving at the final work, Lomborg has used a similar approach in each of his work's main areas and subtopics. He progresses from the general to the specific, starting with a broad concern, such as [[pollution]] or energy, dividing it into subtopics (e.g. [[air pollution]]; [[peak oil|fossil fuel depletion]]), and then identifying one or more widely held fears and their source (e.g. our air is growing increasingly toxic, by X measure, according to Y). From there, Lomborg chooses data that he considers to be the most reliable and reasonable available. He then analyzes that data to prove or disprove his selected proposition. In every case, his calculations find that the claim is not substantiated, and is either an exaggeration, or a completely reversed portrayal of an improving situation, rather than a deteriorating one. Having established what he calls "the true state of the world", for each topic and subtopic, Lomborg examines a variety of theories, technologies, implementation strategies and costs, and suggests alternative ways to improve not-so-dire situations, or advance in other areas not currently considered as pressing.

==Contents==
''The Skeptical Environmentalist'''s subtitle refers to the ''[[State of the World (book series)|State of the World]]'' report, published annually since 1984 by the [[Worldwatch Institute]]. Lomborg designated the report "one of the best-researched and academically most ambitious environmental policy publications," but criticized it for using short-term trends to predict disastrous consequences, in cases where long-term trends would not support the same conclusions.

In establishing its arguments, ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' examined a wide range of issues in the general area of environmental studies, including environmental economics and science, and came to an equally broad set of conclusions and recommendations. Lomborg's work directly challenged popular examples of green concerns by interpreting data from some 3,000 assembled sources. The author suggested that environmentalists diverted potentially beneficial resources to less deserving environmental issues in ways that were economically damaging.  Much of the book's [[methodology]] and integrity have been subject to criticism which argue that Lomborg distorted the fields of research he covers. Support for the book was staunch as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resourse-1621-2004.18.pdf | format=PDF | title=When scientists politicize science: making sense of controversy over The Skeptical Environmentalist | first=Roger A. | last=Pielke Jr. | author-link=Roger A.

===''The Litany''===
"The Litany" comprises very diverse areas where, Lomborg claims, overly pessimistic claims are made and bad policies are implemented as a result. He cites accepted mainstream sources, like the United States government, [[United Nations]] agencies and others, preferring global long-term data over regional and short-term statistics.

''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' is arranged around four major themes:
# Human prosperity from an economic and demographic point of view
# Human prosperity from an ecological point of view
# Pollution as a threat to human prosperity
# Future threats to human prosperity

Lomborg's main argument is that the vast majority of environmental problems—such as pollution, water shortages, deforestation, and species loss, as well as population growth, hunger, and AIDS—are area-specific and highly correlated with poverty. Therefore, challenges to human prosperity are essentially logistical matters, and can be solved largely through economic and social development. Concerning problems that are more pressing at the global level, such as the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming, Lomborg argues that these issues are often overstated and that recommended policies are often inappropriate if assessed against alternatives.

==== 1. Human prosperity from an economic and demographic point of view ====

Lomborg analyzes three major themes: [[life expectancy]], food and [[hunger]], and prosperity, finding that life expectancy and health levels have ''dramatically'' improved over the past centuries, even though several regions of the world remain threatened, in particular by [[AIDS]]. He dismisses [[Thomas Malthus]]' theory that increases in the world's population lead to widespread hunger. On the contrary, Lomborg claims that food is widespread, and humanity's daily intake of calories is increasing, and will continue to rise until hunger's eradication, thanks to technological improvements in [[agriculture]]. However, Lomborg notes that [[Africa]] in particular still produces too little sustenance, an effect he attributes to the continent's dismal economic and political systems. Concerning prosperity, Lomborg argues that wealth, as measured by per capita GDP, should not be the only judging criterion. He points to improvements in education, safety, leisure, and ever more widespread access to consumer goods as signs that prosperity is increasing in most parts of the world.

====2. Human prosperity from an ecological point of view====
In this section, Lomborg looks at the world's natural resources and draws a conclusion that contrasts starkly to that of the well known report ''[[The Limits to Growth]]''. First, he analyzes food once more, this time from an ecological perspective, and again claims that most food products are not threatened by human growth. An exception, however, is fish, which continues to be depleted. As a partial solution, Lomborg presents fish farms, which cause a less disruptive impact on the world's oceans. Next, Lomborg looks at forests. He finds no indication of widespread [[deforestation]], and notes that even the Amazon still retains more than 80% of its 1978 tree cover. Lomborg points out that in [[developing country|developing countries]], deforestation is linked to poverty and poor economic conditions, so he proposes that economic growth is the best means to tackle the loss of forests.
Concerning energy, Lomborg asserts that oil is not being depleted as fast as is claimed, and that improvements of technology will provide people with fossil fuels for years to come. The author further asserts that many alternatives already exist, and that with time they will replace fossil fuels as an energy source. Concerning other resources, such as metals, Lomborg suggests that based on their price history they are not in short supply. Examining the challenge of collecting sufficient amounts of water, Lomborg says that wars will probably not erupt over water because fighting such wars is not cost-effective (one week of war with the Palestinians, for instance, would cost [[Israel]] more than five desalination plants, according to an Israeli officer). Lomborg emphasizes the need for better water management, as water is distributed unequally around the world.

==== 3. Pollution as a threat to human prosperity ====
Lomborg considers pollution from different angles. He notes that air pollution in wealthy nations has steadily decreased in recent decades. He finds that air pollution levels are highly linked to economic development, with moderately developed countries polluting most. Again, Lomborg argues that faster growth in emerging countries would help them reduce their air pollution levels. Lomborg suggests that devoting resources to reduce the levels of specific air pollutants would provide the greatest health benefits and save the largest number of lives (per amount of money spent), continuing an already decades-long improvement in air quality in most developed countries.  Concerning [[water pollution]], Lomborg notes again that it is connected with economic progress. He also notes that water pollution in major Western rivers decreased rapidly after the use of sewage systems became widespread. Concerning [[waste]], Lomborg notes once again that fears are overblown, as the entire waste produced by the United States in the 21st century could fit into a square 100 feet thick and 28&amp;nbsp;km along each side, or 0.009% of the total surface of the United States.

==== 4. Future threats to human prosperity ====
In this last section, Lomborg puts forward his main assertion: based on a cost-benefit analysis, the environmental threats to human prosperity are overstated and much of policy response is misguided.  As an example, Lomborg cites worries about [[pesticides]] and their link to [[cancer]]. He argues that such concerns are vastly exaggerated in the public perception, as alcohol and coffee are the foods that create by far the greatest risk of cancer, as opposed to vegetables that have been sprayed with pesticides. Furthermore, if pesticides were not used on fruit and vegetables, their cost would rise, and consequently their consumption would go down, which would cause cancer rates to increase. He goes on to criticize the fear of a vertiginous decline in [[biodiversity]], proposing that 0.7% of species have gone extinct in the last 50 years (as compared to a maximum of 50%, as claimed by some biologists). While Lomborg admits that extinctions are a problem, he asserts that they are not the catastrophe claimed by some, and have little effect on human prosperity.

Lomborg's most contentious assertion, however, involves [[global warming]]. From the outset, Lomborg "accepts the reality of man-made global warming" though he refers to a number of uncertainties in the computer simulations of climate change and some aspects of data collection.  His main contention involves not the science of global warming but the politics and the policy response to scientific findings. Lomborg points out that, given the amount of greenhouse gas reduction required to combat global warming, the current [[Kyoto protocol]] is grossly insufficient. He argues that the economic costs of legislative restrictions that aim to slow or reverse global warming are far higher than the alternative of international coordination. Moreover, he asserts that the cost of combating global warming would be disproportionately shouldered by &lt;!-- the poorer --&gt; developing countries. Lomborg proposes that since the Kyoto agreement limits economic activities, developing countries that suffer from pollution and poverty most, will be perpetually handicapped economically.

Lomborg proposes that the importance of global warming in terms of policy priority is low compared to other policy issues such as fighting poverty, disease and aiding poor countries, which has direct and more immediate impact both in terms of welfare and the environment. He therefore suggests that a global cost-benefit analysis be undertaken before deciding on future measures. The [[Copenhagen Consensus]] that Lomborg later organized concluded that combating global warming does have a benefit but its priority compared to other issues is "poor" (ranked 13th) and three projects addressing climate change (optimal carbon tax, the Kyoto protocol and value-at-risk carbon tax), are the least cost-efficient of its proposals.

===Conclusions===
Lomborg concludes his book by once again reviewing the Litany, and noting that the real state of the world is much better than the Litany claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' argues, the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges us to look at what he calls the true problems of the world, since solving those will also solve the Litany.

==Reaction==
''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' was controversial even before its English-language release, with anti-publication efforts launched against Cambridge University Press. Once in the public arena, the book elicited strong reactions in scientific circles and in the mainstream media. Opinion was largely polarized. Environmental groups were generally critical.

===Anti-publication pressures===
Dr. Chris Harrison (Publishing Director of social science publishing for [[Cambridge University Press]]), anticipating the level of controversy a book like ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' would likely provoke, took extra care with the book's peer-review process. Instead of choosing candidates from the usual list of social science referees, Cambridge University Press chose from a list provided by their environmental science publishing program. Four were chosen:  a [[climate]] scientist, an expert in [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability|sustainable]] development, a specialist on the economics of climate change (whose credentials include reviewing publications for the UN's [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)) and a "pure" economist.  All four members of Cambridge's initial review panel agreed that the book should be published.

While criticism of the book was to be expected, the publisher was apparently surprised by the pressure brought against it to not publish ''The Skeptical Environmentalist''. The complaints of some critics included demands that Cambridge convene a special panel to review the book in order to identify errors (despite existing pre-publication [[peer review]]), that Cambridge transfer their publishing rights to a "non-scholarly publishing house" and that they review their own policies to prevent publication of any book described as "essentially a political tract" in the future.

In the article, entitled "Peer review, politics and pluralism", Dr. Harrison noted that "many of the critical reviews of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' went beyond the usual unpicking of a thesis and concentrated instead on the role of the publisher in publishing the book at all. The post tray and e-mail inbox of editors and senior managers at the press bore witness to a concerted campaign to persuade Cambridge to renounce the book."  He went on to describe complaints from [[environmentalist]]s who feared the book would be "abused by corporate interests". Cambridge University Press felt it necessary to issue a formal, written statement, in order to "explain the editorial decisions that led not just to publishing the book but also to Cambridge's resistance to concerted pressure to withdraw it from the market." With these complaints and the publication of a ''[[Scientific American]]'' issue regarding the book (described below), Cambridge stated, in response to those who claimed the book lacked ''peer-review credentials'', "it would be quite wrong to abandon an author who had satisfied the requirements of our peer-review system."

Cambridge took the additional step of inviting submissions of publishing proposals for books which offered an opposing argument to Lomborg's but noted that they had, to the best of Chris Harrison's knowledge, seen no attempt by any of the critics to submit such a proposal.  This is seen by some{{Who|date=July 2011}} to suggest that criticism of the book was political rather than academic. Subsequent to Cambridge's unequivocal assertion that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' had been subject to peer-review, Harrison noted that
{{quote|we were surprised and disappointed to see the critics' letter being quoted in an issue of ''Time'' magazine (2 September 2002)... in which the authors repeated their charge that the book had not been peer-reviewed despite the assurances to the contrary that they had by then received by the press... It has become part of the anti-Lomborg folklore that this book bypassed the usual Cambridge peer-review process...  This is a charge that is repeated in many of the public and private attacks in the press, and it is unfounded.}}

Cambridge University Press maintained their position and the book was published.

====Criticism of the material and methods====
The January 2002 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'' contained, under the heading "Misleading Math about the Earth", a set of essays by several scientists, which claim that Lomborg and ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' misrepresent both scientific evidence and scientific opinion.  The magazine then refused Lomborg's request to print a lengthy point-by-point rebuttal in his own defence, on the grounds that the 32 pages would have taken a disproportionate share of the month's installment. ''Scientific American'' allowed Lomborg a one-page defense in the May 2002 edition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000001E0-157B-1CD4-B4A8809EC588EEDF "The Skeptical Environmentalist Replies"].

Retrieved: 21 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' also published a harsh review of Lomborg's book, in which [[Stuart Pimm]] of the [[Center for Environmental Research and Conservation]] at [[Columbia University]] and [[Jeffrey Harvey (biologist)|Jeff Harvey]] of the [[Netherlands Institute of Ecology]] wrote: ''"the text employs the strategy of those who, for example, argue that gay men aren't dying of AIDS, that Jews weren't singled out by the Nazis for extermination, and so on."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stuart Pimm |author2=Jeff Harvey |title=No need to worry about the future |journal=Nature |volume=414 |date=November 8, 2001 |doi=10.1038/35102629 |page=149 |issue=6860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lomborg has also been criticized for using [[straw man]] arguments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Local Environment | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with charges that his Litany of environmental doom-mongering does not accurately represent the mainstream views of the contemporary [[green movement]].

The "separately written expert reviews" further detail the various [[expert opinion]]s.  [[Peter Gleick]]'s assessment, for example, states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/ecology/gleick.pdf | title=Where's Waldo?  A Review of The Skeptical Environmentalist (Bjorn Lomborg) | work=Union of Concerned Scienists | author=Peter H Gleick | date=2001-11-06 | accessdate=2016-08-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829042627/http://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/ecology/gleick.pdf | archivedate=2016-08-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:There is nothing original or unique in Lomborg's book. Many of his criticisms have appeared in... previous works&amp;mdash;and even in the work of environmental scientists themselves. What is new, perhaps, is the scope and variety of the errors he makes.

[[Jerry Mahlman]]'s appraisal of the chapter he was asked to evaluate, states:
:I found some aspects of this chapter to be interesting, challenging, and logical. For example, the author's characterizations of the degree of difficulty in actually doing something meaningful about climate change through mitigation  and coping/adaptation are perceptive and valuable. In principle, such characterizations could provide a foundation for more meaningful policy planning on this difficult problem.  Unfortunately, the author's lack of rigor and consistency on these larger issues is likely to negate any real respect for his insights.

[[David Pimentel]], who was repeatedly criticized in the book, also wrote a critical review.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel. (Summer 2002). [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628121816/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmske/is_/ai_n28903009 Skeptical of the skeptical environmentalist]. ''Skeptic''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of media handling====
One critical article, "The Skeptical Environmentalist: A Case Study in the Manufacture of News",&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Matthew. [http://www.csicop.org/scienceandmedia/environmentalist/ "The Skeptical Environmentalist: A Case Study in the Manufacture of News"].  Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, 23 January 2003. Retrieved 21 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; attributes this media success to its initial, influential supporters:

:"News of the pending book first appeared in the UK in early June of 2001 when a ''Sunday Times'' article by Nayab Chohan featured an advanced report of claims made by Lomborg that London's air was cleaner than at any time since 1585.  Headlined "Cleanest London Air for 400 Years," the publicity hook was both local and timely, as the tail end of the article linked the book's questioning of the Kyoto climate change protocol to U.S. president George W. Bush's visit the same week to Europe, and Bush's controversial opposition to the treaty. The'' Times ''followed up the report the next day with a news article further detailing the book's Kyoto protocol angle."

:"With ''The Times'' reports, Lomborg and his claims had made the Anglo media agenda. As is typically the case, other media outlets followed the reporting of the elite newspaper. Articles pegging the claims of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' to Bush's European visit ran later that week in the U.K's ''The Express'' and ''Daily Telegraph'', and Canada's ''Toronto Star''."

The media was criticized for the biased selection of reviewers and not informing readers of reviewers' background. Richard C. Bell, writing for Worldwatch noted that the Wall Street Journal, "instead of seeking scientists with a critical perspective," like many publications "put out reviews by people who were closely associated with Lomborg", with the Journal soliciting a review from the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Ronald Bailey, someone "who had earlier written a book called The True State of the World, from which much of Lomborg's claims were taken." Bell also criticized the Washington Post, whose Sunday Book World assigned the book review to [[Denis Dutton]], identified as "a professor of philosophy who lectures on the dangers of pseudoscience at the science faculties of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand", and as the editor of the web site [[Arts and Letters Daily]]. Bell noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Post did not tell its readers that Dutton's web site features links to the Global Climate Coalition, an anti-Kyoto consortium of [[Energy Lobby|oil and coal businesses]], and to the messages of Julian Simon --the man whose [[climate change denial|denial]] that global warming was occurring apparently gave Lomborg the idea for his book in the first place. It was hardly surprising that Dutton anointed Lomborg's book as 'the most significant work on the environment since the appearance of its polar opposite, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, in 1962. It's a magnificent achievement.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/538 Commentary: Media Sheep]&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The "unrealistic" critique====
Some critics of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' took issue not with the statistical investigation of Lomborg's Litany, but with the suggestions and conclusions for which they were the foundation. This line of criticism considered the book as a contribution to the policy debate over environment rather than the work of natural science. In a [[BBC]] column from August 23, 2001, veteran BBC environmental correspondent [[Alex Kirby (journalist)|Alex Kirby]] wrote:

:"I am neither a statistician nor a scientist, and I lack the skill to judge Lomborg's reworkings of the statistics of conventional wisdom. But I am worried that on virtually every topic he touches, he reaches conclusions radically different from almost everybody else. That seems to suggest that most scientists are wrong, short-sighted, naïve, interested only in securing research funds, or deliberately dancing to the campaigners' tune. Most I know are honest, intelligent and competent. So it beggars belief to suppose that Professor Lomborg is the only one in step, every single time."&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Alex. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1502076.stm "Bjørn Lomborg's wonderful world"] BBC News, 23 August 2001. Retrieved 21 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirby's first concern was not with the extensive research and statistical analysis, but the conclusions drawn from them:

:"What really riles me about his book is that it is so damnably reasonable. In the rational world that Bjørn Lomborg thinks we all inhabit, we would manage problems sensibly, one by one...But the real world is messier, more unpredictable - and more impatient."

On September 5, 2001, at a Lomborg book reading in England, British environmentalist author [[Mark Lynas]] threw a cream pie in Lomborg's face. In a September 9, 2001, article, "Why I pied Lomborg", Lynas stated:

:"Lomborg specialises in presenting the reader with false choices - such as the assertion that money not spent on preventing climate change could be spent on bringing clean water to the developing world, thereby saving more lives per dollar of expenditure. Of course, in the real world, these are not the kind of choices we are faced with. Why not take the $60 billion from George Bush's stupid Son of Star Wars program and use that cash to save lives in Ethiopia? Because in a world where political choices are not made democratically at a global level, but by a small number of rich countries and corporations, the poor and the environment are never going to be a priority."&lt;ref&gt;[http://schema-root.org/people/political/activists/environment/individuals/mark_lynas/ schema-root.org/mark_lynas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 12, 2001 issue of ''[[Grist Magazine|Grist]]'' devoted an issue to ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'',&lt;ref name="GristSkepticalLook"/&gt; with a series of essays from various scientists challenging individual sections. A separate article examining the book's overall approach took issue with the framing of Lomborg's conclusions:

:"Lomborg begins by making the entirely reasonable point that accurate information is critical to informed decision-making. If information is skewed to paint a bleaker environmental picture than is justified by reality, as he claims, then we will in turn skew our limited resources in favor of the environment and away from other important causes. ... Then Lomborg proceeds to weigh the causes championed by the environmental movement against a deliberately circumscribed universe of other possible "good causes." It is up to us, he says, to make responsible decisions about whether to protect the environment or "boost Medicaid, increase funding to the arts, or cut taxes. ... The worse they can make this state appear, the easier it is for them to convince us we need to spend more money on the environment rather on hospitals, kindergartens, etc." A few pages later he again claims that the purpose of the Litany is to cause us to prioritize the environment over "hospitals, child day care, etc." ... But who is really failing to consider how our money is spent? As Lomborg notes, "We will never have enough money," and therefore, "Prioritization is absolutely essential." Why, then, does he weigh the environment only against hospitals and childcare, rather than against, say, industry subsidies and defense spending?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Schulz, Kathryn |title=Let Us Not Praise Infamous Men |date=12 December 2001 |work=Grist Magazine |url=http://grist.org/advice/books/2001/12/12/infamous/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the apparent difficulty of scientists opposing ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' in criticizing the book strictly on the basis of statistics and challenging the conclusions about areas of environmental sciences that were drawn from them, Lynas contends:
:"One of the biggest problems facing the environmental community in analyzing Lomborg’s book is that his work, as flawed as it is, has clearly been very time-consuming and meticulous. In a busy and under funded world, few people have the time or background knowledge to plow though 3,000 footnotes checking his sources. It is impressively interdisciplinary."&lt;ref&gt;[http://critique-magazine.com/article/lomborg.html The Skeptical Environmentalist: Bjorn Lomborg'', Interview by Michael Standaert]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
Influential UK newsweekly ''[[The Economist]]'' weighed in at the start with heavy support, publishing an advance essay by Lomborg in which he detailed his Litany, and following up with a highly favorable review and supportive coverage. It stated that "This is one of the most valuable books on public policy—not merely environmental policy— to have been written for the intelligent general reader in the past ten years...''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' is a triumph."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_SSDSGV The Economist – Books &amp; Arts – Environmental scrutiny - Doomsday postponed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_JGVSTR  The Economist – Leader – The environment – Defending science] “The January issue of Scientific American devoted many pages to a series of articles trashing ‘The Skeptical Environmentalist’. The authors, all supporters of the green movement, were strong on contempt and sneering, but weak on substance.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the general media, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that "The primary target of the book, a substantial work of analysis with almost 3,000 footnotes, are statements made by environmental organizations like the Worldwatch Institute, the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace." The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' deemed Lomborg's work "a superbly documented and readable book.". A review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' claimed that "Bjørn Lomborg's good news about the environment is bad news for Green ideologues. His richly informative, lucid book is now the place from which environmental policy decisions must be argued. In fact,'' The Skeptical Environmentalist ''is the most significant work on the environment since the appearance of its polar opposite, Rachel Carson's ''[[Silent Spring]]'', in 1962. It's a magnificent achievement." ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that "Lomborg pulls off the remarkable feat of welding the techno-optimism of the Internet age with a lefty's concern for the fate of the planet."

In March 2003 the ''New York Law School Law Review'' published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= |journal=New York Law School Law Review |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=581–614 |year=2003 |url=http://www.nyls.edu/pdfs/v46n3-4p581-614.pdf |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626022030/http://www.nyls.edu/pdfs/v46n3-4p581-614.pdf |archivedate=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an examination of the critical reviews of ''Skeptical Environmentalist'' from the ''Scientific American'', ''Nature'' and ''Science'' magazines by Professor of Law David Shoenbrod and then Senior Law Student Christi Wilson of New York Law School. The authors take the perspective of a court faced with an argument against hearing an expert witness in order to evaluate whether Lomborg was credible as an expert, and whether his testimony is valid to his expertise. They classify the types of criticisms leveled at Lomborg and his arguments, and proceed to evaluate each of the reasons given for disqualifying Lomborg. They conclude that a court should accept Lomborg as a credible expert in the field of statistics, and that his testimony was appropriately restricted to his area of expertise. Of course, Professor Shoenbrod and Wilson note, Mr. Lomborg's factual conclusions may not be correct, nor his policy proposals effective, but his criticisms should be addressed, not merely dismissed out of hand.

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] and the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] raised concern about the responses of certain sections of the scientific community to a peer reviewed book published under the category of environmental economics. The groups worried that the receptions to Lomborg were a politicization of science by scientists.  This unease was reflected in the involvement of the Union of Concerned Scientists and Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty in "When scientists politicize science: making sense of controversy over The Skeptical Environmentalist",&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; where Roger A. Pielke argued:

{{quote|The use of science by scientists as a means of negotiating for desired political outcomes – the politicization of science by scientists – threatens the development of effective policies in contested issues. By tying themselves to politics, rather than policy, scientists necessarily restrict their value and the value of their science.}}

In "Green with Ideology - The hidden agenda behind the "scientific" attacks on Bjørn Lomborg’s controversial book, The Skeptical Environmentalist", [[Ronald Bailey]] stated that "The bitter anti-Lomborg campaign reveals the hidden crisis of what we might call ideological environmentalism." He further wrote:

{{quote|The Skeptical Environmentalist obviously should be held to high standards of accuracy, but to insist that it read like a scientific paper is both specious and disingenuous. The book is essentially a response to such popular environmentalist tracts as the State of the World report and the reams of misinformation disseminated by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the Union of Concerned Scientists, The Ecologist, the Turning Point Project, Grist, Wild Earth, and the rest of the sprawling eco-media propaganda complex.}}

==Accusations of scientific dishonesty==
After the publication of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', Lomborg was accused of scientific dishonesty. Several environmental scientists brought a total of three complaints against Lomborg to the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] (DCSD), a body under Denmark's [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]]. Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a "debate" publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed.&lt;ref name="icg2008"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1343527.html | title=The 'Lomborg case' on sustainable development and scientific dishonesty | publisher=International Geological Congress | date=2008 | accessdate=23 November 2014 | author=Hansen, Jens Morten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges claimed that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

===DCSD investigation===
On January 6, 2003, a mixed DCSD ruling was released, in which the Committees decided that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' was scientifically dishonest, but Lomborg was innocent of wrongdoing due to a lack of expertise in the relevant fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.fi.dk/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty/annual-report-2003-danish-committees-scientific-dishones.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217162831/http://en.fi.dk/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty/annual-report-2003-danish-committees-scientific-dishones.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}. Retrieved 22-Dec-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Objectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty. ...In view of the subjective requirements made in terms of intent or gross negligence, however, Lomborg's publication cannot fall within the bounds of this characterization. Conversely, the publication is deemed clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice."

The DCSD cited ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' for:

*Fabrication of data;
*Selective discarding of unwanted results (selective citation);
*Deliberately [[systemic bias|misleading use of statistical methods]];
*Distorted interpretation of conclusions;
*[[Plagiarism]];
*Deliberate misinterpretation of others' results.

===MSTI review and response===
On February 13, 2003, Lomborg filed a complaint against the DCSD's decision with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MSTI), which oversees the group.

On December 17, 2003, the Ministry found that the DCSD had made a number of procedural errors, including:
* Not using a precise standard for deciding "good scientific practice" in the social sciences;
* Defining "objective scientific dishonesty" in a way unclear in determining whether "distortion of statistical data" had to be deliberate or not;
* Not properly documenting that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' was a scientific publication on which they had the right to intervene in the first place;
* Not providing specific statements on actual errors.

The Ministry remitted the case to the DCSD. In doing so the Ministry indicated that it regarded the DCSD's previous findings of scientific dishonesty in regard to the book as invalid. The Ministry also instructed the DCSD to decide whether to reinvestigate. On March 12, 2004, the Committee formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=icg2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3340305.stm | title = Lomborg celebrates ministry ruling | work = | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 22 December 2003 | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response of the scientific community===

The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a [[petition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm "Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825145806/http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm |date=August 25, 2011 }}. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; among Danish academics from 308 scientists, many from the social sciences, who criticised the DCSD's investigative methods.

Another group of Danish scientists collected signatures in support of the DCSD. The 640 signatures in this second petition came almost exclusively from the medical and [[natural science]]s, and included [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] in Chemistry [[Jens Christian Skou]], former university [[Rector (academia)|rector]] [[Kjeld Møllgård]], and professor [[Poul Harremoës]] from the [[Technical University of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulnits.dk/biologi/frame298.htm "Verden ifølge Lomborg - eller den moderne udgave af "Kejserens Nye Klæder": Han har jo ikke noget på..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118233024/http://www.ulnits.dk/biologi/frame298.htm |date=2006-01-18 }}. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continued debate and criticism==
A group of scientists published an article in 2005 in the ''Journal of Information Ethics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rörsch, A |title=On the opposition against the book The Skeptical Environmentalist by B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=16–28 |year=2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.1.16 |last2=Frello |first2=Thomas |last3=Soper |first3=Ray |last4=De Lange |first4=Adriaan}} ():&lt;/ref&gt; in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community had misused their authority to suppress the author.

===Kåre Fog===
The claim that allegations against Lomborg were unsubstantiated was challenged in the next issue of ''Journal of Information Ethics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fog, K. |title=The real nature of the opposition against B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=66–76 |year=2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.2.66}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Kåre Fog, one of the original DCSD petitioners. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid, and rejected what he called "the Galileo hypothesis", which portrays Lomborg as a brave young man confronting an entrenched opposition.

Fog has established a curated catalogue of criticisms against Lomborg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url = http://www.lomborg-errors.dk
  | title = Lomborg errors
  | work =
  | publisher =
  | date =
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a section for each page of every ''Skeptical Environmentalist'' chapter. Fog enumerates and details what he believes to be flaws and errors in Lomborg's work. He explicitly indicates if particular mistakes may have been made deliberately by Lomborg, in order to mislead. According to Fog, since none of his denunciations of Lomborg's work have been proven false, the suspicion that Lomborg has misled deliberately is maintained. Lomborg has written a full text published online as '''Godehetens Pris''' (Danish) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/39-file/GodhedensPris.pdf Godhedens Pris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705114344/http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/39-file/GodhedensPris.pdf |date=2009-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that goes through the main allegations put forward by Fog and others.

The '''theory of multiple intelligences''' differentiates [[human intelligence]] into specific 'modalities', rather than seeing intelligence as dominated by a single [[general ability]]. [[Howard Gardner]] proposed this model in his 1983 book ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. According to the theory, an intelligence 'modality' must fulfill eight criteria:{{r|Gilman}}
# potential for brain isolation by [[brain damage]],
# place in [[evolutionary history]],
# presence of core operations,
# susceptibility to encoding ([[symbolic expression]]),
# a distinct developmental progression,
# the existence of [[savant syndrome|savant]]s, prodigies and other exceptional people,
# support from [[experimental psychology]], and
# support from [[psychometric]] findings.

Gardner proposed seven abilities that he held to meet these criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, Robert (2009), ''Educational Psychology'', p. 117, {{ISBN|0-205-59200-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# musical-rhythmic,
# [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|visual-spatial]],
# [[linguistic intelligence|verbal-linguistic]],
# logical-mathematical,
# bodily-kinesthetic,
# interpersonal,
# intrapersonal
He later suggested that [[Spiritual intelligence|existential]] and [[ethics|moral]] intelligences may also be worthy of inclusion.{{r|Smith}}

Although the distinction between intelligences has been set out in great detail, Gardner opposes the idea of labeling learners to a specific intelligence. Gardner maintains that his theory should "empower learners", not restrict them to one modality of learning.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, W. (2005). Multiple intelligences and instructional technology. ISTE (International Society for Technology Education). {{ISBN|156484188X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gardner, an intelligence is "a biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture."{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=33-4|ps=}} According to a 2006 study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involves a blend of the general [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, non-cognitive abilities or personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}

== Intelligence modalities ==

=== Musical-rhythmic and harmonic ===
{{main|Musicality}}

This area has to do with sensitivity to sounds, rhythms, [[Pitch (music)|tones]], and music. People with a high musical intelligence normally have good pitch and may even have [[absolute pitch]], and are able to sing, play musical instruments, and compose music. They have sensitivity to rhythm, pitch, meter, tone, melody or timbre.{{r|PBS}}&lt;ref name=G-H&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H., &amp; Hatch, T. |title=Multiple intelligences go to school: Educational implications of the theory of multiple intelligences|doi=10.3102/0013189X018008004|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jcnesbit/EDUC220/ThinkPaper/Gardner1989.pdf|year=1989|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=18|issue=8|page=4|last2=Hatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual-spatial ===
{{main|Spatial intelligence (psychology)}}

This area deals with spatial judgment and the ability to visualize with the mind's eye. Spatial ability is one of the three factors beneath ''g'' in the hierarchical model of intelligence.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt;

=== Verbal-linguistic ===
{{main|Linguistic intelligence}}

People with high verbal-linguistic intelligence display a facility with words and languages. They are typically good at reading, writing, telling stories and memorizing words along with dates.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Verbal ability is one of the most ''g''-loaded abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, D. (1997). [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] III.&lt;/ref&gt;
This type of intelligence is measured with the [[Verbal IQ|Verbal IQ in WAIS-IV]].

=== Logical-mathematical ===
{{further|Reason}}

This area has to do with [[logic]], abstractions, reasoning, numbers and critical thinking.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; This also has to do with having the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system.{{r|PBS}} Logical reasoning is closely linked to [[fluid intelligence]] and to [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence (''g'' factor)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=J. B. |title=Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor-analytic Studies |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521382755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bodily-kinesthetic ===
{{further|Gross motor skill|Fine motor skill}}

The core elements of the bodily-[[Proprioception|kinesthetic]] intelligence are control of one's bodily motions and the capacity to handle objects skillfully.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Gardner elaborates to say that this also includes a sense of timing, a clear sense of the goal of a physical action, along with the ability to train responses.

People who have high bodily-kinesthetic intelligence should be generally good at physical activities such as sports, dance, acting, and making things.

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high bodily-kinesthetic intelligence include: [[athlete]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, [[actor]]s, [[General contractor|builders]], [[police officer]]s, and [[soldier]]s. Although these careers can be duplicated through virtual simulation, they will not produce the actual physical learning that is needed in this intelligence.{{r|Heteroglossia}}

=== Interpersonal ===
{{main|Social skills}}

In theory, individuals who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others' moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, and their ability to cooperate in order to work as part of a group. According to Gardner in ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom'', "Inter- and Intra- personal intelligence is often misunderstood with being extroverted or liking other people..."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1995). ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom—Administrators' Version''. {{ISBN|1-887943-03-X}}. National Professional Resources Dr. Howard Gardner, along with teachers and students from Fuller Elementary School in Gloucester, MA, discuss the theory behind Multiple Intelligences and demonstrate how they have integrated it into their classrooms and community. (41 minutes)&lt;/ref&gt; Those with high interpersonal intelligence communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They often enjoy discussion and debate." Gardner has equated this with [[emotional intelligence]] of Goleman.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (2015). [https://soundcloud.com/bridging-the-gaps Bridging the Gaps: A Portal for Curious MindsPro Unlimited]. (at 17 minutes). soundcloud.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high interpersonal intelligence include [[sales persons]], [[politician]]s, managers, [[teacher]]s, [[lecturer]]s, [[Psychology|counselors]] and [[social worker]]s.{{r|Gardner2002}}

=== Intrapersonal ===
{{further|Introspection}}

This area has to do with introspective and self-reflective capacities. This refers to having a deep understanding of the self; what one's strengths or weaknesses are, what makes one unique, being able to predict one's own reactions or emotions.

=== Naturalistic ===
Not part of Gardner's original seven, naturalistic intelligence was proposed by him in 1995. "If I were to rewrite Frames of Mind today, I would probably add an eighth intelligence – the intelligence of the naturalist. It seems to me that the individual who is readily able to recognize flora and fauna, to make other consequential distinctions in the natural world, and to use this ability productively (in hunting, in farming, in biological science) is exercising an important intelligence and one that is not adequately encompassed in the current list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H. |year=1995|title=Reflections on multiple intelligences: Myths and messages|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume= 77|pages= 200–209|url=https://learnweb.harvard.edu/WIDE/courses/files/Reflections.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area has to do with nurturing and relating information to one's natural surroundings.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Examples include classifying natural forms such as animal and plant species and rocks and mountain types. This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters, gatherers]], and [[farmer]]s; it continues to be central in such roles as [[botanist]] or [[chef]].{{r|PBS}}

This sort of ecological receptiveness is deeply rooted in a "sensitive, [[Ethics|ethical]], and [[Holism|holistic]] understanding" of the world and its complexities – including the role of humanity within the greater ecosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Morris, M.|editor = Kincheloe, Joe L.|chapter = Ch. 8. The Eight One: Naturalistic Intelligence|title = Multiple Intelligences Reconsidered|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xVu3bhfSicIC&amp;pg=PR150|year = 2004|publisher = Peter Lang|isbn = 978-0-8204-7098-6|pages = 159–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential ===
{{main|Spiritual intelligence}}

Gardner did not want to commit to a spiritual intelligence, but suggested that an "existential" intelligence may be a useful construct, also proposed after the original 7 in his 1999 book.{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=|ps=}} The hypothesis of an existential intelligence has been further explored by educational researchers.{{r|Tupper}}

=== Additional intelligences ===
On January 13, 2016, Gardner mentioned in an interview with [[Big Think|BigThink]] that he is considering adding the teaching-pedagogical intelligence "which allows us to be able to teach successfully to other people".&lt;ref name="Gard16"&gt;Gardner, Howard. (2016). Intelligence Isn't black and white: There are 8 different kinds. Bigthing. come. [http://bigthink.com/videos/howard-gardner-on-the-eight-intelligences video]. Check minutes 5:00 – 5:55 and 8:16&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, he explicitly refused some other suggested intelligences like humour, cooking and sexual intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gard16"/&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Gardner argues that there is a wide range of [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.

[[Intelligence test]]s and [[psychometrics]] have generally found high correlations between different aspects of intelligence, rather than the low correlations which Gardner's theory predicts, supporting the prevailing theory of [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] rather than multiple intelligences (MI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Geake|first1 = John|title = Neuromythologies in education|journal = Educational Research|year = 2008|volume = 50|issue = 2|pages = 123–133|doi = 10.1080/00131880802082518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been criticized by mainstream psychology for its lack of [[empirical evidence]], and its dependence on subjective judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Waterhouse|first1 = Lynn|title = WATERHOUSE MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES Multiple Intelligences, the Mozart Effect, and Emotional Intelligence: A Critical Review|journal = Educational Psychologist|year = 2006|volume = 41|issue = 4|pages = 207–225|url = http://www.faculty.mun.ca/cmattatall/Multiple_Intelligences_.pdf|doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep4104_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However research by Dweck (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. S. (2006). Mindset: The new psychology of success. Random House Incorporated.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as [[growth mindset|Growth Mindset Theory]], shows that individuals with low correlations can attain also high correlations through intelligence growth. This challenges the notion of fixed or static intelligence levels that general intelligence tests measure. More importantly, it challenges the notion that intelligence test scores are an accurate predictor for future ability.

=== Definition of intelligence ===
One major criticism of the theory is that it is ''[[ad hoc]]'': that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word "intelligence", but rather denies the existence of [[intelligence]] as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word "intelligence" where other people have traditionally used words like "ability" and "[[aptitude]]". This practice has been criticized by [[Robert J. Sternberg]],{{r|Sternberg1983}}{{r|Sternberg1991}} [[Michael Eysenck|Eysenck]],{{sfn|Eysenck|1994|p=|ps=}} and Scarr.{{r|Scarr}} White (2006) points out that Gardner's selection and application of criteria for his "intelligences" is subjective and arbitrary, and that a different researcher would likely have come up with different criteria.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=489|ps=}}

Defenders of MI theory argue that the traditional definition of intelligence is too narrow, and thus a broader definition more accurately reflects the differing ways in which humans think and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Nikolova, K., &amp; Taneva-Shopova, S.|year = 2007|title = Multiple intelligences theory and educational practice|publisher = Annual Assesn Zlatarov University|volume = 26|issue = 2|pages = 105–109|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264892931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticisms arise from the fact that Gardner has not provided a test of his multiple intelligences. He originally defined it as the ability to solve problems that have value in at least one culture, or as something that a student is interested in. He then added a [[disclaimer]] that he has no fixed definition, and his classification is more of an artistic judgment than fact:

{{quote|Ultimately, it would certainly be desirable to have an [[algorithm]] for the selection of an intelligence, such that any [[Researcher|trained researcher]] could determine whether a candidate's intelligence met the appropriate criteria. At present, however, it must be admitted that the selection (or rejection) of a candidate's intelligence is reminiscent more of an [[Aesthetics|artistic judgment]] than of a scientific assessment.{{sfn|Gardner|1983|p=|ps=}}}}

Generally, linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities are called intelligences, but artistic, musical, athletic, etc. abilities are not. Gardner argues this causes the former to be needlessly aggrandized. Certain critics are wary of this widening of the definition, saying that it ignores "the connotation of intelligence&amp;nbsp;... [which] has always connoted the kind of thinking skills that makes one successful in school."{{r|Willingham}}

Gardner writes "I balk at the unwarranted assumption that certain human abilities can be arbitrarily singled out as intelligence while others cannot."{{r|Gardner1998}} Critics hold that given this statement, any interest or ability can be redefined as "intelligence". Thus, studying intelligence becomes difficult, because it diffuses into the broader concept of ability or talent. Gardner's addition of the naturalistic intelligence and conceptions of the existential and moral intelligences are seen as the fruits of this diffusion. Defenders of the MI theory would argue that this is simply a recognition of the broad scope of inherent mental abilities, and that such an exhaustive scope by nature defies a one-dimensional classification such as an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ value]].

The theory and definitions have been critiqued by Perry D. Klein as being so unclear as to be [[tautology (logic)|tautologous]] and thus [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]]. Having a high musical ability means being good at music while at the same time being good at music is explained by having a high musical ability.{{r|Klein}}

[[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]] shows that « We can not distinguish intelligence from its operations »&lt;ref&gt;According to formulation of Émile Jalley for Henri Wallon in ''Principes de psychologie appliquée'' (Œuvre 1, édition L'Harmattan, 2015) : « On ne saurait distinguer l'intelligence de ses opérations »&lt;/ref&gt;. Yves Richez discovers 10 Natural Operating Modes (Modes Opératoire Naturel - MoON)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richez |first=Yves |year=2018 |title=corporate talent detection and development|publisher=Wiley Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Richez's studies show a gap between Chinese thought and Western thought. In China, notion of « Being » (Self) and notion of « intelligence » don't exist. Those are greek-Latin inventions (Platon). Instead of intelligence, Chinese speaks of « operating modes ». Thus, Yves Richez doesn't talk of « intelligence » but of « natural operating modes » (Mo.O.N.).

=== Neo-Piagetian criticism ===
[[Andreas Demetriou]] suggests that theories which overemphasize the autonomy of the domains are as simplistic as the theories that overemphasize the role of general intelligence and ignore the domains. He agrees with Gardner that there are indeed domains of intelligence that are relevantly autonomous of each other.{{r|Demetriou2011}} Some of the domains, such as verbal, spatial, mathematical, and [[social intelligence]] are identified by most lines of research in psychology. In Demetriou's theory, one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], Gardner is criticized for underestimating the effects exerted on the various domains of intelligences by the various subprocesses that define overall processing efficiency, such as [[speed of processing]], [[executive functions]], [[working memory]], and [[metacognition|meta-cognitive processes]] underlying [[self-awareness]] and [[Self control|self-regulation]]. All of these processes are integral components of general intelligence that regulate the functioning and development of different domains of intelligence.{{sfn|Demetriou|Raftopoulos|2005|p=68|ps=}}

The domains are to a large extent expressions of the condition of the general processes, and may vary because of their constitutional differences but also differences in individual preferences and inclinations. Their functioning both channels and influences the operation of the general processes.{{r|Architecture}}{{r|Efficiency}} Thus, one cannot satisfactorily specify the intelligence of an individual or design effective intervention programs unless both the general processes and the domains of interest are evaluated.{{r|Self-awareness}}{{sfn|Demetriou|Mouyi|Spanoudis|2010|pp=|ps=}}

=== Human adaptation to multiple environments ===
The premise of the multiple intelligences hypothesis, that human intelligence is a collection of specialist abilities, have been criticized for not being able to explain human adaptation to most if not all environments in the world. In this context, humans are contrasted to [[social insect]]s that indeed have a distributed "intelligence" of specialists, and such insects may spread to climates resembling that of their origin but the same species never adapt to a wide range of climates from tropical to temperate by building different types of nests and learning what is edible and what is poisonous. While some such as the [[leafcutter ant]] grow fungi on leaves, they do not cultivate different species in different environments with different farming techniques as human [[agriculture]] does. It is therefore argued that human adaptability stems from a general ability to [[falsifiability|falsify hypotheses]] and make more generally accurate predictions and adapt behavior thereafter, and not a set of specialized abilities which would only work under specific environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen 2005 edition|"Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf W. Frohlich 2009 edition|"Evolutionary Intelligence: The Anatomy of Human Survival"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IQ tests ===
Gardner argues that IQ tests only measure linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities. He argues the importance of assessing in an "intelligence-fair" manner. While traditional paper-and-pen examinations favor linguistic and logical skills, there is a need for intelligence-fair measures that value the distinct modalities of thinking and learning that uniquely define each intelligence.&lt;ref name=G-H/&gt;

Psychologist [[Alan S. Kaufman]] points out that IQ tests have measured spatial abilities for 70 years.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}} Modern IQ tests are greatly influenced by the [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory]] which incorporates a general intelligence but also many more narrow abilities. While IQ tests do give an overall IQ score, they now also give scores for many more narrow abilities.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}}

=== Lack of empirical evidence ===
According to a 2006 study many of Gardner's "intelligences" correlate with the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], supporting the idea of a single dominant type of intelligence. According to the study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involved a blend of ''g'', of cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, of non-cognitive abilities or of personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}

[[Linda Gottfredson]] (2006) has argued that thousands of studies support the importance of [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) in predicting school and job performance, and numerous other life outcomes. In contrast, empirical support for non-''g'' intelligences is either lacking or very poor. She argued that despite this the ideas of multiple non-''g'' intelligences are very attractive to many due to the suggestion that everyone can be smart in some way.{{r|Gottfredson2006}}

A critical review of MI theory argues that there is little empirical evidence to support it:
{{quote|To date, there have been no published studies that offer evidence of the validity of the multiple intelligences. In 1994 Sternberg reported finding no empirical studies. In 2000 Allix reported finding no [[empirical]] validating studies, and at that time Gardner and Connell conceded that there was "little hard evidence for MI theory" (2000, p. 292). In 2004 Sternberg and Grigerenko stated that there were no validating studies for multiple intelligences, and in 2004 Gardner asserted that he would be "delighted were such evidence to accrue",{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}} and admitted that "MI theory has few enthusiasts among psychometricians or others of a traditional psychological background" because they require "psychometric or experimental evidence that allows one to prove the existence of the several intelligences."{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}}{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}

The same review presents evidence to demonstrate that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research does not support the theory of multiple intelligences:
{{quote|... the human brain is unlikely to function via Gardner's multiple intelligences. Taken together the evidence for the intercorrelations of subskills of IQ measures, the evidence for a shared set of genes associated with mathematics, reading, and g, and the evidence for shared and overlapping "what is it?" and "where is it?" neural processing pathways, and shared neural pathways for language, music, motor skills, and emotions suggest that it is unlikely that each of Gardner's intelligences could operate "via a different set of neural mechanisms" (1999, p. 99). Equally important, the evidence for the "what is it?" and "where is it?" processing pathways, for Kahneman's two decision-making systems, and for adapted cognition modules suggests that these cognitive brain specializations have evolved to address very specific problems in our environment. Because Gardner claimed that the intelligences are innate potentialities related to a general content area, MI theory lacks a rationale for the phylogenetic emergence of the intelligences.{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}

The theory of multiple intelligences is sometimes cited as an example of [[pseudoscience]] because it lacks empirical evidence or [[falsifiability]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/24174224/Multiple_Intelligences_and_pseudo-_science Multiple Intelligences and pseudo-science] Van der Ploeg, 2016. academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt; though Gardner has argued otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gardner | first = Howard | title = Reflections on Multiple Intelligences: Myths and Messages | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | pages = 200–209 | date = November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in education ==
Gardner defines an intelligence as "bio-psychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture."{{sfn|Gardner|1999|pp=33–34|ps=}} According to Gardner, there are more ways to do this than just through logical and linguistic intelligence. Gardner believes that the purpose of schooling "should be to develop intelligences and to help people reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligences. People who are helped to do so, [he] believe[s], feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve society in a constructive way."{{efn|This information is based on an informal talk given on the 350th anniversary of Harvard University on 5 September 1986. Harvard Education Review, Harvard Education Publishing Group, 1987, 57, 187–93.}}

Gardner contends that IQ tests focus mostly on logical and linguistic intelligence. Upon doing well on these tests, the chances of attending a prestigious college or university increase, which in turn creates contributing members of society.{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=6|ps=}} While many students function well in this environment, there are those who do not. Gardner's theory argues that students will be better served by a broader vision of education, wherein teachers use different methodologies, exercises and activities to reach all students, not just those who excel at linguistic and logical intelligence. It challenges educators to find "ways that will work for this student learning this topic".{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=154|ps=}}

[[James Traub]]'s article in ''The New Republic'' notes that Gardner's system has not been accepted by most academics in intelligence or teaching.{{r|Traub}} Gardner states that "while Multiple Intelligences theory is consistent with much
empirical evidence, it has not been subjected to strong experimental tests&amp;nbsp;... Within the area of education, the applications of the theory are currently being examined in many projects. Our hunches will have to be revised many times in light of actual classroom experience."{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=33|ps=}}

[[Jerome Bruner]] agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were "useful fictions," and went on to state that "his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1983/oct/27/state-of-the-child/ |title=State of the Child |last=Bruner |first=Jerome |publisher=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], a prominent cognitive psychologist, wrote in ''The New York Times Book Review'' that Gardner's argument consisted of "hunch and opinion" and Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein in ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994) called Gardner's theory "uniquely devoid of psychometric or other quantitative evidence."{{r|Eberstadt}}

In spite of its lack of general acceptance in the psychological community, Gardner's theory has been adopted by many schools, where it is often conflated with [[learning styles]],{{sfn|Howard-Jones|2010|p=23|ps=}} and hundreds of books have been written about its applications in education.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=486|ps=}} Some of the applications of Gardner's theory have been described as "simplistic" and Gardner himself has said he is "uneasy" with the way his theory has been used in schools.{{r|Revell}} Gardner has denied that multiple intelligences are learning styles and agrees that the idea of learning styles is incoherent and lacking in empirical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/|title = Howard Gardner: 'Multiple intelligences' are not 'learning styles'|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = 10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner summarizes his approach with three recommendations for educators:  individualize the teaching style (to suit the most effective method for each student), pluralize the teaching (teach important materials in multiple ways), and avoid the term "styles" as being confusing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/|title = Howard Gardner: 'Multiple intelligences' are not 'learning styles'|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = 31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial''''' (North American title: '''''Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine''''')&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-393-06661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2008 book about [[alternative medicine]] by [[Simon Singh]] and [[Edzard Ernst]]. Singh is a physicist and the writer of several popular science books.

== Overview ==

The book evaluates the scientific evidence for [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[herbal medicine]], and [[chiropractic]],&lt;ref name="nature1" /&gt; and briefly covers 36 other treatments. It finds that the [[scientific evidence]] for these alternative treatments is generally lacking. Homeopathy is concluded to be completely ineffective: "It's nothing but a [[placebo]], despite what homeopaths say".&lt;ref name="Leggatt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/3355120/Complementary-medicine-seeking-out-alternatives.html|title=Complementary medicine: seeking out alternatives|last=Leggatt|first=Johanna|date=2008-11-08|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Trick or Treatment'' presents evidence that acupuncture, chiropractic and herbal remedies have limited efficacy for certain ailments, the authors conclude that the dangers of these treatments outweigh any potential benefits. Such potential risks outlined by the authors are contamination or unexpected interactions between components in the case of herbal medicine, risk of infection in the case of acupuncture and the potential for chiropractic manipulation of the neck to cause delayed stroke.

The book is very critical of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]' advocacy of alternative medicine and the actions of his now-defunct [[The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health]]. ''Trick or Treatment'' is dedicated, in an [[irony|ironic]] fashion, to the Prince.

== Contents ==
The book contains six chapters:

'''How do you determine the truth?'''
:This chapter describes the methods and history of clinical trials, such as the trial to determine a proper treatment for [[scurvy]] by [[James Lind]] and the story of [[Florence Nightingale]].

'''The truth about acupuncture'''
:This chapter discusses the evidence surrounding [[acupuncture]], a form of [[alternative medicine]] in which acupuncturists place needles in the body for the purpose of blocking Ch'i meridians throughout the body, thus encouraging full health. The authors examine the recent history of acupuncture and several various trials of the technique. The authors conclude that acupuncture is essentially a [[placebo]].

'''The truth about homeopathy'''
:This chapter discusses the evidence surrounding [[homeopathy]], an alternative medicine technique which consists of finding a substance (which causes symptoms similar to the condition needing to be treated in a healthy person), then diluting that substance to an extreme degree. The chapter examines the history of homeopathy and reviews various trials regarding the technique, especially the trial done by [[Jacques Benveniste]], a French researcher. The authors conclude that homeopathy is a placebo. The authors offered a £10,000 prize for anyone who could prove homeopathy was effective.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trickortreatment.com/challenge.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The truth about chiropractic therapy'''
:This chapter discusses the evidence surrounding [[chiropractic]], an alternative medicine technique which aims to cure illness by manipulating the spine, based on the theory that almost all conditions and diseases are caused by misaligned vertebrae in the spine block the body's vital force. The history of chiropractic, as well as several of the trials on chiropractic are described. The authors conclude that there is no evidence to support most of chiropractic's claims. However, the authors state that chiropractic might be beneficial in certain limited situations concerning back pain. As well, the authors find that chiropractic can be very dangerous, especially when it comes to the manipulation of the neck, and state that patients should "try conventional treatments before turning to a chiropractor for back pain."&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Simon &amp; Edzard Ernst. Trick or Treatment. 2008. Page 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The truth about herbal medicine'''
:This chapter discusses the evidence surrounding herbal medicine, such as the use of St. John's Wort and Aloe vera. The authors conclude that several herbal medicines can be effective to treat illness, while others, such as billberry, chamomile, and ginseng, are ineffective.

'''Does the truth matter?'''
:This chapter discusses the state of alternative medicine in society, focusing on Prince Charles's endorsements of alternative medicine.

== Reception ==

The book received generally good reviews. ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'''s review said this about the authors: "Simon Singh is a physicist and science journalist, and his coauthor, Edzard Ernst, is a physician and professor of complementary medicine. Ernst is one of the best qualified people to summarize the evidence on this topic."&lt;ref name=NEJM_book_review&gt;{{cite journal | title = Book review of "Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 359 | pages = 2076–2077 | date = 2008-11-06 | accessdate = 2009-11-21 | issue = 19 | url = http://nejm.highwire.org/cgi/content/extract/359/19/2076 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMbkrev0805020 | last1 = Marcus | first1 = D.

The results are stark. In no case, apart from in some limited ways in herbal medicine, do any of these 'therapies’ work. On the contrary, they can be life-threatening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Owen | first = K |author2=Cousins S  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5291388/Paperbacks-reviews.html | title = Paperbacks: reviews | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2009-05-10 | accessdate = 2009-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' tempered a generally positive review with a concern that the authors' sense of certainty "mirrors that of the proponents of alternative therapies, leaving each position as entrenched as ever."&lt;ref name="nature2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murcott | first = T | date = 2008-06-12 | title = Complementary cures tested | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 453 | pages = 856–857 | doi=10.1038/453856a | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7197/full/453856a.html | accessdate = 2009-10-23 | issue=7197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by [[Harriet A.

[[File:Zamani logo.jpg|thumb|Zamani Project]]
The '''Zamani Project''' is part of the African [[Cultural heritage|Cultural Heritage]] Sites and Landscapes Database. Zamani is a research group at the [[University of Cape Town]], they acquire, model, present and manage spatial and other data of cultural heritage sites. The present focus of the Zamani project is [[Africa]], with the principal objective of developing “The African Cultural Heritage Sites and Landscapes Database”.  Zamani comes from the Swahili phrase “Hapo zamani za kale” which means “Once upon a time”, and can be used to mean 'the past'. The word is derived from Arabic root for temporal vocabulary, ‘Zaman,’ and appears in several languages around the world.

== History ==
The Zamani initiative was conceptualised in the Geomatics Division of the University of Cape Town by Professor Heinz Rüther in 2001 in collaboration with ITHAKA and Aluka [now an initiative of JSTOR] as the “African Cultural Heritage Sites and Landscapes Database” in 2004 with a number of sequential grants from [[the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]. The project developed out of a long history of heritage documentation in the Geomatics division reaching from conventional mapping of [[archaeological site]]s in the early stages of the project to advanced digital modeling of complex sites in its present phase.

== Motivation ==
The documentation project aims to capture spatial information to create a permanent record of important heritage sites for restoration and conservation purposes and as a record for future generations. The project seeks to provide material for education, research and site management and increase international awareness of African heritage on a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] basis.

== Data ==
Spatial data of architectural structures and historical landscapes are acquired by means of [[laser scanning]], conventional surveys, GPS surveys and photogrammetric imaging with calibrated cameras. [[Satellite imagery|Satellite images]], [[aerial photography]] and [[Fulldome|full-dome]] panorama photography are also employed as are contextual photography and videos. The data are captured by the project team during field campaigns. The acquired data are processed to produce [[Geographic Information System]]s (GIS), 3D [[Computer simulation|computer models]], maps, architectural sections and building plans and interactive panorama tours of the heritage sites. Sites are seen in the context of their physical environment and therefore landscapes surrounding sites are modelled in 3D using satellite and aerial imagery wherever possible.

===Undocumented sites===
These sites have been documented by the project team but not included in the database 
1. [[Algeria]], [[Tassili]]: Engravings (TARA)&lt;br /&gt;
2. [[Egypt]], [[Luxor]]: [[Valley of the Queens]] (Getty Conservation Institute, L.A.)&lt;br /&gt;
3. [[Jordan]], [[Petra]]: SIQ canyon and tombs in co-operation with UNESCO&lt;br /&gt;
4. [[Tanzania]], [[Laetoli]]: [[Hominid Trackway]] (Getty Conservation Institute, L.A.)&lt;br /&gt;
5. [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Al Ain]]: Archaeological site (ADACH, Abu Dhabi)

== Access to data ==
The database is conceptualised as a holistic system and therefore spatial data acquired by the Zamani group are augmented by contextual non-spatial data contributed to JSTOR by various additional partners and organizations.  This entire set of materials is made available to the scholarly community via JSTOR's Aluka initiative.  Access to this collection is free to all institutions and organizations in Africa and portions of the developing world.  Libraries and academic institutions outside of Africa can license access to these collections via JSTOR. The Zamani Project website provides a showcase for the data it produces. Subsets of the 3D data, such as panorama tours and flythrough animations can be viewed on the site as well as examples of plans, sections and photographs.

== Funding ==
The African Cultural Heritage Sites and Landscapes Database exclusively funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, New York. Administrative support, office space and other academic services are provided by the University of Cape Town and the Geomatics Division at UCT. Additional funds are generated through documentation work for the Getty Conservation Institute, Los Angeles and the World Monuments Fund, New York. In the early stages of the project [[UNESCO]] provided financial support for documentation in Lalibela.

== Zamani team ==
The Zamani team members comprises three Chief Scientific Officers (Ralph Schroeder, Roshan Bhurtha and Stephen Wessels) under the leadership of the Principal Investigator, Prof. Heinz Rüther.
