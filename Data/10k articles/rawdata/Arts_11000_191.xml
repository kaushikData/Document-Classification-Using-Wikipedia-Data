[[File:Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret (1852-1929) - Les Bretonnes au pardon - Lissabon Museu Calouste Gulbenkian 21-10-2010 13-52-01.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret]], ''Les Bretonnes au Pardon'', 1887. 125.1 x 141.1 cm., (49.3 in × 55.6 in), [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], [[Lisbon]]]]

'''''Breton Women at a Pardon''''' (French: '''''Les Bretonnes au Pardon''''') is an 1887 oil on canvas by the French [[Academic art|academic]] painter [[Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret]]. It shows seven women sitting on grass in a churchyard waiting for a [[Pardon (ceremony)|ceremony]] to begin. The painting is composed from somber tones and the women have a serene calmness and a demeanour described as the embodiedness of "simplicity and piety".&lt;ref&gt;Dorment, Richard. "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3645348/Visionary-with-a-paintbrush.html Visionary with a paintbrush]". ''The Teleghaph'',  26 Jul 2005. Retrieved 9 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The women are dressed in traditional [[Brittany|Breton]] costume which in the late 19th century would have been reserved for such an event; various starched white headdresses and collars, worn over long plain dark dresses. They are huddled in conversation while two men stand to their left with heads bowed, looking coyly at the women. The men have round black hats and are similarly dressed in black with while collars.&lt;ref name="W"&gt;Wold, 237-246&lt;/ref&gt;

This work is the culumation of a series of Breton paintings and follows directly from the similar 1886 ''[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/31.132.34 The Pardon in Brittany]''. It has a [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] look; Dagnan-Bouveret often used photographs as well as drawings and oil sketches&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, 94&lt;/ref&gt; when preparing for a finished canvas. There are many known photographic studies and drawings both for the Breton series in general, and this work in particular. One photograph shows a grassy area in which the artist had a friend pose, another a view of the church seen here in the background, complete with the festival flags protruding from the lower spire. 

The vertical framing and almost uncomfortable proximity of the women add to its 'snapshot' aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, 89&lt;/ref&gt; From the photographs, the painting is known to have been posed at the [[Pardon de Rumengol]], [[Finistère]], Brittany.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt;

[[File:Émile Bernard 1888-08 - Breton Women in the Meadow (Le Pardon de Pont-Aven).jpg|thumb|230px|''Breton Women in the Meadow''. [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], 1888]]
''Breton Women at a Pardon'' was first exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1889, where it drew acclaim and won the Grand Prise. It is often compared to [[Paul Gauguin|Paul Gauguin's]] at the time controversial 1888 ''[[Vision After the Sermon]]'' and [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]'s 1888 ''Breton Women in the Meadow'' (clearly inspired by Dagnan-Bouveret), as much for contrast in approach and in critical reaction, as for their thematic and compositional similarities. Gauguin and Bernard were seen as radicals at the time, and disdained at the Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Cachin, 64-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen began her career as a fashion model and appeared on the front cover of [[Vogue magazine|''Vogue'']] before she made her screen debut in the 1966 film ''[[The Group (film)|The Group]]''. She went on to star in ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' (1966), ''[[Soldier Blue]]'' (1970), ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'' (1975).

==Early life==
Bergen was born in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Daughter Born to Edgar Bergen's Wife", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Saturday 11 May 1946, Volume 52, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, [[Frances Bergen]] ([[married and maiden names|née]] Westerman), was a [[John Robert Powers|Powers model]] who was known professionally as Frances Westcott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/22/Candice-Bergen.html|title=Candice Bergen Biography (1946-)|website=www.filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[Edgar Bergen]], was a famous [[ventriloquist]], comedian, and actor. Her paternal grandparents were [[Sweden|Swedish]]-born immigrants who [[anglicized]] their surname, which was originally Berggren ("mountain branch").

As a child, Candice was irritated at being described as "Charlie McCarthy's little sister" (referring to her father's star [[ventriloquism|dummy]]).&lt;ref&gt;"So when I was born, it was only natural that I was known in the press not as Candice Bergen, but as "Charlie's sister."" (Bergen, "My Dad, Charlie and Me' in Jack Canfield, ''et al.'', ''A Second Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul'' 1998:36&lt;/ref&gt;

She began appearing on her father's radio program at a young age,&lt;ref&gt;"Bergen &amp; McCarthy 55-12-25 Christmas (Guest Candice Bergen)", listed on Golden Age OTR's playlist on Live365.com&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1958, at age 11, with her father on [[Groucho Marx]]'s quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', as Candy Bergen. She said that when she grew up, she wanted to design clothes.

She later attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where she was elected both [[Homecoming#Traditions|Homecoming Queen]] and Miss University, but, as Bergen later acknowledged, she failed to take her education seriously and after failing two courses in art and opera, she was asked to leave at the end of her sophomore year. She ultimately received an honorary doctorate from Penn in May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920614&amp;slug=1497120|title=Entertainment &amp; the Arts - Bergen Is Wimpy Compared To Alter-Ego Murphy - Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked as a fashion model before she took up acting, featured on the covers of ''Vogue''.

==Career==
===Early films===
In 1966, Bergen made her screen debut playing a university student in ''[[The Group (film)|The Group]]'', directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], who knew Bergen's family. The film delicately touched on the subject of lesbianism.&lt;ref name="kick"/&gt;

She did it while studying college and elected not to return, instead playing the role of Shirley Eckert, an assistant school teacher in ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' (1966) with [[Steve McQueen]]. The movie was nominated for several [[Academy Awards]] and was a big financial success. It was made for [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name="group"&gt;Movies: Candice Speaks for Herself
Champlin, Charles. Los Angeles Times 16 Oct 1966: M11.&lt;/ref&gt;

She guest starred on an episode of ''[[Coronet Blue]]'', whose director [[Sam Wanamaker]] recommended her for a part in ''[[The Day the Fish Came Out]]'' (1967) directed by [[Michael Cacoyannis]], distributed by Fox but a huge flop.  Fox signed her to a long-term contract.&lt;ref name="group"/&gt;

She was announced for the role of Anne in ''[[The Valley of the Dolls]]''&lt;ref&gt;Candice in 'Valley of Dolls'
Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 26 Jan 1967: c10.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not appear in the film.

Bergen went to France to appear in [[Claude Lelouch]]'s ''[[Live for Life]]'' (1967) opposite [[Yves Montand]], popular in France but not the US.&lt;ref name="kick"&gt;Candice of California: On an International Kick
By HOWARD THOMPSON. New York Times 18 Dec 1966: X15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, she played the leading female role in ''[[The Magus (film)|The Magus]]'', a British mystery film for Fox starring [[Michael Caine]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], that was almost universally ridiculed on its release and another flop.

She was featured in a 1970 political satire, ''[[The Adventurers (1970 film)|The Adventurers]]'', based on a novel by [[Harold Robbins]], playing a frustrated socialite. Her fee was $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;Candice Has a Premiere Surprise
Haber, Joyce. Los Angeles Times 11 Nov 1968: d25.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews were terrible but the film made money.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Rental Films of 1970", ''Variety'', 6 January 1971 p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen called it a "movie out of the 1940s."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

Bergen played the girlfriend of [[Elliott Gould]] in ''[[Getting Straight (film)|Getting Straight]]'' (1970), a counter-culture movie which was commercially popular. She said it took her career in "a new direction... my first experience with democratic, communal movie making."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

She also starred in the controversial Western ''[[Soldier Blue]]'' (1970), a worldwide hit but a failure in its homeland, perhaps because of its unflattering portrayal of the U.S. Cavalry. The film's European success led to Bergen's being voted by British exhibitors as the seventh-most popular star at the British box office in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Waymark. "Richard Burton top draw in British cinemas." Times [London, England] 30 Dec. 1971: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen received some strong reviews for her support role in ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971), directed by [[Mike Nichols]]. Bergen did a Western with [[Oliver Reed]], ''[[The Hunting Party (1971 film)|The Hunting Party]]'' (1971), then had the lead role in a drama ''[[T.R. Baskin]]'' (1971). She described the latter as the first role "that is really sort of a vehicle, where I have to act and not just be a sort of decoration" saying she'd decided "it was time for me to ge serious about acting."&lt;ref name="new"&gt;Candy's Sweet on Acting Now
By ROGER EBERTCHICAGO.. New York Times 11 Apr 1971: D15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen was absent from screens for a number of years. She returned with a support part in a British heist film, ''[[11 Harrowhouse]]'' (1974), then did a Western with [[Gene Hackman]] and [[James Coburn]], ''[[Bite the Bullet (film)|Bite the Bullet]]'' (1975).

In 1975, she replaced [[Faye Dunaway]] at the last minute to co-star with [[Sean Connery]] in ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'', as a strong-willed American widow kidnapped in the Moroccan desert.

Bergen was reunited with Hackman in ''[[The Domino Killings]]'' (1977) for [[Stanley Kramer]] and hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;At the Movies
Flatley, Guy. New York Times 10 Dec 1976: 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

She did ''[[A Night Full of Rain]]'' (1978) for [[Lina Wertmüller]] and was the love interest of [[Ryan O'Neal]] in the ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' sequel, ''[[Oliver's Story]]'' (1978).&lt;ref name="ryan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ryan O'Neal: Does Father Know Best?: Ryan O'Neal|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=23 July 1978|page= v24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had taken photographs for many years and around this time starting exhibiting them in galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Candice Bergen: Hollywood kid gets her act together: Candice Bergen grows up

===Comedy Films===
Bergen's father died in 1979. She later said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His death left a space for me [...] I was able much more to live according to my own expectations. I always felt my fame was ill-gotten, sort of borrowed from his, and that perhaps I tried to keep some kind of rein on it. Even when he was in retirement I felt I was poaching on his territory. He'd joke and say he was 'the father of Candice Bergen,' and that was only partially a joke. It was very hard on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Klemesrud |first1=Judy |title=CANDICE BERGEN: HAPPY TO SETTLE DOWN |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/style/candice-bergen-happy-to-settle-down.html |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 1984 |page=B8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bergen appeared in the [[Burt Reynolds]] romantic comedy ''[[Starting Over (1979 film)|Starting Over]]'' (1979), for which she received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for best supporting actress.

She portrayed a best-selling author in ''[[Rich and Famous (1981 film)|Rich and Famous]]'' (1981) with [[Jacqueline Bisset]].&lt;ref&gt;'The Cool, Elegant Woman?: This Isn't Me

In 1982, Bergen appeared in the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Oscar-winning]] film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' in which she portrayed documentary photographer [[Margaret Bourke-White]]. Bergen was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?year=1982&amp;category=Film&amp;award=Supporting+Actress|title= BAFTA Awards Database (Supporting Actress 1982)|author= BAFTA|year= 1983|work= British Academy of Film and Television Arts|publisher= |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 she joined the Broadway cast of ''[[Hurlyburly]]''.

On television, Bergen appeared as [[Morgan Le Fay]] in ''[[Arthur the King]]'' (1985) and in the miniseries ''[[Hollywood Wives (miniseries)|Hollywood Wives]]'' (1985).  She was [[Burt Reynolds]]' romantic interest in ''[[Stick (film)|Stick]]'' (1985), and for TV appeared in ''[[Murder: By Reason of Insanity]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mayflower Madam]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;Candice Bergen Tries a Sitcom, Just for Laughs: Bucking Hollywood casting agents' tendency to see only her beauty, the actress feels comedy is her strong suit.

In addition to acting, Bergen has written articles, a play, and a memoir, ''Knock Wood'' (1984). She has also studied photography and worked as a photojournalist.

===''Murphy Brown''===
In 1988, she took the lead role in the sitcom ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', in which she played a tough television reporter. The series provided her with the opportunity to show her little-seen comic talent, and although primarily a conventional sit-com, the show did tackle important issues. Murphy Brown, a recovering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], became a single mother and later battled [[breast cancer]]. In 1992, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dan Quayle]] criticized prime-time TV for showing the Murphy Brown character "mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/08/08/cnn25.tan.quayle/index.html | title = Then &amp; Now: Dan Quayle | date = 2005-08-08 | publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quayle's disparaging remarks were subsequently written into the show, with Murphy shown watching Quayle's speech in disbelief at his insensitivity and ignorance of the reality of the lives of single mothers. A subsequent episode explored the subject of family values within a diverse set of families. The Brown character arranges for a truckload of [[potato]]es to be dumped in front of Quayle's residence, an allusion to an infamous incident in which Quayle erroneously directed a school child to spell the word "potato" as "potatoe". In reality, Bergen agreed with at least some of Quayle's observations, saying that while the particular remark was "an arrogant and uninformed posture", as a whole, it was "a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/07/11/showbuzz/index.html |title=Candice Bergen agrees with Quayle |publisher=CNN |date=2002-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103143433/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/07/11/showbuzz/index.html |archivedate=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen's run on ''Murphy Brown'' was extremely successful. The show ran for ten seasons and between 1989 and 1998, Bergen was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] seven times and won five. After her fifth win, she declined future nominations for the role.&lt;ref&gt;Candice Bergen, Straight Up: Murphy Brown explains herself--not that she has to Rewriting Murphy's Law Everything that can go right seems to have gone right for Candice Bergen. Even ker show is enjoying a renaissance. But then there's this thing called reality
Newman, Bruce. Los Angeles Times 26 Nov 1995: F1&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the same time frame as ''Murphy Brown'', Bergen also appeared as the main spokesperson for a [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] telephone ad campaign.

She produced and starred in the TV movie ''[[Mary &amp; Tim]]'' (1996).

===Post-Murphy Brown===

After playing the role of Murphy Brown, Bergen was offered a chance to work as a real-life journalist. After the run of ''Murphy Brown'' ended in 1998, CBS approached her to cover stories for ''[[60 Minutes]]'', an offer she declined, with the conviction that she didn't personally want to blur the lines between actor and journalist.

After ''Murphy Brown'', Bergen hosted ''Exhale with Candice Bergen'' on the [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen network]].&lt;ref&gt;More Intriguing Guests, More Stimulating Conversation, and More Candice Bergen; "Exhale With Candice Bergen" Returns To Oxygen For Season Two

She also appeared in character roles in films, including ''[[Miss Congeniality (film)|Miss Congeniality]]'' (2000), where she played villainous pageant host Kathy Morningside; she also portrayed the mayor of New York in ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)|Sweet Home Alabama]]'' (2002) and appeared in the [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] flight-attendant comedy, ''[[View from the Top]]'' (2003).

She had roles in ''[[The In-Laws (2003 film)|The In-Laws]]'' (2003), ''[[Footsteps (film)|Footsteps]]'' (2003), a thriller, and a semi recurring role on ''[[Sex and the City]]'', where she played Enid Frick, [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'s editor at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Candice Bergen's Casting Problem

===''Boston Legal''===
In January 2005, Bergen joined the cast of the television series ''[[Boston Legal]]'' as Shirley Schmidt, a founding partner in the law firm of [[Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt]]. She played the role for five seasons. In 2006 and 2008, she received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

A frequent host on NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', she was the first woman to host the show and the first host to do a second show.  She was also the first woman to join the [[Five-Timers Club]], when she hosted for the fifth time in 1990. Bergen guest-starred on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in its first year, appearing in several skits, an episode now available in a DVD collection. She was also featured in a long-running "Dime Lady" ad campaign for the [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] phone company.

She has also made guest appearances on many other TV shows, including ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (as herself playing Murphy Brown), ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' (playing herself).

Bergan could be seen in ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'' (2008) and ''[[Bride Wars]]'' (2009) as Marion St. Claire, New York's most sought-after wedding planner, who also serves as the narrator of the story.

From its launch in 2008, Candice Bergen was a contributor for [[wowOwow]].com, a website for women to talk culture, politics and gossip. The website closed in 2010.

She was in ''[[The Romantics (film)|The Romantics]]'' (2010) and had an occasional role on ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' as [[Lisa Cuddy]]'s mother, starting in Season 7, including the 2011 episodes "[[Larger Than Life (House)|Larger Than Life]]" and "[[Family Practice (House)|Family Practice]]".

In 2010, she appeared in a one-night only concert semi staged reading of ''[[Evening Primrose (musical)|Evening Primrose]]'' by [[Stephen Sondheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Portantiere |first1=Michael |last2= |first2= |year=2011 |title=Back into the light |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVII |issue=3 |pages=44|publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also appeared on Broadway in the 2012 revival of [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[The Best Man (play)|The Best Man]]'' and the 2014 revival of ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.

A political activist, Bergen accepted a date with [[Henry Kissinger]]. During her activist days she participated in a [[Youth International Party|Yippie]] prank when she, [[Abbie Hoffman]], and others threw dollar bills onto the floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1967, leading to its temporary shutdown.  In 1972, she [[Celebrity activists in George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign|served as a fundraiser and organizer]] for [[George McGovern]]'s [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, George S., ''Grassroots: The Autobiography of George McGovern'', New York: Random House, 1977, pp. 173, 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen and former boyfriend [[Terry Melcher]] lived at [[10050 Cielo Drive]] in [[Los Angeles]], which was later occupied by [[Sharon Tate]] and her husband, [[Roman Polanski]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="839">'''Chak-pur''' are the traditional tools used in [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[sandpainting]] to produce ''[[mandala]]s''. They are conically shaped metal funnels and often have ridges down the sides. Normally about {{convert|12|-|18|inch}} in length, they taper to a fine point and are made with varying diameter holes at the end in order to disperse the sand in a controlled way. A Tibetan monk will usually tap glide a piece of wood over the ridges in order to slowly allow the sand to emerge through the hole through the vibrations created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticalartsoftibet.org/mandala.htm|title=Mandala Sand Painting|publisher=Drepung Loseling Monastery|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dendermonde Codex''' or sometimes called '''Villarenser Kodex''' or '''codex 9''' of the [[Dendermonde Abbey]],&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard of Bingen: Woman of Vision /Carol Reed-Jones&lt;/ref&gt; is a valuable manuscript containing the ''Symphonia harmoniae caelestium revelationum'' of [[Hildegard of Bingen]].&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/bljde_20130731_001|publisher=nieuwsblad.be|title=Dendermonde Codex in doctoraatsthesis (Dendermonde) - Het Nieuwsblad|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
This valuable manuscript is kept in a 19th-century monastery because, it did pass in several other Benedictine monasteries.&lt;ref name="stretto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stretto.be/hildegard-von-bingen-in-dendermonde/|publisher=stretto.be|title=HILDEGARD VON BINGEN IN DENDERMONDE &amp;#124; Stretto &amp;#8211; Magazine voor kunst, geschiedenis en muziek|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Historians]] believe it was first sent to the Belgian [[Villers Abbey]], hence the name Villarensis. It then moved to [[Gembloux Abbey]]
and finally it arrived in the famous [[Affligem Abbey]], where the monks were chased out in 1796. In 1869/70, the abbey of Affligem was re-established, but the valuable collection did not return and is kept until today inside Dendermonde Abbey. The Bingen manuscript is considered the most valuable of the library, and is world-famous therefor.

== The Manuscript ==
The collection of songs inside the codex was named by Hildegard ''Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum&lt;ref name="alamirefoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alamirefoundation.org/en/publications/hildegard-bingen-symphonia-harmoniae-caelestium-revelationum-dendermonde-st-pieters-pau|publisher=alamirefoundation.org|title=Hildegard of Bingen, Symphonia harmoniae caelestium revelationum. Dendermonde, St.-Pieters &amp;amp; Paulusabdij, Ms. Cod. 9 &amp;#124; International Centre for the Study of Music in the Low Countries|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.

The current manuscript is not complete as several folios are missing. However, it still contains 183 folios, made of parchment, containing 60 psalmes and cantica in honour of father and son.&lt;ref name="hetstillepand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hetstillepand.be/von_bingen.html|publisher=hetstillepand.be|title=Hildegard von Bingen|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dated ca. 1176 A.D. and is considered one of the major works by Hildegard von Bingen.

It was critically well acclaimed, being one of the first Indian films that talked about [[womance]].

==Plot==
Two young girls from a boarding school decide to elope while on a school picnic. They believe as troublemakers they are not wanted in the school or at home. They see the world's resentment personified in a mean teacher who is in charge of this particular picnic.

They manage to elope and find a convent to stay for the immediate night and a youth hostel soon after under the disguise that they are traveling college students. Meanwhile the teacher loses her job. 

As they piece together a living doing odd jobs for the time being, they are befriended by a stranger towards whom one of them begins to develop love. The other initially tries to protect her friend but soon accedes, not wanting to be a hindrance to her friend's choice.

After a while the former who is in love with this stranger tells him the truth about her situation. This is in return for him telling her the same. The stranger is a suspended bank manager. He lost his job because someone pretending to be the wife of a dead man tricked him into giving her the dead man's money in the bank. However, since his suspension he has been anonymously receiving a fixed sum every month through post. 

As the girl shows him her photo album he realises that this swindler was the disciplinarian school teacher these girls hate. It also gives him an explanation as to why the money orders had stopped. 

He subsequently traces the teacher and they fall in love. He promises to get her job back because he has the kids. He will also be done with his suspension by then.

He then knowingly manipulates the school girl's love for him though he says or does nothing more than leading her on and he expects her to be understating that she's just infactuated with him and too young.

He brings up a position where she agrees to go back thinking then he will love her.

The other girl is like your choices are yours and finally they agree to Manager's proposition to mediate between Teacher and the kids. The "bold" girl ends up outraged at Teacher for no particular reason and storms out refusing to go back to school.

The other girl agrees to convince her. But then things go south as Manager reveals that Teacher is his fiancee.

Back at their hostel the other girl decides to flee and implores her friend to come with. Refuses. They share an intimate goodbye.

But she comes back half way realising it's not fine, bangs open the room to find the other girl about to suicide. 

They both break down and hug.

Next morning Teacher, Manager and the whole school management comes to find that they are in bed sleeping together.

But they are dead.

Last scene is Manager's face going "what have I done"

==Critical Analysis==

The movie is considered as the first Malayalam film which explored the theme of homosexuality.

==Trivia==
*The Film was distributed by Dinny Films.
*Though the film is not structured as a thriller, the mystery element in most of the story was highly acclaimed.  It garnered very positive reviews from viewers as well as critics.  Especially the introduction scene of Harishankar, where the character brings in a clear feeling of distrust for Sally and a very clear romantic feeling for Nirmala is notable for the air of mystery around Harishankar.  Through the narrative, [[Padmarajan]] brings in a connection between Devika and Harishankar which eventually leads to the suicide of the girls.  The feeling Sally has for Nirmala is also described beautifully.  The willful and disobedient Sally was ready to bend her decisions and views only for Nirmala.  Though Nirmala decided to go back against her wishes, Sally never left Nirmala's side and was ready to be with her for ever.

'''Emil Thoroddsen''' (June 16, 1898 &amp;ndash; July 7, 1944) was an Icelandic composer, pianist, playwright, critic and translator. He was the chief art critic of "Morgunblaðið" newspaper from 1926–1933 and worked for the [[RÚV|Icelandic National Broadcasting Service]] since its establishment in 1930. Among his most widely known songs are „Íslands Hrafnistumenn“ and „Hver á sér fegra föðurland“ which was premiered at the Festival of the Republic in 1944, shortly before he far too prematurely died from pneumonia.

In his youth, Emil practiced sports among young men from his neighborhood and was involved in the creation of the football club [[Knattspyrnufélagið Víkingur|Víkingur Reykjavik]] at the age of twelve, hosting the club's inaugural meeting and initially taking the role of club secretary. He later produced coverage about the club's operations and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Mbl.is Archives.

'''Eyebeam''' is a not-for-profit art and technology center in New York City, founded by John S. Johnson III with co-founders David S. Johnson and Roderic R. Richardson.

Originally conceived as a digital effects and coding [[atelier]] and center for youth education, Eyebeam has become a center for the research, development, and curation of [[new media]] works of art and [[open source technology]]. Eyebeam annually hosts up to 20 residents and co-produces youth educational programs, exhibitions, performances, symposia, workshops, [[hackathon]]s and other events with these residents as well as with partner organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyebeam.org/about |title=About |author=Eyebeam Art + Technology Center |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects developed at Eyebeam have received awards and recognition including [[Webby Awards]], [[Guggenheim Fellowships]], and the [[Prix Ars Electronica]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==History==
Eyebeam, originally called Eyebeam Atelier, was first conceived as a collaboration between David S. Johnson, a digital artist, and John S. Johnson III, a filmmaker and philanthropist.  The two were introduced by Roderic R. Richardson, a mutual friend who recognized their shared interests and helped establish the new venture in its early stages.  The inspiration to name the project Eyebeam Atelier came partly from the sculpture atelier of John Johnson's father, [[John Seward Johnson II]] and the [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] collective.  After observing [[new media]] as a growing genre, the co-founders were motivated to create a similar studio. They recognized a need to provide artists and digital film artists access to new technology and a shared workspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jana |first1=Reena |year=2002 |title=Johnson and Johnson Heir Founds Digital Art Museum |journal=Carrindex Gabrius }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to offering resources for new media artists, Johnson saw a need to provide middle and high school students with educational and artistic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Elegant Marriage of Inside and Outside |author=Herbert Muschamp |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/21/arts/design/21MUSC.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 21, 2001 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Day Camp, the first youth program which catered to new [[media literacy|media education]], was founded in 1998; in the pilot program, New York-based high school students learned web development and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez |first1=Allan |year=1998 |title=Eyebeam Atelier |journal=TheBlowUp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future sessions included project-based learning around themes of [[bioart]], [[Urban Interventionism|urban interventionism]], [[game design]], and [[wearable technology]].

Eyebeam’s first forum, “Interaction,” took place online in the summer of 1998 and was curated by [[UCSD]] professor Jordan Crandall. The forum, an [[email list]] called &lt;eyebeam&gt;&lt;blast&gt;, was hosted by [[Brian Holmes]], [[Olu Oguibe]], and [[Gregory Ulmer]], and included [[Lev Manovich]], [[N. Katherine Hayles]], [[Saskia Sassen]], [[Matthew Slotover]], [[Ken Goldberg]], [[Geert Lovink]], [[Knowbotic Research]], [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]], [[Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger]], [[Mark Tribe]], and [[Critical Art Ensemble]] among the participating  artists, educators, new media and internet theorists, and technologists (cite). The discussions spurred by &lt;eyebeam&gt;&lt;blast&gt; were compiled into a book titled “Interaction: Artistic Practice on the Network” and published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flagan |first1=Are |year=2001 |title=Interaction – Artistic Practice in the Network – Review |journal=Afterimage |issue=July/August }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to funding artistic research, Johnson hoped to develop Eyebeam as a space that would also function as a museum devoted to new media works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Avant-Garde Design For A New Media Center |author=Julie V. Iovine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/21/arts/an-avant-garde-design-for-a-new-media-center.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 21, 2002 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Eyebeam announced an international architectural competition to construct a space devoted to the dialog between art and technology, with the design firm [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro|Diller + Scofidio]]’s “Olympic class” design named the winner of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pratt |first=Kevin |title= Building the Better Mousetrap |pages=Issue No. 315 |publisher=Time Out New York |date= October 1, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hovagimyan]], [[Tony Martin (artist)|Tony Martin]], [[Yael Kanarek]], [[M.River &amp; T.Whid Art Associates|MTAA]], [[John Klima (artist)|John Klima]], [[Jem Cohen]], [[Cory Arcangel]], and [[Michael Bell-Smith]] were among the inaugural exhibitors.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Among the projects on display was Galloway’s Carnivore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://r-s-g.org/carnivore/|title=Carnivore|work=r-s-g.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] library that allowed for the creative misuse of data surveillance created in tandem with other members of Radical Software Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eai.org/artistTitles.htm?id=8785/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rojas |first1=Pete |year=2003 |title=Digital Details: Internet Surveillance Tools Make For Unlikely Inspiration |journal=Surface |issue=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnivore takes its name and function from [[Carnivore (software)|DCS1000]], a surveillance system used by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]].

The Eyebeam OpenLab served as the birthplace of the [[Graffiti Research Lab]]. Founded by [[James Powderly]] and [[Evan Roth]] during their OpenLab fellowships in 2005, the GRL was envisioned as a nonprofit design studio for creating experimental technologies with street art applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Writing's on the Wall.

(Free Art and Technology) Lab]], a collective dedicated to the merging of [[open source]] technology and [[popular culture]], with [[Theo Watson]], Chris Sugrue, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/net-art-powerhouse-fat-lab-featured-on-pbs-arts-video |title=Net Art Powerhouse F.A.T.

Eyebeam expanded its programmatic lineup of exhibitions and workshops with MIXER, a series dedicated to showcasing leading performance artists in the field of live video and audio, in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spare Times |author=Melena Ryzik |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/arts/16wspare.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural event, “Brother Islands (Places to Lose People),” was focused around an immersive experimental documentary of [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]] and [[Wards Island]] by media artist [[Benton C Bainbridge]]. MIXER events were organized around themes as disparate as the World's Fair, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and New York City’s underground and featured interactive installations alongside performances by musicians and performance artists including [[Dam Funk|DāM-FunK]], [[Paper Rad|Extreme Animals]], [[CHERYL]], and [[D-Fuse AV]]. That same year, fellows and resident artists began organizing mobile workshops and talks. 
In 2011, several Eyebeam residents, fellows, and alumni participated in [[Talk to Me (exhibition)|''Talk to Me: Design and the Communication between People and Objects'']] at the [[MoMA|Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Eyebeam Fellow Ayah Bdeir’s littleBits, a DIY kit of open source pre-assembled circuits, was among the projects displayed and was acquired by the MoMA as part of their permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=145485 |title=MoMA – The Collection – Ayah Bdeir. littleBits. 2008. |date= |work=The Museum of Modern Art |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 the first ever [[Wikipedia:Meetup/ArtAndFeminism|Art + Feminism Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon]] was hosted at Eyebeam and co-organized by fellow [[Laurel Ptak]] in conjunction with more than 30 satellite edit-a-thons internationally across the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

In July 2014 Eyebeam left their Chelsea space and now operates out of an interim space in [[Industry City]] in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn]].

Since November 2017 Eyebeam has been located at 199 Cook Street in Brooklyn. This coincides with their 20th anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/408850/eyebeam-new-bushwick-home-at-20/|title=As Eyebeam Turns 20, the Arts Nonprofit Moves to Bushwick|date=2017-11-01|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an organization which was celebrated in Spring 2018.

'''''Fremde Haut''''' is a 2005 German film. It was directed by [[Angelina Maccarone]] and stars [[Jasmin Tabatabai]], Anneke Kim Sarnau, and [[Navíd Akhavan]]. Its English title is '''''Unveiled'''''.

==Background==
Writers Maccarone and Judith Kaufmann conceived the idea for the film in 1998. In 2002, Maccarone sent a copy of the script to actress Tabatabai, who reviewed it. As an Iranian, Tabatabai worked with Maccarone and Kaufmann to rewrite the story to be more realistic. For example, the main character became "more subtle, not as outspoken."&lt;ref name="AE interview"&gt;{{cite news

==Plot summary==
The translator Fariba Tabrizi (29, played by Jasmin Tabatabai) is living under the threat of the death penalty in her own country Iran after being revealed, by the vice squad, to be homosexual. With some support from a relative, Fariba is able to flee from her home country to Germany. When she is in the refugee detention centre at Frankfurt Airport her application for asylum is turned down. She lives hour by hour with the thought in mind that she may be deported. Her desperate prospects are dramatically improved by the suicide of a fellow-inmate also from Iran she assumes his identity and, as Siamak Mustafai, and using his temporary permit of sojourn, is re-located to the provinces of Swabia.

Fariba knows Germany only from literature and from her work as a translator which leave her in no way prepared for the likes of Sielmingen. The contrast to a metropolis such as Teheran could scarcely be greater. At first glance her survival seems to be assured. However, in the refugee home she is obliged to uphold her male disguise in cramped quarters and she is not permitted to leave the Regional District of Esslingen. A single word wrong, any attempt at contact is allied for her with the danger of her cover being blown.

The only way to escape from this predicament is by means of forged documents. To do this she is in urgent need of money. With a little help from her roommate Gasmut she comes into contact with Lächle (30), the local godfather. He is instrumental in procuring an illegal, seasonal job for her in a sauerkraut processing factory right in the middle of a complex hick town coterie. Anne (26) is manoeuvred by her workmates into taking on a bet. She will get a bike for her son if she can manage to get a date with the refugee chap. Uwe (29) finds it totally out of order that Anne is so solicitous about Siamak's well-being. His worries are not entirely unfounded, since Anne derives some kind of pleasure from the strange foreigner.

Under any other circumstances Fariba would have been only too glad to respond to Anne's advances, however she is afraid on account of the whole business of the Siamak facade. With great stubbornness Anne drags Siamak along to the boozy leisure activities of her little hick town clique. In the process they become dangerously close and Anne begins to get wind of Fariba's true identity.

When Siamak's permit of sojourn runs out Fariba gets into arrears with the instalments for her documents. It becomes clear to her that she will never manage things on her own. She risks everything and takes Anne into her confidence. She wants at long last to be able to live as a woman again, to live out her profession, to enjoy big cities. To break away from the provinces would also be the fulfilment of a dream for Anne. She does not disappoint Fariba. Together they successfully go in for car theft. Fariba gets her new passport. The world is their oyster.

Just as Fariba is changing out of her Siamak disguise Uwe and the clique turn up in Anne's flat. Uwe demands an explanation. The row escalates. The noisy dispute leads to Fariba's downfall. During the routine check on account of disturbance of the falsified passport falls into the hands of the police. The system which she believed she had outwitted takes its relentless grip. Fariba knows: this is the end, her hopes are shattered. Anne has to watch on helplessly as Fariba is put under arrest.

The term "in orbit" is officially used by the UN to refer to asylum-seekers who find themselves orbiting around planet Earth because they can actually find legal domicile nowhere at all.

The '''Friends of the Uffizi Gallery''' was established in 2006 in [[Palm Beach, Florida]] as the United States "sister" organization to the Amici degli Uffizi in [[Florence, Italy]], which was founded by a group of concerned citizens in response to the terrorist bombing of the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in May 1993 that damaged several artworks and portions of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowell|first=Alan|title=Bomb Outside Uffizi in Florence Kills 6 and Damages Many Works|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/world/bomb-outside-uffizi-in-florence-kills-6-and-damages-many-works.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi directly support the Uffizi Gallery by helping build awareness of the museum and its [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Cultural Heritage|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by raising funds for acquisitions, preservation, restorations, temporary exhibitions, and educational programming.

== History ==
[[File:Uffizi Gallery from south 2013 February.jpg|thumb|250px|Uffizi Gallery viewed from the south]]

In 1993 a terrorist bomb severely damaged the [[Uffizi Gallery]] and some of the artworks.&lt;ref name=Olive&gt;{{cite news|last=Pirro|first=Deirdre|title=The Olive Tree of Peace: The massacre in via dei Georgofili|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=7762|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=The Florentine|date=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this attack, a group of concerned citizens founded the Amici degli Uffizi in Florence to help restore and preserve the artistic heritage of the museum. Since the bombing, the Amici degli Uffizi has supported the Uffizi Gallery by facilitating acquisitions, supporting restorations, and organizing special temporary exhibitions.

In 2006, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery, Inc. was established in Palm Beach, Florida as the United States “sister” organization to the Amici degli Uffizi. Granted 501(c)(3) Tax Exempt Status, its sole purpose is to support the activities of the Amici by helping to fund ongoing restoration projects and to bring these projects to fruition.

Led by Executive Board President Contessa Maria Vittoria Colonna Rimbotti, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery in conjunction with the Amici degli Uffizi raises funds to support all of these activities through an international group of members and patrons. More than 30 restoration projects designated as priorities by the museum have been completed over the last several years and include renowned paintings, altarpieces, sculptures and tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed Restoration Projects|url=http://www.friendsoftheuffizigallery.org/completed-restoration-projects/|publisher=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The mission of both organizations is to support the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy, by raising awareness of the museum and its collections and by providing resources for acquisition, preservation, restoration and education.

=== Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol ===
Created by Sergio Bianco, the symbol represents the view of the Uffizi from the Arno arcade. The sky seen under the archway forms the shape of a horse head in the typical posture of the knight chess piece. Representing loyalty and the right cause, the horse symbolizes the commitment of the Associations Amici degli Uffizi and Friends of the Uffizi Gallery to the benefit of the Uffizi Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol|url=http://www.sergiobianco.it/basement.asp?sn=&amp;sez=1&amp;sez1=1&amp;area=&amp;lang=en&amp;nome=&amp;lay=articolo&amp;pag=69|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities and special events ==

===Florentine weekend, Florence Italy===
Every two years, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery organize the Florentine Weekend, which includes art-focused activities at the Uffizi Gallery and in nearby locations throughout the City of Florence that relate to both Renaissance art and Italian culture. It is a members-only event open to Friends of the Uffizi Gallery members at the Botticelli, Michelangelo and Leonardo membership levels.

== Completed restoration projects ==
[[File:Michelangelo- Tondo Doni - tone corrected.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo's ''Tondo Doni'' is the centerpiece of the new room reconstructed through funds from the Friends of Uffizi Gallery]]
More than thirty restorations designated as a priority by the Uffizi Gallery have been completed with funds raised by both Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and Amici degli Uffizi.

The '''Michelangelo Room''', which opened to the public on January 29, 2013, is an example of a completed project by this organization.  The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi funded the re-construction of this room on the second floor and the re-installation of the paintings. The re-construction involved restoring the original marble floor and re-plastering the walls and painting them red. 
The re-installation included Michelangelo’s ''[[Doni Tondo|Tondo Doni]]'' (ca. 1507 oil and tempera on panel) which is the only confirmed panel painting existing today in its original frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery fund new Michelangelo Room on second floor of gallery in Italy|url=http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=60758#.U15_RF7Zdg0|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Art Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other early sixteenth-century Florentine painters represented in the room include [[Francesco Granacci]], [[Fra Bartolomeo]] (Paolo di Jacopo del Fattorino detto Baccio della Porta), [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Franciabigio]], [[Giuliano Bugiardini]],  and [[Alonso Berruguete]].

'''''[[Laocoön]]''''' by [[Baccio Bandinelli]] (Firenze 1493-1560), depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons ensnared in the toils of the sea serpents sent by [[Poseidon]]. A previous restoration was done when the sculpture was broken into more than 40 pieces by a fire that caused a partial roof collapse at the Uffizi on August 12, 1762. The new restoration improved on the previous one plus removed layers of dust and wax that had built up over the decades and caused the sculpture’s surface to become dull and darkened. This restoration will protect the beauty and condition of this sculpture for many generations.

== Individual restoration projects ==
These two projects are examples of restorations funded by a single Leonardo-level member of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery.

The restoration of this late 2nd Century A.D. replica of a 5th Century B.C. Greek sculpture of '''''[[Asclepius]]''''', the god of medicine, made it possible to confirm the pertinence of the head to the body. In addition to strengthening the sculpture by replacing old putty, recent cleaning of the surface revealed details from an early 12th Century restoration such as the figure’s left hand holding a medicinal plant well known since the Middle Ages. This restoration was funded by the Lisa Marie Conte Browne Family.

This mid-2nd Century A.D. statue of '''''[[Aphrodite]] &amp; [[Eros]]''''' is a replica of the original Capitoline Venus, apart from the addition of the small funerary Eros. The sculpture’s head, arms and right leg were integrated in 1584. The sculpture is likely to have never been restored since then and the recent restoration included removing the dirt deposits and addressing the ancient integrations and fractures repairs. This restoration was funded by Thomas J. and Judith A. Embrescia.

== Community restoration projects ==
With this type of project, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery accepts donations from all sources (including non-members) interested in conserving a selected work of art.

The 2014 project is a statue of '''''[[Aphrodite]]''''' (2nd Century AD). She is the Greek goddess of love, known as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] to the Romans. This sculpture is a standing semi-nude female figure created using the ancient Roman fragments of the torso and head. The arms aned richly-draped lower part were added by [[Alessandro Algardi]], an artist hired by the Medici in the 17th Century to integrate the fragments into a single sculpture. This restoration project involved removing thick layers of accumulated dust and greatly increased documentary information.

'''Functional Design''' is a paradigm used to simplify the design of hardware and software devices such as computer [[software]] and increasingly, [[3D model]]s. A [[function (engineering)|functional]] design assures that each modular part of a device has only one responsibility and performs that responsibility with the minimum of side effects on other parts. Functionally designed modules tend to have low [[coupling (computer science)|coupling]].

==Advantages==
The advantage for implementation is that if a software module has a single purpose, it will be simpler, and therefore easier and less expensive, to design and implement.

Systems with functionally designed parts are easier to modify because each part does only what it claims to do.

Since maintenance is more than 3/4 of a successful system's life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.jyu.fi/~koskinen/smcosts.htm] Software Maintenance Costs by Jussi Koskinen&lt;/ref&gt; this feature is a crucial advantage. It also makes the system easier to understand and document, which simplifies training. The result is that the practical lifetime of a functional system is longer.

In a system of programs, a functional module will be easier to reuse because it is less likely to have side effects that appear in other parts of the system.

==Technique==

The standard way to assure functional design is to review the description of a module.  If the description includes conjunctions such as "and" or "or", then the design has more than one responsibility, and is therefore likely to have side effects.  The responsibilities need to be divided into several modules in order to achieve a functional design.

==Critiques and limits==

Every computer system has parts that cannot be functionally pure because they exist to distribute CPU cycles or other [[resource (computer science)|resource]]s to different modules. For example, most systems have an "initialization" section that starts up the modules. Other well-known examples are the [[interrupt vector table]] and the [[main loop]].

Some functions inherently have mixed semantics. For example, a function "move the car from the garage" inherently has a side effect of changing the "car position". In some cases, the mixed semantics can extend over a large topological tree or graph of related concepts. In these unusual cases, functional design is not recommended by some authorities. Instead [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]], or procedural methods may be preferred.

==Applied to 3D modeling and simulation==
Recently several software companies have introduced functional design as a concept to describe a [[Parametric feature based modeler]] for 3D modeling and simulation.  In this context, they mean a [[parametric model]] of an object where the parameters are tied to real-world design criteria, such as an axle that will adjust its diameter based on the strength of the material and the amount of force being applied to it in the simulation.  It is hoped that this will create efficiencies in the design process for mechanical and perhaps even architectural/structural assemblies by integrating the results of [[finite element analysis]] directly to the behavior of individual objects.

The '''Gaiety Theatre''' is a [[listed building|category B listed]] performing arts venue in [[Ayr]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=21522 Historic Scotland - Gaiety Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted for its interior [[rococo]] features, its atmosphere and its acoustics.

The Ayr Gaiety was built in 1902, reconstructed after a fire in 1904, its façade remodeled in 1935, and further reinstated after a fire in 1955. In 1995, an annex was constructed, including a new café, box office, dressing rooms and studio space.
After a faltering start, which saw several years as a cinema after World War I, the theatre was bought by Ben Popplewell, from Bradford who already had a track record of success running the Pavilion theatre on Ayr seafront.  For fifty years the Popplewell family ran the theatre – latterly as part of the Glasgow Pavilion business.  During this time the Gaiety developed a reputation as a variety theatre with a ‘summer’ variety show – the Gaiety Whirl – which ran for 26 weeks at its height. Many Scottish and UK stars appeared regularly on its stage, and several started their careers there.  The programme offered more than a summer show however, with several weeks of Shakespeare and regular transfers from Glasgow Citizens theatre, being part of a varied offer. 
After seventy years in private ownership the local Council acquired the Gaiety theatre freehold in 1974.  It then operated as a municipal theatre under direct local authority management.  The programming had much in common with the Popplewell years, with the Gaiety Whirl still a feature and the, by now, popular panto at the core of the programme.  But the scope of performances developed and, while the family oriented theme continued, a wider range of presentations developed, including controversial shows such as Borderline Theatres production of Dario Fo’s Mistero Buffo and a touring version of Oh Calcutta!  After many years of successful operation the theatre began to lose audiences and the Council felt the revenue subsidy it provided and the requirement for capital investment required a new approach.  In January 2009 the theatre closed, leaving Ayr without a theatre – as the Civic Theatre, which had mainly presented drama, had been closed and demolished a little earlier due to asbestos contamination problems.

==South Ayrshire Council forced closure==

The closure met with considerable opposition and dismay among many Ayr residents, particularly since it appeared that the required capital and revenue investment to reopen the theatre would not be available.  A public meeting attracted over 400 attendees, the future of the theatre was a key issue in the local press, many Scottish performers expressed their dismay and there was extensive discussion on social media.

In early 2009 South Ayrshire Council invited tenders to take on the theatre management. Ayr Gaiety Partnership (AGP), a charity formed by local residents for the purpose in Summer 2009, secured preferred bidder status.  Just over three years later, having secured financial backing from the Council and Scottish Government, as well as from local fundraising, AGP took on a 99-year lease of the theatre with a vision to do much more than simply re-open the building. Ayr Gaiety Partnerships vision is 'to re-energise the performing arts in South Ayrshire, with the Gaiety Theatre as the hub of a network of venues that will stimulate the cultural life and economic prosperity of the area ensuring that Ayr will once again be a key destination for all those interested in the performing arts.'

==Re-opening in 2012==

From the start the organisation set ambitious social, economic and cultural goals. But the first priority was to re-open with a successful panto. On 11 December 2012, after many last minute challenges, the Gaiety re-opened for what turned out to be a sell-out run of over 40 performances of the panto Cinderella.

==Ayr Gaiety Partnership==

The Ayr Gaiety Partnership is a charitable body formed by local community figures, with membership open to local residents. The directors at present are: Ian Welsh, David Quayle, Chris Fremantle, Graham Peterkin, and Professor Gayle McPherson.

Membership is open to local residents and others with an interest in the theatre. Ayr Gaiety Partnership's first General Meeting is set to take place on 13 October 2014.

==Staff &amp; Volunteering at The Gaiety==
The new Ayr Gaiety is unlike most theatres in the UK because it is largely run through voluntary effort.   Most of the people undertaking front of house, technical, fundraising, marketing and maintenance are doing so on a voluntary basis. Although the volunteering effort overall is led by the Executive Director and Board- each volunteer team is supported and led by one of the staff team members.

The Gaiety's current full-time staff team consists of just nine employees led by Executive Director Jeremy Wyatt.

==Scotland's 1st Learning Theatre==
The School of Media, Culture &amp; Society at the [[University of the West of Scotland]] (UWS) and the Gaiety Theatre officially launched Scotland’s first Learning Theatre on Friday 19 September 2014. The launch event, which saw representatives from UWS, the Gaiety, as well as the [[National Theatre of Scotland]] in attendance, marks the first stage in the development of the partnership Learning Theatre, which will provide a centre for education, training and research in the area of performance and theatre craft.

UWS enjoys close links with the Gaiety and the University’s new BA Technical Theatre degree, delivered in conjunction with the Theatre, had its first intake in September. The course, the only one of its kind in the country, offers thorough vocational training for those looking to work in stage management and theatre production. Students will gain professional knowledge of the industry and will be prepared for a variety of employment opportunities from small-scale theatres to large multi-media events, venues and festivals. The course is aimed at those with a range of theatre, performance, production and related HND qualifications to enable them to build to a degree award in Technical Theatre. Students from the University's undergraduate Performance programme also make regular use of the theatre's facilities.

[[File:GO Gala Photo.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Hugh Bonneville, George Sallis, Antonia Franceschi, Mark Baldwin, Richard Alston, Martin Lawrence, 22 January 2011]]

In 2013, Giant Olive produced the inaugural GOlive Dance and Performance festival, curated by veteran arts journalist Donald Hutera, whose writing has appeared in The Times, Time Out, Dance Europe and many other publications and websites worldwide. The festival patrons were Siobhan Davies and Rosemary Butcher. Spread across 21 consecutive days, and comprising over four dozen individuals or companies, the GOlive Festival featured work by Darren Ellis, Ella Mesma, Renaud Wiser, Anusha Subramanyam, Daniel Hay-Gordon/Eleanor Perry, 70/30 Split, Shane Shambhu, Nuno Silva, Moreno Solinas, Peta Lily, The Dangerologists, Stephanie Schober, Anna Williams, Stopgap's Sg2, Angela Woodhouse, Dog Kennel Hill Project, Avatâra Ayuso,  Mickael Marso Rivière, Jennifer Jackson/Susie Crow, Annie Lok, Zoi Dimitriou and Fred Gehrig amongst many others. Between them the artist involved had worked with the likes of Complicite, Richard Alston, Siobhan Davies, Shobana Jeyasingh, Russell Maliphant, The Royal Ballet, Wayne McGregor|Random Dance, Rambert Dance Company, Henri Oguike, Arthur Pita and Fiona Shaw.

In 2011, George Sallis and Antonia Franceschi teamed up to produce a Gala performance, to mark the closure of the Lion &amp; Unicorn Theatre for refurbishment.  The evening included performances choreographed by [[Richard Alston (choreographer)|Richard Alston]], Mark Baldwin, Martin Lawrence, Jonathan Goddard with poetry directed by Patsy Rodenburg, and ‘Disco’ from Giant Olive’s POP8, again featuring Ballet Black.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londondance.com/news_details.asp?NewsID=8136 londondance.com] 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glasgow Print Studio''' is an arts organisation situated in [[Glasgow, Scotland]].  Founded in 1972, Glasgow Print Studio is an organisation with charitable status that exists to encourage and promote the art of printmaking; it is supported by the [[Creative Scotland]] and [[Glasgow City Council]].

Providing facilities for the production of [[etchings]], [[relief prints]] and [[screenprints]], Glasgow Print Studio has a membership of over 300 artists who use the custom-built printmakers workshop.  The Studio also has two exhibition spaces hosting an exhibitions programme.  It also runs a learning programme focused on teaching and developing understanding of fine art [[printmaking]].

As well as providing subsidised printmaking facilities to artists, the Studio also supports its artist members by promoting and selling their art work in the gallery, on its web site and at international art fairs.

The Studio also has a print publishing programme, where an artist is invited to the studio to work with a master printmaker to make an edition of original prints.  It has worked with a range of Scottish and international artists, including [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Peter Howson]], [[Christine Borland]], [[Alasdair Gray]]. These publications can be seen in the gallery and on the Studio's web site. 

History: 

In 1972 a group of graduates from Glasgow School of Art set up Glasgow Print Studio in a flat in [[Finnieston]]. Finding nowhere that they could continue printmaking after graduation, they were supported by the [[Glasgow School of Art]]'s Head of Printmaking, Philip Reeves, to establish their own workshop.

As membership of the organisation increased, the 1976 move to Ingram Street in the city centre provided a larger workshop plus a gallery. Here, artists had a space to sell their work and the programme ranged from contemporary print to the popular Scottish Cartoonists exhibition and a retrospective by [[L. S. Lowry|LS Lowry]]. At Ingram Street, the Print Studio was at the centre of a social and artistic whirl. Bands played and plays were performed in the gallery, while the Print Studio Press published books by Scottish writers including [[Liz Lochhead|Liz Lochead]] and [[Alasdair Gray]]. The Studio also organised an annual Midsummer Ball, which became a key event in Glasgow’s social calendar.

Fruitful relationships have developed with established artists such as [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[Adrian Wiszniewski]], Scott Myles, [[Jim Lambie]], [[Claire Barclay]], [[Ciara Phillips|Ciara Philips]] and [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], who work collaboratively with the Studio’s master printers. The Studio offers both traditional and digital printing facilities and uses its expertise to work with contemporary galleries like [[The Modern Institute]]. Over forty years after its establishment, Glasgow Print Studio continues to play a vital role in encouraging and supporting a vibrant artistic community.

Unique to Scotland’s cultural landscape and central to the development of Glasgow’s [[Merchant City]] as the city's vibrant cultural quarter, the studio's workshop, galleries, archive, education space and other facilities now span three floors of Glasgow’s centre for art and creativity, [[Trongate 103.]]

[[File:Hawes-craven-iln.jpg|thumb|right|Hawes Craven]]
'''Henry Hawes Craven Green''' (3 July 1837 – 22 July 1910) was an English theatre scene-painter.  He collaborated with [[Henry Irving]], [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], producing stage sets of unprecedented realism.  Craven's career lasted from 1853 to 1905, spanning the end of the era of gas lighting in theatres and the beginning of electrical lighting; he developed new techniques to co-ordinate the appearance of theatre settings during the transition from gas to electricity.  He was regarded as the finest scene-painter of his day and was the last major scenic designer in the ultra-realistic tradition.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Craven was born in [[Leeds]], the son of theatrical parents.  His father, James Green (d. 1881), was a comedian and [[pantomime|pantomimist]], who had previously been an innkeeper. His mother, Elizabeth, ''née'' Craven (1802 or 1803–1866), was an actress, who left the stage, and published several volumes of prose and verse.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32617 "Craven, Hawes (1837–1910)"]. Archive version of ODNB article (dated 1912), ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 22 July 2010. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed with his father as a youth, shortening his name to Hawes Craven.  However, his aptitude for painting led him to apply for a place at the Government School of Design at [[Marlborough House]], London.  He studied there from 1851 to 1853, winning many prizes.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Ingram, Raymond (rev). [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32617 "Craven, Hawes (1837–1910)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 22 July 2010. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; On leaving, he was a taken on as an apprentice by John Gray, scene-painter of the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, London.  When Gray moved to the [[Olympic Theatre]], Craven moved with him.  In 1857 he had his first success, when Gray was ill and Craven did the work on a set depicting the Eddystone lighthouse for [[Wilkie Collins]]'s ''The Lighthouse''.  He worked from a painting by a well-known seascape artist, [[Clarkson Stanfield]], with such fidelity that Stanfield presented him with the original painting.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In the late 1850s and early 1860s, Craven worked at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] on pantomimes, and at the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]] on operas.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His first post as chief scene-painter was at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin]], from 1862 to 1864.  In London, during the rest of the 1860s, Craven was an assistant at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]], Olympic and [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]] theatres.  In June 1866 he married a dancer, Mary Elizabeth Watson Tees (1838–1891). There were three sons and three daughters of the marriage.

===Lyceum and Savoy theatres===
[[File:Harker-ivanhoe.jpg|right|thumb|Craven's scenery for ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', 1891]]
In 1871 Craven became principal scene-painter at the Lyceum Theatre, a role he held for the next thirty years, first as an employee and later as a freelance artist.  At first he worked under the management of H. L. Bateman, and then Bateman's widow.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; Despite early success with his scenery for the melodrama ''The Bells'', in which [[Henry Irving]] made his name, Craven's opportunities were restricted until Irving became lessee and manager of the Lyceum in 1878.  Craven, with Irving's support, carried scenic realism and stage illusion to new levels. 

For some productions, Irving commissioned designs from well-known painters, which Craven would then re-create as scenery.  These artists included [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].  For other productions, Craven created the original designs as well as executing them.  For his scenes in Irving's 1888 production of ''Faust'', he visited [[Nuremberg]] and the [[Harz mountains]] "with admirable results."&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; Irving became well known for his Shakespeare productions, for which Craven painted strongly naturalistic scenery, which won critical applause and occasionally threatened to outshine the performers.  His productions included ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1874 and 1878), ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1879), ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1882), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1888), ''[[Henry VIII (play)|King Henry VIII]]'' (1892), ''[[King Lear]]'' (1892), ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (1895), and ''[[Coriolanus]]'' (1902).&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; By the mid-1880s, Craven was recognised as among the élite of his art.  The theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' wrote, "In the art of scene painting England stands paramount. Neither Paris, not Germany, nor New York can commence to approach, let alone rival, the work of the men who furnish London with its stage scenery. Such men as  … Hawes Craven … are artists in the truest and best sense of the word."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 1 September 1888, p. 13. The article named [[William Roxby Beverly|W. R. Beverley]], William Telbin, Walter Hann, T. E. Ryan, Stafford Hall, and William Horford alongside Craven&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivanhoe-prog.jpg|left|thumb|Programme crediting Craven's sets for ''Ivanhoe'']]
For [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], Craven painted the scenery for seven of the [[Savoy opera]]s.  Carte's new theatre, the [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]], built in 1881, was lit by electricity, unlike the Lyceum, which remained gas-lit for some years.  Craven adjusted his techniques to match the stronger light produced by electric bulbs.  For the Savoy, Craven painted scenery for ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884),&lt;ref&gt;Act II only: see Rollins and Witts, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), a revival of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1890) and ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. vii–viii&lt;/ref&gt; Settings for these works ranged from a mediaeval Hungarian castle to a Japanese garden, the interior of a picture gallery, a Royal Naval ship modelled on [[H.M.S. Victory]], the [[Tower of London]], the [[Piazza San Marco#Description of the Piazzetta|Piazzetta]] in Venice, and a South Sea island.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, unnumbered photographic pages&lt;/ref&gt; Also for Carte, Craven designed and painted scenery for [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 7 February 1891, p. 11.  Craven provided the sets for the three scenes of Act II (The Forest, and two interiors in the Castle of Torquilstone). Carte's elaborate production also featured sets by J. Harker (Act I) and Ryan and Telbin (Act III).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Hawes-craven.jpg|thumb|right|1894 cartoons of Craven]]
The pinnacle of theatrical realism was reached, with Craven's help, by [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]].  Craven painted sets for stagings that famously included live rabbits running about in the forest scenes of ''[[As You Like It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gielgud, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Craven's last substantial work was the scenery for [[Arthur Bourchier]]'s revival of  ''The Merchant of Venice'' at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in October 1905.  In the same year he was elected president of the Scenic Artists' Association.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Craven was the last great practitioner of stage realism.  In its obituary notice, ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' wrote, "The most gifted scene-painters of the coming generation will probably try to suggest more and state less, to give symbols rather than imitations of nature."&lt;ref name=mg/&gt;

Craven died of bronchitis at his home in south London on 22 July 1910, at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Obituary tributes in the newspapers declared him to have been "the greatest of English scene-painters, and perhaps the finest scene-painter who has ever lived" (''The Manchester Guardian''),&lt;ref name=mg&gt;Obituary, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 27 July 1910, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; whose "scenes were real pictures, with the atmosphere and charm of fine paintings" (''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard'', 27 July 1910, ''quoted'' in the ODNB.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Jerusalem'''" is a song by [[Americans|American]] [[reggae]] singer [[Matisyahu]], produced by Jimmy Douglass &amp; The Ill Factor, and first released in 2006 on his major label debut, ''[[Youth (Matisyahu album)|Youth]]''. A new version was recorded later in 2006 with [[Sly &amp; Robbie]] and was released as a digital single on September 19, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=musicNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-13T013147Z_01_N12360436_RTRIDST_0_MUSIC-MATISYAHU-DC.XML&amp;archived=False |title=Matisyahu revisits "Jerusalem" with Sly &amp; Robbie |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=25 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517215139/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=musicNews |archivedate=17 May 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The song itself is based on [[Psalm 137]], verses 5–6, one of the most well known of the [[Psalms]]: 

{{quote|"If I forget you, O [[Jerusalem]], let my right hand wither, let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour."}}

The psalm is said to have been written during the [[Babylonian Exile]] by [[Jeremiah]] expressing the desire of the [[Israelites]] to return to Jerusalem. 

Matisyahu used the chorus lyrics of [[Break My Stride]] by [[Matthew Wilder]] as the bridge in this single. There are two versions of the song, the single version which is subtitled (Out of Darkness Comes Light) which is a funky-rock version, and an alternative slower dancehall reggae version.

==Music video==
On 31 September 2006, Matisyahu released a music video for "Jerusalem (Out of Darkness Comes Light) ". The video uses extensive imagery from the [[Holocaust]]  and Eastern European Jewish History, and the [[Civil Rights Movement]], as well as using pictures to create a central composite of the [[Western Wall]]. This is the first of Matisyahu's videos which does not take place outdoors, and is the first which contains extensive [[symbol]]ism rather than straightforward scenes.

[[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] as a sin. Judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life, since there is no perfect man and everyone has an [[Yetzer harah|inclination]] to do evil "from his youth".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis:8:21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torah.org/learning/mlife/ch1law1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence. Sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins, since a sin can't be a sin if the one who did it didn't know it was wrong. Unintentional sins are considered less severe sins.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"&gt;http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sins between people are considered much more severe in [[Judaism]] than sins between man and God. [[Yom Kippur]], the main day of repentance in [[Judaism]], can atone for sins between man and God, but not for sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]], [[Yoma]],8:9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks.org"&gt;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9670&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=310&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleazar ben Azariah]] derived [this from the verse]: "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" ([[Book of Leviticus]], 16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre.org"&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm#30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster 1986"&gt;Simon and Schuster, 1986, Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism, New York: Touchstone book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thetorah.com"&gt;http://thetorah.com/historical-uniqueness-and-centrality-of-yom-kippur/&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Karbanot]] (sacrifices) for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''karbanot'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''karbanot'' only expiate unintentional sins, that is, sins committed because a person forgot that this thing was a sin or by error. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress or through lack of knowledge, and for the most part, ''karbanot'' cannot atone for a malicious, deliberate sin. In addition, ''karbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely [[Repentance in Judaism|repents]] of his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"/&gt;

The completely righteous (means a man who did nothing wrong in his life) enjoy in this life and in the life after. The not completely righteous or completely wicked suffer for their sins in this world in order to atone for their sins through the humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them. If the repentance is not complete in this world, the suffering will continue in the life after (hell).  After the repentance is complete they join the righteous. The completely wicked (a man who did nothing good in his life) cannot correct their sins in this world or in the other, and hence do not suffer for them here, but in ''[[Gehenna|gehinom]]'' (hell). The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''gehinom'', because they don't or can't repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this, but God's justice is long, precise and just.&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16693.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tanakh==
The first mention of sin as a noun is a [[zoomorphism]], with sin (''hattath'') crouching at [[Cain]]'s door. The first as a verb is [[Abimelech]] being prevented from sinning (''khata'') against God in a dream. In fact the whole [[Tanakh]] is full of references to sins committed by leading people. This is to teach us that no one is perfect, everyone standing in trials/tests, and the thing is to try your best to learn from their mistakes.

People do have the ability to master this inclination ({{bibleverse||Genesis|4:7|HE}}) and choose good over evil (conscience)({{bibleverse||Psalm|37:27|HE}}).&lt;ref name="englishhandbook"&gt;[http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/library/document-library/handbook/The-Jewish-Response-to-Missionaries---English/ English Handbook of Jews for Judaism]&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism uses the term "sin" to include violations of [[halakha|Jewish law]] that are not necessarily a lapse in morality. According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]: "Man is responsible for sin because he is endowed with free will ("behirah"); yet he is by nature frail, and the tendency of the mind is to evil: "For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" (Gen. viii. 21; Yoma 20a; Sanh. 105a). Therefore God in His mercy allowed people to [[repent]] and be [[Forgiveness|forgiven]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=812&amp;letter=S&amp;search=sin JewishEncyclopedia.com - SIN:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism holds that all people sin at various points in their lives, and hold that [[God]] tempers [[justice]] with [[mercy]].

==Terminology==
Hebrew has several other words for sin beyond ''hata'', each with its own specific meaning.  The word ''pesha'', or "trespass", means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word ''aveira'' means "transgression".  And the word ''avone'', or "iniquity", means a sin done out of moral failing.  The word most commonly translated simply as "sin", ''hata'', literally means "to go astray." Just as Jewish law, ''halakha'', provides the proper "way" (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path.

Judaism teaches that humans are born with [[free will]], and morally neutral, with both a ''[[yetzer hatov]]'', (literally, "the good inclination", in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a ''[[yetzer hara]]'', (literally "the evil inclination", in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). The yetzer hara in some forms of Judaism means that [[Satan]] is merely an idiom or parable, rather than the [[fallen angel]] of traditional Christianity.

==In rabbinical literature==
[[Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno]] suggests that the verse about a leader begins with the term "when," which implies that committing a sin is inevitable because powerful and wealthy people—the leaders—are also likely to sin. This Torah verse concludes with the words "realizes his guilt" (Leviticus 4:22) because it is essential that powerful people acknowledge and feel remorse for their sin, lest they sin again.

==Transgression==
The generic [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for any kind of sin is ''avera'' (literally: transgression). Based on verses in the [[Hebrew Bible]], Judaism describes three levels of sin. There are three categories of a person who commits an avera. The first one is someone who does an avera intentionally, or "B'mezid." This is the most serious category. The second is one who did an avera by accident. This is called "B'shogeg," and while the person is still responsible for their action it is considered less serious. The third category is someone who is a "[[Tinok Shenishba]]", which is a person who was raised in an environment that was assimilated or non-Jewish, and is not aware of the proper Jewish laws, or halacha. This person is not held accountable for his or her actions.
*''Pesha'' (deliberate sin; in modern Hebrew: crime) or ''Mered'' (lit.: rebellion) - An intentional sin; an action committed in deliberate defiance of God; ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H6588 (''פשע pesha', peh'shah'').  According to Strong it comes from the root (:H6586); rebellion, transgression, trespass.
*''Avon'' (lit.: iniquity) - This is a sin of lust or uncontrollable emotion. It is a sin done knowingly, but not done to defy God; ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H5771 (''avon, aw-vone'').  According to Strong it comes from the root (:H5753); meaning perversity, moral evil:--fault, iniquity, mischief.
*''Cheit'' - This is an unintentional sin, crime or fault. ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H2399 (''חַטָּא chate''). According to Strong it comes from the root ''khaw-taw'' (:H2398, H2403) meaning "to miss, to err from the mark (speaking of an archer), to sin, to stumble."

==States==
Judaism holds that no human being is perfect, and all people have sinned many times. The [[Talmud]] says: "Everyone is responsible to be as great as [[Moses]]", But then the [[Torah]] tells us in [[Deuteronomy]] 34:10 that "No one will ever be as great as Moses". This is to clarify that [[Moses]] fulfilled his own personal potential, so too we are expected to fulfill ours. Each person is born with a unique set of talents and tools. Some are rich, others are poor. Some are tall and some are short. One person can sing, another can write, etc. But these qualities are not what determine your greatness. Rather, it's how you deal with your particular circumstances. That's why Judaism says: It's not important where you are on the ladder, but how many rungs you've climbed. The crucial concept is the effort.&lt;ref name="As Great as Moses"&gt;[http://www.aish.com/atr/As_Great_as_Moses.html As Great as Moses]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is told of [[Zusha of Hanipol|Zusha]], the great [[Chassidic]] master, who lay crying on his deathbed. His students asked him, "Rebbe, why are you so sad? After all the mitzvahs and good deeds you have done, you will surely get a great reward in heaven!". "I'm afraid!" said Zusha. "Because when I get to heaven, I know God's not going to ask me 'Why weren't you more like Moses?' or 'Why weren't you more like King David?' But I'm afraid that God will ask 'Zusha, why weren't you more like Zusha?' And then what will I say?!" &lt;ref name="As Great as Moses"/&gt;

[[Joseph Hertz]] said that sin is not an evil power whose chains the children of flesh must helplessly drag towards a weary tomb. We can always shake off its yoke; and what is more, we need never assume its yoke. An ancient fable tells us of distant oceans with mountainous magnetic rocks of such terrific power that wreck and ruin would befall any ship venturing near them. Instantly the iron nails would fly out of the ship, bolts and fastenings would be torn away by that magnetic force, the vessel would become nothing more than so many planks of wood, and all on board fall a prey to the hungry waters. Sins there are that, likewise, unhinge all our stays of character, rob us of the restraints of past habits and education, and leave us helpless playthings on the billows of temptation and passion. Yet a man is the pilot of his life’s barque, and can at all times steer it so as never to come near those mountains of destruction, darkness, and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the views of [[Rabbeinu Tam]] in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (tractate Rosh HaShanah 17b), God is said to have [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy]]:

# God is merciful before someone sins, even though God knows that a person is capable of sin. 
# God is merciful to a sinner even after the person has sinned. 
# God represents the power to be merciful even in areas that a human would not expect or deserve. 
# God is compassionate, and eases the punishment of the guilty. 
# God is gracious even to those who are not deserving. 
# God is slow to anger. 
# God is abundant in kindness. 
# God is the God of truth, thus we can count on God's promises to forgive repentant sinners. 
# God guarantees kindness to future generations, as the deeds of the righteous patriarchs ([[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]) have benefits to all their descendants. 
# God forgives intentional sins if the sinner repents. 
# God forgives a deliberate angering of Him if the sinner repents. 
# God forgives sins that are committed in error. 
# God wipes away the sins from those who repent.

As Jews are commanded in ''[[imitatio Dei]]'', emulating God, [[rabbi]]s take these attributes into account in deciding [[Halakha|Jewish law]] and its contemporary application.

==Role of orthopraxy==
Jews recognize two kinds of sin, offenses against other people, and offenses against God. Offenses against God may be understood as violation of a contract (the covenant between God and the Children of Israel). Since the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], Jews have believed that [[orthopraxy|right action]] (as opposed to [[orthodoxy|right belief]]) is the way for a person to atone for one's sins. [[Midrash]] ''Avot de Rabbi Natan'' states the following:

:One time, when Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai was walking in Jerusalem with Rabbi Yehosua, they arrived at where the Temple now stood in ruins. "Woe to us" cried Rabbi Yehosua, "for this house where atonement was made for Israel's sins now lies in ruins!" Answered Rabban Yochanan, "We have another, equally important source of atonement, the practice of ''gemilut hasadim'' ("loving kindness"), as it is stated "I desire loving kindness and not sacrifice" ([http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=16160&amp;showrashi=true Hosea 6:6]).

In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take.  It does not teach that choosing good is impossible - only at times more difficult.  There is almost always a "way back" if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)

==Sins between man and his fellow==
Sins between people are considered much more severe in [[Judaism]] than sins between man and God. [[Yom Kippur]], the main day of repent in [[Judaism]] can atones for [[Sins between man and God(Judaism)|Sins between man and God]], but not for [[Sins between man and his fellow(Judaism)|Sins between man and his fellow]], that is until he has appeased his friend.([[Mishnah]], [[Yoma]],8:9).&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks.org"/&gt; [[Eleazar ben Azariah]] derived [this from the verse]: "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" ([[Book of Leviticus]],16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thetorah.com"/&gt;

The [[Gemara]] (87a) continues: "R. Yitzchak said: Whoever aggravates his fellow even through words is required to placate him… R. Yosi bar Chanina said: Whoever beseeches forgiveness from his friend should not beseech him more than three times.  And if he died, [the offender] brings ten people and must stand them by his grave and he says, "I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and so-and-so whom I wounded.""

==Many small sins vs. One big sin==
Two Jews came to a Chassidic Rabbi to ask advice about sins they had committed. One had committed a great sin for which he was sure God would never forgive him; the other was less worried, because he had never been guilty of anything so grave, but only of the normal collection of lesser sins. The Rabbi told them to go out to a field and select stones corresponding to the size and number of their sins, and later to return to the field and scatter the stones. This done, they came back to the Rabbi. “Now go to the field once more,” he told them both, “pick up the stones you scattered, and bring them to me.”

He who had committed the one big sin knew at once which was his stone, and brought it to the Rabbi. The other, however, had scattered so many little stones that he could not be certain of identifying them again. He had a most difficult time in finding his stones and bringing them to the Rabbi. The Rabbi then told them: “Your deeds are like your stones. You who brought one large stone, committed a grave sin. But you were conscious of what you had done, and with a determined effort at repentance you could be forgiven by God. But you, whose sins were many and small, like those of most human beings, have found how hard it is to catch up with one’s minor lapses. And no repentance of yours can possibly be effective until you realise that small things matter.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selflessness vs. selfishness==
{{See also|Golden mean (Judaism)}}
The rabbis recognize a positive value to the ''[[yetzer hara]]'': one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was "very good" (God's work on the preceding days was just described as "good") and explain that without the ''yetzer ha'ra'' there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that ''yetzer ha'tov'' and ''yetzer ha'ra'' are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.

Or as [[Hillel the Elder]] famously summarized the Jewish philosophy:
:"If I am not for myself, who will be for me?
:And if I am only for myself, what am I?
:And if not now, [then] when?"

Another explanation is, without the existence of the ''yetzer ha'ra'', there would be no merit earned in following God's commandments; choice is only meaningful if there has indeed been a choice made. So whereas creation was "good" before, it became "very good" when the evil inclination was added, for then it became possible to truly say that man could make a true choice to obey God's "mitzvot" (commandments). This is because Judaism views the following of God's ways as a desirable end in and of itself rather than a means to an end.

==Value of repentance==
{{See also|Repentance in Judaism}}
The Babylonian Talmud teaches that "Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Eleazar both explain that as long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel, but now, one's table atones [when the poor are invited as guests]." (Tractate Berachot, 55a.)

Repentance in itself is also a means of atonement (See [[Ezekiel]] 33:11, 33:19, [[Jeremiah]] 36:3, etc.) The Hebrew word for repentance is ''teshuvah'' which literally means to "return (to God)." The prophet Hosea (14:3) said, "Take with you words, and return to God."

Judaism teaches that our personal relationship with God allows us to turn directly to Him at any time, as [[Malachi]] 3:7 says, "Return to Me and I shall return to you," and Ezekiel 18:27, "When the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive." Additionally, God is extremely compassionate and forgiving as is indicated in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 9:18, "We do not present our supplications before You because of our righteousness, but because of Your abundant mercy."

The [[siddur|traditional liturgy]] of the ''Days of Awe'' (the [[High Holy Days]]; i.e. [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]) states that [[prayer]], repentance and tzedakah (charitable actions) are ways to repent for sin. In Judaism, sins committed against people (rather than against God or in the heart) must first be corrected and put right to the best of a person's ability; a sin which has not also been put right as best as possible cannot truly be said to be repented.

===True repentance===
To a man who says “I will sin and repent, I will sin and repent,” the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]] brings no forgiveness. For sins against God the Day of Atonement brings forgiveness; for sins against one’s fellowman, the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness till he has become reconciled with the fellowman he wronged (Mishnah Yoma 8:9).

According to [[Maimonides]] in order to achieve true repentance the sinner must abandon his sin and remove it from his thoughts and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, “Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts” (Isaiah 55:7). Likewise must he regret the past, as it is said: “Surely after I turned I repented” (Jer. 31:18). He must also call Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atonement in the Temple period===
{{See also|Repentance in Judaism|Korban}}
Atonement for sins is discussed in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], known to Christians as the [[Old Testament]]. Rituals for atonement occurred in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and were performed by the ''[[Kohen|Kohanim]]'', the Israelite priests. These services included song, prayer, offerings and animal [[sacrifice]]s known as the ''[[korbanot]]''. The rites for [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, are prescribed in the book of [[Leviticus]] chapter 16. The ritual of the [[scapegoat]], sent into the wilderness to be claimed by [[Azazel]], was one of these observances (Lev. 16:20-22).

===Liturgical norms===
The liturgy of the Days of Awe (the High Holy Days; i.e. [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]) states that prayer, repentance and [[tzedakah]] (the dutiful giving of charity) atone for sin. But prayer cannot atone for wrongs done, without an honest sincere attempt to rectify any wrong done to the best of one's ability, and the sincere intention to avoid repetition. Atonement to Jews means to repent and set aside, and the word "T'shuvah" used for atonement actually means "to return". Judaism is optimistic in that it always sees a way that a determined person may return to what is good, and that God waits for that day too.

A number of animal sacrifices were prescribed in the [[Torah]] (five books of Moses) to make atonement: a [[sin-offering]] for sins, and a [[guilt offering]] for religious trespasses. The significance of animal sacrifice is not expanded on at length in the Torah, though [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:4 and [[Leviticus]] 17 suggest that blood and vitality were linked. Conservative Jews and Christians argue at the present era that the Jews never believed that the aim of all sacrifice is to pay the debt for sins - only the [[sin offering]] and the [[guilt offering]] had this purpose; modern scholars of early Jewish history, however, often disagree and argue that this division came later.

Later Biblical [[prophet]]s occasionally make statements to the effect that the hearts of the people were more important than their sacrifices - "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams" (I Samuel 15:22); "For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgement of God rather than burnt offerings" ([[Hosea]] 6:6); "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart" (Psalm 51:17) (see also [[Isaiah]] 1:11, Psalm 40:6-8).

Although the animal sacrifices were prescribed for atonement, there is no place where the Hebrew Bible says that animal sacrifice is the ''only'' means of atonement. Hebrew Bible teaches that it is possible to return to God through repentance and prayer alone. For example, in the books of Jonah and Esther, both Jews and gentiles repented, prayed to God and were forgiven for their sins, without having offered any sacrifices.&lt;ref name="englishhandbook" /&gt; Additionally, in modern times, most Jews do not even consider animal sacrifices.

On the High Holy Days of [[Rosh Hashana]], [[Yom Kippur]] - also known as the Day of Atonement-, and the ten-day period between these holidays, repentance of sins committed is based on specialized prayers and hymns, while some Jews continue the ancient methods of sacrifice.  An example of a common method of "sacrificing" for the sake of repentance is simply to drop bread into a body of water (as in the ceremony of [[Tashlikh]]), to signify the passing of sins and the hope for one to be written into the Book of Life by God once again. This is especially emphasized on what is arguably the holiest Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur.

The '''Klondike Big Inch Land''' promotion was a  [[marketing]] promotion run by the [[Quaker Oats Company]] in 1955 and created by Bruce Baker, a Chicago advertising executive.

== Inception ==
Quaker Oats bought 19.11 acres of land in the [[Yukon Territory]] of [[Canada]] for the price of $1000 USD and printed up 21 million deeds for one square inch of land.  On advice of counsel, Quaker Oats set up and transferred the land to the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company to make the company the registered owner and manager of the deeds.

Starting on January 1955, 93 newspapers across the United States ran advertisements that read "Get a real deed to one square inch of land in the Yukon gold rush country" and, "You'll actually own one square inch of Yukon land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Folks still make claims in Sgt. Preston's Yukon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19860920&amp;id=tlkiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XqgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1066,5068721|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=1986-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion was tied to the ''[[Challenge of the Yukon|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' radio show which Quaker Oats was sponsoring at the time.

== Obtaining Deeds ==
The promotion instructed people to mail a form along with a box top from either Quaker Puffed Wheat, Quaker Puffed Rice or Muffets Shredded Wheat to the Quaker Oats company.  In turn, a 5 by 8 inch deed to one square inch of land in the Klondike was sent back.  In February 1955, Quaker Oats was blocked from trading the deed for a box top by the Ohio Securities Division until it received a state license for the "sale" of foreign land.&lt;ref name="Akron Beacon"&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Mark J.|title=Local history: Quaker Oats prize creates Yukon land rush in 1955|url=http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/history/local-history-quaker-oats-prize-creates-yukon-land-rush-in-1955-1.257639|publisher=Akron Beacon Journal Online|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get around the injunction, the company stopped the trade-in offer and instead put one of the deeds in each box of cereal produced.

Since none of the deeds were actually registered, the documents were never legally binding and owners of these deeds were never actual owners of any land.  The deed excluded mineral rights on the property.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1955 Quaker Oats" /&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}

== Afterwards ==
Due to $37.20 in back taxes, the land was repossessed by the Canadian government in 1965, and the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company dissolved in 1966.  The land is now part of the [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]] Golf Course.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1955 Quaker Oats"&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Vincent|title=1955 Quaker Oats Yukon Land Giveaway: Deeds on "eBay"|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/1955-quaker-oats-yukon-land-giveaway-deeds-ebay-2889211.html?cat=27|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217032350/http://voices.yahoo.com/1955-quaker-oats-yukon-land-giveaway-deeds-ebay-2889211.html?cat=27|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}

To this day, Yukon officials receive letters and phone calls about the deeds. The land office of the Yukon currently contains an 18-inch thick file folder of correspondence regarding the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Klondike Big Inch|url=http://www.yukoninfo.com/klondikebiginch.htm|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Caricature''''' was a satirical weekly published French periodical that was distributed in Paris between 1830 and 1843 during the [[July Monarchy]].  Its cartoons repeatedly attacked King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], whom it typically depicted as a pear.

==History==
[[File:Caricature Charles Philipon pear.jpg|thumb|The famous cartoon of Louis Philippe as a pear, drawn by [[Honoré Daumier]] after the sketch by [[Charles Philipon]] and published in ''La Caricature'' in 1831]]
''La Caricature morale, politique et littéraire'' was published from 1830 to 1843.  Auguste Audibert was editor and [[Charles Philipon]] (1800–61) was director and main author.{{sfn|La Caricature ... Gallica}} Honoré de Balzac and Louis Desnoyers assisted Philipon in writing some of the magazines issues. Primary artists were Honoré Daumier and Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville with caricature contributions from many artists including  Henry Monnier, Alexandre Decamps, Auguste Raffet, Paul Gavarni, Achille Devéria, Auguste Desperret, Eugène Forest, Benjamin Roubaud. The journal was founded after the censorship laws had been relaxed following the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 in which Louis Philippe came to power. It covered both politics and art. 251 issues appeared between 1830 and 1835, each of four pages, with two or three lithographs.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}}

Philipon was the owner of the largest printing house in Paris equipped with lithographic presses, and used them to print ''La Caricature'' and ''[[Le Charivari]]'', another illustrated paper. He drew together a group of skilled artists who mostly worked for these two papers, through which they attacked the king and the system of government with growing violence.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=3}} The major contributors were [[Honoré Daumier]] (1808–79) and [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville]] (1803–47), but there were many others.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}} For example, a caricature by [[Jules David]] appeared in ''La Caricature'' of 31 May 1831.  The king is depicted as an illusionist who uses the ''[[juste milieu]]'' and some ''poudre de non-intervention'' to make liberty and revolution vanish.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=75}}

In 1830–31 there were revolutionary uprisings in Italy. The Austrians intervened to suppress the revolts, and the French did nothing to prevent them. The Pope broke his promise to grant the rebels in the [[Papal States]] an amnesty. ''La Caricature'' published a cartoon that showed the Pope on his throne surrounded by corpses.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=75}} Similarly, Philipon published cartoons that associated the French government with that of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] when Russia suppressed a revolt in Poland. The fall of Warsaw was announced by [[Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta|Horace Sebastiani]], the French foreign minister, as "L'ordre règne à Varsovie" (Order reigns in Warsaw). The phrase was used as a caption for one of the cartoons.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=76}}

The journal became increasingly vocal in its opposition to Louis-Philippe, and was seized more than twelve times. The publishers were prosecuted, and Philipon was jailed for a year. In 1835 the government passed legislation that forced ''La Caricature'' to cease publication.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}} The journal began publication again in 1838 and continued until 1843.{{sfn|La Caricature ... Gallica}} Writing in 1840, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] talked of the "curious contest between the State and M. Philipon's little army."{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=3}} Thackery wrote,
{{quote|Half-a-dozen poor artists on the one side, and his Majesty Louis-Philippe, his august family, and the numberless [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] and supporters of his monarchy, on the other.... The King of the French suffered so much, his ministers were so mercilessly ridiculed, his family and his own remarkable figure drawn with such odious and grotesque resemblance, in fanciful attitudes, circumstances, and disguises, so ludicrously mean, and so often appropriate, that the King was obliged to descend into the lists and battle his ridiculous enemies in form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=4}} }}

Women Directors and Their Films. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first female graduate of the [[AFI Conservatory]], in 1973.

==Early life==
Leder was born in New York City in 1952, the daughter of Etyl, a classical pianist, and [[Paul Leder]], a director, producer, actor, writer, and editor of such films as ''[[My Friends Need Killing]], [[Attack of the Giant Horny Gorilla]],'' and ''[[Dismember Mama]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodesser|first=Claude|date=June 2000|title=Helmer: Leder Among Men|url=|journal=Daily Variety|volume=|pages=A4|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/78/Mimi-Leder.html|title=Mimi Leder Biography|website=filmreference.com|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leder was raised in Los Angeles, in a [[Jewish]] home. During childhood, her father, a low-budget independent filmmaker, introduced Mimi and her siblings to film production. Her father often dropped her off at the cinema to watch the latest films. Leder states that one of the first films that had an impact on her was [[Federico Fellini]]'s [[8½|8 1/2]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Having worked for the majority of her life in film gave her the skill and confidence to be the first woman accepted into the [[AFI Conservatory]]. She studied cinematography but enjoyed working with actors and telling stories.

==Film career==
Leder began her career as a script supervisor on a string of films, including ''Spawn of the Slithis'' (1978), ''Dummy'' (1979), ''The Boy Who Drank Too Much'' (1980), and ''A Long Way Home'' (1980), before moving on to the TV series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (1981). After making a short film, ''Short Order Dreams'', written and funded by her father Paul,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Mollie. Women Who Run the Show: How a Brilliant and Creative New Generation of Women Stormed Hollywood. New York: St. Martin's, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; she screened it for [[Steven Bochco]], creator of Hill Street Blues, and his friend [[Gregory Hoblit]] who hired her to direct an episode of ''[[L.A. Law]]''.

In 1988 Leder went on to direct episodes of ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]'',  ''[[The Bronx Zoo (TV series)|The Bronx Zoo]]'', ''[[Midnight Caller]]'', before getting hired to direct several episodes of ''[[China Beach]]'' (1988–91) for which she was nominated for four Emmys. She decided to make a few made-for-TV films, ''Woman with a Past'' (1992), ''House of Secrets'' (1993), and ''Baby Brokers'' (1994) before getting hired as one of the core directors for ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' (1994–2009). She made proficient use of her cinematography background and the Steadicam to create high energy scenes that moved around the corridors and rooms of the hospital. The show earned her Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series in 1995 and 1996. She returned to direct an episode of the series during its final season in 2009. She was receiving much attention and soon received a job offer from Steven Spielberg to direct the film ''[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]'' (1997), an action-adventure film that she has said she sees as a drama.&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, Mary G. Women Directors and Their Films. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Leder became one of only a handful of woman directors to break into the action genre,&lt;ref&gt;Tasker, Yvonne. Action and Adventure Cinema. London: Routledge, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and her assignment to this film generated much press about the opportunities for women directors in Hollywood. She studied trains and other visual effects to prepare herself for the film and is proud of the results.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Mollie. Women Who Run the Show: How a Brilliant and Creative New Generation of Women Stormed Hollywood. New York: St. Martin's, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing to work for [[DreamWorks]], she directed ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' (1998) and ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000) while simultaneously creating a personal love story about her parents, ''Sentimental Journey'' (1999). Leder went through a period after making ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' where she wasn’t being hired to direct any feature films.  This was due to the lack of success of the film.  Leder felt as though she had been put into a ‘movie jail’ by [[Hollywood]] for the lack of success that is associated with ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]''.  Leder also attributed this reaction from the industry to her being a female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Tobias|date=October 2015|title=Veteran TV Director Still Tries to Scale Film Barriers|url=|journal=New York Times|volume=|pages=C2|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with Leder’s already privileged position of being a filmmakers daughter, it is still hard for her to keep her footing in the largely male industry. Leder doesn’t like being called a ‘woman’ director, and instead prefers to simply be called a director. Despite her challenges with being a woman in film, Leder still integrates distinctly female perspectives into her directing style. She has changed the way that her characters interact with stereotypes in some of her films such as ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' so that female protagonists are stronger and shallow villains are deeper with interesting backstories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Leder envisions a future in film that is not only shaped and changed by technological advancements, but also by more female voices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Michael|date=November 1998|title=Mimi Leger: Director|url=|journal=Millimeter|volume=|pages=|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Leder has used her position to hire many women in times where not many women were being hired.  Some of the women that she has hired over the years have been [[Bethany Rooney]], [[Sharron Miller]], [[Diane Keaton]], and [[Michelle MacLaren]].  She tries to bring female directors onto shows that she produces as much as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rochlin|first=Margy|date=Spring 2018|title=For Mimi Leder, Persistence Pays Off|url=https://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1802-Spring-2018/DGA-Interview-Mimi-Leder.aspx|journal=Directors Guild of America Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leder’s dry spell of feature films after the release of ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' drove her to work even harder with her other pursuits in television and film executive producing.  She shot nine pilots and produced six series including ''The Beast'' (2001), ''[[John Doe (TV series)|John Doe]]'' (2002), ''[[Jonny Zero|Johnny Zero]]'' (2005), and ''[[Vanished]]'' (2006).  Leder also made many made-for-TV movies such as ''[[Thick as Thieves (TV series)|Thick as Thieves]]'' (2009), ''U.S. Attorney'' (2009), and ''Heavenly'' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;"Mimi Leder: Television Director, Producer." The Paley Center for Media: She Made It. Curator Ron Simon. The Paley Center for Media. Web. May 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 2015 Leder was brought on by HBO to direct a first-season episode of ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]]'' and was later hired as a co-showrunner.

Leder’s new feature film ''[[On the Basis of Sex]]'', the story of [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ruth Bader Ginsberg]]’s path to become a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court Justice]], will be released in December of 2018.  It will be Leder’s first feature film in 18 years. Leder felt a strong connection to the story portrayed due to Ginsberg’s constant struggle to be a female voice in a male dominated field and the similarities that she saw between it and the film industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Personal life==
Leder has one daughter, [[Hannah Leder|Hannah]], with her husband actor Gary Werntz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/director-mimi-leder-on-the-basis-of-sex|title=The Long Road from Pay It Forward to Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Inside Director Mimi Leder’s Return to the Big Screen|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|first=Nicole|last=Sperling|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leder is a self-proclaimed feminist and avid protester.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Moscot''' is a five-generation, American luxury [[eyewear]] brand, headquartered in [[New York City]], specializing in optical frames and sunglasses. It was founded in the [[Lower East Side]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] in 1915 by [[Hyman Moscot]], which makes it one of the oldest local businesses in New York City,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bondstreet.com/blog/nyc-oldest-businesses-still-standing|title=5 of NYC’s Oldest Businesses Still Standing {{!}} Bond Street|website=Stories on Bond Street|language=en-US|access-date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[List of oldest eyewear companies|21st oldest eyewear company in the world]] still operating today.

== History ==

=== Early years, 20th century ===
In 1899, when he was in his 20s, Belarusian immigrant Hyman Mushcot arrived in New York City through [[Ellis Island]], where his surname was shortened and changed to Moscot.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/culture/318460/wwhere-foresight-is-20-20-moscot-family-glasses-now-the-epitome-of-cool/|title=The 100-Year Vision of Moscot Eyewear|website=The Forward|access-date=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He settled down in [[Manhattan]]’s [[Lower East Side]] neighborhood, and having already worked in the optical business in his home country, he began selling ready-made eyeglasses from a wooden pushcart on [[Orchard Street (Manhattan)|Orchard Street]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/15/moscot-a-new-york-legend-turns-100.html|title=Moscot, A New York Legend, Turns 100|last=Jones|first=Justin|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke only Yiddish, and served the many immigrants that poured into the Lower East Side at the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Moscot Orchard St.jpg|left|thumb|262x262px|[[Hyman Moscot]] in front of the first Moscot shop on 94 Rivington St.]]
In 1910, Hyman married fellow immigrant Leba.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Five years later, with a family rapidly growing, he opened his first retail store at 94 [[Rivington Street]], filling its Windows with signs, posters, and drawings of giant eyes and glasses. (Because of this, some journalists have speculated that the shop, which sat close to the Williamsburg bridge, was [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]’s inspiration for the Doctor T. J. Eckleburg billboard in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', which the novelist was writing during the same years.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/13725/legendary-optical-shop-looks-to-the-future-02150/|title=Legendary Optical Shop Looks to the Future|website=The Forward|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sol Moscot.png|thumb|Sol Moscot sitting in a vintage Ford on Rivington Street in 1934]]
Hyman and Leba had six children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1925, at 15 years old, Hyman’s youngest son, Solomon, nicknamed “Sol,” took over the business, and in 1935, moved the shop to its location at 118 Orchard Street, where it would be located for nearly eight decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The bright yellow sign with giant, black-rimmed glasses that adorned its storefront became synonymous with the brand, the neighborhood, and downtown New York, and while most of New York’s historical businesses fell during the [[Great Depression]], the Moscots made it through the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sol’s son, Joel, began presiding over the House of Moscot in 1951.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Charming, dedicated, and devoted to his customers, Joel would manage Moscot for over fifty years‚ overseeing the Shop’s activities, while conveying the family’s values to his sons, who would soon become the fourth generation of Moscots to take the helm. The oldest, Harvey, graduated from Boston [[New England College of Optometry]] in 1986, and began working as a doctor at 118 Orchard.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The youngest, Kenny, entered the business in 1991 with a bachelor's degree in finance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1996, with father Joel still at the company, Moscot expanded, opening a second shop at 69 W. 14th Street, on the corner of [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], in downtown Manhattan, which remains the company’s flagship location.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 21st century ===
[[File:Moscot Brooklyn.png|thumb|272x272px|The Moscot shop in Brooklyn]]
After Joel Moscot retired in 2003,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the family company rebranded from Sol Moscot to Moscot. Together, the fourth generation Moscot siblings reinvented what was once a neighborhood optical shop into what is now a global brand.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

After the death of his brother in 2010, Harvey Moscot became president of the company. Due to gentrification in the Lower East Side, Moscot moved from 118 Orchard Street across Delancey Street to 108 Orchard Street where it remains today. The shop was eventually included in the [[Lower East Side Tenement Museum|Tenement Museum]]’s historical tour of the Lower East Side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tenement.org/blog/when-life-gives-you-lemons-sell-them-on-the-lower-east-side/|title=When Life Gives You Lemons, Sell them On the Lower East Side {{!}} Notes From The Tenement|website=www.tenement.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Moscot opened its third flagship store, this time in the [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]] neighborhood of Brooklyn, the façade of which is reminiscent of the family’s first shop at 94 Rivington Street.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moscot later opened shops in Seoul, South Korea, Tokyo, Japan, and London, England.

Harvey's son, Zack Moscot studied industrial and product design at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]] and began working full time at Moscot in 2013. He is now the company’s chief eyewear designer, representing the fifth generation Moscot to join the brand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smart-magazine.com/en/interview-zack-moscot&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eyewear ==
The frames, eyeglasses and sunglasses together, are categorized under the Moscot Originals and Moscot Spirit Collections. Materials vary from acetate to metal and beta-titanium.
[[File:CLIPTOSH Mannequin-Head 2015-web.png|thumb|Moscot's signature mannequin head]]
In the spring of 2008, the brand teamed up with fashion designer [[Chris Benz]] for a limited edition run of four special colors for its classic frame, the "Nebb"; only 200 were available, each numbered for supposed authenticity. The company has since engaged in eyewear collaborations with [[Simon Miller]], [[Myles Kennedy]], [[Tariq Trotter]] and [[Johan Lindeberg]] for BLK DNM.

== Artists and celebrities ==
[[File:Andy Warhol Miltzen 1977.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol wearing the Miltzen frames]]
Moscot is popularly known for its collaborations and association with many American artists and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/fashion/25POINTS.html|title=Glasses Make the Nerd|publisher=New York Times (Fashion &amp; Style section)|date=2007-01-25|access-date=March 12, 2009|first=David|last=Colman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Justin Theroux]], a longtime customer of the brand, has a frame named after him based on those his character wore in the 2001 movie ''[[Mulholland Drive]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/threadny/Moscot-Releases-Muhoulland-Drive--60942212.html|title=Moscot's Limited-Edition Mulholland Drive Frames|website=NBC New York|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Truman Capote Moscot.jpg|left|thumb|Truman Capote]]
In 2011, the company released a limit edition (only 350 pairs were available) of the [[Terry Richardson]] original frame, called “Terry”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/this-just-in-moscot-terry-richardson-glasses|title=This Just In: Moscot + Terry Richardson Glasses|last=Phili|first=Stelios|website=GQ|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a limited edition “Grunya” frame designed with the collaboration of [[The Roots]] frontman [[Tariq Trotter]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newyorktrendnyc.com/2014/12/18/moscot-tariq-black-thought-trotter-join-forces-in-eyewear-collaboration/|title=Moscot &amp; Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter Join Forces in Eyewear Collaboration|website=New York Trend Online|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johnny Depp]] made the “Lemtosh” frames famous back in 2004, when the psychological thriller movie [[Secret Window]] came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tokyo.elle.co.jp/en/ginza_omotesando/moscot|title=MOSCOT TOKYO|last=Ltd.|first=Hearst Fujingaho Co.,|website=ELLE ONLINE|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.it/trends/il-blog-delle-tendenze/2015/05/moscot-celebrity-100-anni|title=Gli occhiali Moscot di New York: le celeb li amano - Vogue.it|website=www.vogue.it|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/fashion/25POINTS.html|title=Glasses Make the Nerd|last=Colman|first=David|date=2007-01-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hilton, Oi Yoi Yoi.jpg|thumb|''Oi Yoi Yoi'', 1963, [[Tate Gallery]].]]

'''''Oi Yoi Yoi''''' is a 1963 oil painting by British painter [[Roger Hilton]].  Perhaps Hilton's best-known work, it is a free composition depicting a naked white woman.  The central figure is abstracted, with simple black outlines drawn in charcoal of a featureless face, breasts and pubic triangle, and upraised arms.  All four limbs are cut off at the edges of the frame.  The white body contrasts with bold segments of background colour in yellow and red, blue and black.  The work is inscribed on the back "Oi, yoi, yoi/Hilton/Dec 63".

According to Hilton, the painting was inspired by a drunken argument with his second wife, [[Rose Hilton]], who was dancing on a verandah, nude, shouting "oi yoi yoi", an expression of frustration or exasperation.  According to his wife, the argument took place in France in the summer of 1962, before they were married.  Hilton has rejected the suggestion that he took conscious inspiration from paintings of dancers and bathers by [[Cézanne]] or [[Matisse]], but admitted they were "probably subconsciously" important.

The painting was exhibited in the British Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1964.  It was also exhibited in a retrospective exhibition of Hilton's work at the [[Serpentine Gallery]] in 1974, along with a second version of the same subject, ''Dancing Woman'', which has as similar central figure but more muted background colours limited to blue, black and yellow.  ''Oi Yoi Yoi'' was purchased from the artist by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1974 through [[Waddington Galleries]], and is displayed at [[Tate Britain]] in London.  ''Dancing Woman'' was purchased by the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]] in Edinburgh in 1981.  Both works measure {{convert|60|in|cm}} by {{convert|50|in|cm}}.

The paintings have similarities with the [[Dancing Beijing]] logo for the [[2008 Beijing Olympic Games]], designed by [[Guo Chunning]], which was inspired by the Chinese character [[京 (disambiguation)|京]] (jīng, meaning "capital"), and also resembles a dancing figure with arms raised, or a runner crossing a finishing line.  Hilton also may have taken inspiration from a Chinese character.

[[File:Warrant_stating_the_occasion_2014-07-15_03-59.jpg|thumbnail|Warrant stating the occasion]]

The '''Paragon China''' Company was a [[United Kingdom|British]] manufacturer of [[bone china]] from 1919 to 1960, based in [[Longton, Staffordshire|Longton]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], previously known as the Star China Company, and more recently part of the [[Royal Doulton]] group. Paragon was noted for producing high quality [[teaware]] and [[tableware]], and was granted [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrants of appointment]] by several members of the [[British Royal Family]].

==History==
The Star China company was founded in 1897 as a [[partnership]] between Herbert Aynsley (great-grandson of the founder of [[Aynsley China]]) and Hugh Irving, trading until 1919, and using ''Paragon'' as a trade name from about 1900. In 1919, after Aynsley's retirement the company name was changed to Paragon China Company Limited. Irving's two sons subsequently became [[managing director]]s of the business.

In its early history the firm manufactured tea and breakfast wares, exporting to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. However, in the 1930s, Paragon expanded both its market, to include [[the Americas]], and its range of products to include [[dinnerware]]. Also at this time, Paragon began its move towards creating a smokeless factory, installing electric [[kiln]]s.

The 1960s saw the company change hands several times, owned for a while by T.C. Wild, then forming part of Allied English Potteries, then becoming part of Royal Doulton.

The Paragon name has been retained, mainly with designs based on traditional floral patterns. Unfortunately the early Paragon pattern books are presumed lost, however the royal commemorative designs are still sought by collectors.

==Royal warrants==
* 1926 - The [[Duchess of York]] ([[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]]) commissioned china for the nursery of Princess Elizabeth (now Queen [[Elizabeth II]]). This pattern is known as "Two for Joy", originating from the English number rhyme ''One for sorrow, Two for joy'' associated with [[magpie]]s, and the legend that two magpies were seen at the [[infant baptism|christening]] of Princess Elizabeth.

[[Image:Paragon China Budgies cup&amp;saucer.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cup and saucer commissioned to mark the birth of Princess Margaret]]
* 1930 - The Duchess of York commissioned a tea service to mark the birth of Princess Margaret Rose (later [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]]). This pattern also has two birds, as well as [[Argyranthemum|marguerite]] and [[rose]] flower designs, referring to the [[given name]]s of the princess.
* 1933 - Queen Mary grants a Royal Warrant of Appointment
* 1937 - King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth grants a royal warrant for the occasion of their coronation
* 1938 - Queen Elizabeth (the future Queen Mother) &amp; Queen Mary grants a Royal Warrant of Appointment
* 1953 - Queen Elizabeth II grants a Royal Warrant of Appointment

[[File:Liveaudioequip.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A portable setup of various live audio production and recording equipment]]

'''Professional audio''', abbreviated as '''pro audio''', refers to both an activity and a category of high quality, studio-grade audio equipment. Typically it encompasses [[sound recording]], [[sound reinforcement system]] setup and [[audio mixing]], and [[music producer|studio music production]] by trained [[sound engineer]]s, [[audio engineer]]s, [[record producer]]s, and audio technicians who work in [[live event support]] and recording using [[audio mixer]]s, recording equipment and sound reinforcement systems. In contrast, [[consumer electronics|consumer audio]] equipment is a lower grade of gear which is used by regular people for the reproduction of sound in a private home on a [[home stereo]] or [[home cinema]] system.

Professional audio can include, but is not limited to [[broadcast radio]], [[audio mastering]] in a [[recording studio]], [[television studio]], and [[sound reinforcement]] such as a live concert, [[DJ]] performances, [[Sampling (music)|audio sampling]], [[public address]] system set up, [[surround sound]] design in [[movie theatre]]s, and design and setup of [[piped music]] in hotels and restaurants. Professional audio equipment is sold at [[professional audio store]]s and [[music store]]s. While [[consumer electronics]] stores sell some of the same categories of equipment (e.g., [[power amplifier]]s and [[subwoofer]] cabinets), the equipment that consumer stores sells is a lower consumer-grade type of equipment, which does not meet the standards for low noise and low [[distortion (music)|distortion]] that are required in pro audio applications.

==Definition==
The term ''professional audio'' has no precise definition, but it typically includes:
* Operations carried out by trained [[audio engineers]]
* The capturing of sound with one or more [[microphone]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Alten | first=S.R. | title=Audio in Media | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-285-67529-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Balancing, mixing and adjusting sound signals from [[multitrack recording]] devices using a [[mixing console]]
* The control of audio levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Reinhardt | first=R. | last2=Dowd | first2=S. | title=Adobe Flash CS3 Professional Bible | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | series=Bible | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-470-11937-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQs0sJ0NLDsC&amp;pg=PA1165 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; using standardised types of metering
* Sound signals passing through lengthy [[airchain|signal chain]]s involving processes at different times and places, involving a variety of skills
* Compliance with organisational, national and international practices and standards established by such bodies as the [[International Telecommunication Union]], [[Audio Engineering Society]] and [[European Broadcasting Union]]
* Setting up or designing sound reinforcement systems or recording studios.
==Equipment==
Compared to consumer-grade audio equipment, professional audio equipment tends to have such characteristics as:
* Greater mechanical robustness and reliability
* Many more options for "tweakability" and modification than typical consumer grade equipment. For example, whereas a typical home audio grade active subwoofer may have a factory set-[[audio crossover]] to determine at which point the audio signal will be routed to the subwoofer and a factory preset phase control and equalizer setting, pro audio active subwoofers (with built-in amplifiers and electronics) may offer adjustable crossover points, user-selectable phase control and equalizer controls{{efn|Some expensive, high-end [[hi-fi]] active subwoofers also offer "tweakability" and user controls, but the low-priced active subs sold at [[Big box]] [[consumer electronics]] stores do not usually include these features.}}
* Heavy-duty industrial-grade connectors, e.g. [[XLR connector|XLR]] balanced audio cables (for audio signals) rather than unbalanced cables and [[Speakon]] speaker connectors, rather than 1/4" speaker jacks
* Designed for touring and transportation. This includes the use of [[19-inch rack]]-mount devices for electronic [[effects unit]]s and [[power amplifier]]s, the provision of handles and/or dolly wheels on heavy equipment to facilitate moving gear onstage (large [[speaker enclosure]] cabinets for [[subwoofer]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]] main speakers typically have handles and wheels)
* [[Balanced audio]] interfaces (XLR) for lower noise and hum
* Higher [[analog audio]] signal levels of 0 [[decibel|dBu]] or more&lt;ref name="“books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=professional+audio+equipment+characteristics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1iWT0zIa5p&amp;sig=FLVzefRE9IQZi2or8bZnWP42rwg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OnE6VfGIGYmoNon_gcAG&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=professional%20audio%20equipment%20characteristics&amp;f=false/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AES3|AES/EBU]] [[digital audio]] interfaces
* Lower-noise audio equipment with less [[Total Harmonic Distortion]]

The [[broadcast quality]] of professional audio equipment is on a par with that of consumer [[high-end audio]] and [[hi-fi]] equipment, but is more likely to be designed purely on sound engineering principles and owes little to the consumer-oriented [[audiophile]] sub-culture.&lt;ref name=perlman1&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Reapers Resting in a Wheat Field''''' is a late 19th century painting by American [[Impressionism|impressionist]] [[John Singer Sargent]]. Done in oil on canvas, the painting a scene set in a wheat field near the village of [[Broadway, Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/12162|title=Reapers Resting in a Wheat Field |website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting depicts a group of English wheat farmers resting in their field during harvest. The titular reapers are seated in a semicircle, with their [[Sickle|sickles]] stuck in the ground. As is evident by the stacks of wheat in the field, the harvest is well underway. The sky in the background is slightly overcast, while a brace of trees provides a stark, green backdrop that contrasts the yellow field of wheat. Aspects of the painting consist of long, wavy brushstrokes, a style in tune with Sagent's impressionist proclivities.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/sargent/paintings/29.html|title=“Reapers Resting in a Wheat Field” by John Singer Sargent |website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sargent spent the fall of 1885 in the [[Cotswolds]] of [[Southern England]], where the image was painted.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

'''''Seed of Chucky''''' is a 2004 American [[comedy film|comedy]] [[slasher film]], the fifth installment of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' series]], and sequel to 1998's ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' as well as the first film to be distributed by another company since ''Child's Play''. The film was written and directed by [[Don Mancini]], who created the series and has written all of the films. With this entry, Mancini made his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. The film is set six years after ''[[Child's Play 3]]'' and ''Bride of Chucky'' and follows a young doll named Glen, the son of [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] and [[Tiffany (Child's Play)|Tiffany]], resurrecting his parents, causing chaos.

The film, shot in [[Romania]], continues the series' evolution from the pure horror genre of the first movie to a hybrid horror-comedy.&lt;ref name="WPF 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cult of Chucky a fine fit in popular slasher series | website=Winnipeg Free Press | date=October 7, 2017 | url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/movies/cult-of-chucky-a-fine-fit-in-popular-slasher-series-449782683.html | access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dunkley | first=Cathy | last2=Dunkley | first2=Cathy | title=Redman, Waters go to ‘Seed’ | website=Variety | date=March 16, 2004 | url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/redman-waters-go-to-seed-1117901763/ | access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last ''Child's Play'' film to be released in theaters, with all future installments to be released [[direct to DVD]]. The film was followed by another sequel, ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'', released on home video and [[Netflix]] in 2013.

== Plot ==
Six years after [[Bride of Chucky|the previous film]], Glen, the benevolent son of Chucky and Tiffany, has a nightmare in which he murders a little girl's parents. In reality, he is living a life of embarrassment and abuse as a ventriloquist's [[ventriloquism#Ventriloquist's dummy|dummy]]. After being forced to perform, and then locked inside a cage, Glen sees Chucky and Tiffany on television and realizes that he is their son. 

Desperate to know his parents, Glen manages to escape his abusive owner and tracks Chucky and Tiffany to [[Hollywood]]. He finds himself in the prop room of [[Jennifer Tilly]]'s horror film, which includes the Chucky and Tiffany dolls. Glen uses the Heart of Damballa, a [[Haitian Vodou#Myths and misconceptions|voodoo]] amulet to bring them back to life. Chucky faints, but Tiffany is overjoyed and hugs her child. When a puppeteer starts taking Tiffany apart, she and Chucky decapitate him with a piano wire. Jennifer finds the beheaded body and calls the police. Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen ride home with her in a limousine. 

Having witnessed his parents kill the puppeteer, Glen asks them why they murder others, as he feels violence is bad. Chucky replies that it helps them to relax. On the other hand, Tiffany, feeling parental responsibility, agrees with Glen and forces Chucky to agree to stop killing people for the sake of their son. Chucky promises to do so, but crosses his fingers behind his back in hopes of getting Tiffany to shut up. 

Jennifer tries to get a role as the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] in [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]'s directorial debut, and after he tells her she is not right for the part, she invites him to her house. Chucky and Tiffany make plans to transfer their souls into Redman and Jennifer. As Jennifer and Redman start to make love, Tiffany knocks them out and uses a turkey baster to [[Insemination|inseminate]] Jennifer with Chucky's semen. 

Chucky takes Glen on a car ride. After driving [[Britney Spears]]' car off the road, killing her, they proceed to photographer Pete Peters' darkroom. Peters had taken pictures of Tilly kissing Redman and of Chucky masturbating. When Glen tries to warn Peters that Chucky is about to attack, Peters bump into a shelf, causing a jar of sulphuric acid to fall into his head, accidentally killing him. Chucky, overjoyed with pride, believes Glen did this on purpose and takes a picture to celebrate, much to the dismay of both Glen and Tiffany. 

Jennifer awakens the following morning, realizes that she is pregnant, and claims Redman is responsible. When he denies this, Tiffany kills him in anger. The next day, Jennifer wakes up only to find herself with a full pregnant belly, a consequence of the voodoo magic. Chucky attacks and captures Jennifer during a phone call. Her chauffeur, Stan, serving as Chucky's replacement body due to Redman's death, is also captured. Jennifer's assistant Joan tries to help her, but she is killed by Glen's murderous twin sister, Glenda, whose soul shares Glen's body. Tiffany discovers this and smacks Glenda to bring back Glen, who is horrified at what has happened. 

After Jennifer gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl, Chucky has an epiphany: after years as an infamous killer doll, he finally accepts his circumstances. Disgusted, Tiffany rejects Chucky and decides to take Glen with her. Enraged, Chucky throws a knife at Jennifer to stop Tiffany transferring her soul into her body and leaving him, but Stan jumps in the way to save her and tells Jennifer he loves her before dying. The police arrive, forcing the dolls to flee. Jennifer is rushed to the hospital, but claims she wants to see her babies. Tiffany drugs Jennifer and begins to possess her, but Chucky breaks in and kills Tiffany with an axe. Before Tiffany dies, she tells Glen not to make the same mistakes she and Chucky have. Devastated, Glen snaps and challenges Chucky to a fight. Jennifer passes Chucky's axe to Glen, and Glen impales Chucky. Chucky assumes it's Glenda again, but Glen reveals it is actually him, finally able to kill in revenge for his mother's death. He dismembers Chucky and suffers an emotional breakdown after killing him.

Five years later, at a birthday party for Jennifer's children, a nanny quits her job because Jennifer's daughter Glenda scares her. Jennifer lets the nanny quit, only to beat her to death with the Tiffany doll. Jennifer's eyes glow green, revealing that Tiffany was successful in transferring her soul into Jennifer's body. Glen has one more birthday present to open. When he does so, Chucky's severed arm springs up to grab him, and his infamous laugh is heard as the screen fades to black.

{{about|the literary device|the prewriting technique|Free writing}}

In [[literary criticism]], '''stream of consciousness''' is a [[narrative mode]] or method that attempts to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books,1984), pp. 660-1).&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[William James]] in 1890 in his ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', and in 1918 the novelist [[May Sinclair]] (1863–1946) first applied the term stream of consciousness, in a literary context, when discussing [[Dorothy Richardson]]'s (1873–1957) novels. ''[[Pointed Roofs]]'' (1915), the first work in Richardson's [[novel sequence|series]] of 13 semi-autobiographical novels titled ''[[Pilgrimage (novel sequence)|Pilgrimage]]'',&lt;ref name="Winning2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEz_3E-SnA0C|title=The Pilgrimage of Dorothy Richardson|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-299-17034-9|author=Joanne Winning}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first complete stream of consciousness novel published in English. However, in 1934, Richardson comments that "[[Proust]], [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]] &amp; D.R. ... were all using 'the new method', though very differently, simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to the bookseller and publisher [[Sylvia Beach]] ''Windows of Modernism: Selected Letters of Dorothy Richardson, ed. Gloria G. Fromm Athens, Georgia, University of Georgia Press, 1995, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, many earlier precursors and the technique is still used by contemporary writers.

==Definition==
Stream of consciousness is a [[narrative device]] that attempts to give the written equivalent of the character's [[thought process]]es, either in a loose interior monologue (see below), or in connection to his or her actions.  Stream of consciousness writing is usually regarded as a special form of interior monologue and is characterized by associative leaps in thought and lack of some or all punctuation.&lt;ref&gt;For example, both [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]] and [[James Joyce|Joyce]] omitted full stops and paragraph breaks, but while Joyce also omitted apostrophes, Beckett left them in.&lt;/ref&gt; Stream of consciousness and interior monologue are distinguished from [[dramatic monologue]] and [[soliloquy]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person, which are chiefly used in [[poetry]] or [[drama]]. In stream of consciousness the speaker's thought processes are more often depicted as overheard in the mind (or addressed to oneself); it is primarily a [[fictional device]].
The term "stream of consciousness" was coined by [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]] [[William James]] in  ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890):
{{quote|consciousness, then, does not appear to itself as chopped up in bits ... it is nothing joined; it flows. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. {{em|In talking of it hereafter, let's call it the stream of thought, consciousness, or subjective life.}}&lt;ref&gt;(I, pp.239-43) quoted in Randall Stevenson, ''Modernist Fiction: An Introduction''. (Lexington, Kentucky: University of Kentucky, 1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:UlyssesCover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (first edition, 1922), considered a prime example of stream of consciousness writing styles.]]
In the following example of stream of consciousness from James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Molly seeks sleep:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interior monologue==
{{See also|Internal monologue}}

While many sources use the terms stream of consciousness and interior monologue as synonyms, the ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'' suggests, that "they can also be distinguished psychologically and literarily. In a psychological sense, stream of consciousness is the subject‐matter, while interior monologue is the technique for presenting it". And for literature, "while an interior monologue always presents a character's thoughts 'directly', without the apparent intervention of a summarizing and selecting narrator, it does not necessarily mingle them with impressions and perceptions, nor does it necessarily violate the norms of grammar, or logic- but the stream‐of‐consciousness technique also does one or both of these things."&lt;ref&gt;ed. Chris Baldick, Oxford: Oxford U.P.,  2009, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', while agreeing that these terms are "often used interchangeably", suggests, that "while an interior monologue may mirror all the half thoughts, impressions, and associations that impinge upon the character's consciousness, it may also be restricted to an organized presentation of that character's rational thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/290310/interior-monologue "interior monologue." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 24 Sep. 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Beginnings to 1900===
While the use of the narrative technique of stream of consciousness is usually associated with modernist novelists in the first part of the twentieth-century, a number of precursors have been suggested, including [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[psychological novel]] ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' (1757).&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984), p. 661; see also Robert Humphrey, ''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (1954). University of California Press, 1972, fn. 13, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" (1843) foreshadows this literary technique in the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1785800/The-Tell-Tale-Heart|title=The Tell-Tale Heart - story by Poe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's story is a [[first person narrative]], told by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of his sanity, while describing a murder he committed. and it is often read as a [[dramatic monologue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eapoe.org/index.htm|title=Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore - The Life and Writings of Edgar Allan Poe|website=www.eapoe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; George R. Clay notes that [[Leo Tolstoy]] "when the occasion requires it ... applies Modernist stream of consciousness technique" in both ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1869) and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1878).&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy'', edited Donna Tussing Orwin. Cambridge University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
The short story "[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]" (1890) by another American author, [[Ambrose Bierce]], also  abandons strict linear time to record the internal consciousness of the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Khanom, Afruza. "Silence as Literary Device in Ambrose Bierce's 'The Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.' ''Teaching American Literature: A Journal of Theory and Practice.'' Spring 6.1 (2013): 45-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his renunciation of chronology in favor of free association, [[Édouard Dujardin]]'s ''[[Les Lauriers sont coupés]]'' (1887) is also an important precursor. Indeed, [[James Joyce]] "picked up a copy of Dujardin's novel ... in Paris in 1903" and "acknowledged a certain borrowing from it".&lt;ref&gt;Randell StevensonJ ''Modernist Fiction''. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992, p. 227, fn 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also those who point to [[Anton Chekhov]]'s short stories and plays (1881-1904)&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, "Ramblings". ''London Review of Books''. Vol.22, no. 11, 1 June 2000, pp. 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Knut Hamsun]]'s ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]'' (1890), and ''[[Mysteries (novel)|Mysteries]]'' (1892) as offering glimpses of the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative technique at the end of the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n23/wood02_.html James Wood. "Addicted to Unpredictability." November 26, 1998. ''London Review of Books''. November 8, 2008 ]&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Hunger'' is widely seen as a classic of world literature and a groundbreaking modernist novel, ''Mysteries'' is also considered a pioneer work. It has been claimed that Hamsun was way ahead of his time with the use of stream of consciousness in two chapters in particular of this novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamsunsenteret.no/en/component/author/page/107-hamsun's-modernism|title=Martin Humpál: Hamsun’s modernism - Hamsunsenteret - Hamsunsenteret|website=hamsunsenteret.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;[https://tv.nrk.no/serie/guddommelig-galskap-knut-hamsun/PRTR64006207/13-12-2009#t=19m59s Interview with Robert Ferguson in the second episode of the documentary television series ''Guddommelig galskap - Knut Hamsun'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; British author Robert Ferguson said: “There’s a lot of dreamlike aspects of ''Mysteries''. In that book ... it is ... two chapters, where he actually invents stream of consciousness writing, in the early 1890s. This was long before Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.” &lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; [[Henry James]] has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as ''[[Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that he influenced later stream of consciousness writers, including [[Virginia Woolf]], who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (March 2003)''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pn9OzR4AYdsC&amp;pg=PA40 A Writer's Diary: Being Extracts from the Diary of Virginia Woolf]''. Harcourt.  pp. 33, 39–40, 58, 86, 215, 301, 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has also been argued that [[Arthur Schnitzler]] (1862-1931), in his short story '"Leutnant Gustl" ("None but the Brave", 1900), was in fact the first to make full use of the stream of consciousness technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133295/stream-of-consciousness|title=stream of consciousness - literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Twentieth century===
But it is only in the twentieth-century that this technique is fully developed by modernists. [[Marcel Proust]] is often presented as an early example of a writer using the stream of consciousness technique in his novel sequence ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]'' (1913–1927) (''In Search of Lost Time''), but Robert Humphrey comments, that Proust "is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness" and, that he "was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of consciousness novel".&lt;ref&gt;''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles: University of California, 1954), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[John Cowper Powys]] also argues that Proust did not use stream of consciousness: "while we are told what the hero thinks or what Swann thinks we are told this rather by the author than either by the 'I' of the story or by Charles Swann."&lt;ref&gt;"Proust". ''Enjoyment of Literature'', New York: Simon and Schuster, , p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us go then, you and I,
 When the evening is spread out against the sky
 Like a patient etherized upon a table;
 Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
 The muttering retreats
 Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
 And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
 Streets that follow like a tedious argument
 Of insidious intent
 To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
 Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"
 Let us go and make our visit.

 In the room the women come and go
 Talking of Michelangelo.
&lt;/poem&gt;|source =T. S. Eliot, "The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock"&lt;br /&gt;1915}}

The term was first applied in a literary context in ''The Egoist'', April 1918, by [[May Sinclair]], in relation to the early volumes of [[Dorothy Richardson]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''Pilgrimage''. Richardson, however,  describes the term as an 'lamentably ill-chosen metaphor".&lt;ref&gt;"Novels", ''Life and Letters'', 56, March 1948, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Joyce]] was a major pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness. Some hints of this technique, are already present in ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916), along with [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Deming, p. 749.&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce began writing ''A Portrait'' in  1907 and it was first serialised in the English literary magazine ''[[The Egoist]]'' in 1914 and 1915. Earlier in 1906 Joyce, when working on ''Dubliners'', considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Serial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in March 1918. ''Ulysses'' was finally published in 1922. While ''Ulysses'' represents a major example of the use of stream of consciousness Joyce also uses "authorial description" and Free Indirect Style to register Bloom's inner thoughts. Furthermore the novel does not focus solely on  interior experiences: "Bloom  is constantly shown ''from'' all round; from inside as well as out; from a variety of points of view which range from the objective to the subjective".&lt;ref&gt;Randell Stevenson. ''A Reader's Guidw to the Twentieth-Century Novel in Britain''. University of Kentucky Press, 1993, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In his final work ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939) Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in, which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns.

Another early example is the use of [[interior monologue]] by [[T. S. Eliot]] in his poem "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" (1915), a [[dramatic monologue]] of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action,"&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Kathleen, and Harlan, Judith. ''English Literature From 1785'' (New York: HarperCollins, 1992), 265–66. {{ISBN|006467150X}}&lt;/ref&gt; a work probably influenced by the narrative poetry of [[Robert Browning]], including "[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]".&lt;ref&gt;William Harmon &amp; C. Holman, ''A Handbook to Literature'' (7th edition). (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1996), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1923 to 2000===

Prominent uses in the years that followed the publication of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', include [[Italo Svevo]], ''[[Zeno's Conscience|La coscienza di Zeno]]'' (1923),&lt;ref&gt;[untitled review], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/478649 Beno Weiss, ''Italica'', Vol. 67, No. 3 (Autumn, 1990), p. 395.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]], ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925), ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' (1927), and [[William Faulkner]] in ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Randell Stevenson suggests, that "interior monologue, rather than stream of consciousness, is the appropriate term for the style in which [subjective experience] is recorded, both in ''[[The Waves]]'' and in Woolf's writing generally.&lt;ref&gt;''Modernist Fiction''. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992, p. 55; ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout ''Mrs Dalloway'' Woolf blurs the distinction between [[Direct speech|direct]] and [[indirect speech]], freely alternating her [[Narrative mode|mode of narration]] between [[Third-person omniscient|omniscient description]], [[free indirect discourse|indirect]] [[interior monologue]], and [[soliloquy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dowling |first=David |title=Mrs Dalloway: Mapping Streams of Consciousness |page=46 |year=1991 |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=978-0-8057-9414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm Lowry]]'s novel ''[[Under the Volcano]]'' (1947) resembles ''Ulysses'', "both in its concentration almost entirely within a single day of [Its protagonist] Firmin's life ... and in the range of interior monologues and stream of consciousness employed to represent the minds of [the] characters".&lt;ref&gt;Randall Stevenson, pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Beckett]], a friend of James Joyce, uses interior monologue in novels like [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951), ''Malone meurt'' (1951; ''[[Malone Dies]]'') and ''L'innommable'' (1953: ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''). and the short story "[[From an Abandoned Work]]" (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Karine Germoni, '"From Joyce to Beckett: The Beckettian Dramatic Interior Monologue'". ''Journal of Beckett Studies'', Spring 2004, Vol. 13, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique continued to be used into the 1970s in a novel such as [[Robert Anton Wilson]]/[[Robert Shea]] collaborative ''[[Illuminatus!]]'' (1975),  with regard to which ''[[The Fortean Times]]'' warns readers, to "[b]e prepared for streams of consciousness in which not only identity but time and space no longer confine the narrative".&lt;ref&gt;''The Fortean Times'', issue 17 (August 1976), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish writer [[James Kelman]]'s novels are known for mixing stream of consciousness narrative with [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] vernacular. Examples include ''[[The Busconductor Hines]]'', ''[[A Disaffection]]'' and ''[[How Late It Was, How Late]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/minds-are-the-strangest-thing Giles Harvey, "Minds Are The Strangest Thing". ''The New Yorker'', May 20, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Salman Rushdie]] one critic comments, that "[a]ll Rushdie's novels follow an Indian/Islamic storytelling style, a stream-of-consciousness narrative told by a loquacious young Indian man".&lt;ref&gt;John C. Hawley, ''Encyclopedia Of Postcolonial Studies'' (Westport: Greenwood, 2001), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers who use this narrative device include [[Sylvia Plath]] in ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' (1963)&lt;ref&gt;''American Literature'', Vol. 65, No. 2, Jun. 1993, 
p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irvine Welsh]] in ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Keating, "Tales from the Other Side of the Track". ''Irish Times'' 3 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of consciousness continues to appear in contemporary literature. [[Dave Eggers]], author of ''[[A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius]]'' (2000), according to one reviewer, "talks much as he writes – a forceful stream of consciousness, thoughts sprouting in all directions".&lt;ref&gt;"The agony and the irony", Stephanie Merritt. ''The Observer'', Sunday 14 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist John Banville describes [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novel ''[[Amulet (novel)|Amulet]]'' (1999), as written in "a fevered stream of consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;"Amulet by Roberto Bolaño", John Banville. ''The Guardian'', Saturday 12 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century=== 
The twenty-first century brought further exploration, including [[Jonathan Safran Foer]]'s ''[[Everything is Illuminated]]'' (2002) and many of the short stories of American author [[Brendan Connell]].&lt;ref&gt;"A nine-year-old and 9/11", Tim Adams

The '''Syriac Bible of Paris''' ([[Paris]], [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], MS syr. 341) is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Bible]] written in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. It dates to 6th or 7th century.  It is believed to have been made in northern [[Mesopotamia]].  The manuscript has 246 extant [[Bookbinding|folio]]s. Large sections of text and the accompanying illustrations are missing.  The folios are 312 by 230 mm. For reasons of economy, the text is written in three columns.  

The illumination consists of miniatures introducing each of the books of the Bible and set into one or two of the text columns.  The miniature for the [[Book of Genesis]] which may have been the most sumptuous miniature is missing. Although most of the miniatures are full length author portraits,  some depict scenes from the following book. For example, the miniature before the [[Book of Job]] depicts [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]] on the dung heap.  This miniature combine several scenes from the Book of Job.  Job is pictured lying naked on the dung heap, covered with sores.  Below him his wife is talking to him.  To the left are his three friends.  One of them is seen rending his garments, while the other two are seated, and talking to him.  The [[Book of Exodus]] also has a narrative miniature before it.  It depicts [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]] requesting permission to depart from [[Pharaoh]].  It is hard to understand why this scene, rather than one of the many more popular scenes was chosen to be the sole illustration for Exodus. Other miniatures are allegorical groups. The miniature before the [[Book of Proverbs]] shows the [[Virgin and Child]],  flanked by [[King Solomon|Solomon]], representing the wisdom of the [[Old Testament]], and [[Christian Church|Ecclesia]], a personification of the [[Christian]] Church. Only one [[New Testament]] miniature survives, that of James the Apostle. The miniatures show mixture of [[Hellenistic]] heritage and a native Syriac tradition.  Some of the miniatures, especially the miniature before Exodus, show stylistic similarities to the miniatures in the [[Rabula Gospels]].   Based on this it is unlikely that this manuscript was made much later than the Rabula Gospels which were made in 586.

The manuscript is assumed to have come from the Episcopal library of [[Siirt]] near [[Lake Van]], where it may have been produced.  It has been in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] since 1909.

[[File:S Eustachio - teatro Argentina 1010120.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The facade of Teatro Argentina]]
[[File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical Fête - 1747.png|thumb|The Teatro Argentina ([[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], 1747, [[Musée du Louvre]])]]
The '''Teatro Argentina''' is an [[opera house]] and theatre located in [[Largo di Torre Argentina]], a square in [[Rome, Italy]]. One of the oldest theatres in Rome, it was constructed in 1731 and inaugurated on 31 January 1732&lt;ref name=PLANT&gt;Plantamura, 10&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[Berenice]]'' by [[Domenico Sarro]]. It is built over part of the curia section of the [[Theatre of Pompey]]. This curia was the location of the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]].

==History==
The house was commissioned by the Sforza-Cesarini family and designed by the architect [[Gerolamo Theodoli]] with the auditorium laid out in the traditional horseshoe shape. [[Duke Francesco Sforza-Cesarini]], who ran the Argentina Theatre from 1807 to 1815, was a "theatre fanatic" who continued until his death to run up debts.&lt;ref name=PLANT/&gt; [[Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' was given its premiere on 20 February 1816, just after Duke Francesco's death and, in the 19th century, the premieres of many notable operas took place in the theatre, including  [[Verdi]]'s ''[[I due Foscari]]'' on 3 November 1844 and ''[[La battaglia di Legnano]]'' on 27 January 1849.&lt;ref name=PLANT/&gt;

From 1919 to 1944, more musical offerings than dramatic ones were presented, although the theatre premiered works by [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Maxim Gorky]] during this time. As well, a series of operas was presented in the winter of 1944-45 in honor of the American and British troops.

The venue was used for classical-music recordings by the Santa Cecilia orchestra in the 1950s. 

In 1994, the theatre became the home of the [[Teatro Stabile]] company of Rome, currently directed by Mario Martone. It offers a variety of programmes, some being large-scale productions, although more plays than music or opera are presented today.

==Technical information==
The inside of the theatre is constructed of wood with six levels of boxes characterizing the design, and has been restored many times.{{sfn|Landriani|1830|pp=162–163}} It seats 696 people, including 344 in the stalls and with 40 boxes on five levels seating an additional 352.&lt;ref&gt;Technical information pdf on the theatre's website&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantamura notes that the theatre's acoustics were regarded as being excellent and that the architect who designed the [[La Fenice]] opera house in Venice, [[Gianantonio Selva]], modeled his design after the Argentina.&lt;ref name=PLANT/&gt;

|}

==In popular culture==
In the novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the Teatro Argentina was the setting for an important scene during a performance of ''[[Parisina (opera)|Parisina]]'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti]].

The book was first published in Lebanon in 1948 and was initially written in English, with Na'ima later translating it into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boullata|first=Issa J.|title=Mikhail Naimy: Poet of Meditative Vision|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|date=July 1993|volume= 24|issue= 2|page=175|doi=10.1163/157006493x00041|jstor=4183302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Na'ima initially sought to have the book published in London, where it was rejected for "[advancing] a religion with 'a new dogma'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matar|first=Nabil I.|title=Adam and the Serpent: Notes on the Theology of Mikhail Naimy|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|year=1980|volume= 11|pages=56–61|doi=10.1163/157006480x00045|jstor=4183028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the book was adapted into a three-act play by Padukone Ramanand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramanand|first=Padukone|title=Mirdad: Mikhail Naimy's Famous Work 'The Book of Mirdad' Made Into a Play in Three Acts|year=1973|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mirdad_Mikhail_Naimy_s_Famous_Work_The_B.html?id=DuHNiWmguwEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is presented as a series of dialogues between Mirdad, the abbot of a monastery, and his disciples. ''The Book of Mirdad'' draws on a variety of philosophies, including that of [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Sufi Islam]]. Through the allegories in the book presented by Mirdad, Na'ima presents several themes and calls for the unity of different people groups in universal love, as well as criticizing materialism and empty religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Aida Imangulieva|title=Gibran, Rihani &amp; Naimy: East-West Interactions in Early Twentieth-Century Arab Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWH62rLHcg8C&amp;pg=PA153|year=2010|publisher=Anqa Publishing|isbn=978-1-905937-27-1|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mirdad's dialogs gives out teachings which show us how it is possible to transform our consciousness and uncover the God within, by dissolving our sense of duality. The Book of Mirdad is ranked among the great religious classics of the twentieth century and a must have constant companion of any spiritual seeker.

==Reception==
A reviewer for ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'' praised the book, citing Na'ima's "power of enthusiasm and persuasion" as a highlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scaligero|first=Massimo|title=Review: The Book of Mirdad, A Lighthouse and a Haven by Mikhail Naimy|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=March 1960|volume= 11|issue= 1|pages=54–55|jstor=29754226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian mystic [[Rajneesh|Osho]] mentioned ''The Book of Mirdad'' in his book ''A Song Without Words'', saying that it "can be of immense help if you don't expect, and it is a book worth reading thousands of times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osho|title=A Song Without Words|year=2006|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=8171827357|pages=130, 140, 143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ii6_XQlvv3UC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=The+Book+of+Mirdad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OHCoUOnwDorn0QH--ICAAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Book%20of%20Mirdad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Mirdad is considered a masterpiece of spiritual wisdom to rank alongside [[The Prophet (book)|The Prophet]].

'''''The Music''''' (also known as ''The Music Group'', [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Muzyka'', ''Grupa Muzyka'') is one of three sculptures&lt;ref&gt;Except ''Music'' there are also ''Fine Arts'' and ''Theatre'' groups.&lt;/ref&gt; located on the roof of the building on Koszykowa Street 34/50 in [[Warsaw]] since 1952. The project was chosen after an artistic competition. The monument was designed by [[Józef Gosławski (Polish sculptor)|Józef Gosławski]], but his wife - [[Wanda Gosławska|Wanda]] - and his brother - [[Stanisław Gosławski|Stanisław]] - helped him with its realization because of the short deadline. Lack of scaffolds, problems with obtaining funds and the short deadline forced the artists&lt;ref&gt;Except Józef Gosławski sculptures in new Warsaw district were designed by [[Kazimierz Bieńkowski]] and [[Leon Machowski]].&lt;/ref&gt; to write a letter to the chief architect of Warsaw - Józef Sigalin.

'''''The Sterilization of Leilani Muir''''' is a 1996 documentary directed by Glynis Whiting about the life and times of [[Leilani Muir]], the first person to file a lawsuit against the [[Alberta]]  provincial government for wrongful sterilization under the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]].

==Synopsis==
The film runs through the life of [[Leilani Muir]], starting with her early life as a child, her life at the [[Provincial Training School]] (Michener Centre) in Red Deer, Alberta, her experience of the sterilization itself, and her lawsuit that ensued years later. Along the way in the film, professors, legal scholars, and other people of interest are interviewed and offer their knowledge of specific eugenic topics. Also, brief explanations of the theory of eugenics, IQ tests and their relation to eugenics, and a history of eugenics in Alberta and Germany are provided. 
	
[[Leilani Muir]] was born July 15, 1944, in Calgary, Alberta and grew up on a farm. She experienced a rough childhood as her mother often beat her and didn’t provide her with regular meals. As a result, Leilani often went hungry and began to steal classmates' lunches at school. The teachers were quick to notice this and would often bring lunches for her. Teachers also began to question Leilani’s parents but in order to avoid answering these questions, her family would move away. Many neighbors did not even know Leilani existed as she was often locked away on the farm, hidden for no one to see.&lt;ref name="Whiting"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.nfb.ca/film/sterilization_of_leilani_muir/|last=Whiting|first=Glynis|title=The Sterilization of Leilani Muir (film)|year=1996|publisher=National Film Board of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before Leilani’s 11th birthday, July 12, 1955, Leilani was taken to the [[Provincial Training School]] for Mental Defectives (also called the Michener Center) located in Red Deer, Alberta.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt; Leilani, not knowing at the time why she was placed in the centre, believed that she had been taken to an orphanage, since her mother had told her that she had never wanted a girl. During the next couple years Leilani played with the other girls, received a clean bed and clean clothes, was fed three meals a day, went to school and “kicked butt if she felt like it.”&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;
During her time at the Michener Center, Leilani was given a single IQ test in which she scored a 64. She was termed a moron and brought up before the [[Alberta Eugenics Board]]. They had asked her questions such as “At what age does a baby begin to walk and talk?” for roughly 5 minutes. Leilani had known the answer to this question as she had had a younger brother growing up. However, she still was deemed a danger of transmitting mental defects to progeny and incapable of intelligent parenthood. In 1957, at the age of 14 years, Leilani was told that she was undergoing a surgery to have her appendix removed. The surgeons and staff did not mention that she was being sterilized by having her fallopian tubes removed.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;

In 1965, at the age of 21, Leilani left the Michener Centre and began to support herself. She got married at the age of 24 and wanted to have a family. After going to the doctor, it was revealed that Leilani had been sterilized and could no longer have children. She married again, not having told her husband of her past, and when an adoption fell through, quickly became depressed.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;

On June 12, 1995 with the Honorable Madame Joanne B. Viet presiding, Leilani, sued the Alberta Government for wrongful sterilization and damages, with her lawyers Jon Faulds and Sandra Anderson. On January 25, 1996, Viet ruled in favor of Muir and awarded her $750,000 CAD in damages. Leilani wishes her story to be made known so that what happened to her and many others may never happen in Canada again.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;

|ShortSummary= In 1977, after being rejected by Mattel and Hasbro, [[Lucasfilm]] signed with [[Kenner Products]] to have toys produced for their sci-fi film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. This was a huge gamble, as Kenner was a small toy company at the time and the negotiation process started late due to [[George Lucas]]' secrecy over the ship designs. Since then, toy sales of the ''Star Wars'' franchise have totaled to US$14 billion worldwide.

The toy line dominated in sales from US$38.2 million in 1982 to US$400 million in 1986 before its demise in 1987 as a result of sales dropping to US$7 million and the critical and financial failure of the [[Masters of the Universe (film)|live-action film adaptation]].

|ShortSummary= Introduced in 1964, [[Hasbro]]'s [[G.I. Joe: America's Movable Fighting Man]] was the first action figure in toy history, but an [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and declining sales led to the line's demise in 1978. Desperate to hold their own against Kenner's ''Star Wars'' line, Hasbro took inspiration from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan-era]] [[Cold War (1979–1985)|Cold War]] to revive the line as ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'' in 1982, making over US$51 million that year and becoming one of the most influential boys' toys of all time.

|ShortSummary= Since the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] went on the air in 1966, the ''Star Trek'' franchise has had a history of ups and downs in the toy business - from [[Aluminum Model Toys|AMT]]'s faithful scale model kit of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] to [[Remco]]'s obscure tie-in merchandise, to [[Mego Corporation|Mego]]'s best–selling action figure line. Following Mego's bankruptcy in 1983 and a string of flops by [[Ertl Company|Ertl]] and [[Galoob]], [[Playmates Toys|Playmates]] picked up the toy license in the late 1980s and sparked a resurgence in the franchise's toy sales. From the mid-2000s onwards, companies such as [[Diamond Select Toys|Art Asylum]] and [[McFarlane Toys]] continue to keep the ''Star Trek'' toy franchise alive.

|ShortSummary= In 1983, when Hasbro was looking for a fresh, new line to sell alongside G.I. Joe, they bought the license of the [[Diaclone]] and [[Micro Change]] toys from [[Tomy|Takara]], then commissioned [[Marvel Comics]] to come up with a story-line and character names for the toys. The result: [[Transformers: Generation 1|Transformers]]. Despite [[Tonka]] releasing the cheaper [[Gobots]] line six months earlier, Hasbro's Transformers took the toy market by storm in 1984, raking in US$50 million that year. At the peak of the toy line's popularity, ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' hit theaters to further capitalize on its success, but the film polarized fans and collectors with the death of [[Optimus Prime]] and majority of the original characters. As Hasbro took full control of Transformers from Takara by the late 1980s, sales declined until the toy line was discontinued in 1991. After the failed [[Transformers: Generation 2|Generation 2]] reboot, ''[[Beast Wars: Transformers|Beast Wars]]'' rejuvenated the franchise in 1995. In 2007, the [[Transformers (film)|live-action ''Transformers'' film]] solidified Transformers' position as Hasbro's flagship toy line.

|ShortSummary= In 1949, after decades of making wooden furniture and toys, [[Ole Kirk Christiansen]]'s small factory in [[Billund, Denmark]], moved to plastic and created the "Automatic Binding Bricks", which would later be known as LEGO. When the company patented the tube system in 1958, LEGO became the dominant toy line worldwide throughout the 1960s and 1970s. When other competitors capitalized on the expiration of the company's patents in the 1980s, LEGO faced stiff competition until they reported their first loss in 1998. Poor business decisions with film licenses and the failure of the Jack Stone and ''[[Galidor: Defenders of the Outer Dimension|Galidor]]'' lines brought LEGO to near-bankruptcy until [[Jørgen Vig Knudstorp]] took over the company and, by bringing it back to its roots, rejuvenated LEGO's profits. By the time ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' hit theaters in 2014, LEGO became the largest toy franchise in the world.

The company had success producing merchandise for popular manga such as ''[[Anpanman]]'' before purchasing the license for ''[[Peanuts]]''. But after being fed up with paying royalties to [[Charles M. Schulz]], Sanrio decided to create their own characters. In 1974, Tsuji and designer [[Yuko Shimizu]] worked on a cat-based character that eventually became Hello Kitty. Since her debut, Hello Kitty has become not only the best–selling girl's toy in Japan, but also a pop culture icon for all ages worldwide, earning at least US$5 billion a year.

[[File:Uncanny valley.png|thumb|350px|An empirically estimated uncanny valley for static robot face images&lt;ref name="Mathur2016"/&gt;]]

In [[aesthetics]], the '''uncanny valley''' is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object. The concept of the uncanny valley suggests [[humanoid]] objects which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit [[uncanny]], or strangely familiar, feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers.&lt;ref name="MacDormanIshiguro2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacDorman | first1 = K.

Examples can be found in robotics, 3D computer animations, and lifelike dolls among others.  With the increasing prevalence of virtual reality, augmented reality, and photorealistic computer animation, the 'valley' has been cited in the popular press in reaction to the [[verisimilitude]] of the creation as it approaches indistinguishability from reality. The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts an entity appearing almost human risks eliciting cold, eerie feelings in viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDorman|first=Karl F.|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Debaleena|title=Categorization-based stranger avoidance does not explain the uncanny valley effect|journal=Cognition|volume=161|pages=132–135|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2017.01.009|pmid=28109534|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The concept was identified by the robotics professor [[Masahiro Mori (roboticist)|Masahiro Mori]] as ''bukimi no tani genshō'' ({{lang|ja|不気味の谷現象}}) in 1970.&lt;ref name="Mori2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mori | first = M. | translator1-last = MacDorman | translator1-first = K.

==Hypothesis==
Mori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and [[empathy|empathetic]], until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes strong revulsion. However, as the robot's appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels.&lt;ref name=mori33&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

This area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a "barely human" and "fully human" entity is the uncanny valley. The name captures the idea that an almost human-looking robot seems overly "strange" to some human beings, produces a feeling of [[uncanniness]], and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive [[human–robot interaction]].&lt;ref name=mori33/&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism underlying the phenomenon:
* '''Mate selection.''' Automatic, stimulus-driven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved [[cognitive]] mechanism for the avoidance of [[Mate choice|selecting mates]] with low [[fertility]], poor [[Endocrine system|hormonal health]], or ineffective [[immune system]]s based on visible features of the face and body that are predictive of those traits.&lt;ref name=Green2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = R.

A. (eds) (2002). Facial Attractiveness: Evolutionary, Cognitive, and Social Perspectives, Ablex Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mortality salience]].''' Viewing an "uncanny" robot elicits an innate fear of death and culturally-supported defenses for coping with death’s inevitability.... [P]artially disassembled androids...play on subconscious fears of reduction, replacement, and annihilation: (1) A mechanism with a human façade and a mechanical interior plays on our subconscious fear that we are all just soulless machines. (2) Androids in various states of mutilation, decapitation, or disassembly are reminiscent of a battlefield after a conflict and, as such, serve as a reminder of our mortality. (3) Since most androids are copies of actual people, they are [[doppelgänger]]s and may elicit a fear of being replaced, on the job, in a relationship, and so on. (4) The jerkiness of an android’s movements could be unsettling because it elicits a fear of losing bodily control."&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman &amp; Ishiguro, 2006, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pathogen]] avoidance.''' Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response. "The more human an organism looks, the stronger the aversion to its defects, because (1) defects indicate disease, (2) more human-looking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically, and (3) the probability of contracting disease-causing [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], and other [[parasite]]s increases with genetic similarity."&lt;ref name="Rhodes, G. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman, Green, Ho, &amp; Koch, 2009, p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; The visual anomalies of androids, robots, and other animated human characters cause reactions of alarm and revulsion, similar to corpses and visibly diseased individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=S. Craig|title=Applied Evolutionary Psychology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199586073|page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Sorites paradox]]es.''' Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories, human and nonhuman, by a quantitative metric, degree of human likeness.&lt;ref&gt;Ramey, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Violation of human norms.''' The uncanny valley may "be symptomatic of entities that elicit a model of a human other but do not measure up to it".&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman &amp; Ishiguro, 2006, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman, its human characteristics are noticeable, generating empathy. However, if the entity looks almost human, it elicits our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations. The nonhuman characteristics are noticeable, giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness. In other words, a robot stuck inside the uncanny valley is no longer judged by the standards of a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human, but is instead judged by the standards of a human doing a terrible job at acting like a normal person. This has been linked to perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding.&lt;ref name = "SayginSCAN"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Saygin| first=A.P.|title=The Thing That Should Not Be: Predictive Coding and the Uncanny Valley in Perceiving Human and Humanoid Robot Actions. |journal=Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience| year=2011 | volume = 7| issue=4| pages = 413–22| url=http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/413 | doi=10.1093/scan/nsr025| pmid=21515639| pmc=3324571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=UCSD News|title=Your Brain on Androids|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/soc/20110714BrainAndroids.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Religious definition of human identity.''' The existence of artificial but humanlike entities is viewed by some as a threat to the concept of human identity.&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman, K. F., Vasudevan, S. K., &amp; Ho, C.-C., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An example can be found in the theoretical framework of psychiatrist [[Irvin Yalom]]. Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses in order to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death. One of these defenses is ''specialness'', the irrational belief that aging and death as central premises of life apply to all others but oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, Irvin D. (1980) "Existential Psychotherapy", Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the very humanlike "living" robot can be so rich and compelling that it challenges humans' notions of "specialness" and existential defenses, eliciting existential anxiety. In folklore, the creation of human-like, but soulless, beings is often shown to be unwise, as with the [[golem]] in Judaism, whose absence of human empathy and spirit can lead to disaster, however good the intentions of its creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472117598-intro.pdf|title=Introduction to ''The Golem Returns''|author=Cathy S. Gelbin|year=2011|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conflicting perceptual cues.''' The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations. Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to [[Categorization|category]] membership, such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot, or has other visible robot features. This cognitive conflict is experienced as psychological discomfort (i.e., "eeriness"), much like the discomfort that is experienced with [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name="Ferrey2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferrey | first1 = A.

Mathur and Reichling found that the time subjects took to gauge a robot face's human- or mechanical-resemblance peaked for faces deepest in the uncanny valley, suggesting that perceptually classifying these faces as "human" or "robot" posed a greater cognitive challenge.&lt;ref name="Mathur2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mathur | first1 = Maya B. | last2 = Reichling | first2 = David B.| year = 2016 | title = Navigating a social world with robot partners: a quantitative cartography of the Uncanny Valley | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715300640 | format = PDF | journal = Cognition | volume = 146 | issue = | pages = 22–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2015.09.008 | pmid=26402646}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they found that while perceptual confusion coincided with the uncanny valley, it did not mediate the effect of the uncanny valley on subjects' social and emotional reactions—suggesting that perceptual confusion may not be the mechanism behind the uncanny valley effect. Burleigh and colleagues demonstrated that faces at the midpoint between human and non-human stimuli produced a level of reported eeriness that diverged from an otherwise linear model relating human-likeness to affect.&lt;ref name="Burleigh2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burleigh | first1 = T.

The more a robot resembles a real person, the more it represents a challenge to our social identity as human beings.

===Research===
A series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces. Mathur MB &amp; Reichling DB&lt;ref name="Mathur2016"/&gt; used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human-like: first, a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches, and second, a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6-face series set of faces. They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face. To measure trust toward each face, subjects completed a one-shot investment game to indirectly measure how much money they were willing to "wager" on a robot's trustworthiness. Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitly-rated likability and a more context-dependent uncanny valley on implicitly-rated trust. Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley, perceptual confusion at a category boundary, found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses.

One study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley. A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D&amp;nbsp;monkey faces (realistic, unrealistic), and a real photo of a monkey's face. The monkeys' eye-gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion. Since the realistic 3D&amp;nbsp;monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo, or the unrealistic 3D&amp;nbsp;monkey face, this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D&amp;nbsp;face aversive, or otherwise preferred the other two images. As one would expect with the uncanny valley, more realism can lead to less positive reactions, and this study demonstrated that neither human-specific cognitive processes, nor human culture explain the uncanny valley. In other words, this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitta MacPherson |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S25/53/99A37/index.xml?section=topstories |title=Monkey visual behavior falls into the uncanny valley |publisher= Princeton University |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, researchers at [[University of California, San Diego]] and [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]] are measuring human brain activations related to the uncanny valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science Exploring the uncanny valley of how brains react to humanoids| url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/19/uncanny-valley-tested}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsey |first=Doug |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/05-13ResearchOpportunities.asp |title=Nineteen Projects Awarded Inaugural Calit2 Strategic Research Opportunities Grants |publisher=UCSD  |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate= 2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study using [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], a group of cognitive scientists and roboticists found the biggest differences in brain responses for uncanny robots in [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]], on both sides of the brain, specifically in the areas that connect the part of the brain’s [[visual cortex]] that processes bodily movements with the section of the [[motor cortex]] thought to contain [[mirror neuron]]s. The researchers say they saw, in essence, evidence of mismatch or perceptual conflict.&lt;ref name="SayginSCAN" /&gt; The brain "lit up" when the human-like appearance of the android and its robotic motion "didn’t compute". Ayşe Pınar Saygın, an assistant professor from UCSD, says "The brain doesn’t seem selectively tuned to either biological appearance or biological motion per se. What it seems to be doing is looking for its expectations to be met – for appearance and motion to be congruent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiderra|first=Inga| title=YOUR BRAIN ON ANDROIDS|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/soc/20110714BrainAndroids.asp| work=UCSD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=Gary|title=UCSD exploring why robots creep people out| url= http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/aug/04/ucsd-exploring-why-some-robots-creep-people-out/?sciquest| newspaper=San Diego Union Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Chris| title=Exploring "The thing that should not be"|url=http://calit2.net/newsroom/article.php?id=1878| newspaper= Calit2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewer perception of [[facial expression]] and speech and the uncanny valley in realistic, human-like characters intended for [[video games]] and film is being investigated by Tinwell et al., 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Tinwell| first=A.|title=Facial expression of emotion and perception of the Uncanny Valley in virtual characters|journal=Computers in Human Behavior| year=2011| url=https://bolton.academia.edu/AngelaTinwell/Papers/1206195/Facial_expression_of_emotion_and_perception_of_the_Uncanny_Valley_in_virtual_characters | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.018| volume=27| issue=2| pages=741–749|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration is also given by Tinwell et al. (2010) as to how the uncanny may be exaggerated for antipathetic characters in survival horror games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Tinwell| first=A.|title=Uncanny Behaviour in Survival Horror Games|journal=Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds| year=2010| url=https://bolton.academia.edu/AngelaTinwell/Papers/1402003/Uncanny_Behaviour_in_Survival_Horror_Games|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the body of work already undertaken in android science, this research intends to build a conceptual framework of the uncanny valley using 3D characters generated in a real-time gaming engine. The goal is to analyze how cross-modal factors of facial expression and speech can exaggerate the uncanny. Tinwell et al., 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Tinwell| first=A.|title=The Uncanny Wall|journal=International Journal of Arts and Technology| year=2011| url=https://bolton.academia.edu/AngelaTinwell/Papers/1206198/The_Uncanny_Wall|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also introduced the notion of an ''unscalable'' uncanny wall that suggests that a viewer’s discernment for detecting imperfections in realism will keep pace with new technologies in simulating realism. A summary of Angela Tinwell's research on the uncanny valley, psychological reasons behind the uncanny valley and how designers may overcome the uncanny in human-like virtual characters is provided in her book, ''The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation'' by CRC Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Tinwell| first=Angela |title=The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation|year=2014| url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/146658694X/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles==
A number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley:
* '''Design elements should match in human realism.''' A robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, MacDorman, Pramono, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both a robot with a synthetic voice or a human being with a human voice have been found to be less eerie than a robot with a human voice or a human being with a synthetic voice.&lt;ref name="Mitchell et al., 2011"&gt;Mitchell et al., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For a robot to give a more positive impression, its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior.&lt;ref name="Goetz, Kiesler, &amp; Powers, 2003"&gt;Goetz, Kiesler, &amp; Powers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; If an animated character looks more human than its movement, this gives a negative impression.&lt;ref&gt;Vinayagamoorthy, Steed, &amp; Slater, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important.&lt;ref name="SayginSCAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saygin2010"&gt;Saygin, A.P., Chaminade, T., Ishiguro, H. (2010) The Perception of Humans and Robots: Uncanny Hills in Parietal Cortex. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 2716-2720).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saygin2011"&gt;Saygin et al., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance, behavior, and ability.''' In terms of performance, if a robot looks too appliance-like, people expect little from it; if it looks too human, people expect too much from it.&lt;ref name="Goetz, Kiesler, &amp; Powers, 2003"/&gt; A highly human-like appearance leads to an expectation that certain behaviors are present, such as humanlike motion dynamics. This likely operates at a sub-conscious level and may have a biological basis. Neuroscientists have noted "when the brain's expectations are not met, the brain...generates a 'prediction error'. As human-like artificial agents become more commonplace, perhaps our perceptual systems will be re-tuned to accommodate these new social partners. Or perhaps, we will decide "it is not a good idea to make [robots] so clearly in our image after all."&lt;ref name="SayginSCAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saygin2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaylord|first=Chris|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Tech/2011/0914/Uncanny-Valley-Will-we-ever-learn-to-live-with-artificial-humans|title=Uncanny Valley: Will we ever learn to live with artificial humans?|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Human facial proportions and photorealistic texture should only be used together.''' A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions, or the computer generated character can fall into the uncanny valley. Abnormal facial proportions, including those typically used by artists to enhance attractiveness (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;larger eyes), can look eerie with a photorealistic human texture. Avoiding a photorealistic texture can permit more leeway.&lt;ref name="MacDorman, Green 2009"&gt;MacDorman, Green, Ho, &amp; Koch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny:
* '''Good design can lift human-looking entities out of the valley.''' [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|David Hanson]] has criticized Mori's hypothesis that entities approaching human appearance will necessarily be evaluated negatively.&lt;ref name="Hanson, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanson | first1 = David | last2 = Olney | first2 = Andrew | last3 = Pereira | first3 = Ismar A. | last4 = Zielke | first4 = Marge | year = 2005 | title = Upending the Uncanny Valley | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 1728–1729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has shown that the uncanny valley that Karl MacDorman and Hiroshi Ishiguro&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman &amp; Ishiguro, 2006, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; generated – by having participants rate photographs that morphed from humanoid robots to android robots to human beings – could be flattened out by adding [[Neoteny|neotenous]], cartoonish features to the entities that had formerly fallen into the valley.&lt;ref name="Hanson, 2005"/&gt; This approach uses the fact that humans find characteristics appealing that are reminiscent of the young of our own (as well as many other) species, as used in cartoons.
* '''The uncanny appears at any degree of human likeness.''' Hanson has also pointed out that uncanny entities may appear anywhere in a spectrum ranging from the abstract (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[MIT]]'s robot Lazlo) to the perfectly human (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;cosmetically atypical people).&lt;ref name="Hanson, 2005"/&gt; [[Capgras delusion]] is a relatively rare condition in which the sufferer believes that people (or, in some cases, things) have been replaced with duplicates. These duplicates are rationally accepted as identical in physical properties, but the irrational belief is held that the "true" entity has been replaced with something else. Some sufferers of Capgras delusion claim that the duplicate is a robot. Ellis and Lewis argue that the delusion arises from an intact system for overt recognition coupled with a damaged system for covert recognition, which leads to conflict over an individual being identifiable but not familiar in any emotional sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = H. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Capgras delusion: A window on face recognition | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 149–156 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01620-x| pmid = 11287268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the view that the uncanny valley could arise due to issues of categorical perception that are particular to the way the brain processes information.&lt;ref name="Saygin2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollick, F. In Search of the Uncanny Valley. Analog communication: Evolution, brain mechanisms, dynamics, simulation. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press: The Vienna Series in Theoretical Biology (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The uncanny valley is a [[wikt:heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] group of phenomena.''' Phenomena labeled as being in the uncanny valley can be diverse, involve different sense modalities, and have multiple, possibly overlapping causes, which can range from evolved or learned circuits for early face perception&lt;ref name="MacDorman, Green 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman &amp; Ishiguro, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to culturally-shared psychological constructs.&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman, Vasudevan &amp; Ho, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; People's cultural backgrounds may have a considerable influence on how androids are perceived with respect to the uncanny valley.&lt;ref&gt;Bartneck Kanda, Ishiguro, &amp; Hagita, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The uncanny valley may be generational.''' Younger generations, more used to CGI, robots, and such, may be less likely to be affected by this hypothesized issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Annalee |last=Newitz |url=http://io9.com/is-the-uncanny-valley-a-myth-1239355550 |title=Is the "uncanny valley" a myth? |publisher=Io9.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar effects==
An effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1839:
{{quote|The expression of this &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Lachesis muta|Trigonocephalus]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; snake’s face was hideous and fierce; the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris; the jaws were broad at the base, and the nose terminated in a triangular projection. I do not think I ever saw anything more ugly, excepting, perhaps, some of the [[vampire bat]]s. I imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions, with respect to each other, somewhat proportional to the human face; and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness.|Charles Darwin|''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin. ''The Voyage of the Beagle ''. New York: Modern Library. 2001. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar "uncanny valley" effect could, according to the ethical-futurist writer Jamais Cascio, show up when humans begin modifying themselves with [[transhuman]] enhancements (cf. [[body modification]]), which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible, be it [[eyesight]], [[muscle]] strength, or [[cognition]].&lt;ref name=openthefuture&gt;Jamais Cascio, [http://www.openthefuture.com/2007/10/the_second_uncanny_valley.html The Second Uncanny Valley]&lt;/ref&gt; So long as these enhancements remain within a perceived norm of human behavior, a negative reaction is unlikely, but once individuals supplant normal human variety, revulsion can be expected. However, according to this theory, once such technologies gain further distance from human norms, "[[transhuman]]" individuals would cease to be judged on human levels and instead be regarded as separate entities altogether (this point is what has been dubbed "[[posthuman]]"), and it is here that acceptance would rise once again out of the uncanny valley.&lt;ref name=openthefuture /&gt; Another example comes from "pageant retouching" photos, especially of children, which some find disturbingly doll-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Erinhurt |url=http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu/node/235 |title=Retouching memories? |publisher=University of Texas |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2011-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226082858/http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu/node/235 |archive-date=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to rapid advancements in the areas of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[affective computing]], cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an "Uncanny Valley of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-10-01|title=Feeling robots and human zombies: Mind perception and the uncanny valley|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027712001278|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=125|issue=1|pages=125–130|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.06.007|pmid=22784682|issn=0010-0277|last1=Gray|first1=Kurt|last2=Wegner|first2=Daniel M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-01|title=Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind—The influence of mind attribution on the acceptance of human-like characters in a virtual reality setting|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716303055|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=160|pages=43–50|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2016.12.010|pmid=28043026|issn=0010-0277|last1=Stein|first1=Jan-Philipp|last2=Ohler|first2=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced, emotion-sensitive technology. Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon, both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research.

==In computer animation and special effects==
A number of films that use [[computer-generated imagery]] to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or "creepiness" as a result of the characters looking too realistic. Examples include the following:

* According to roboticist [[Dario Floreano]], the baby character Billy in [[Pixar]]'s groundbreaking 1988 animated short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' provoked negative audience reactions, which first led the film industry to take the concept of the uncanny valley seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Dario Floreano]] | url=http://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&amp;id=41111 | title=Bio-Mimetic Robotics }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]]. http://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&amp;id=41121{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a review of the 2007 animated film ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'', ''[[New York Times]]'' technology writer David Gallagher wrote that the film failed the uncanny valley test, stating that the film's villain, the monster [[Grendel]], was "only slightly scarier" than the "closeups of our hero [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]]'s face... allowing viewers to admire every hair in his 3-D digital stubble".&lt;ref name="digital in beowulf"&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/digital-actors-in-beowulf-are-just-uncanny/ Digital Actors in ‘Beowulf’ Are Just Uncanny] - ''New York Times'', November 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some reviewers of the 2009 animated film ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' criticized its animation as creepy. Joe Neumaier of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' said of the film, "The motion-capture does no favors to co-stars [Gary] Oldman, Colin Firth and Robin Wright Penn, since, as in 'Polar Express,' the animated eyes never seem to focus. And for all the photorealism, when characters get wiggly-limbed and bouncy as in standard Disney cartoons, it's off-putting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neumaier|first=Joe|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/blah-humbug-christmas-carol-3-d-spin-dickens-parts-lacks-spirit-article-1.414317|title=Blah, humbug!

* In the 2010 live-action film ''[[The Last Airbender]]'', the character [[Appa (character)|Appa]], the flying bison, has been called "uncanny". [[Geekosystem]]'s Susana Polo found the character "really quite creepy", noting "that prey animals (like bison) have eyes on the sides of their heads, and so moving them to the front without changing rest of the facial structure tips us right into the uncanny valley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Susana|last=Polo|title=New ''Airbender'' TV Spot: Appa's Creepy Face|url=http://www.geekosystem.com/airbender-appa-creepy-face|date=June 20, 2010|accessdate=December 11, 2012|publisher=Geekosystem}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2010 live-action film ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' features a computer-generated young version of actor [[Jeff Bridges]] (as a young [[List of Tron characters#Kevin Flynn|Kevin Flynn]] and [[List of Tron characters#Clu 2|Clu]]), which reviewers have criticized as creepy. Vic Holtreman of Screen Rant wrote, "Finally we get to the CGI recreation of Jeff Bridges as a young man. Have we finally gotten past the 'uncanny valley' (where the mind/eye discerns that something is just not quite 'real')? Sadly, no. As long as young Kevin Flynn wasn’t talking, the face looked great – but as soon as he spoke, the creepy factor pops up. He looked like he had a face full of Botox […] One could argue that Clu was a computer program and should have been 'stiff' compared to a human, but even in the opening scene of the film where we see the real-world young Kevin Flynn, the same effect is present".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/tron-legacy-reviews-vic-92655/|title='TRON: Legacy' Review – Screen Rant|last=Holtreman|first=Vic|date=December 16, 2010|publisher=Screenrant.com|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the appearance of young Kevin was "a simulacrum that here looks like an animated death mask".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|author-link=Manohla Dargis|date=December 16, 2010|title=Following in Father’s Parallel-Universe Footsteps|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/movies/17tron.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Biancolli of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Regarding Bridges' digital de-aging: It's creepy. It's a little less creepy on Clu's face (he's not human, anyway) than on Kevin's in a scene from 1989, but on either of them it has the waxen look of storefront [[mannequins]] - or over-Botoxed socialites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Biancolli|first=Amy|date=December 16, 2010|title=TRON: Legacy – Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/entertainment/movies/article/TRON-Legacy-1712822.php|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2011 animated film ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' was widely criticized for being creepy and unnatural because of its style of animation. The film was among the [[List of box office bombs|biggest box office bombs in history]], which may have been due in part to audience revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Jonathan|title=Mars Needs Moms and the Uncanny Valley|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-kim/mars-needs-moms-ucanny-valley_b_841018.html|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ryan|title=Too real means too creepy in new Disney animation|work=[[USA Today]]|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2011-04-04-creepy-animation_N.htm|date=April 4, 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Many Culprits in Fall of a Family Film|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/business/media/15mars.html|date=March 14, 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlus|first=John|title=Did The 'Uncanny Valley' Kill Disney's CGI Company?|publisher=Fastcodesign.com|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663530/did-the-uncanny-valley-kill-disneys-cgi-company|date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Mars Needs Moms'' was produced by [[Robert Zemeckis]]'s production company, [[ImageMovers]], which had previously produced ''The Polar Express'', ''Beowulf'', and ''A Christmas Carol''.)
* Reviewers had mixed opinions regarding whether the 2011 animated film ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' was affected by the uncanny valley. Daniel D. Snyder of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote, "Instead of trying to bring to life Herge’s beautiful artwork, Spielberg and co. have opted to bring the movie into the 3D era using trendy motion-capture technique to recreate Tintin and his friends. Tintin’s original face, while barebones, never suffered for a lack of expression. It’s now outfitted with an alien and unfamiliar visage, his plastic skin dotted with pores and subtle wrinkles." He added, "In bringing them to life, Spielberg has made the characters dead.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Snyder|first=Daniel D.|date=December 26, 2011|title='Tintin' and the Curious Case of the Dead Eyes|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/12/tintin-and-the-curious-case-of-the-dead-eyes/250432/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; N.B. of ''[[The Economist]]'' called elements of the animation "grotesque", writing, "Tintin, Captain Haddock and the others exist in settings that are almost photo-realistic, and nearly all of their features are those of flesh-and-blood people. And yet they still have the sausage fingers and distended noses of comic-strip characters. It's not so much 'The Secret of the Unicorn' as '[[The Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=N.B.|date=October 31, 2011|title=Tintin and the dead-eyed zombies|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/10/performance-capture-animation|work=[[The Economist]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other reviewers felt that the film avoided the uncanny valley despite its animated characters' realism. Critic [[Dana Stevens (critic)|Dana Stevens]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote, "With the possible exception of the title character, the animated cast of Tintin narrowly escapes entrapment in the so-called 'uncanny valley'".&lt;ref name=DanaTintin&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Dana|title=Tintin, So So|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2011/12/adventures_of_tintin_review_spielberg_s_motion_capture_adventure_has_its_charms_but_it_s_no_raiders_.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine editor [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] wrote of the film, "we have passed beyond the uncanny valley into the plains of hyperreality".&lt;ref name=BeyondUncanny&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|title=Beyond the Uncanny Valley|url=http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2012/01/beyond_the_unca.php|publisher=The Technium|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2015 live-action film ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' contains a scene featuring a computer-generated young version of actor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (as a young [[Terminator (character)|T-800 Terminator]]), which some reviewers thought was affected by the uncanny valley. Eric Mungenast of the ''[[East Valley Tribune]]'' wrote of the film, "One notable technological problem stems from the attempt to make old Schwarzenegger look young again with some digital manipulation — it definitely doesn’t cross over the uncanny valley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mungenast|first=Eric|date=July 2, 2015|title='Terminator Genisys' more than adequate|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/movies/article_7657c5c0-2103-11e5-b073-1fba99814591.html|newspaper=[[East Valley Tribune]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and reviewer Simon Prior wrote of the film, "Even the 'Synthespian' version of Arnie isn’t as horrific as you might expect, although it’s still clear that CGI hasn’t yet conquered the Uncanny Valley issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonprior.com/terminator-genisys-2015/|title=Terminator: Genisys (2015) review|last=Prior|first=Simon|date=February 2, 2016|publisher=Simonprior.com|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The film's predecessor, 2009's ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', also has a scene with a CG young Schwarzenegger that provoked similar reactions from some viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideonexus.com/2009/10/15/will-james-camerons-avatar-escape-the-uncanny-valley/|title=Will James Cameron's Avatar Escape the Uncanny Valley?|last=Somma|first=Ryan|date=October 15, 2009|publisher=Ideonexus.com|access-date=March 20, 2016|quote=''Terminator: Salvation'' took advantage of the spooky effect, intentionally or not, with a computer animated Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/blogs/members/b/shootist2600_blog/archive/2009/12/07/scaling-the-uncanny-valley.aspx|title=Scaling the Uncanny Valley|last=Wadsworth|first=Kyle|date=December 7, 2009|publisher=[[Gameinformer.com]]|access-date=March 20, 2016|quote=This would be a welcome counterpoint to the relatively poor rendering of a virtual Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but unlike in the newer film, this earlier version does not speak.)
* The 2016 live-action film ''[[Rogue One]]'' features the CGI likenesses of the deceased [[Peter Cushing]] and a young [[Carrie Fisher]] "reprising" their respective roles of [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] and [[Princess Leia]]. Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "The Tarkin that appears in Rogue One is a mix of CGI and live-action, and it… doesn't work. — In fact, for a special effect that's still stuck in the depths of the uncanny valley, it's surprising just how much of the movie Tarkin appears in, quietly undermining every scene he's in by somehow seeming less real than the various inhuman aliens in the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=December 18, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|title='Rogue One': That Familiar Face Isn't Familiar Enough|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rogue-one-grand-moff-tarkins-familiar-face-isnt-familiar-957178|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly Lawler of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote, "the Leia cameo is so jarring as to take the audience completely out of the film at its most emotional moment. Leia’s appearance was meant to help the film end on a hopeful note [...] but instead it ends on a weird and unsettling one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawler|first=Kelly|date=December 19, 2016|title=How the 'Rogue One' ending went wrong|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/12/19/how-rogue-one-ending-went-wrong/95519816/|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 ''[[30 Rock]]'' episode "[[Succession (30 Rock)|Succession]]", [[Frank Rossitano]] explains the uncanny valley concept, using a graph and ''[[Star Wars]]'' examples, to try to convince [[Tracy Jordan]] that his dream of creating a pornographic video game is impossible. He also references the computer-animated film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Neal|title=Succession|date=April 25, 2008| publisher= Yahoo!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10124">'''VIDA: Women in Literary Arts''' is a non-profit feminist organization, based in the United States, committed to creating transparency around the lack of gender parity in the literary landscape and to amplifying historically-marginalized voices, including people of color; writers with disabilities; and queer, trans and gender nonconforming individuals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and History|url=https://www.vidaweb.org/about-vida/|publisher=Vida--Women in Literary Arts|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

VIDA began when [[Cate Marvin]] sent a handful of women writers an email that questioned the current state of women in literature. Together with [[Erin Belieu]] and Ann Townsend, VIDA was founded to address this in 2009.&lt;ref name="lambdaliterary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Julie|title=Erin Belieu: The VIDA Count and Women in Publishing|url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/features/05/11/erin-belieu-the-vida-count-and-women-in-publishing/|publisher=Lambda Literary|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvin, Belieu, and Townsend resigned from the Board in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vidaweb.org/vida-past-and-future-vida-announces-change-in-leadership|title=VIDA PAST AND FUTURE: VIDA ANNOUNCES CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP {{!}} VIDA: Women in Literary Arts|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vidaweb.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current executive committee includes [[Melissa Febos]], [[Amy King]], Krista Manrique, Lynn Melnick, and [[Camille Rankine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Board|url=https://www.vidaweb.org/group/executive-board|publisher=Vida--Women in Literary Arts|}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current advisory board includes [[Jennifer Baumgardner]], Soraya Chemaly, [[Jodi Picoult]], Corinne Segal, [[Cheryl Strayed]], [[Jennifer Weiner]], and [[Jamia Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Board|url=http://www.vidaweb.org/group/advisory-board|publisher=Vida--Women in Literary Arts|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== The Count ==

The Count began as a yearly inventory documenting the number of women and men who were published in, or had their books reviewed by, notable literary magazines. The Count was first performed, and the results published, in 2010. The collected data showed significantly lower numbers of women than men had been published or had their books reviewed by notable literary magazines.

The VIDA Count has revealed major imbalances at premiere publications both in the US and abroad. For example, the inaugural count determined ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' covered a total of 306 books by men in 2010 and only 59 books by women and that ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' covered 524 books by men compared to 283 books written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vidaweb.org/the-count-2010/|title=The Count 2010 {{!}} VIDA: Women in Literary Arts|website=www.vidaweb.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first VIDA Count encompassed fifteen major journals and publications, plus 81 editions of three ''Best American'' anthologies—including an overall Count for each of the series’ three separate anthology imprints from the years 1986–2010—for a total of 94 journals, publications, and presses. VIDA expanded the scope of the Count in 2013, adding a new Larger Literary Landscape Count that examined dozens of historically well-established literary magazines. The 2014 VIDA Count results included the first Women of Color Count. Then, the following year VIDA further expanded to the Intersectional Count which included self-reported demographic information regarding gender, race and ethnicity, sexuality identity, age, education, and disability.

=== Reactions ===

Responses to The Count have been widely varied, and VIDA's pie charts have been reproduced in many periodicals and journals.  
The conversation spurred by VIDA's Count has been explained in the ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]].''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/04/women-writers-vida-asme]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some magazines, such as ''[[Granta]],'' ''[[Tin House]],'' and ''[[Boston Review]]'' have responded to The Count by making a conscious effort to remedy the gender disparity within their journals. Not only do the editors of these publications say that they are making these efforts, but the numbers of The Count show this to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Temple|first=Emily|title='It Isn't Rocket Science': 'Tin House' and 'Granta' Editors on How to Run a Publication That Isn't Sexist|url=http://flavorwire.com/376951/it-isnt-rocket-science-tin-house-and-granta-editors-on-how-to-run-a-publication-that-isnt-sexist|publisher=Flavorwire|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Count has also inspired some activism by individuals, such as Lorraine Berry who, in response to ''[[Harper's]]'' highly disparate numbers for three years running, published her letter "Why I’m Canceling My Subscription: An Open Letter to ‘Harper’s’ from a Loyal Reader."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berry|first=Lorraine|title=Why I'm Canceling My Subscription: An Open Letter to 'Harper's' from a Loyal Reader|url=http://flavorwire.com/377631/why-im-canceling-my-subscription-an-open-letter-to-harpers-from-a-loyal-reader|publisher=Flavorwire}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this letter, Berry details her history as a ''[[Harper's]]'' subscriber, including how much she has enjoyed reading it and how much she has been inspired by it. She then goes on to say how disheartened she was to see that ''[[Harper's]]'' has failed to do anything to correct the gender disparity in their publication, and that she will be cancelling her subscription as a result.

Some magazines, such as ''[[The Coffin Factory]],'' have openly and bluntly criticized VIDA for The Count, claiming that the questions asked by VIDA, and that the methods used to come to the conclusion that there is gender disparity in the publishing world are flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaacman|first=Laura|title=Why the VIDA Count is Bullshit|url=http://thecoffinfactory.com/the-vida-count-is-bullshit/|publisher=The Coffin Factory|accessdate=1 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common criticism of VIDA's methods is that the numbers don't include information on how many submissions are made to each magazine by men and women respectively. The assertion is that if there is a disparity in the number of submissions by men versus women, then the presence of a disparity between published work by men versus women makes sense and is not evidence of gender bias. VIDA contributor and poet Danielle Pafunda responded to this concern in her article "Why the Submissions Numbers Don't Count." Here, she details seven reasons why submissions numbers are ultimately irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pafunda|first=Danielle|title=Why the Submissions Numbers Don't Count|url=http://www.vidaweb.org/why-the-submissions-numbers-dont-count|publisher=Vida|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

VIDA has been publishing original content on its website since it began. In May 2012, edited by [[Rosebud Ben-Oni]] and Arisa White, VIDA: Women in Literary Arts launched their online forum and blog "Her Kind," taking its name from an [[Anne Sexton]] poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/06/her-kind-interview|title=HER KIND Interview by Harriet Staff|date=2017-09-19|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Kind retired in 2014 and archived its articles and essays on the organization's website, which continues to publish up-to-date content. In 2016, VIDA announced the ''VIDA Review'', a formal name for its web content, which features original interviews, articles, and essays from an intersectional feminist and womanist perspective on the literary world, publishing, education, and the arts. ''VIDA Review'' is edited by Amy King and the managing editor is Marcelle Heath. Columns include Reports from the Field; which calls out sexism, harassment and misogyny in the literary community; Curating with Compassion; VIDA Reads with Writers; and VIDA ''Voices &amp; Views'', a video and audio podcast produced and hosted by [[Melissa Studdard]].

== #saferLIT==

In 2018, VIDA launched the #saferLIT initiative to create awareness and action in the literary world around the issues of sexual harassment, coercion, and assault.  VIDA will create guidelines and develop a pledge that address conduct at conferences, residencies, workshops, panels, literary events, and with organizations, presses, and writing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vidaweb.org/saferlit/|title=Safer LIT {{!}} VIDA: Women in Literary Arts|website=www.vidaweb.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar organizations ==

[[Canadian Women in Literary Arts]] (CWILA) is "an inclusive national literary organization for people who share feminist values and see the importance of strong and active female perspectives and presences within the Canadian literary landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://cwila.com/wordpress/about-us/|publisher=Canadian Women in Literary Arts|accessdate=23 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded by the Canadian poet and essayist [[Gillian Jerome]]. 

Following VIDA's lead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://cwila.com/wordpress/about-us/|publisher=Canadian Women in Literary Arts|accessdate=23 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, CWILA began publishing their own version of The Count  focusing on Canadian literary magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 CWILA Numbers|url=http://cwila.com/wordpress/?p=253|publisher=Canadian Women in Literary Arts|accessdate=23 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia’s Stella Count began in 2012, modeled after the VIDA Count. In 2015 they expanded their count to include a survey, also modeled after the VIDA Count survey, which included self-reported demographic information on gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Stella Count|url=http://thestellaprize.com.au/the-count/2016-stella-count/|website=Stella - The Stella Prize|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What the (Bleep) Just Happened?: The Happy Warrior's Guide to the Great American Comeback''''' is a withdrawn 2012 book by [[Fox News]] contributor [[Monica Crowley]]. It was published by Broadside Books, a [[HarperCollins]] imprint. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-hong|title=A book by Donald Trump’s pick to lead national security communications is being pulled for plagiarism|url=https://qz.com/882372/monica-crowleys-what-the-bleep-just-happened-is-being-pulled-for-plagiarism/|date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What the (Bleep) Just Happened?'' was a New York Times bestseller. In 2013, the book was re-released with an afterword and the title ''What the (Bleep) Just Happened... Again?: The Happy Warrior's Guide to the Great American Comeback''.

According to Crowley, the book's name came from a conversation she had with her friend about the [[Obama administration]]:

{{quote|Every day, we were getting hit with a new piece of insane, leftist social engineering or some new policy to take down American power or prestige abroad — a rapid-fire assault I call "Barack-a-mole." Our enemies were getting olive branches, our allies were getting dissed, and millions of Americans were being moved into government dependency at home.

[[Kirkus Reviews]] panned the book, writing that Crowley's "vitriol corrodes any basis for rational discussion." The review suggested that readers pass on the book unless they are Fox News junkies, saying it is "just a restatement of similar xenophobic, snarkily presented sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WHAT THE (BLEEP) JUST HAPPENED? by Monica Crowley |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/monica-crowley/what-the-bleep-just-happened/|work=Kirkus Reviews|date=June 19, 2012|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Lauren Weiner in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' said that Crowley's arguments were overstated and employed [[doggerel]]. Weiner wrote further that after "over 300 pages of cynical quips, Nixonian realism, and declarations that 'the romanticism of the Left is over'," Crowley declared herself a "happy warrior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiner|first1=Lauren|title=(Bleep) of Faith|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/bleep-of-faith/article/649712|work=The Weekly Standard|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism==
Following the announcement by the [[Donald Trump]] administration in December 2016 that Crowley would be appointed to the [[U.S. National Security Council]], reports surfaced of [[plagiarism]] in ''What the (Bleep) Just Happened?''. A January 7, 2017 report from ''[[CNNMoney|CNN Money]]'' alleged numerous instances of plagiarism in the book, including over fifty incidents of copying from published sources without giving attribution.&lt;ref name="plagiarism"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/interactive/news/kfile-trump-monica-crowley-plagiarized-multiple-sources-2012-book/|title=Trump pick Monica Crowley plagiarized multiple sources in 2012 book |newspaper=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Trump transition team responded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/monica-crowley-plagiarism-report-233314 |title=Report: Trump's NSC comms pick plagiarized tracts in 2012 book |first=Rebecca |last=Morin|work=Politico|date=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yema''' is a French [[watch]]making company based in [[Besançon]], [[France]]. 

Founded in 1948 in Besançon (Doubs) by Henry Louis Belmont.

The evolution of the brand is punctuated by: 
* The anti-shock watch in the 50's; 
* The '''Yema''' '''Superman''' waterproof to 300 meters in 1963; 
* The '''Yema Rallygraf''' equipped with a tachometer for car enthusiasts in 1968; 
* The '''Yema Spationaute''' first French watch to fly in space with [[Jean-Loup Chrétien|Jean-Loup Chretien]] in 1982; 
* The '''Yema''' '''North Pole''' which accompanied [[Nicolas Hulot]] and Hubert de Chevigny in the exploit of the [[North Pole]] in 1987.

In 1966, 1967 and 1968 '''Yema''' becomes the leading exporter of French watches with more than 500,000 watches sold every year across 50 countries.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 1982 Henry Louis Belmont's son sells the brand to [[Matra]] ([[Lagardère Group|Groupe Lagardère]]) which in partnership with Thomson takes control of '''Yema'''. At that time the brand produced 2 million watches per year.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Having been owned by [[Seiko]] Watch Corporation of [[Japan]] since 1988, '''Yema''' returns to French hands in 2004 through a buyout by Louis Eric Beckensteiner. 

In 2009 Yema is acquired by the French watchmaker group Montres Ambre based in [[Morteau]].&lt;gallery&gt;

== 1963 - Yema Superman collection ==
In 1963 '''Yema''' launches the very first '''Yema Superman''', a watch initially developed for diving professionals. 

Many variations were then produced by '''Yema''' for this model of French manufacture in order to reach a wider audience, as for example the famous 53.00.16 and its black dial or the 24.11.17 with its blue Iridescent dial and its second hand "Pelle".&lt;gallery&gt;

== 1966 - Yema Yachtingraf collection ==
In 1966, the first '''Yema Yachtingraf''' is launched, a watch especially designed for sailors. This automatic chronograph (Valjoux movement), waterproof to 200 meters, was very popular among French yachting amateurs in the 60's and the 70's. {{cn|date=October 2018}} 

Start of 1970 '''Yema''' became official supplier of the [[French Sailing Federation]] (''Fédération Française de Yachting à Voile'') and equipped the French National team who participated to [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]]. 

Six different versions of '''Yema Yachtingraf''' model were crafted over the years. &lt;gallery&gt;

== 1982 - First French Watch in Space ==
On June 24, 1982, for the first time a French astronaut, [[Jean-Loup Chrétien]], flew from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonour base]] for a 10-day trip into space. On his wrist he wears the very first French watch to leave for the space: the '''Yema Spationaute I'''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

On June 17, 1985, the Discovery shuttle took off with [[Patrick Baudry]] and his '''Yema Spationaute II''' on mission STS-51G (First Franco-American Orbital Flight).

On November 26, 1988, [[Jean-Loup Chrétien|Jean Loup Chrétien]] goes on a mission to [[Mir|MIR Space Station]] wering a '''Yema Spationaute III'''.

== 1986 - North Pole Mission ==
In May 1986, '''Yema''' joined forces with French physician and explorator [[Jean-Louis Étienne|Jean-Louis Etienne]] to cross the [[North Pole]]. The '''Yema North Pole''' watch, created especially for the occasion, accompanied the adventurer during his 800 km solo trip to the [[North Pole]]. Very resistant to cold thanks to its titanium case, this model also had a system avoiding the magnetic north. The four cardinal points were determined according to the position of the sun, with the local sun's time as a reference point.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== 2009 - Innovative watch movement ==
After 4 years of research &amp; development, '''Yema''' designs a new proprietary watch movement: the MBP 1000. Equipped with a bidirectional oscillating mass mounted on ball bearings, they allow a fast reassembly and a power reserve of 40 hours. This resulted in a gain of efficiency but also precision, provided by a regulator whose balance beats at a frequency of 28,800 alternations per hour. Stacking a total of 31 rubies including 2 located at the ends of the axis of the barrel, this technical design effectively reduces the friction generally observed at this element following the mechanical movements.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== 2017 - Proxima Mission ==
The mission on which the 10th French astronaut went into the space was called [[Proxima Centauri|Proxima]], in tribute to the nearest star of our sun, which perpetuates the French tradition of baptising the missions of astronauts by the name of a star or a constellation. In 2017, '''Yema''' and [[CNES]] (the French Space Agency) worked once again together to create a brand new model in honour of this new space mission, the '''Yema Spacegraf'''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}
