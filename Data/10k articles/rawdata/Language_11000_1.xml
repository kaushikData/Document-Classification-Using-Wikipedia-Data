{{For|the software|Artificial Intelligence for Digital Response}}

'''AIDR''' or '''As-Is Data Rate''' is a term primarily used by [[telephone]] companies to represent the level of available data throughput that can actually be provided to an end-user over copper wiring.  

AIDR, as opposed to [[MEDR]] is an actual measure of what an end-user can be provided measured in [[kilobytes per second]]&amp;mdash;in other words, an AIDR of 3000 means that the end user in question can receive up to 3000 kilobytes per second of download speed.

Unlike MEDR, AIDR is dependent upon factors such as distance of the customer's [[network interface device]] from the [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAM]] (datacenter), whereas MEDR is only a numerical representation of line quality and only includes information on what a line can ''physically'' handle&amp;mdash;not what can actually be provided to that line.

The '''Achumawi language''' (also '''Achomawi''' or '''Pit River language''') is the native [[language]] spoken by the [[Pit River Tribe|Pit River people]] of present-day [[California]]. The term Achumawi is an anglicization of the name of the Fall River band, ''ajúmmááwí'', from ''ajúmmá'' "river". Originally there were nine bands, with [[dialect]] differences among them but primarily between upriver and downriver dialects, demarcated by the [[Big Valley mountains]] east of the Fall River valley.

==Genetic relationships==

Together, Achumawi and [[Atsugewi language|Atsugewi]] are said to comprise the [[Palaihnihan languages|Palaihnihan]] [[Language families and languages|language family]]. The basis of this assertion is weakened by poor quality of data. David Olmsted's dictionary depends almost entirely upon de Angulo, and carelessly includes [[Pomoan languages|Pomo]] vocabulary from a manuscript in which he (de Angulo) set out to demonstrate that Achumawi and Pomo are not related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Phonology  ==

Achumawi has 37 consonants. Most of these form pairs of plain and [[laryngealized]] or [[glottalized]] series. Plosives and affricates also have a third, [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] member of the series (except for the single [[glottal stop]]) which is contrastive only syllable-initially and probably derives historically from clusters, as in the neighboring and possibly related [[Yana language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |chapter= |title=Aspects of Pit River Phonology |url=http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/316-0599/roa-316-nevin-4.pdf |last=Nevin  |first=Bruce  |year=1998 |publisher=The University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= |docket= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laryngealized stops are similar in articulation to the [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[glottalization|glottalized]] stops of neighboring languages, but more [[lenis]], that is, not "popped" unless an unusual effort is made at articulating the distinction. The plain-aspirated distinction is neutralized and realized with aspiration or voiceless release in syllable-final position and before another consonant. Plain stops are voiced before a short vowel or after an aspirated stop, voiceless elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Nevin 1998"&gt;Nevin 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 5-vowel system, consisting of 5  short and long, /ɪ ɛ ʌ ə ʊ/ and /i e a o u/, the mid vowels may be of secondary origin historically, as in [[Yana language|Yana]] and [[Atsugewi language|Atsugewi]]. A schwa [ə] appears epenthetically between the consonants of certain prefixes, as in ''lhúpta'' "let's go!". Two degrees of length are contrastive for both vowels and consonants. In downriver dialects, the second [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] of a long vowel is devoiced before a plain or aspirated consonant ([[preaspiration]]) and laryngealized before a laryngealized consonant. Long vowels are typically more peripheral and short vowels more centralized. In downriver dialects, utterance-final syllables may be devoiced or whispered.&lt;ref name="Nevin 1998"/&gt;

Unlike the neighboring and related language [[Atsugewi]], Achumawi has distinctive tone on every syllable.&lt;ref name="Nevin 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mithun2001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mithun | first = Marianne | title = The Languages of Native North America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | page = 24 | isbn = 978-0-521-29875-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology ==

The Achumawi language does not have gender nor a sense of [[plural]]ity expressed as nouns. Instead of having plurality, the language has independent adjectives or numerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Angulo|first=Jaime|last2=Freeland|first2=L. S.|date=1930|title=The Achumawi Language|jstor=1263305|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=6|issue=2|pages=77–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
[[File:Ahjumawi Indian woman.jpg|thumb|An elderly Ahjumawi Indian woman, likely one of the final remaining speakers of the language.]]
Today, the Achumawi language is severely endangered. Out of an estimated 1500 Achumawi people remaining in northeastern California, perhaps ten spoke the language in 1991, with only 8 in 2000. However, out of these 8, 4 had a limited English proficiency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

As of 2013, a [[mobile app]] is planned for the language.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Louise Davis, who lives in northern California, is almost tearful when she describes hearing people using the language of her Pit River tribe in conversation for the first time. It happened years ago when an older man from another part of the state met up with her grandmother.

It was such a powerful, emotional experience that Davis is driven to use [[flashcards]] at home with her children and do whatever it takes to preserve the language.

“You can say things in our language that you can’t say in English,” she said.

Testing out a language app in February [2013], she said she couldn’t wait to see it being used among young people in the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

An '''acoustic model''' is used in [[automatic speech recognition]] to represent the relationship between an [[audio signal]] and the [[phonemes]] or other linguistic units that make up speech. The model is learned from a set of audio recordings and their corresponding transcripts. It is created by taking audio recordings of speech, and their text transcriptions, and using software to create statistical representations of the sounds that make up each word.

== Background ==
Modern speech recognition systems use both an acoustic model and a [[language model]] to represent the statistical properties of speech. The acoustic model models the relationship between the audio signal and the phonetic units in the language. The language model is responsible for modeling the word sequences in the language. These two models are combined to get the top-ranked word sequences corresponding to a given audio segment.

Most modern [[speech]] recognition systems operate on the audio in small chunks known as frames with an approximate duration of 10ms per frame. The raw audio signal from each frame can be transformed by applying the [[mel-frequency cepstrum]]. The coefficients from this transformation are commonly known as mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)s and are used as an input to the acoustic model along with other features. 

Recently, the use of [[Convolutional neural network|Convolutional Neural Networks]] has led to big improvements in acoustic modeling.&lt;ref name="SAIN2013"&gt;T. Sainath ''et al.''., "Convolutional neural networks for LVCSR," ''ICASSP'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speech audio characteristics ==
Audio can be [[Encoder|encoded]] at different [[sampling rate]]s (i.e. samples per second – the most common being: 8, 16, 32, 44.1, 48, and 96&amp;nbsp;kHz), and different bits per sample (the most common being: 8-bits, 16-bits, 24-bits or 32-bits).   Speech recognition engines work best if the acoustic model they use was trained with speech audio which was recorded at the same sampling rate/bits per sample as the speech being recognized.

== Telephony-based speech recognition ==
The limiting factor for [[telephony]] based speech recognition is the bandwidth at which speech can be transmitted.  For example, a standard land-line telephone only has a bandwidth of 64 kbit/s at a sampling rate of 8&amp;nbsp;kHz and 8-bits per sample (8000 samples per second * 8-bits per sample = 64000 bit/s).  Therefore, for telephony based speech recognition, acoustic models should be trained with 8&amp;nbsp;kHz/8-bit speech audio files.

In the case of [[Voice over IP]], the [[codec]] determines the sampling rate/bits per sample of speech transmission.  Codecs with a higher sampling rate/bits per sample for speech transmission (which improve the sound quality) necessitate acoustic models trained with audio data that matches that sampling rate/bits per sample.

== Desktop-based speech recognition ==
For speech recognition on a standard desktop PC, the limiting factor is the [[sound card]].  Most sound cards today can record at sampling rates of between 16&amp;nbsp;kHz-48&amp;nbsp;kHz of audio, with bit rates of 8 to 16-bits per sample, and playback at up to 96&amp;nbsp;kHz.

As a general rule, a speech recognition engine works better with acoustic models trained with speech audio data recorded at higher sampling rates/bits per sample.  But using audio with too high a sampling rate/bits per sample can slow the recognition engine down.  A compromise is needed. Thus for desktop speech recognition, the current standard is acoustic models trained with speech audio data recorded at sampling rates of 16&amp;nbsp;kHz/16bits per sample.

During those years, as well as in the course of a 1956 field trip, he collected extensive material on the Squamish language. From 1960 to 1983 Kuipers taught [[linguistics]] at [[Leiden University]]; after 1971 he was a professor in the department of Slavic languages and culture, specializing in [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Caucasian languages]].&lt;ref name="leiden"&gt;"[http://www.hum.leidenuniv.nl/russischestudies/over-de-opleiding/geschiedenis.html Hoogleraren, Slavische talen en kulturen]" (Professors, Slavic languages and culture), Leiden University, 23 May 2013. Accessed 30 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuipers has a strong commitment to helping to preserve a record of threatened and endangered languages. As a 1998 article in ''[[The Economist]]'' put it: "Aert Kuipers ... went to Canada recently with the intention of locating and preserving American Indian languages. He came across dozens, some limited to a single valley, others spoken by only a few dozen people. He settled on one, learnt it and put together a dictionary and a primer. But by the time he had finished there was only one other speaker of the language left."&lt;ref name="english"&gt;"[http://www.economist.com/node/133436 Dying languages: English kills]", 4 June 1998 in ''[[The Economist]]''. Accessed 30 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuipers responded to this in a letter that his arrival in Canada (nearly half a century earlier) hardly was "recently" and that the Economist may have conflated Squamish and Shuswap with regard to the "one speaker left" statement.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.economist.com/node/137641 Re: Dying languages]", 25 June 1998 in ''The Economist''.

[[Image:Aft (PSF).jpg|thumb|200px]]
:''For the acronym, see [[AFT (disambiguation)]].''

'''Aft''', in [[navy|naval]] [[terminology]], is an [[adjective]] or [[adverb]] meaning, ''towards the [[stern]] (rear) of the [[ship]]'', when the [[frame of reference]] is within the ship, headed at the fore. Example: "Able Seaman Smith; lay aft!".  Or; "What's happening '''aft'''?"
* The corresponding ''[[adjective]]'', in distinguishing one feature of the vessel from another is '''after'''. See the caption to the right. Its antonym is '''forward'''.
* The corresponding ''[[preposition]]'' is '''abaft'''. For example, the [[mizzenmast]] is abaft the [[mainmast]]. Its [[antonym]] is '''before''' or, in a more clumsy form, '''forward of'''.

'''Aft''' also describes the direction of movement within an [[aircraft]]; that is, towards the tail. Example: "Let's go aft". Meaning to pull back on the yoke. It may also describe the back/tail location or region within an aircraft cabin. Example: "Aft lavatory".

The difference between '''aft''' and '''stern''' is that aft is the ''inside'' (onboard) rearmost part of the vessel, while stern refers to the ''outside'' (offboard) rearmost part of the vessel. The stern is opposite the bow, the "outside" (offboard) of the front of the boat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6513">{{other uses|Aggressive (disambiguation)}}
The '''aggressive''' ({{Lang-fi|aggressiivi}}) is a [[verb]] construction that occurs in the [[Finnish language]], especially in emotional outbursts. It expresses negation or rejection and resembles a negative [[clause]], but it lacks the Finnish [[negative auxiliary]]. Instead, the aggressive is often marked with an [[Profanity|obscene word]], which tends to be seen as a distinctive feature of the construction. The aggressive has playfully been described as a [[grammatical mood]] by the inventor of the term, but the construction operates on the [[Syntax|syntactical]] level and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] the verb is in a regular mood (typically in the [[Indicative mood|indicative]]).

The aggressive has vogue particularly in the [[vernacular]] of the youth, but the characteristic omission of the negative auxiliary has already been found in samples of [[dialect]]al Finnish recorded in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Yle 2007"/&gt; Even though the construction is not uncommon in [[colloquial Finnish]], little attention has been paid to it in [[Finnish grammar]]s, as it has mostly been regarded as an exceptional variant of the negative clause.&lt;ref name="Kotilainen 2007"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
The characteristics of the aggressive were analyzed by [[Lari Kotilainen]] in his doctoral dissertation in 2007. According to Kotilainen, the aggressive is an affective and reactive construction where the negative auxiliary is omitted and the main verb tends to be at the end. In addition, there is often an expletive (obscene) word at the beginning and the construction tends to include a semi-negative word – typically ''mitään'' '[not] anything', which can be analyzed as a [[pronoun]] or an [[adverb]]. More specifically, Kotilainen has identified four main varieties of the construction&lt;ref name="Kotilainen 2007"/&gt; (below, nearly word-by-word translations into English are given with extra clarifications in [[square bracket]]s):

* The negative construction without the negative auxiliary (an optional expletive + [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]s and [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s and adverbs connected to the verb + the negative form of the main verb).
::''(Vittu) mä mitään tiedä!'' '(Fuck) I anything know [not]!'

* The affirmative-negative construction (an expletive in singular or plural + complements and adjuncts and adverbs connected to the verb + the affirmative form of the main verb).
::''Vittu mä mitään tiedän!'' 'Fuck I anything know [fuck I don't know anything]!'

* The repetitive construction (an expletive in plural + the affirmative form of the main verb with the [[lexeme]] mentioned earlier).
::''Paskat tiedän!'' 'Shit [if] I know!'

* The ''paskat välitän'' construction (the [[grammatical subject]] + an expletive in plural + the verb ''välittää'' 'to care' + complements and adjuncts connected to the verb).
::''Mä paskat välitän siitä!'' 'I shit care about it [I don't give a shit]!'

==Origin of the term==
In his dissertation, Kotilainen does not directly refer to the construction as "the aggressive", but he mentions that such a name has been used of the negative construction without the negative auxiliary. Elsewhere, he has himself repeatedly used it to refer to a negative construction that includes no negative auxiliary.&lt;ref name="Kotilainen &amp; Varteva 2006"/&gt;

The Finnish term ''aggressiivi'' first appeared in a parody of [[Linguistics|linguistic]] argumentation written by [[Jaakko Häkkinen]] in 1999. It was coined by shortening the [[adjective]] ''aggressiivinen'' 'aggressive' into a novel [[noun]] inspired by the existing noun ''egressiivi'' (referring to the completely unrelated [[egressive case]] of the [[Komi language]]).&lt;ref name="Häkkinen"/&gt; Häkkinen's pseudo-scientific definition describes the aggressive as a recently discovered affective negative verb mood in the Finnish language. The verbs in Häkkinen's examples are morphologically in the indicative mood, but according to his description it is typical for the "aggressive mood" to prefix ''vittu'' ('[[fuck]]', literally '[[cunt]]' but largely diluted owing to its high frequency especially in the vernacular of young people) as a mock [[bound morpheme]] to a pronoun that functions as the grammatical subject of the clause (''vittumä sinne mene'' 'fuck-I there go [fuck I won't go there]') or, alternatively, to a pronoun in a [[locative case]] (''vittusiellä ketään ole'' 'fuck-there anybody is [fuck there won't be anybody there]').

Häkkinen's joke was first published in [[Siulaset]], the [[zine]] of the students of Finnish and [[Finno-Ugric languages]] at the [[University of Helsinki]], and later republished in [[Suomen Kuvalehti]] (1/2000), a magazine in nationwide circulation. Since then, the joke has been posted and reposted on various Internet forums, but often with additions that miss the original idea of a grammatical mood and focus on the use of the expletive. Sometimes the aggressive has mistakenly been described as a [[grammatical case]] or [[part of speech]].&lt;ref name="Räisänen 2007"/&gt;

'''Appeal to the People''' or '''An Appeal to the People''' was a document written by communists in [[Shōwa era]] Imperial Japan in [[Fuchu Prison]]. It was issued after their release on October 10, 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Revolution and Subjectivity in Postwar Japan|author= J. Victor Koschmann|publisher= University of Chicago Press|year= Dec 1, 1996|pages= 28|isbn=9780226451220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a month after the [[Surrender of Japan]] on September 2, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/japanese_surrender_document/|title=Featured Document: Japanese Surrender Document|publisher= National Archives &amp; Records Administration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first issue of the ''[[Shimbun Akahata]]'' newspaper published after World War II, [[Kyuichi Tokuda]], [[Yoshio Shiga (Communist)|Yoshio Shiga]], and other released Communists issued an "Appeal to the People" on October 10, 1945. In it the following themes were advanced:

{{quote|
1. Gratitude for the opening of the "[[democratic revolution]]" in Japan as a result of the [[Allied occupation of Japan|Allied Occupation]], and "enthusiastic support" for the peace policy of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the other [[Allied powers of World War II|Allied Powers]].

2. A pledge to overthrow the Emperor system described as a combination of the Emperor and his court, the military and the administrative bureaucrats, the nobility, the absentee landlords, and the monopoly capitalists and to establish a People's Democracy.

3. Promises to eliminate militarism and police politics, to confiscate "parasitic" and idle land, distributing it to the peasants, to establish free labor unions, to abolish the old security laws, to remove the military and bureaucratic cliques from power, and to set up a national assembly based on universal suffrage for all Japanese over eighteen years of age.

4. An attack on "phony liberals" and "pseudo-socialists" who had supported the Emperor system, declaring them unfit for leadership.

5. A call for the creation of a united front under Japanese Communist Party leadership of all those who shared the above objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Japanese Communist movement, 1920-1966|author= [[Robert A. Scalapino]]|publisher= University of California Press|year= 1967 |pages= 48–49|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

According to [[John W. Dower]] "Later, when the [[Cold War]] intensified, this would become a point of embarrassment to the Communists, who lamely rationalized Tokuda's words by pointing out that the reference to "Allies" included the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II |author= John W.

'''Automatic content recognition''' ('''ACR''') is an identification technology to recognize content played on a media device or present in a media file. Devices containing ACR support enable users to quickly obtain additional information about the content they seen without any user-based input or search efforts. For example, developers of the application can then provide personalized complementary content to viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automatic Content Recognition (ACR)|url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/automatic-content-recognition-acr|website=Gartner|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
To start the recognition, a short media clip (audio, video, or both) is selected. This clip could be selected from within a media file or recorded by a device. Through algorithms such as fingerprinting, information from the actual perceptual content is taken and compared to a database of reference fingerprints, each reference fingerprint corresponding to a known recorded work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acrcloud.com/docs/introduction/automatic-content-recognition/|title=ACR(Automatic Content Recognition)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database may contain metadata about the work and associated information, including complementary media. If the fingerprint of the media clip is matched, the identification software returns the corresponding [[metadata]] to the client application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automated content recognition creating content aware ecosystems|url=http://www.civolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ACR-Creating-Content-Aware-Ecosystems-Civolution-White-Paper-Jan2013.pdf|website=Civolution|publisher=Civolution|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fingerprints and watermarking==
Audio based ACR is commonly used in the market. The two leading methodologies are [[acoustic fingerprint]]ing and [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]]. Another common approach uses [[video fingerprint]]ing.

Acoustic fingerprinting generates unique fingerprints from the content itself. Fingerprinting techniques work regardless of content format, codec, bitrate and compression techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panako: a scalable acoustic fingerprinting system handling time-scale and pitch modification|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5754913|website=Universiteit Gent|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it possible to use across networks and channels. Therefore, it is widely used for interactive TV, second screen application and content monitoring sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/6-steps-to-an-automatic-content-recognition-campaign/|title=Nielsen Is Bringing Real-Time Interactive Ads to Smart TVs to Keep Streaming Audiences Engaged|last=Main|first=Sami|date=|work=Adweek|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brink|first1=Kyle|title=A Primer on Automated Content|url=http://viggleinc.com/263/|website=Viggle|publisher=Viggle|accessdate=22 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624181308/http://viggleinc.com/263/|archive-date=2015-06-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular apps like Shazam, YouTube, Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Automatic Content Recognition|url=http://emergingspaces.co.uk/facebook-automatic-content-recognition-acr/|website=Starcom MediaVest Group|publisher=SMG|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thetake, Wechat and Weibo are using audio fingerprinting methodology to recognize the content played from a TV and trigger additional features like votes, lotteries, topics or purchases.

In contrast to fingerprinting, [[digital watermarking]] requires inserting digital tags containing information about the content into the content itself prior to distribution. For example, a broadcast encoder might insert a watermark every few seconds that could be used to identify to broadcast channel, program id, and time stamp. The watermark is normally inaudible or invisible to the users. Terminal devices like phones or tablets read the watermarks instead of actually recognizing the played content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brink|first1=Kyle|title=SVP of Product Development|url=http://viggleinc.com/263/|website=A Primer on Automated Content Recognition|publisher=Viggle|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watermarking technology is utilized in media protection field to trace where illegal copies originate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-these-hidden-video-watermarks-can-help-spot-piracy-doctored-images/|title=How these hidden video watermarks can help spot piracy, doctored images {{!}} ZDNet|last=Solana|first=Anna|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected by Next/Market Insights that 2.5 billion devices will be integrated with ACR technology to provide synchronized live and on-demand video watching experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACR Technology To Drive Social TV  As It Reaches 2.5 Billion Devices by 2017|url=http://nextmarket.co/blogs/news-1/10067125-acr-technology-to-drive-social-tv-as-it-reaches-2-5-billion-devices-by-2017|website=NEXT / MARKET INSIGHTS|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ACR technology was applied in TV content by [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]] in 2011 which captured the attention from TV industries. Shazam was previously a music recognition service which recognizes music from a sound recording. By utilizing its own fingerprint technology to identify live channels and videos, Shazam extended their business for TV. In 2012 [[DIRECTV]] partnered with Viggle which is a TV loyalty vendor to provide interactive viewing experience on the second screen. In 2013 LG partnered with [[Inscape Data Services|Cognitive Networks]] (later purchased by [[Vizio]] and renamed Inscape), an ACR vendor, to provide ACR driven interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LG partners with Cognitive Networks to make Smart TVs smarter and more interactive|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/29/lg-parnters-with-cognitive-networks-to-make-smart-tvs-smarter-an/|website=engadget|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 ACR technology is spread widely to even more applications and smart TVs. Now, social applications and TV manufacturers like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Google]], [[Wechat]], [[Weibo (company)|Weibo]], [[LG]], [[Samsung]], [[Vizio]] TV have already used ACR technology either developed by themselves or integrated from third party ACR providers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} In 2016 there are more applications and mobile OS embedded with automatic content recognition services on the market like Peach, Omusic and Mi OS to enhance the music discover experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACRCloud Powers Song Recognition For Hottest New Social Network, Peach|url=http://www.mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=189077|website=Music Industry News Network|publisher=Music Industry News Network|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Victoria|first1=Ho|title=Xiaomi will help you name that song you can't stop humming|url=http://mashable.com/2016/02/16/xiaomi-acrcloud/#XudP7Ncesaqh|website=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACRCloud Powers The Launch Of Taiwan's First Music/Humming Recognition Service For Omusic|url=http://www.mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=188840|website=Music Industry News Network|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Content identification===
ACR technology helps audiences easily retrieve information about the content they watched. For [[smart TV]]s and applications with ACR technology embedded the audience can check the name of the song which is played or descriptions of the movie they watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2018/01/03/tom-weiss-breaking-the-barriers-to-addressable-advertising-in-europe/ |title= Tom Weiss: Breaking the barriers to addressable advertising in Europe| first = Tom | last = Weiss |publisher= Broadband TV News| date= January 23, 2018 | accessdate = 30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the identified video and music content can be linked to internet content providers for on-demand viewing, third parties for additional background information, or complementary media.

===Content enhancement===
Because devices can be "aware" of content being watched or listened to, second screen devices can feed users complementary content beyond what is presented on the primary viewing screen. ACR technology can not only identify the content, but also it can identify the precise location within the content. Thus, additional information can be presented to the user. ACR can enable a variety of interactive features such as polls, coupons, lottery or purchase of goods based on timestamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Michael|title=Three Ways Automatic Content Recognition Will Change TV|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelwolf/2013/11/20/three-ways-automatic-content-recognition-will-change-tv/|work=Forbes|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audience measurement===
Real-time [[audience measurement]] metrics are now achievable by applying ACR technology into smart TVs, set top boxes and mobile devices such as smart phones and tables. This measurement data is highly essential to quantify audience consumption to set advertising pricing policies.

===Broadcast monitoring===
For advertisers and content owners, it is vital to know when and where their content has been played. Traditionally agencies or advertisers have to manually audit the presentation. At scale it only can be checked through a statistical sampling method. ACR technology enables automatic monitoring of the content played in TV. Information like the time of play, duration, frequency can be achieved without any manual effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automated Content Recognition creating content aware ecosystems|url=http://www.csimagazine.com/csi/whitepapers/ACR%20Creating%20%20content-aware%20ecosystems%20-Civolution%20White%20Paper%20-%20Sept%202012.pdf|website=csimagazine|publisher=Civolution|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roku Privacy Policy (Section I-B-4 and IV-E)|url=https://docs.roku.com/doc/userprivacypolicy/en-us|website=roku.com|publisher=Roku|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have expressed some concern{{weasel-inline|date=February 2017}} however on the information that these smart TVs are sending out to the companies collecting this data.

The alternative approaches are video based automated content recognition technologies.

Where [[acoustic fingerprint]] fails in its reliance on a database of reference fingerprints. [[Digital watermarking]] relies on intrusive frame by frame production stage imprinting on every piece of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/disadvantages-watermark-74718.html|title=The Disadvantages of a Watermark|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of these techniques have been challenged based on their presumed inability to effectively scale to the amount of video being generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150827/16421932087/facebook-announces-contentid-attempt-using-audible-magic.shtml|title=Facebook Announces Its ContentID Attempt... Using Audible Magic {{!}} Techdirt|website=Techdirt.|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice for monetization and other user based ACR applications the reference database or presence of watermarks only has to cover those videos that are targets of monetization. For example, a video that is hosted on YouTube and viewed only once does not need to be present in a world wide ACR database or be impressed with a watermark.

'''Berber orthography''' is the writing system(s) used to transcribe the [[Berber languages]]. In antiquity, the Libyco-Berber script ([[Tifinagh]]) was utilized to write Berber. Early uses of the script have been found on rock art and in various sepulchres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=L.

[[File:Central Morocco Tamazight in Tifinagh.svg|thumb|150px|alt=The word ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ.|''Tamaziɣt'' in [[Tifinagh]]]]

[[Neo-Tifinagh]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Linguists and historians tend to be specific in distinguishing between the millennia-old Berber [[abjad]] used by the Tuareg to a limited extent and found in some historical engravings and which is 'Tifinagh'; and the 'Neo-Tifinagh' [[alphabet]] which is based on the abjad but marks vowels and distinguishes more consonants. The Neo-Tifinagh script was developed and computerized in the 20th century mainly by Moroccan and Algerian researchers, some of whom were based in Europe. It has been used since the early 1970s in Berber publications, see {{Harvcoltxt|Chaker|1996|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a resurrected version of an [[alphabet]]ic script found in historical engravings, is the ''de jure'' writing system for [[Tamazight]] in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Tifinagh was chosen to be official after consideration of its univocity (one sound per symbol, allowing regional variation&lt;ref name="mdimen" /&gt;), economy, consistency, and historicity.&lt;ref name="mdimen"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bouhjar|2008|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, Tifinagh avoids negative cultural connotations of the Latin and Arabic scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Brenzinger|2007|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tifinagh is preferred by young people as a symbol of identity and has popular support.&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="voice"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|El Aissati|2001|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially popular for symbolic use, with many books and websites written in a different script featuring logos or title pages using Neo-Tifinagh. However, virtually no books or websites were being published in this alphabet, with activists primarily favoring Latin scripts for serious usage.

The Latin script has its origins in French colonialism.&lt;ref name="souag"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Souag|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; French missionaries and linguists found the Arabic script inconvenient, so they adapted the Latin alphabet to various Berber languages and Arabic vernaculars.&lt;ref name="souag" /&gt; While the established body of literature in the Arabic script was a barrier to wider adoption of the Latin script, it caught on among the French-educated minority, particularly in Algeria.&lt;ref name="souag" /&gt; Since independence, the Latin alphabet has been largely favored by the intelligentsia, especially in [[Kabylie]] where the Berberists are largely pro-Westernization and French-educated.&lt;ref name="souag" /&gt; A standard transcription for the [[Kabyle language]] was established in 1970, and most other Northern Berber dialects have to varying extents published literature in the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name="souag" /&gt;

The Latin alphabet has been preferred among Amazigh linguists and researchers, and also has a great deal of established writing, including newspapers, periodicals, and magazines.&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Brenzinger|2007|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tira"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chaker|1996|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more popular in Algeria than Morocco, but prevalent in the Riffian area.&lt;ref name="tira" /&gt; It is backed by the Amazigh elite, but is vehemently opposed by the Moroccan pro-Arab establishment.&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt; The Latin script is far more ensconced in the Kabyle dialect than in Tamazight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

;Medieval orthography
A consistent orthography was used in the few Berber texts in existence from the eleventh to the fourteenth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;The following description is based on van den Boogert (2000) and van den Boogert (1997, ch. 6).&lt;/ref&gt; These were written in an older Berber language likely to be most closely related to Tashelhiyt. The consonant ''g'' was written with ''jīm'' ({{Script|Arabic|ج}}) or ''kāf'' ({{Script|Arabic|ك}}), ''ẓ'' with ''ṣād'' ({{Script|Arabic|ص}}) or sometimes ''zāy'' ({{Script|Arabic|ز}}), and ''ḍ'' with ''ṭāʼ'' ({{script|Arabic|ط}}). Vowels ''a, i, u'' were written as orthographically long vowels ‹ā›, ‹ī›, ‹ū›. Word-final ''wāw'' was usually accompanied by ''alif al-wiqāyah''. The vowels signs ''fatḥah'' or ''kasrah'' represent a phonemic shwa /ə/ which was lost in the post-medieval language, e.g. ''tuwərmin'' ‹tūwarmīn› ({{script|Arabic|تووَرمين}}) “joints, articulation”. Labialization may be represented by ''ḍammah'', e.g. ''tagʷərsa'' ‹tāgursā› ({{script|Arabic|تاكُرسا}}) “ploughshare”. Prepositions, possessive complements and the like are mostly written as separate words. The medieval texts display many archaisms in phonology, morphology and lexicon.

;Traditional Tashelhiyt orthography
The way in which [[Shilha language|Tashelhiyt]] has been written in the Arabic script during the past centuries is very consistent, to the extent that it is possible to talk about “a conventionalized orthography”. This premodern orthography has remained virtually unchanged since at least the end of the 16th century, and is still used today in circles of traditional Islamic scholars (''ṭṭlba'').&lt;ref&gt;The following description is based on van den Boogert (1997:61-67).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maghrebi script]]&lt;ref&gt;On the peculiarities of Maghrebi script and orthography see van den Boogert (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; style is always used. Distinctive features of Maghrebi script are: the different pointing of ''fāʼ'' and ''qāf''; ''shaddah'' may be represented with a V-shaped symbol; ''waṣl'' is indicated by writing the final vowel of the preceding word a second time with the ''alif'' (with ''u'' represented by a bar through the middle of the ''alif''), e.g. ''kullu n-nāsi'' ‹kullu (u)l-nnāsi› “all the people”.

In premodern Shilha orthography, two extra letters were added to the alphabet to represent consonants not represented by the Standard Arabic alphabet: a ''kāf'' with three dots {{script|Arabic|ݣ}} for ''g'', and ''ṣād'' with three dots {{script|Arabic|ڞ}} for ''ẓ'' (dots may also be added underneath the letter). Consonants ''ṛ'' and ''ḷ'', which bear a minimal [[functional load]], are not distinguished in the spelling from ''r'' and ''l''.

Texts are always fully vocalized, with ''a'', ''i'' and ''u'' written with the vowel signs ''fatḥah'', ''kasrah'', and ''ḍammah''. Consonants without a following phonemic vowel are always written with a ''sukūn''. Gemination is indicated as usual with ''shaddah'', but in Shilha spelling it may be combined with ''sukūn'' to represent a geminated consonant without following vowel (which never occurs in Standard Arabic). Labialization is generally not represented, e.g. ''tagʷrsa'' ‹tagrsa› “plough share”. The Arabic ''waṣl'' spellings are often “mirrored” and used to write word-initial vowels, e.g. ''ayyur ula tafukt'' ‹ayyur(u) ulatafukt› “the moon as well as the sun”.

Vowel length is not distinctive in Shilha, but orthographically long vowels may be used to indicate emphasized syllables in metric texts, e.g. ''lxálayiq'' ‹lxālayiq› “creatures” vs. standard Arabic orthography ‹l-xalāʼiq›.

The Arabic letters ﺙ, ﺫ, ﻅ, representing the Arabic interdentals /θ, ð, ð̣/ may be used in etymological spellings of loanwords, but they are often replaced by ﺕ, ﺩ, ﺽ, in accordance with Shilha pronunciation, e.g. ''lḥadit'' “tradition” can be written as ‹lḥadiθ› (etymological) or as ‹lḥadit› (phonemic). Final /-a/ in both native Berber words and loan words is sometimes written with ''alif maqṣūrah'', even if the Standard Arabic spelling does not use it, e.g. ''zzka'' “alms tax” written as ‹zzká› vs. standard ‹z-zkā&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;›. Final ''-t'' in words of Arabic origin is sometimes written with ''tāʼ marbūṭah'', whether or not the original Arabic word was spelled with it, e.g. ''zzit'' “olive oil” written as ‹zzi&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;›. Nunation diacritics are sometimes used to write final ''-Vn'' in Shilha words, e.g. ''tumẓin'' “barley” ‹tumẓin› or ‹tumẓ&lt;sup&gt;in&lt;/sup&gt;›. Native words starting with a vowel and a geminated consonant may sometimes be written as if they contain the Arabic definite article, e.g. ''azzar'' “hair” written as ‹al-zzar›. Final ''-u'' or ''-w'' in Shilha words may be written with a following ''alif al-wiqāyah''.

With respect to word divisions, the premodern orthography may be characterized as conjunctive (in contrast to most European orthographies, which are disjunctive). Thus, elements such as prepositions, preverbials, pronominal affixes, demonstrative and directional particles are written connected to a noun or verb form, e.g. ‹urānɣiḍhir manīɣurikfis iblisī› = ''ur anɣ iḍhir mani ɣ ur ikfis iblis-i'' “it is not apparent to us where Iblis has not sown [his depravity]”.

[[File:KonikovoGospel.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Konikovo Gospel title page published in the book "Български старини от Македония", Йордан Иванов, С. 1931, с. 182.]]

The history of '''Bible translations into Macedonian''' is connected in its early years with the history of [[Bible translations into Bulgarian]]. In 1852, in [[Salonica]], the cleric [[:bg:Павел Божигробски|Pavel Bozhigrobski]] printed a bilingual manuscript. It contains a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[evangeliarium]] and its translation to [[Solun-Voden dialect]] from today [[Slavic dialects of Greece]], both written in Greek letters. The texts represent the [[vernacular]], not church language.

This translation is the oldest known text of greater scope, that directly reflects the living dialects of [[Aegean Macedonia]] of that period. Bulgarian [[academician]] [[:bg:Йордан Иванов|Jordan Ivanov]], who found the title page of the gospel in 1907, described it as written in [[Bulgarian dialects|Bulgarian dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/rami/j_ivanov_solunsko.html Български старини от Македония", Йордан Иванов, С. 1931, с. 182.]&lt;/ref&gt; On the title page is written "Typed in [[Bulgarian language]]"&lt;ref&gt;''Евангелие на Господа Бога и Спаса нашего Иисуса Христо, сига ново типосано на '''богарской йезик''' за секоа неделя от година догодина со рет. Преписано и диортосано от мене Павел йероманах, бозигропски протосингел, родом Воденска (Епархия) от село Кониково. Солон, Стампа Кирякова Дарзилен 1852''.&lt;/ref&gt; even the author himself was known later as [[Bulgarian Exarchate]]'s worker.&lt;ref&gt;Български възрожденски книжовници от Македония. Избрани страници, Издателство на БАН, София, 1983, стр. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The label "Bulgarian language" for various [[Macedonian dialects]] can be seen from early vernacular texts such as the four-language dictionary of [[Daniel Moscopolites]], the early works of [[Kiril Peichinovich]] and [[Yoakim Karchovski]] and such vernacular gospels written in the Greek alphabet. These written works influenced by or completely written in the local Slavic vernacular were registered in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in the 18th and beginning of the 19th century and their authors referred to their language as Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. K. Yasamee "Nationality in the Balkans: The Case of the Macedonians" in Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121-132.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered by researchers from the [[University of Helsinki]] to be the oldest known Gospel translation in what would later be known as [[Macedonian language]].

Until the winter of 2003-04 it was believed that both the manuscript and the printed text were destroyed. Only the front page was preserved and published in the book ''Bulgarian antiquities in Macedonia'', Jordan Ivanov, 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;182., among others. Then a group of researchers from the University of Helsinki found the original manuscript of the translation of the Alexandrian Patriarch, under the reference: [http://www.helsinki.fi/~jslindst/268/ Bibl.Patr.Alex. 268]. Another example is the ''Kulakian gospel'' from 1863, which represents translation from Greek [[evangeliarium]]  to [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and was written by hand with Greek letters from Evstati Kipriadi in the town of [[Chalastra]]. On the title page is also inscription "Written in [[Bulgarian language]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mazon, Andre]] et Andre Vaillant. L'evangeliaire de Kulakia un parler slave du Bas-Vardar, Paris 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Господново и сфетаго евангелио на бога нашаго голема црикфа христианоф, искарено на '''бугарцко изик''' тувашно збор на Вардариа за уф неделите сати за гудината и за сати празницити големите за цела година за литургиата. Са писало ут Евстатио Киприади уф селото Колакиа на 30 ноемврио месиц 1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official translations ==
In 1952 a liturgical edition of the 4 Gospels was printed.  This was translated by Milošev Djordje with the help of the Macedonian Committee of the Orthodox Church.  In 1957 further selections based upon the lectionary readings were published.  In 1959 the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, translated by Georgi Milosev, Boris Boskovski and Petar Ilijevski was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS).  The first complete e New Testament translated in the [[Macedonian language]] was then completed and published in 1967.  In 1970 the Bible Society printed an edition with cross-references following the verses.  Another edition was printed in Belgrade in 1988 by the Yugoslav office of the United Bible Societies (UBS).

The whole Bible (including the [[Deuterocanonical books]]) translated in Macedonian by the [[Archbishop Gavril]] was printed in 1990. This was published by the Bible Society and it has the official sanction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. An audio edition of the 1990 New Testament was produced.

The text was revised in 2006 and called the Macedonian Standard Bible.  This was printed in 2 editions, one without the deuterocanonical books and one with them, which has the official sanction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church.  These have been digitised by the Bible Society and the 2006 editions are now on YouVersion as MK2006&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/1501/jhn.1 Macedonian 2006 Bible]&lt;/ref&gt; and MK2006D. The Bible Society launched a Macedonian Bible app which was launched in Skopje in October 2016. This is available on Android, iPhone and Google platforms.  An audio edition of the New Testament was also produced.

In 2008 the Orthodox Church edited the 1952 liturgical 4 Gospels to produce a new edition used with their lectionary and liturgy.

== Independent translations ==
An independent translation of the complete Bible was prepared by Duško Konstantinov in the mid 1970s, but it was not printed until 1996 by the [[Loucas Foundation]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. A [[dynamic translation]] of the [[New Testament]] prepared by [[Ivan Grozdanov]] and [[Goran Stojanov]] was published in 1999 under the umbrella of [[Biblica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://svetopismo.com.mk Macedonian New Testament - Dynamic Translation], published by the [http://crkva.org.mk Good News Baptist Church], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have translated their [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]] from English into Macedonian.&lt;ref&gt;Available on-line [http://www.jw.org/mk/izdanija/biblija/ here], in PDF format.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bima language''', or '''Bimanese''' (Bima: ''Nggahi Mbojo'', [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Bahasa Bima'') is an Austronesian language spoken on the eastern half of [[Sumbawa]] Island, [[Indonesia]], which it shares with speakers of the [[Sumbawa language]]. Bima territory includes the [[Sanggar Peninsula]], where the extinct Papuan language [[Tambora language|Tambora]] was once spoken. "Bima" is an exonym; the autochthonous name for the territory is "Mbojo" and the language is referred to as "Nggahi Mbojo." There are over half a million Bima speakers. Neither the Bima nor the Sumbawa people have alphabets of their own for they use the alphabets of the [[Bugis language|Bugis]] and the [[Malay language]] indifferently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Cowles Prichard|title=Researches into the Physical History of Mankind Volume 5: Containing Researches Into the History of the Oceanic and of the American Nations|year=1874|publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert, and Piper|asin=B0041T3N9G}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Long thought to be closely related to the [[Sumba languages|languages of Sumba]] Island to the southeast, this assumption has been refuted by Blust (2008), which makes Bima a primary branch within the [[Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages|Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian]] subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;Blust, R. (2008). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20172340 Is There a Bima-Sumba Subgroup?] ''Oceanic Linguistics'', 47(1), 45-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Dialects include Kolo, Sangar (Sanggar), Toloweri, Bima, and Mbojo (''Ethnologue'').

'''Donggo''', spoken in mountainous regions to the west of [[Bima Bay]] such as in Doro Ntika of the [[Doro Oromboha]] area, is closely related to the main dialect of Bima. It is spoken by about 25,000 people who were formerly primarily Christians and animists; many have now converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Just, Peter. 2001. ''Dou Donggo justice: conflict and morality in an Indonesian society''. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Bima is spoken on Sumbawa, [[Sape Strait|Banta]], [[Sangeang]], and [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] islands (''Ethnologue'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1642">The '''Birch–Tate conjecture''' is a [[conjecture]] in [[mathematics]] (more specifically in [[algebraic K-theory]]) proposed by both [[Bryan John Birch]] and [[John Tate]].

==Statement==
In algebraic K-theory, the [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the [[Center (group theory)|center]] of the [[Steinberg group (K-theory)|Steinberg group]] of the [[ring of integers]] of a [[number field]] ''F''. ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also known as the tame kernel of ''F''. The Birch–Tate conjecture relates the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of this group (its number of elements) to the value of the [[Dedekind zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta_F&lt;/math&gt;. More specifically, let ''F'' be a [[totally real number field]] and let ''N'' be the largest natural number such that the [[Field extension|extension]] of ''F'' by the ''N''th [[root of unity]] has an [[Elementary abelian group|elementary abelian]] [[p-group|2-group]] as its [[Galois group]]. Then the conjecture states that
:&lt;math&gt;\#K_2 = |N\zeta_F(-1)|.&lt;/math&gt;

==Status==
Progress on this conjecture has been made as a consequence of work on [[Iwasawa theory]], and in particular of the proofs given for the so-called "[[main conjecture of Iwasawa theory]]."

The problem remains unsolved as of 2011.

&lt;!-- article needed  [http://www.bison.co.uk/about-us/heritage/ May help]--&gt;
The '''Bison wall-frame''' construction system was a construction method used in [[tower block]] construction. It was launched in 1963 by [[Concrete Ltd]] who set up factories across the UK to pre-fabricate the parts it.
It was not a frame structure as such, instead [[pre-cast concrete]] panels formed the structure of high rise blocks. It evolved into a rapid construction method. 

In tower blocks over 12 storeys in height, all of the walls were loadbearing - external and internal. Whilst there were no partition walls, the internal walls were still thinner at 6 inches in thickness. Two-bedroom flats could be constructed out of 21 pre-cast concrete pieces. The bathroom and toilet elements could be constructed from a similarly few number of pre-fabricated pieces. The lift shaft and staircases could be constructed out of pieces that were 3 storey high. The method was limited in that it was only really practical for two and three-bedroom flats. &lt;ref name=ukhousing&gt;{{cite web|title=Bison|url=http://ukhousing.wikia.com/wiki/Bison|website=UK Housing Wiki|accessdate=18 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cholón''', also known as ''Seeptsá'' and ''Tsinganeses'', is a recently extinct language of Peru.

== Phonology ==
Due to the amateur Spanish [[pronunciation spelling]]s used to transcribe Cholon, its sound inventory is uncertain. The following is an attempt at interpreting them (Adelaar 2004:464).

== Grammar ==
Cholon distinguishes masculine and feminine [[grammatical gender]] in the [[Grammatical person|second person]]. That is, one used different forms for "you" depending on whether one was speaking to a man or a woman:

{| class=wikitable
|''katsok'' || 'house'
|-
|''aktsok'' || 'my house'
|-
|''miktsok'' || 'your house' (speaking to a man)
|-
|''piktsok'' || 'your house' (speaking to a woman)
|-
|''intʃamma'' || 'what did you say?' (speaking to a man)
|-
|''intʃampa'' || 'what did you say?' (speaking to a woman)
|}

{{Conservation status}}
 
The '''conservation status''' of a [[taxon|group of organisms]] (for instance, a [[species]]) indicates whether the group still exists and how likely the group is to become [[Extinction|extinct]] in the near future. Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status: not simply the number of individuals remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, and known threats.  Various systems of conservation status exist and are in use at international, multi-country, national and local levels as well as for consumer use.

==International systems==
===IUCN Red List of Threatened Species===
The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria Categories and Criteria] The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 18 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IUCN. (2012) [http://jr.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf ''IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria: Version 3.1''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128190606/http://jr.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf |date=2016-01-28 }} Second edition. Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK. {{ISBN|9782831714356}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also included are species that have gone extinct since 500 AD.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term "[[Threatened species|threatened]]" is a grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.

* [[Extinction|Extinct]] (EX) – No known living individuals
* [[Extinct in the wild]] (EW) – Known only to survive in captivity, or as a naturalized population outside its historic range
* [[Critically endangered]] (CR) – Extremely high risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Endangered species|Endangered]] (EN) – High risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] (VU) – High risk of endangerment in the wild
* [[Near threatened]] (NT) – Likely to become endangered in the near future
* [[Least concern]] (LC) – Lowest risk; does not qualify for a higher risk category. Widespread and abundant [[taxa]] are included in this category.
* [[Data deficient]] (DD) – Not enough data to make an assessment of its risk of extinction
* [[Not evaluated]] (NE) – Has not yet been evaluated against the criteria.

===The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora===
[[CITES|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)]] aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Many countries require CITES permits when importing plants and animals listed on CITES.

==Multi-country systems==
In the [[European Union]] (EU), the Birds and Habitats Directives are the legal instruments that evaluate the conservation status within the EU of species and habitats.

[[NatureServe conservation status]] focuses on [[Latin America]], United States, Canada, and the [[Caribbean]]. It has been developed by scientists from [[NatureServe]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and the network of natural heritage programs and data centers. It is increasingly integrated with the IUCN Red List system. Its categories for species include: ''presumed extinct'' (GX), ''possibly extinct'' (GH), ''critically imperiled'' (G1), ''imperiled'' (G2), ''vulnerable'' (G3), ''apparently secure'' (G4), and ''secure'' (G5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |title=InfoNatura: About the Data: Conservation Status |website=NatureServe.org |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system also allows ambiguous or uncertain ranks including ''inexact numeric ranks'' (e.g. G2?), and ''range ranks'' (e.g. G2G3) for when the exact rank is uncertain. NatureServe adds a qualifier for ''captive or cultivated only'' (C), which has a similar meaning to the IUCN Red List ''extinct in the wild'' (EW) status.

The [[Red Data Book of the Russian Federation]] is used within the Russian Federation, and also accepted in parts of Africa.

==National systems==
In Australia, the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' (EPBC Act) describes lists of threatened species, ecological communities and threatening processes. The categories resemble those of the 1994 [[IUCN Red List]] Categories &amp; Criteria (version 2.3). Prior to the EPBC Act, a simpler classification system was used by the ''Endangered Species Protection Act 1992''. Some state and territory governments also have their own systems for conservation status.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In Belgium, the Flemish [[Research Institute for Nature and Forest]] publishes an online set of more than 150 nature indicators in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inbo.be/content/homepage_en.asp |title=Research Institute for Nature and Forest |website=Inbo.be |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] (COSEWIC) is a group of experts that assesses and designates which wild species are in some danger of disappearing from Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosepac.gc.ca/eng/sct5/index_e.cfm |title=Cosewic |publisher=Government of Canada, Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada |accessdate=2013-07-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA), it is up to the federal government, which is politically accountable, to legally protect species assessed by COSEWIC.

In China, the State, provinces and some counties have determined their key protected wildlife species. There is the China red data book.

In [[Finland]], a large number of species are protected under the Nature Conservation Act, and through the [[EU Habitats Directive]] and EU Birds Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?node=6053&amp;lan=en |title=Protecting species |website=Ymparisto.fi |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Federal Agency for Nature Conservation]] publishes "red lists of endangered species".

India has the [[Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, Amended 2003]] and the [[Biological Diversity Act, 2002]].

In Japan, the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of Environment]] publishes a Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodic.go.jp/english/rdb/rdb_e.html |title=Threatened Species |website=Biodic.go.jp |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], the Dutch [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]] publishes a list of threatened species, and conservation is enforced by the Nature Conservation Act 1998. Species are also protected through the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives.

In New Zealand, the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] publishes the [[New Zealand Threat Classification System]] lists.  {{As of|2008|January}} threatened species or subspecies are assigned one of seven categories: Nationally Critical, Nationally Endangered, Nationally Vulnerable, Declining, Recovering, Relict, or Naturally Uncommon.&lt;ref name="NZTCS08"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Townsend|first1=Andrew J.|last2=de Lange|first2=Peter J.|last3=Duffy|first3=Clinton A.J.|last4=Miskelly|first4=Colin M.|last5=Molloy|first5=Janice|last6=Norton|first6=David A.|title=New Zealand Threat Classification System manual|date=January 2008|publisher=Science &amp; Technical Publishing Department of Conservation|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=9780478143645|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/sap244.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2018|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the classification looks only at a national level, many species are unique to New Zealand, and species which are secure overseas are noted as such.

In Russia, the Red Book of Russian Federation came out in 2001, it contains categories defining preservation status for different species. In it there are 8 taxa of amphibians, 21 taxa of reptiles, 128 taxa of birds, and 74 taxa of mammals, in total 231. There are also more than 30 regional red books, for example the red book of the Altaic region which came out in 1994.

In [[South Africa]], The South African National Biodiversity Institute, established under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/gazette/acts/2004/a10-04.pdf|title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! - South African Government|website=Info.gov.za|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for drawing up lists of affected species, and monitoring compliance with CITES decisions. It is envisaged that previously diverse Red lists would be more easily kept current, both technically and financially.

In [[Thailand]], the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act of BE 2535 defines fifteen [[Reserved animals of Thailand|reserved animal]] species and two classes of protected species, of which hunting, breeding, possession, and trade are prohibited or restricted by law. The National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand)|Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment]] is responsible for the regulation of these activities.

In [[Ukraine]], the Ministry of Environment Protection maintains list of endangered species (divided into seven categories from "0" - extinct to "VI" - rehabilitated) and publishes it in the Red Book of Ukraine.

In the [[United States of America]], the [[Endangered Species Act]] created the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|Endangered Species List]].

==Consumer guides==
{{Main article|Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification}}

Some consumer guides for [[seafood]], such as [[Seafood Watch]], divide fish and other sea creatures into three categories, analogous to conservation status categories:
* Red ("''say no''" or "''avoid''")
* Yellow or orange ("''think twice''", "''good alternatives''" or "''some concerns''")
* Green ("''best seafood choices''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx | title=Seafood Recommendations: Our Seafood Ratings|website=Seafoodwatch.org | accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The categories do not simply reflect the imperilment of individual species, but also consider the environmental impacts of how and where they are fished, such as through [[bycatch]] or [[ocean bottom trawlers]]. Often groups of species are assessed rather than individual species (e.g. [[squid]], [[prawn]]s).

The [[Marine Conservation Society]] has five levels of ratings for seafood species, as displayed on their ''FishOnline'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fishonline.org/ratings | title=Fish ratings | work=FishOnline | publisher=Marine Conservation Society | accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the video game concept of taking cover|Cover system}}
[[Image:DutchGapb.jpg|thumb|Two American soldiers in 1864 take cover. One flattens himself against the wall while the other crouches behind a barrel]]

In military combat, '''cover''' is anything which is capable of physically protecting an individual from enemy fire. This differentiates it from the similar concept of [[:wikt:concealment|concealment]], in that an object or area of concealment only affords the benefit of stealth, not actual protection from [[small arms]] fire or [[artillery|artillery fragments]]. An example of "cover vs. concealment" would be sandbags vs. tall grass. Cover may be a naturally occurring feature, such as a rock or a tree stump, or it may be a constructed feature, such as a foxhole or a trench.

==Uniform==
In some military services (especially in the [[United States]]), a uniform's hat is sometimes referred to officially as a cover, as in "Hey soldier, remove your cover!" or "You're not in uniform without your cover." It is a convention in the [[United States Military]] that an armed [[soldier]] must wear cover while indoors to indicate that they are [[under arms]].

==In gaming==
{{main|Cover system}}

Many [[First-person shooter|first]] and [[third-person shooter]] video games encourage the player to utilize cover. This gameplay mechanic is often referred to as a "cover system".

{{About|the use of the term in project management|the war crime|death march}}

In [[project management]], a '''death march''' is a project that the participants feel is destined to fail, or that requires a stretch of unsustainable overwork. The general feel of the project reflects that of an actual [[death march]] because project members are forced to continue the project by their superiors against their better judgment.

[[Software development]] and [[software engineering]] are the fields in which practitioners first applied the term to these project management practices. Other fields have since recognized the same occurrence in their own spheres and have adopted the name.

Death marches of the destined-to-fail type usually are a result of unrealistic or overly optimistic expectations in [[Schedule (project management)|scheduling]], feature [[Scope (project management)|scope]], or both, and often include lack of appropriate [[Software documentation|documentation]] or relevant training and outside expertise that would be needed to accomplish the [[Task (project management)|task]] successfully. The knowledge of the doomed nature of the project weighs heavily on the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of its participants, as if they are helplessly watching themselves and their coworkers being forced to torture themselves and march toward death. Often, the death march will involve desperate attempts to right the course of the project by asking [[Project team|team]] members to work especially grueling hours (14-hour days, 7-day weeks, etc.) or by [[Brooks's law|attempting to "throw (enough) bodies at the problem"]], often causing [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]].

Often, the discomfort is heightened by the knowledge that "it didn't have to be this way";{{Tone inline|date=February 2017}} that is, that if the company wanted to achieve the goal of the project, it could have done so in a successful way had it been managed competently (such as by devoting the obviously required [[Resource (project management)|resources]], including bringing all relevant expertise, technology, or [[applied science]] to the task rather than just whatever incomplete knowledge a few employees happened to possess). Patent under-resourcing is especially offensive at a large corporation with sufficient financing. Business culture pressures, such as the corporate pursuit of short-term maximization of profits, may play a role in addition to mere incompetence.{{Tone inline|date=February 2017}}{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The term "death march" in this context was discussed at length in [[Edward Yourdon]]'s book ''Death March: The Complete Software Developer's Guide to Surviving 'Mission Impossible' Projects'' ({{ISBN|0130146595}}), which has a second edition simply titled ''Death March'' ({{ISBN|013143635X}}). Yourdon's definition: "Quite simply, a death march project is one whose 'project parameters' exceed the norm by at least 50 percent." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=169512 | title=What is a Death March Project and Why Do They Happen? | publisher = InformIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extemporaneous speaking''', colloquially known as '''extemp''', is a limited-preparation speech event based on research and original analysis. Extemporaneous speaking is a competitive speaking event in the [[United States]] in both [[high school]] and [[college]] [[public speaking|forensics]] competition.
Extemporaneous speaking provides 30 minutes of preparation time, followed by a seven minute speech. When preparation starts, speakers are offered three questions to answer. Questions are based on current affairs, and topic areas generally include international and domestic policy, economic policy, and social or scientific issues. Speakers generally speak persuasively, though some areas of the US offer informative speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL Competition Events Guide|url=http://www.nationalforensicleague.org/aspx/nav.aspx?navid=127&amp;pnavid=26?navid=13&amp;pnavid=175|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230349/http://www.nationalforensicleague.org/aspx/nav.aspx?navid=127&amp;pnavid=26?navid=13&amp;pnavid=175|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-02|publisher=National Forensic League|accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFA Events Guide|url=http://www.americanforensics.org/Welcome.html|publisher=American Forensics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=hsLNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 6.18.6]), [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus|Anaximenes]] was "the first who practised the art of speaking extemporaneously." Extemporaneous Speaking was designed as an event to not be a memorized, rehearsed speech, but rather, a short, analytical speech spoken off the cuff, emphasizing critical thinking in addition to performance.123

== Basic information and format ==
Extemporaneous speaking is a speech that is either persuasive or informative in nature, usually modeled off of a 5 paragraph essay. At top levels, extemporaneous is a smooth, dynamic performance that incorporates research, background knowledge, and opinion. A successful extemporaneous speech has an introduction that catches the listener's attention, introduces the theme of the speech, and answers the question through three, or sometimes two, areas of analysis, which develop an answer to the question. These areas of analysis are followed by a conclusion, which summarizes the speech. Extemporaneous speaking sometimes allows for the use of index cards, but many extemporaneous competitors forgo their usage, and many forensic leagues do not allow their usage. The use of the Internet is often not allowed during preparation.

Debate and public speaking (collectively called "forensics") are generally stratified into novice and varsity levels. A varsity level extemporaneous speech typically contains anywhere from 6 – 15 sources, while averaging 8-10, to provide a basis of fact for analyzing the question. References are often referred to as a "cite" or "citation."  Quality sources include newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', magazines like ''[[the Economist]]'' and ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' and journals like ''[[The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs]]'' and ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''. For a speech dealing with a certain region's issues, say [[Africa]] or the [[Middle East]], it is good to include regional sources as well, like ''[[All Africa]]'' and ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' respectively.

The introduction is usually structured as a 1 minute, 30 second section, with an attention-getter to grab the attention of the audience, background information, which often includes a source to build credibility, a statement of significance,  which tells the audience why the topic is important, before going into the basic overview of the structure of the speech, including the question, answer, and a preview of the three areas of analysis.

An individual point in Extemporaneous Speaking is typically structured like a basic warrant, with a claim, warrant, and impact with about 1 minute and 30 to 1 minute and 40 seconds of content. This usually incorporates two to four sources to build credibility and provide information for analysis, and a mid of both broad argumentation and specific examples. Finally, the end of a point usually links back to the speaker's answer to the question, which functions as an impact. Some schools of thought argue that the impact of a point should link to a scenario outside of the scope of the question,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacting – it's THAT Important|url=http://speechgeek.com/extemp/impacting-%E2%80%93-it%E2%80%99s-that-important/|publisher=Extemp Central|accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most competitive circuits in High School and Collegiate competition value a link back to the answer to the question instead.

The conclusion, which lasts for between 30 seconds and 1 minute, in Extemporaneous Speaking follows the basic format of the introduction, but backwards, starting with the speaker restating the question, answer, and review of the three points. Finally, the speech finishes with a basic reference to the attention-getter.

== Competition ==

During the speech, competitors are evaluated by way of comparison to the other speakers in a "round" of competition.  Generally, there are five to seven competitors in a given round.  Judges give speakers time signals to help them pace their presentations, usually starting from five minutes remaining.  Judges rank all students in a room in order, with the first rank being the best and the worst speaker ranked last (sixth, for example in a round of six competitors).

In High School competition, the [[National Forensic League]] (NFL), [[Stoa USA]], the [[National Christian Forensics and Communication Association]] (NCFCA) and the [[National Catholic Forensic League]] (CFL) host most Extemp tournaments in High School.  Both leagues have a national tournament at the end of every year, with the NFL tournament drawing a larger number of competitors.  There is also the [[Extemporaneous Speaking Tournament of Champions]], held each May at [[Northwestern University]], along with the [[Tournament of Champions (debate)|Tournament of Champions]] at the [[University of Kentucky]], which has held a round robin since 2012. In addition, there are highly prestigious "circuit" tournaments, as in [[Policy debate]], [[Public forum debate|Public Forum]], and [[Lincoln-Douglas Debate|Lincoln-Douglas]].  These include the Glenbrooks Tournament in [[Chicago]], the Yale Invitational at [[Yale University]], the Patriot Games at [[George Mason University]], the Barkley Forum at [[Emory University]], the Berkeley Tournament in [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the Invitational at [[Harvard University]].  There are also two major round-robins, held at George Mason University and at [[Montgomery Bell Academy]] (MBA).

In collegiate competition, a myriad of organizations provide national competition in Extemporaneous Speaking. The [[American Forensic Association]] (AFA) and the [[National Forensic Association]] (NFA) are organizations responsible for Extemporaneous speaking at the four year level, with Phi Ro Pi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phi Ro Pi – Official Website|url=http://www.phirhopi.org/|publisher=Phi Ro Pi|accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving the two year, community college level. Other organizations which offer Extemporaneous Speaking competition are Pi Kappa Delta, [[Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha]], and the International Forensic Association. Collegiate competition is almost identical to High School competition, with most tournaments hosted by Universities. The AFA hosts a National Individual Events Tournament (NIET), usually in April. The NFA hosts a separate tournament with easier qualification requirements known as NFA Nationals. Additionally, collegiate competition consists of dozens of tournaments across the country, like the Norton Invitational, hosted by [[Bradley University]], and the Hell Froze Over swing tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFA Nationals Manual|url=http://www.americanforensics.org/Welcome.html|publisher=American Forensics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFA Nationals Manual|url=http://www.nationalforensics.org/|publisher=National Forensic Association|accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current rankings ==
Rankings for High School Extemporaneous Speaking are maintained by multiple organizations, three of which are: Extemp Central,&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speechgeek.com/extemp/natl-points-race/|title=Nat'l Points Race|date=24 July 2009|work=speechgeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute for Speech and Debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheard|first1=Robert|title=Debate Rankings – Extemp|url=http://www.debaterankings.com/extemp.html|website=Debate Rankings|publisher=Institute for Speech and Debate|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SpeechRanks.com.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.speechranks.com&lt;/ref&gt; All three use a points system which assigns points to tournaments on the national circuit based on the size of each tournament's field, and its prestige.

'''Hate-watching''' is the activity of watching a [[television show]] while simultaneously hating its content or subject. 

''[[The New Yorker]]'' described the short-lived ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'' as a show people loved to hate-watch, as "it was bad in a truly spectacular way—you could learn something from it, about self-righteous TV speechifying and failed satire and the dangers of letting a brilliant showrunner like [[Aaron Sorkin|[Aaron] Sorkin]] run loose to settle all his grudges in fictional form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nussbaum |first=Emily |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/04/hate-watching-smash.html |title=Hate-Watching "Smash" |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted the difference between hate-watching and watching as a [[guilty pleasure]]. "You wouldn't tune in every week to hate-watch a really "bad" reality show — that’s a guilty pleasure. Generally speaking, hate-watching requires a TV series with high ambitions and features a certain amount of aesthetic perfection".&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/08/16/newsroom-smash-glee-hatewatch/ The Rise of Hate-Watching: Which TV shows do you love to despise? | PopWatch | EW.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article describing the complexity of effects of U.S. presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]]'s appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as host, writer Mary McNamara references the hate-watching phenomenon as a reason that ratings alone are not an indication of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNamara |first=Mary |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-critics-notebook-donald-trump-snl-ratings-20151107-column.html |title=Why huge 'SNL' ratings won't help Donald Trump become president |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= November 27, 2015|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of studies in Hebrew grammar==
{{Further information|Hebraist}}
The [[Masoretes]] in the 7th to 11th centuries laid the foundation for grammatical analysis of Hebrew. As early as the 9th century [[Judah ibn Kuraish]] discussed the relationship between Arabic and Hebrew. In the 10th century, [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]] refined the [[Tiberian vocalization]], an extinct pronunciation of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

The first treatises on Hebrew grammar appear in the [[High Middle Ages]], in the context of [[Midrash]] (a method of interpreting and studying the Hebrew Bible). The [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] tradition originated in [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]] around the 7th century. The ''[[Diqduq]]'' (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;G. Khan , J. B. Noah, ''The Early Karaite Tradition of Hebrew Grammatical Thought'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] in the 11th century composed a versified Hebrew grammar, consisting of 400 verses divided into ten parts. In the 12th century, [[Ibn Barun]] compared the [[Hebrew language]] with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic grammatical tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinchas Wechter, Ibn Barūn's Arabic Works on Hebrew Grammar and Lexicography (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;
11th to 12th century grammarians of the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]] included [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]], [[Jonah ibn Janah]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], [[Joseph Kimhi]], [[Moses Kimhi]] and [[David Kimhi]]. Ibn Ezra gives a list of the oldest Hebrew grammarians in the introduction to his ''Moznayim'' (1140).
[[Roger Bacon]] was "a tolerable Hebrew scholar".  [[Profiat Duran]] published an influential grammar in 1403.

[[Judah Messer Leon (15th century)|Judah Messer Leon]]'s 1454 grammar is a product of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Hebrew grammars by [[Christian Hebraist|Christian authors]] appeared during the [[Renaissance]]. [[Hieronymus Buclidius]], a friend of [[Erasmus]], gave more than 20,000 francs to establish a branch of Hebrew studies at [[Leuven|Louvain]] in [[Flanders]]. [[Elijah Levita]] was called to the chair of Hebrew at the [[University of Paris]]. [[Cardinal Grimani]] and other dignitaries, both of the state and of the Church, studied Hebrew and the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] with Jewish teachers; even the warrior [[Guido Rangoni]] attempted the Hebrew language with the aid of [[Jacob Mantino]] (1526). [[Pico de la Mirandola]] (d. 1494) was the first to collect Hebrew manuscripts, and [[Reuchlin]] was the first Christian author to write a vocabulary and short grammar of the Hebrew language (1506).&lt;ref&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0001/bsb00017321/images/index.html?id=00017321&amp;groesser=&amp;fip=xsyztsxdsydewqenxssdasyztsw&amp;no=212&amp;seite=1 Online version of ''De rudimentis hebraicis'']&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed grammar was published in 1590 by [[Otto Walper]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books/about/Grammatica_linguae_sanctae.html?id=ZjY8AAAAcAAJ ''Grammatica linguae sanctae'' at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Conrad Gesner]] (d. 1565) was the first Christian to compile a catalogue of Hebrew books.
[[Paul Fagius]] and [[Elia Levita]] operated the first Hebrew printing office in the 1540s. Levita also compiled the first Hebrew-[[Yiddish]] dictionary.

Through the influence of [[Johannes Buxtorf]] (d. 1629) a serious attempt was made to understand the post-Biblical literature, and many of the most important works were translated into Latin.  [[Gesenius]]' ''Hebrew Grammar'' appeared in 1813.

== Eras ==

The Hebrew language is subdivided by era, with significant differences apparent between the varieties. All varieties, from Biblical to Modern, use a typically Semitic [[templatic morphology]] with triconsonantal stems, though Mishnaic and Modern Hebrew have significant borrowed components of the lexicon that do not fit into this pattern. Verbal morphology has remained relatively unchanged, though Mishnaic and Modern Hebrew have lost some modal distinctions of Biblical Hebrew and created others through the use of auxiliary verbs.

Significant syntactic changes have arisen in Modern Hebrew as a result of non-Semitic substrate influences. In particular:

* In Biblical Hebrew, possession is normally expressed with [[status constructus]], a construction in which the possessed noun occurs in a phonologically reduced, "construct" form and is followed by the possessor noun in its normal, "absolute" form. Modern Hebrew tends to reserve this construction for phrases where the two components form a unified concept, whereas ordinary possession is more commonly expressed [[Analytic language|analytically]] with the preposition ''shel'' 'of' (etymologically consisting of the relativizer ''she''- 'that' and the preposition ''le''- 'to').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zuckermann|2006|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rosén|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Possession in pronouns is expressed with pronominal suffixes added to the noun. Modern Hebrew tends to reserve this for a limited number of nouns, but usually prefers to use the preposition ''shel'', as in the previous case.&lt;ref name="glinert"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Glinert|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biblical Hebrew often expresses a pronoun direct object by appending a pronominal suffix directly to the verb, as an alternative to appending it to the preposition that signals a definite direct object. The latter construction is the one generally used in Modern Hebrew.&lt;ref name=glinert/&gt;
* The [[Tense-aspect-mood|tense–aspect]] that is formed by prefixes could denote either the present (especially [[frequentative]]) or the future, as well as frequentative past in Biblical Hebrew (some scholars argue that it simply denoted [[imperfective aspect]]), while in modern Hebrew it is always future. The suffixed form denotes what is commonly translated as past in both cases, though some scholars argue that it denoted [[perfective aspect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|1981|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biblical Hebrew employs the so-called [[waw consecutive]] construction, in which the conjunction "and" seemingly reverses the tense of a verb (though its exact meaning is a matter of debate). This is not typical of Modern Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Davis|2007|p=536}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The default word order in Biblical Hebrew is [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]], while Modern Hebrew is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Doron|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most Biblical Hebrew constructions are still permissible in Modern Hebrew in formal, literary, archaic or poetic style.

'''Jakob Streit''' (23 September 1910 in [[Spiez]], Switzerland – 15 May 2009 in Spiez) was a Swiss author, teacher and [[anthroposophist]]. Besides this he worked as musician and [[choirmaster]] as well as conductor and [[dramaturg]]

== Biography ==

Jakob Streit was born in the [[Berner Oberland]] in Switzerland, the son of a [[watchmaker]], and lived there for most of his life. He had four brothers and sisters and everyone helped to tend the family beehives, their cow and calf and their sheep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jakobstreit.ch/ Biographical sketch on the Jakob Streit Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied Education at the teacher training college in Bern, where his skills in Music, Education and Literature were honed. His musical education he completed with Hans Klee, the father of artist [[Paul Klee]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/-gedenkfeier-fuer-lehrer-autor-musiker-und-dramaturg-/story/13409321/print.html Obituary of Eva Streit]&lt;/ref&gt; then began on a career as teacher of different age groups, in the course of which the many stories he told to the children were published as children's stories in over forty books. Many of these are translated into English and other languages. His educational method, and particularly his music instruction drew heavily on the indications of [[Rudolf Steiner]] on [[Waldorf education]].

“When one has told stories to different age groups of children for 45 years on a daily basis, one learns a great deal from them, one is carried on the wings of Poetry, of the imagination. In later years, this interest grows into everything that is truly human. For example, this is how I came to write my first book about gnomes: A girl in the third grade brought a beautiful [[Edelweiss]] to my desk one morning, saying: “My father gave it to me and told me that, if you can tell us how the Edelweiss came about, you can keep it.” Quickly the children all sat down at their desks, for in their eyes the teacher of the third grade is capable of anything at all. Forty pairs of eyes are looking expectantly at you. (…) I began thoughtfully; soon there were gnomes and elves in the picture, finding magic ways to transform the stars of the night into the Edelweiss. Carried by the astonished eyes of the children, my story must have gone on for about 20 minutes. When the Edelweiss had finally been created, a little boy stood up and proclaimed: “Tomorrow you must deal with the Gentian.” In this manner, from day to day, we found our way through the different flowers of the mountains. I was not able to prepare at all. I needed the children to be there. Afterwards I wrote down the stories that had come about. They have been published as “Bergblumen Märchen” today with the publisher Oratio Verlag in Schaffhausen.”

After producing plays with children, he broadened his interest to amateur theatre direction, in the course of which he inaugurated the [[William Tell]] festival plays in [[Interlaken]] and the Spiez Castle Plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlossspielespiez.ch/clubdesk/www Schloss Spiele Spiez]&lt;/ref&gt; Having studied Piano and Organ, his work as choir conductor led him to produce a succession of [[operas]], amongst others [[The Magic Flute]] and [[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Euridice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliomedia.ch/de/autoren/Streit_Jakob/719.html Bibliomedia, Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions of Art, Art History and culture occupied him all his life and after his retirement he began to lecture in most of Europe besides increasing the scope of his literary work. For many years he was editor of the AVS-Mitteilungen, the newssheet of the [http://www.anthroposophischevereinigung.ch/ Anthroposophische Vereinigung in der Schweiz], continuing with this until his death at 99 years of age.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Sultan Jahan (here ''Sultan'' is a name, not a title) was born at [[Bhopal]], the elder and only surviving child of Nawab Begum [[Sultan Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal|Sultan Shah Jahan]] and her husband General HH Nasir ud-Daula, Nawab Baqi Muhammad Khan Bahadur (1823–1867). In 1868, she was proclaimed heiress apparent to the Bhopal ''musnaid'' following the death of her grandmother, Sikander Begum and her mother's succession to the throne. In 1901, Sultan Jahan succeeded her mother at her death, becoming Nawab Begum of Dar-ul-Iqbal-i-Bhopal.

=== Nawab Begum ===
[[File:Kaikhusrau Jahan, Begum of Bhopal at Delhi Durbar 1911.jpg|thumb|right| Jahan with her second son at the [[Delhi Durbar#Durbar of 1911|Delhi Durbar of 1911]]]]
A great reformer in the tradition of her mother and grandmother, Sultan Jahan founded several important educational institutions in Bhopal, establishing free and compulsory primary education in 1918. During her reign, she had a particular focus on public instruction, especially female education. She built many technical institutes and schools and increased the number of qualified teachers. From 1920 until her death, she was the founding [[List of Chancellors of the Aligarh Muslim University|Chancellor]] of [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. Even till today, she is the only female [[Chancellor]] ever served for [[Aligarh Muslim University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amu.ac.in/pro.jsp?did=10065&amp;lid=List%20of%20Chancellors |title=Aligarh Muslim University &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Public Relations Officer |website=Amu.ac.in |date= |accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not just a reformer in the field of education, the Nawab Begum reformed taxation, the army, police, the judiciary and the jails, expanded agriculture, and constructed extensive irrigation and public works in the state. Also, she established an Executive and Legislative State Council in 1922 and began open elections for the municipalities.

In 1914, she was the President of the All-India Muslim Ladies' Association. Sultan Jahan's primary legacy, though, was in the field of public health, as she pioneered widespread inoculation and vaccination programs and improved the water supply and standards of hygiene and sanitation. A prolific author, she wrote several books on education, health and other topics, including ''Hidayat uz-Zaujan'', ''Sabil ul-Jinan'',
''Tandurusti'' (Health), ''Bachchon-ki-Parwarish'', 
''Hidayat Timardari'', ''Maishat-o-Moashirat''. Owing to her numerous activities, she was the recipient of numerous honours and awards.

In 1926, after a reign of 25 years, Sultan Jahan abdicated the throne in favour of her youngest child and only surviving son, [[Hamidullah Khan]]. She died four years later, aged 71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/India/bhopal6.htm |title=BHOPAL6 |publisher=Royalark.net |date= |accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Krymchak language''' ({{lang|jct|кърымчах тыльы}}, ''Qrımçah tılyı'') (also called Judeo-Crimean Tatar, Krimchak, Chagatai, Dzhagatay) is a [[Moribund language|moribund]] [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Crimea]] by the [[Krymchaks|Krymchak people]]. The Krymchak community was composed of [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants who arrived from all over Europe and Asia and who continuously added to the Krymchak population. The Krymchak language, as well as culture and daily life, was very similar to [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], the peninsula's majority population, with the addition of a significant [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] influence.

Like most [[Jewish languages]], it contains a large number of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Loanword|loanwords]]. Before the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], it was written using [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew characters]]. In the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1930s, it was written with the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] (a variant of the [[Latin script]]), like [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] and [[Karaim language|Karaim]]. Now it is written in the [[Cyrillic script]].

Over the last century the language has disappeared and been replaced by [[Russian language|Russian]], with approximately 70% of the population perishing in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Warren|year=1984|title=The Fate of the Crimean Jewish Communites: Ashkenazim, Krimchaks and Karaites|url=|journal=Jewish Social Studies|volume=46|issue=2|pages=169-176|issn=0021-6704|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in May 1944 almost all Crimean Tatars were deported to [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Uzbekistan]], many speakers of Krymchak were among them, and some remained in Uzbekistan.

Nowadays the language is almost [[Extinct language|extinct]]. According to the Ukrainian census of 2001, less than 785 Krymchak people remain in [[Crimea]]. One estimate supposes that of the approximately 1500-2000 Krymchaks living worldwide, mostly in [[Israel]], Crimea, Russia, and the [[United States]], only 5-7 are native speakers.
== Classification ==
Krymchak is within the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]]. It has alternatively been considered as a separate language or as an [[ethnolect]] of Coastal/Middle Crimean Tatar,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kizilov|first=Mikhail|year=2009|title=The Krymchaks: Current State of the Community|url=http://img.eajc.org/data/image/books/18/0/180_d.pdf#page=62|journal=Euro-Asian Jewish Yearbook|volume=2007/2008|pages=63-89|isbn=978-5-91665-003-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Crimean Karaites|Crimean Karaite]]. [[Glottochronology|Glottochronological]] reckoning evidenced that these [[Subdialect|subdialects]] became distinct from Crimean Tatar around 600-800 AD. Krymchak and Karaite became distinguishable around 1200-1300.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polinsky|first=Maria|year=1991|title=The Krymchaks: History and Texts|url=|journal=Ural-Altaic Yearbook|volume=63|pages=123-154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Krymchak community formed over hundreds of years as Jews from all over [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] immigrated to the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A Greek-speaking Jewish community had resided on the peninsula from 100 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ianbay|first=Iala|year=1998|title=The Krimchak Translation of a Targum Sent of the Book of Ruth|url=https://www.academia.edu/12834807/THE_KRIMCHAK_TRANSLATION_OF_A_TARGUM_ŠENI_OF_THE_BOOK_OF_RUTH_I|journal=Mediterranean Language Review|volume=10|pages=1-53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Jewish peoples settled there over time as well.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires|last=Olson|first=James|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Krymchak community originated during the [[Middle Ages]], grew intensely in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, became a unified group in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and continued to grow until the nineteenth century. This growth occurred continuously as Jewish emigrants arrived from the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Persia]], and many other regions. The study of Krymchak [[Surname|surnames]] affirms that their community formed slowly and was composed from elements of different origins.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Krymchaks: A Vanishing Group in the Soviet Union|last=Khazanov|first=Anatoly|publisher=Hebrew University of Jerusalem|year=1989|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Like other Jewish groups in the Crimea, Krymchak culture, everyday life, and language had strong [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] influences. The Crimean Tatar language became dominant between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries for political reasons, it being the language of the Crimean peninsula's Tatar political majority. Tatar was the [[Lingua franca|common language]] used between different ethnic groups residing on the peninsula, and it also became the common language between the different Jewish groups living in the Crimea.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Although Krymchak is often considered by modern linguists to be an [[ethnolect]] of Crimean Tatar, and for hundreds of years Krymchaks themselves considered Crimean Tatar to be their language, Krymchak has at times been labeled a unique language. For political reasons, another Crimean Jewish community, the [[Crimean Karaites|Karaites]], claimed that Krymchaks spoke a separate language. Additionally, during the time of the Soviet Union, the Krymchaks themselves claimed to have a language distinct from Crimean Tatar because association with the Tatars would have been dangerous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In their translation of a Krymchak storybook, linguists Marcel Erdal and Iala Ianbay found that Krymchak was different enough from Crimean Tatar to warrant a separate name and study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erdal|first=Marcel|last2=Ianbay|first2=Iala|year=2000|title=The Krimchak Book of Miracles and Wonders|url=https://www.academia.edu/13809850/The_Krimchak_book_of_Miracles_and_Wonders_I|journal=Mediterranean Language Review|volume=12|pages=39-141|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general switch from Krymchak to Russian began after the [[Russian Revolution]] and intensified in the 1930s. In 1897, 35% of Krymchak men and 10% of women spoke Russian. In 1926, the majority of Krymchaks considered Crimean Tatar as their [[First language|native language]], however the youth attending Russian schools preferred to speak the Russian language, though they usually spoke incorrectly. Neither did they have a firm command of the Krymchak language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1959, 189 Krymchaks considered Crimean Tatar as their native language. This number should have been higher, however by this time there was ambiguity about the Kymchak [[Ethnic group|ethnic identity]] and confusion about the language's name.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1989 only a few elders could speak Krymchak, while a significant amount of the intermediate generation could speak it somewhat. The younger generation had no knowledge of it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
A 2007 estimate supposes 1,200-1,500 Krymchaks live worldwide, mainly in Israel, Russia, the Crimea, and the US. Of these, only 5-7 can speak the language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Krymchak was spoken in the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine. In 1783, when Russia conquered Crimea, most Krymchaks lived in the town of [[Bilohirsk|Karasubazar]] (now Belogorsk). This continued to be their population center until [[World War II]], though beginning in the 1880s many migrated to [[Simferopol]]. Around 1913 about 1,500 Krymchaks lived in Simferopol. A community-conducted census in 1913 shows they also lived in [[Kerch]], [[Feodosia Municipality|Theodosia]], and [[Sevastopol]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There was also a small community in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Their population began to decline in the twentieth century, beginning with the Russian civil war and ensuing [[Russian famine of 1921–22|famine]]. 

About 70% of the Krymchak community died during World War II.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Between December 1941 and July 1942 Krymchaks, and many other Jews and other civilians, were killed throughout the Crimean peninsula by the German [[Einsatzgruppen]]. When German soldiers reached the towns in which Jewish communities resided, they murdered them en masse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Warren|year=1984|title=The Fate of the Crimean Jewish Communites: Ashkenazim, Krimchaks and Karaites|url=|journal=Jewish Social Studies|volume=46|issue=2|pages=169-176|issn=0021-6704|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the remaining Krymchak population dispersed from the Crimean peninsula.

By 1942 about one hundred Krymchak families lived in the United States, most in [[New York City]], and they quickly integrated into the Jewish community there.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1979, its estimated that 1000 Krymchaks lived in the Ukraine, 600 in Russia, 200 in Georgia, and 200 in Uzbekistan. In 1974 only two Krymchak men were still living in Belogorsk, formerly Karasubazar, the community's historic center.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Official status ===
Krymchak is designated as an [[indigenous language]] in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babin|first=Borys|year=2016|title=Legal Status of the Non-numerous Indigenous Peoples of Crimea in the Modern Conditions|url=http://dspace.puet.edu.ua/bitstream/123456789/4993/1/eppd_2016_3_4.pdf#page=15|journal=European Political and Law Discourse|volume=3|issue=4|pages=15-23|issn=2336 5439|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dialects ===
Though itself considered a dialect of Crimean Tatar, Krymchak differed geographically depending on the dialect of the surrounding Tatar population.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/13749396/Relativisation_in_Krymchak|title=Scholarly Depth and Accuracy. A Festschrift to Lars Johanson|last=Erdal|first=Marcel|publisher=Grafiker|year=2002|isbn=|location=Ankara|pages=117-136|chapter="Relativisation in Krymchak"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sounds/Phonology ==
Krymchak employs the five [[Vowel|vowels]] ''a o u I e.'' Their phonology contains only short vowels. They do not distinguish between front and back [[Labialization|labial]] vowels, such as o / ö and u / ü.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olach|first=Zsuzsanna|year=2015|title=Emergence of a new written culture: the use of Hebrew script among the Krimchaks and the Karaim|url=http://real.mtak.hu/27545/1/AOV_Olach_revised.pdf|journal=Acta Orientalia Vilnensia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers intone words differently than speakers of Crimean Tatar.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Krymchak pronunciation of Hebrew also differs from its traditional pronunciation, which was used by Crimean Karaites, another Judeo-Crimean community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chernin|first=Velvl|year=2001|title=The Krymchak tradition of Hebrew pronunciation|url=|journal=Hebrew Linguistics|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary/Lexis ==
Krymchak contains a significant amount of borrowed words from Hebrew. As much as 5% of vocabulary is Hebrew.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One study of various Krymchak texts also shows borrowed vocabulary from [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] and [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]]. Later texts show strong Russian influence, while earlier texts have many [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] borrowings, where the use of Arabic or Persian lends a lofty style.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Writing system ==
Krymchak was written using the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

The "'''Kudzu League'''" are a loosely defined group of prestigious universities in the [[southern United States]].  The term is a parody of the term "[[Ivy League]]" (used to designate a set of eight prestigious universities in [[New England]] and the [[mid-Atlantic states]]) and alludes to the [[Kudzu in the United States|proliferation of kudzu in the American South]] since its introduction from Japan in the late 1800s for erosion-control purposes.

Schools frequently labeled with the term include:

*'''Private institutions''':
:*[[Duke University]] (Durham, North Carolina)
:*[[Wake Forest University]] (Winston-Salem, North Carolina)
:*[[Rice University]] (Houston, Texas)
:*[[Vanderbilt University]] (Nashville, Tennessee)
:*[[Tulane University]] (New Orleans, Louisiana)
:*[[Furman University]] (Greenville, South Carolina)

*'''Public institutions''':
:*The [[University of Virginia]] (Charlottesville, Virginia)
:*The [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (Chapel Hill, North Carolina)
:*The [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Atlanta, Georgia)

The prestigious institutions [[Emory University]] and [[The College of William and Mary]], located respectively in Atlanta, Georgia, and Williamsburg, Virginia, are often listed as additional members due to their academic excellence and location.  However, as they do not participate in FBS-level college football, they are sometimes omitted.

'''LSE''' ({{lang-fr|Langage symbolique d'enseignement}}) is a [[programming language]] developed at [[Supélec]] in the late 1970s/early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hebenstreit2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hebenstreit|first=Jacques|editor=Jacquetta Megarry|title=World Yearbook of Education 1982/3: Computers and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeXYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-16772-0|page=126|chapter=The '10,000 microcomputers plan' in France|quote=The language LSE (Langage Symbolique d'Enseignement–a symbolic teaching language) was defined at my laboratory in 1971 and implemented on the MITRA 15 and T1600, both French-made systems.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marquet2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Marquet|title=Informatique et enseignement: progrès ou évolution?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aeK6lBSoJAMC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Editions Mardaga|language=fr|isbn=978-2-87009-875-2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmucler1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Héctor Schmucler|title=Memoria de la comunicación|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKPfXxDcih4C&amp;pg=PA178|year=1997|publisher=Editorial Biblos|language=es|isbn=978-950-786-141-3|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[BASIC]], except with [[French language|French]]-language instead of [[English language|English]]-language keywords. It was derived from an earlier language called ''LSD'', also developed at Supélec. It is most commonly said to be an acronym for ''Langage Symbolique d'Enseignement'' (Symbolic Teaching Language), but other expansions are also known (e.g. ''Langage de Sup-Élec'', or the more cynical ''Langage Sans Espoir'' (hopeless language)).

It originally flourished due to support from the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|French Ministry of National Education]], but declined as the ministry lost interest. It went through a number of revisions; earlier versions of LSE lacked full support for [[structured programming]], which later version added, along with [[exception handling]].

'''[[Montenegro]]''' has one [[official language]], specified in the Constitution of 2007 as [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]. At the 2011 census, 42% of the population declared Serbian to be their native language, while 37% declared it to be Montenegrin. Linguistically, they are the same language (different standardized varieties of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]), but an incipient Montenegrin [[standardized language|standard]] is in the process of being formulated.

Recognized minority languages are [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. As of 2017, Albanian is an official language of the municipalities of [[Podgorica]], [[Ulcinj]], [[Bar]], [[Pljevlja]], [[Rozaje]] and [[Tuzi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocnal.com/2017/03/albanian-language-official-in-montenegro.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, there are a few hundred Italians in Montenegro, concentrated in the [[Bay of Kotor]] (''Cattaro'').

The Montenegrin language is written in [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabets, but there it is a growing political movement to use only the Latin alphabet.

'''Low rate initial production (LRIP)''' is a term commonly used in [[military]] [[weapon]] projects/programs to designate the phase of initial, small-quantity [[Manufacturing|production]]. The prospective first buyer and operator (i.e., a country's defense authorities and the relevant military units) gets to thoroughly test the weapons system over some protracted amount of time&amp;mdash;in order to gain a reasonable degree of confidence as to whether the system actually performs to the agreed-upon requirements before contracts for [[mass production]] are signed.  At the same time, manufacturers can use the LRIP as a production test-phase where they develop the assembly line models that would eventually be used in mass production. Therefore, the LRIP is commonly the first step in transitioning from highly customized, hand-built prototypes to the final mass-produced end product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://acc.dau.mil/adl/en-US/716926/file/78952/Instruction%20-%20USD%20(AT_L),%20DoDI%205000.02,%20Operation%20of%20DAS,%207%20Jan%202015.pdf|title = DoDI 5000.02, January 2015 - Operation of Defense Acquisition Strategy|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, either the production capability or the weapons system itself can be unready during the LRIP phase. This can mean that systems produced during LRIP are built significantly differently both in terms of technique and cost owing to the immaturity of the production line or changes in the weapons system's design, necessitating a large degree of hand-assembly and trial-and-error typically associated with the prototyping stage.  Furthermore, the cost of each LRIP system can be much greater than the final mass production unit cost, since the LRIP cost can include both the R&amp;D and setup cost for production, although the goal is that this additional cost is spread out over future production carried out by the assembly capacity developed during LRIP.

The term is also applied in fields other than weapons production, most commonly in non-weapon military equipment programs.

Immaturity in a system's design or its method of production discovered during LRIP phase can result in additional LRIP phases to verify corrections/improvements, or project cancellation. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has found that the [[United States Department of Defense]] rarely achieves projected cost savings because too many programs fail to move from LRIP to full-scale production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fas.org/man/gao/ns97103.htm | publisher = FAS | title = Defense Aircraft Investments: Major Program Commitments Based on Optimistic Budget Projections | type = testimony | date = 3 May 1997 | id = GAO/T-NSIAD-97-103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marba''' is an [[Afro-asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language]] that is used by the Azumeina peoples of [[Chad]] ([[:fr:Tchad|fr]]) as their first language. It is also the name of one of these Azumeina people groups.

This article relates to the '''Marba language''' [mpg] spoken by the Azumeina peoples.

==Description==
The Marba language is indigenous primarily to:
* [[Tandjilé Ouest]] ([[:fr:Tandjilé Ouest|fr]]), one of three departments in the [[Tandjilé Region]] ([[:fr:Tandjilé|fr]]) of south-western Chad (the others are [[:fr:Tandjilé Centre|Tandjilé Centre]] and [[Tandjilé Est]])
* Leou-Mbassa sous-préfecture in the department of [[Kabbia]] ([[:fr:Kabbia|fr]]) in the [[Mayo-Kebbi Est]] ([[:fr:Mayo-Kebbi Est|fr]]) region.

Alternate non-preferred spellings include Maraba. Historically the language has sometimes been called Azumeina. Banana, {{not a typo|Bananna}} and Ho Ho were sometimes used during the time of the French administration but have fallen into disuse. 

The Marba of this article is a different topic from Marfa [mvu] and Maba [mde] which are Nilo-Saharan languages spoken in the [[Ouaddaï Region|Ouaddaï]] and [[Wadi Fira Region|Wadi Fira]] regions of Chad.

==Geographic distribution and variations==

The following people groups speak Marba and are therefore called Azumeina:
* Marba 
* Kolon (Koloŋ, Kolong)
* Leou (also spelled Léo).

Each of these people groups comprises several clans. The name of a clan is often the same as the name of the clan’s home village or township as noted in the following tables. On the internet Kolon is sometimes misspelled Kulung.

Many Azumeina now live outside their traditional area. For example, there is a significant community of Marba-speaking people in N’Djaména and around Kouroup north of Koyom in the [[Mayo-Boneye|Mayo Boneye]] ([[:fr:Mayo-Boneye|fr]]) department of [[Mayo-Kebbi Est Region|Mayo-Kebbi Est]] ([[:fr:Mayo-Kebbi Est|fr]]).

;Geographical variations
Spoken Marba is often mixed with some [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Chadian Arabic]] words. However, geographical variations of Marba itself are barely significant enough to be called [[dialect]]s if a dialect is defined as distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation. Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation, the term [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] may be preferred over dialect. There is little difference in the Marba spoken by the Marba and Kolon peoples. The differences in speech between the Marba and Kolon tribes on the one hand and the Leou tribe on the other hand are more related to pronunciation than to grammar or vocabulary. This difference affects mainly some vowels.

People who live at the periphery of the Marba-speaking area mix Marba words with words from neighbouring languages. This occurs for example in the Musey area increasingly as one travels from Leou towards [[Pala, Chad|Pala]], [[Gounou Gaya]] and [[Fianga]].

==The various names of the language==

===Azumeina versus Marba===
The Azumeina peoples now prefer to call their language Marba.

However, when their language began to be written down in the 1950s and 1960s, the language was sometimes called Azumeina. The Kolon and Leou clans do not see themselves as ethnically Marba i.e. they are not part of the Marba people group even though they share a common language. This approach had the advantage of avoiding ambiguity between the Marba people group and the wider group of speakers of the common language.

Marba is now generally accepted by the Azumeina peoples as the name of their common language. This approach simplifies discussion about language variations in border regions because differences can be explained more easily in terms of mixing of languages. A disadvantage of this approach is the potential ambiguity of the term Marba between the Marba people group and the wider group of Marba-speaking Azumeina peoples.

The transition to the new approach is illustrated in the following timeline:
* A lexicon published by Colin Price in 1968 was titled ''Azumeina—English Dictionary''&lt;ref name=":PriceC-1968" /&gt; 
* The Holy Bible published by the Alliance Biblique du Tchad (Chadian Bible Society (UBS)) in 1999 carried the French subtitle ''La Sainte Bible en langue Azumeina'' (The Holy Bible in the Azumeina language)&lt;ref name=":Comite-1999" /&gt; 
* The sixth edition of the Azumeina hymn book published in December 2014 by the Marba-language translation committee carried the French subtitle ''Cantiques en langue Marba'' (Songs in the Marba language).&lt;ref name=":Comite-2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Comité de Traduction en Langue Marba (Marba language translation committee)|first1=|title=Sawal la gile Alona – Cantiques en langue Marba|year=2014|publisher=self published|location=Baktchoro|pages=|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of the Marba===
The origin of Marba is historically unknown: no ancient document explains its origin. However Christian Seignobos recorded that the Marba migrated across the [[Logone River]] at the beginning of the 20th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Les migrations gumay ont été, en revanche, quelque peu bousculées par le passage du Logone, au Sud, de colonies marba et [[Musey language|musey]], toujours plus nombreuses. Au début de la période coloniale, les Marba Gogor, aprés leurs démêlés avec le chef Azina Kolon,&lt;!-- voire aussi Price, Colin H. (1968), ibid. p.I --&gt; ont en effet traversé le [[Logone River|Logone]] et les Musey les ont suivis. Faisant irruption dans le ''no man’s land'' dégagé par les Kwang, alors en repli devant les Masa à Vabolo et Kunsul, Marba et Musey ont agrandi le passage entre Kwang et Masa, allant jusqu’à coloniser les abords de la piste [[Bongor]]-Gelendeng. Les fronts pionniers masa avancent moins vite que les colonies marba-musey, disposant du [[Poney Mousseye|poney]]. De tradition guerrière, Marba et Musey suscitent encore la crainte. Aussi les Kwang lâchent-ils pied devant eux et gagnent de leur côté le [[Chari River|Chari]], alors que les Masa ne progressent plus dans cette région. L’interférence marba-musey avec la remontée masa a fait s’infléchir le couloir de migration de ces derniers en direction des Munjuk, au Nord, ce qui complique encore une carte ethnique déjà passablement bigarrée dans cette région de l’interfluve [[Chari River|Chari]]-[[Logone River|Logone]].&lt;ref name=":Seignobos-1986"&gt;{{cite book|language = fr|first1 = Henry|last1 = Tourneux|first2 = Christian|last2 = Seignobos|first3 = Francine|last3 = Lafarge|title = Les Mbara et leur langue (Tchad)|publisher = Peeters Publishers|year = 1986|isbn = 9782852971882|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O079YifWNG4C|access-date = 2015-10-15|page = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An English translation is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Gumay migrations were, however, somewhat diverted by the passage of Logone, in the South, of Marba and Musey colonies, ever more numerous. At the beginning of the colonial period, the Marba Gogor, after their separation from the chief Azina Kolon, crossed the Logone and the Musey followed them. Bursting into the ''no man's land'' cleared by the Kwang, then retreating before the Masa to Vabolo and Kunsul, the Marba and Musey expanded the gap between the Kwang and the Masa, colonising as far as the area around the Bongor-Gelendeng track. The pioneer Masa fronts advanced more slowly than Marba-Musey colonies, with the pony. Of a warrior heritage, the Marba and Musey are still feared. Also the Kwang let them walk in front of them and gained their side of the Chari, while the Masa no longer advanced in this region. The Marba-Musey interference of the rise of the Masa curbed the migration corridor of the latter in the direction of the Munjuk, to the North, further complicating an already quite patchy ethnic map in this region between the Logone and Chari rivers. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Current legends explain the etymology of Marba in various ways as follows:
* A man went out hunting and caught some game. He shared the meat with his brothers but not his father. The father complained that he had been left out i.e. “Mar-ba” where ''mar'' means forget and ''ba'' means father
* Marba was the ancestor of the Marba people group. The names of the Marba clans come from the names of his sons.

Given the practice of naming people after events, these two legends are not necessarily mutually exclusive. On the other hand, they may be more myth than legend.

===Origin of the name Azumeina===
The etymology of Azumeina is historically unknown.

In 1969, Robert Price wrote, “The French know this tribe as the Bananas or the Banana Marba, but the people call themselves the Azumeina. In Azumeina, Banana means ‘my male friend’, and Marba is a clan of the Azumeina! Naturally, the people want to be called by their correct name.”&lt;ref name=":PriceR-1969"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Robert|title='An Article'|date=1969|publisher=Colin Price|location=Sydney|work=reproduced in Price, Colin (1994). The Work of Christian Brethren Missionaries to Chad|pages=208800 words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of colloquial names Banana and Ho Ho===

;Banana
The term Banana was sometimes used during the time of the French administration to refer to the Marba people group. It is derived from the Marba phrase ‘my male friend’.

Legend has it that a French official asked someone what language his friend spoke. The reply, “My friend is Marba” (Banana Marba) was misunderstood to be the name of the people group.

The name Banana is not preferred.&lt;ref name=":PriceR-1969" /&gt;

;Ho Ho
‘Ho Ho’ refers to the traditional practice of communicating over distances by shouting the sound ‘ho’ in the tone of the relevant words. The Marba language has three tones.

==Linguistics==

===Historical survey of linguistic work===
Marba was put into writing during the 20th century by representatives of the Azumeina peoples with the support of the Assemblées Chrétiennes au Tchad, the Roman Catholic Church, the United Bible Societies, SIL and other organisations. This was seen as a means to improve life, preserve Azumeina culture and facilitate education and prosperity.

Between 1920 and 1950, several individuals had compiled word lists. For example, Johannes Lukas published information about Marba in 1937 including a list of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1 = Lukas|first1 = Johannes|title = Zentralsudanische Studien|location = Hamburg|publisher = Friederichsen, de Gruyter|year = 1937|pages = 204|volume = 45|series = Hansische Universität: Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiet der Auslandskunde Nr 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, representatives of the Assemblées Chrétiennes au Tchad published and printed the first book in the Marba language.  This contained 25 hymns and some passages from the Holy Bible, namely the Lord’s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, John 3:16 and Romans 3:23.&lt;ref name=":PriceC-1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Price|first1 = Colin H|title = The Work of Christian Brethren Missionaries to Chad|location = Sydney|publisher = self-published|year = 1994|pages  = 209000 words|nopp = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hymn book was expanded over time with several reprints.

In the mid-1960s the team for promotion and translation of the Marba language finalised an orthography based on a questionnaire that was sent to nearly 500 Marba readers. This orthography was used for the first complete books of the Holy Bible, namely Mark and Ephesians. These were published by the American Bible Society in 1967.&lt;ref name=":PriceC-1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":PriceC-1968"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Price|last2 = Colin H|title = Azumeina - English Dictionary|location = London|publisher = self published|year = 1968|others = 481 pages|url = http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:paradisec.org.au:JW2-Azumeina|pages = I, IV-VI|lay-summary= http://search.language-archives.org/record.html?id=paradisec_org_au_JW2-Azumeina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Price captured his learning in his 500-page “Azumeina-English” lexicon published in 1968.&lt;ref name=":PriceC-1968" /&gt;  Working separately, Franco Nicola published a lexicon in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Nicola|first1 = Franco|title = Vocabulaire Marba|location = Montréal|year = 1970|pages = 214|url = http://glottolog.org/resource/reference/id/309426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the complete New Testament was published in England by the Bible Society (UBS) in 1978, with the support of the Assemblées Chrétiennes au Tchad and the Roman Catholic Church. The Holy Bible, both Old and New Testaments, was initially prepared by the UBS Bible Society in Cameroon (Alliance Biblique du Cameroun) in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = www.biblesociety-cameroon.org|url = http://www.biblesociety-cameroon.org/|website = www.biblesociety-cameroon.org|access-date = 2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was published by the UBS Bible Society in Chad (Alliance Biblique du Tchad) in 1999.&lt;ref name=":Comite-1999" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Marba Genesis Translation - Alliance Biblique du Tchad|url = https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_mpg_gen-1|access-date = 2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthography and phonetics===

====AD 1960 – 2000====

;Orthographic principles
The orthographic principles finalised in the 1960s&lt;ref name=":PriceC-1968" /&gt; remained generally the same up to AD 2000. They were as follows:
* Must be able to be typed on a French typewriter
* Letters (graphemes) should be written in a similar manner to French to minimise additional learning with the exception that ‘ou’ was written ‘u’ in Marba to simplify vowel clusters. This was because French is one of the two official national languages of Chad and was the written language of the milieu.
* Tones should be indicated only to avoid ambiguity with another word because first-language speakers know the tones.

This orthography may be seen online.&lt;ref name=":Comite-1999"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Comité de Traduction en Langue Marba|title = Mbaktumba Halonid’a|location = N'Djaména|publisher = Alliance biblique du Tchad (UBS)|year = 1999|isbn = 9966-40-628-X|url = https://www.bible.com/bible/855/jhn.1.ba|script-title = La Sainte Bible en langue Azumeina|lay-summary = http://www.worldcat.org/title/mbaktumba-halonida/oclc/41639371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":PriceC-1968" /&gt;

;Vowel phonemes and tones
Marba has three tones. Subject to the orthographic principles above, vowels a, e, i, o and u were annotated as follows in order of precedence: dieresis ̈  for long vowels, circumflex ̂  for nasal vowels, acute ́  for high tones, grave ̀  for low tones, mid tones unmarked.&lt;ref name=":PriceC-1968" /&gt;

The apostrophe ' indicated:
* Two adjacent vowels pronounced as separate phonemes (i.e. not diphthongs)
* Implosive consonants, as explained below.

;Consonant phonemes
Consonants were written as noted in Table 1.

;Punctuation
Quotation marks were not used. Speech was reported; direct speech was not used. For example, He said, ''“I ate the rice.”'' was written ''He said that he ate the rice.''

Full stops, question marks, colons and semi colons were used in a similar manner to French (and English).

;Stress, rhythm and intonation

====Current developments in orthography====
Implementation of Unicode in a wider range of computer software in the early 2000s facilitated use of a wider range of letters (graphemes).

In 2009 the government of Chad specified the character set for use for Chadian languages ([[:fr:Alphabet national tchadien|fr]]).

In addition to the letters previously used, the sixth edition of the Marba hymn book&lt;ref name=":Comite-2014" /&gt; published in 2014:
* Simplified the orthography of some consonant phonemes by adding new letters (refer Table 2) 
* Included additional vowel letters Ə ə (U+018A, 0259) and Ɨ ɨ (U+0197, 0268) 
* Used the tilde to indicate nasal vowels instead of the circumflex, which is the preferred linguistic notation for nasalisation.

'''Minangkabau''' (''autonym'': ''Baso Minang(kabau)''; {{lang-id|Bahasa Minangkabau}}) is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] spoken by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of [[West Sumatra]], the western part of [[Riau]], [[South Aceh Regency]], the northern part of [[Bengkulu]] and [[Jambi]], also in several cities throughout [[Indonesia]] by migrated Minangkabau.&lt;ref&gt;Kajian Serba Linguistik : Untuk Anton Moeliono Pereksa Bahasa (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The language is also a [[lingua franca]] along the western coastal region of the province of [[North Sumatra]], and is even used in parts of [[Aceh]], where the language is called ''Aneuk Jamee''. It is also spoken in some parts of [[Malaysia]], especially [[Negeri Sembilan]].

Due to the huge proximity between the Minangkabau language and [[Malay language|Malay]], there is some controversy regarding the relationship between the two. Some see Minangkabau as a nonstandardized [[dialect]] of Malay, while others think of Minangkabau as a proper (Malay) language.

== Malaysia ==
Besides Indonesia, Minangkabau is also spoken in Malaysia, by some descendants of migrants from the Minang-speaking region in Sumatra (''Ranah Minang'', ''Tanah Minang'', or Land of the Minang). Significant numbers of the early migrants settled in what is now the Malaysian state of [[Negeri Sembilan]]; this ''Negeri Sembilan Malay'' is known as ''Bahaso Nogori / Baso Nogoghi''. More recent immigrants are known as ''Minang''.

== Dialects ==
The Minangkabau language has several dialects, sometimes differing between nearby villages (e.g. separated by a river). The dialects are Rao Mapat Tunggul, Muaro Sungai Lolo, Payakumbuh, Pangkalan-Lubuk Alai, Agam-Tanah Datar, Pancungsoal, Kotobaru, Sungai Bendung Air, and Karanganyar.&lt;ref&gt;Nadra, Reniwati, and Efri Yades, Daerah Asal dan Arah Migrasi Orang Minangkabau di Provinsi Jambi Berdasarkan Kajian Variasi Dialektikal (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In everyday communication between Minangkabau people of different regions, the Agam-Tanah Datar dialect (''Baso Padang'' or ''Baso Urang Awak'' "our (people's) language") is often used and has become a kind of standard.

The [[Tapan language]], spoken in the town of Tapan in southern [[West Sumatra]] province, is a recently discovered [[Malayan languages|Malayan language]] which has been proposed as related to but not part of Minangkabau. Together, Tapan and Minangkabau would form a Greater Minangkabau subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstaff.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/15/abstracts/Santi_Yessy_Wichmann_Gil.pdf Santi Kurniati, Yessy Prima Putri, Søren Wichmann and David Gil (2011)." Tapan: An Exploration in Malayic Subgrouping". ISMIL 15 conference presentation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807061443/http://wwwstaff.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/15/abstracts/Santi_Yessy_Wichmann_Gil.pdf |date=2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two languages [[Tapan language|Tapan]] and [[Muko-Muko language|Muko-Muko]] form a ''[[Lunangic languages|Lunangic]]'' subgroup within the ''Minangic'' (Greater Minangkabau) language group.&lt;ref&gt;http://ical13.ling.sinica.edu.tw/Full_papers_and_ppts/July_18/G-32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/12ICAL/abstracts/Kurniati_etal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722002058/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/12ICAL/abstracts/Kurniati_etal.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minangic subgroup is characterized by the following word-final sound changes.&lt;ref&gt;http://ical13.ling.sinica.edu.tw/Full_papers_and_ppts/July_18/G-32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pangwa''' are an ethnic and linguistic group based in the [[Kipengere Range]] on the eastern shore of [[Lake Malawi]], in the [[Ludewa|Ludewa District]] of [[Njombe Region]] in southern [[Tanzania]].  In 2002 the Pangwa population was estimated to number 95,000 [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pbr]. The Pangwa language is a member of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family. 

Alternate names for Pangwa are Ekipangwa and Kipangwa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3200">'''Probabilistic argumentation''' refers to different formal frameworks in the literature. All share the idea that qualitative aspects can be captured by an underlying logic, while quantitative aspects of uncertainty can be accounted for by probabilistic measures.

== Probabilistic labellings ==

The framework of "probabilistic labellings" &lt;ref&gt;see R. Riveret et al. (2018)&lt;/ref&gt; refers to probability spaces where the sample space is a set of labellings of [[argumentation framework|argumentation graphs]]. As a labelling of an argumentation graph associates any argument with a label to reflect the acceptability of the argument (if the labelling is total), the approach of probabilistic labellings allows to associate an arguments with a label probability to reflect the probability of the argument to be labelled as such.

== Probabilistic argumentation systems ==

The name "probabilistic argumentation" has been used to refer to a particular theory of reasoning that encompasses uncertainty and ignorance, combining [[probability theory]] and [[deductive logic]], and thus consisting in a [[probabilistic logic]] {{Harv|Haenni|Kohlas|Lehmann|2000}}. [http://openpas.steweche.co.uk OpenPAS] is an open-source implementation of such a probabilistic argumentation system.

Probabilistic argumentation systems encounter a problem when used to determine the occurrence of [[Black Swan Theory|Black Swan]] events since, by definition, those events are so improbable as to seem impossible.  As such, probabilistic arguments should be considered fallacious arguments known as [[Appeal to probability|appeals to probability]].

{{English grammar}}

In [[linguistics]] and [[grammar]], a '''pronoun''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|pro}}''') is a word that substitutes for a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]]. It is a particular case of a [[pro-form]].

Pronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the [[part of speech|parts of speech]], but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform. Subtypes include [[personal pronoun]]s, [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] and [[reciprocal pronoun|reciprocal]] pronouns, [[possessive pronoun]]s, [[demonstrative pronoun]]s, [[relative pronoun]]s, [[interrogative pronoun]]s, and [[indefinite pronoun]]s.&lt;ref name="Bhat"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhat |first=Darbhe Narayana Shankara |title=Pronouns |date=2007 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0199230242 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–34}}&lt;ref name=Borjars&gt;{{cite book |last=Börjars |first=Kersti |title=Introducing English grammar |date=2010 |publisher=Hodder Education |location=London |isbn=978-1444109870 |edition=2nd |last2=Burridge |first2=Kate |pages=50&amp;ndash;57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of pronouns often involves [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on an [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]. This applies especially to third-person personal pronouns and relative pronouns. For example, in the sentence ''That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat'', the antecedent of the pronoun ''he'' is the noun phrase ''that poor man''.

The [[adjective]] associated with ''pronoun'' is '''''pronominal'''''.{{efn-ua|Not to be confused with ''prenominal'', which means "before the noun". English adjectives are prenominal – ''the '''blue''' house'' — and most of the French adjectives are postnominal — ''la maison '''bleue'''''.}} A pronominal is also a word or phrase that acts as a pronoun. For example, in ''That's not the one I wanted'', the phrase ''the one'' (containing the [[prop-word]] ''one'') is a pronominal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://glossary.sil.org/term/pronominal |title=What is a pronominal? |publisher=SIL International |work=Glossary of linguistic terms |last=Loos |first=Eugene E. |last2=Anderson |first2=Susan |last3=Day |first3=Dwight H.

Personal pronouns may be classified by [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Grammatical case|case]]. English has three persons (first, second and third) and two numbers (singular and plural); in the third person singular there are also distinct pronoun forms for male, female and neuter gender.&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|52–53}} Principal forms are shown in the adjacent table (see also [[English personal pronouns]]).

English personal pronouns have two cases, ''subject'' and ''object''. [[Subject pronoun]]s are used in [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] position ('''''I''' like to eat chips, but '''she''' does not''). [[Object pronoun]]s are used for the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of a verb or [[preposition]] (''John likes '''me''' but not '''her''''').&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|52–53}}

Other distinct forms found in some languages include:
* [[T-V distinction|Second person informal and formal pronouns]] (the T-V distinction), like ''tu'' and ''vous'' in French. There is no such distinction in standard modern English, though Elizabethan English marked the distinction with ''[[thou]]'' (singular informal) and ''you'' (plural or singular formal), and this is preserved in some dialects.
* [[Inclusive and exclusive we|Inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns]], which indicate whether or not the audience is included, that is, whether "we" means "you and I" or "they and I". There is no such distinction in English.
* [[Intensive pronoun|Intensive (emphatic) pronouns]], which re-emphasize a noun or pronoun that has already been mentioned. English uses the same forms as the reflexive pronouns; for example: ''I did it '''myself''''' (contrast reflexive use, ''I did it to myself'').
* Direct and indirect object pronouns, such as ''le'' and ''lui'' in [[French personal pronouns|French]]. English uses the same form for both; for example: ''Mary loves '''him''''' (direct object); ''Mary sent '''him''' a letter'' (indirect object).
* [[Prepositional pronoun]]s, used after a [[preposition]]. English uses ordinary object pronouns here: ''Mary looked at '''him'''''.
* [[Disjunctive pronoun]]s, used in isolation or in certain other special grammatical contexts, like ''moi'' in French. No distinct forms exist in English; for example: ''Who does this belong to? '''Me'''.''
* [[Weak pronoun|Strong and weak forms]] of certain pronouns, found in some languages such as Polish.

Some special uses of personal pronouns include:
* [[Generic you|Generic ''you'']], where second person pronouns are used in an indefinite sense: '''''You''' can't buy good old-fashioned bulbs these days.'' 
* [[Generic they|Generic ''they'']]: ''In China '''they''' drive on the right.''
* [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|Gender non-specific]] uses, where a pronoun needs to be found to refer to a person whose sex is not specified. Solutions sometimes used in English include [[generic he|generic ''he'']] and [[singular they|singular ''they'']].
* [[Dummy pronoun]]s ([[syntactic expletive|expletive]] pronouns), used to satisfy a grammatical requirement for a noun or pronoun, but contributing nothing to meaning: '''''It''' is raining.''.
* [[Resumptive pronoun]]s, "intrusive" personal pronouns found (for example) in some relative clauses where a gap ([[trace (linguistics)|trace]]) might be expected: ''This is the girl that I don’t know what '''she''' said.''

===Reflexive and reciprocal===
{{Main article|Reflexive pronoun|Reciprocal pronoun}}
Reflexive pronouns are used when a person or thing acts on itself, for example, ''John cut '''himself'''.'' In English they all end in ''-self'' or ''-selves'' and must refer to a noun phrase elsewhere in the same clause.&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|55}}

Reciprocal pronouns refer to a reciprocal relationship (''each other'', ''one another''). They must refer to a noun phrase in the same clause.&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|55}} An example in English is: ''They do not like '''each other'''.'' In some languages, the same forms can be used as both reflexive and reciprocal pronouns.

===Possessive===
{{Main article|Possessive|Possessive determiner}}
Possessive pronouns are used to indicate [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (in a broad sense). Some occur as independent noun phrases: ''mine'', ''yours'', ''hers'', ''ours'', ''yours'', ''theirs''. An example is: ''Those clothes are '''mine'''.'' Others act as a determiner (adjective) and must accompany a noun: ''my'', ''your'', ''her'', ''our'', ''your'', ''their'', as in: ''I lost '''my''' wallet.'' (''His'' and ''its'' can fall into either category, although ''its'' is nearly always found in the second.) Those of the second type have traditionally also been described as possessive [[adjective]]s, and in more modern terminology as [[possessive determiner]]s. The term "possessive pronoun" is sometimes restricted to the first type. Both types replace [[possessive]] noun phrases. As an example, '''''Their''' crusade to capture our attention'' could replace '''''The advertisers' '''crusade to capture our attention.''&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|55–56}}

===Demonstrative===
{{Main article|Demonstrative pronoun}}
Demonstrative pronouns (in English, ''this'', ''that'' and their plurals ''these'', ''those'') often distinguish their targets by pointing or some other indication of position; for example, ''I'll take '''these'''.'' They may also be ''[[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]]'', depending on an earlier expression for context, for example, ''A kid actor would try to be all sweet, and who needs '''that'''?''&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|56}}

===Indefinite===
{{Main article|Indefinite pronoun}}
Indefinite pronouns, the largest group of pronouns, refer to one or more unspecified persons or things. One group in English includes compounds of ''some-'', ''any-'', ''every-'' and ''no-'' with ''-thing'', ''-one'' and ''-body'', for example: '''''Anyone''' can do that.'' Another group, including ''many'', ''more'', ''both'', and ''most'', can appear alone or followed by ''of''.&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|54–55}} In addition,
* [[Distributive pronoun]]s are used to refer to members of a group separately rather than collectively. (''To '''each''' his own.'')
* [[Negation (linguistics)|Negative pronouns]] indicate the non-existence of people or things. ('''''Nobody''' thinks that.'')
* [[Impersonal pronoun]]s normally refer to a person, but are not specific as to first, second or third person in the way that the personal pronouns are. ('''''One''' does not clean '''one's''' own windows.'')

===Relative===
{{Main article|Relative pronoun}}
Relative pronouns (''who'', ''whom'', ''whose'', ''what'', ''which'' and ''that'') refer back to people or things previously mentioned: ''People '''who''' smoke should quit now.'' They are used in [[relative clause]]s.&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|56}}

===Interrogative===
{{Main article|Interrogative word}}
Interrogative pronouns ask which person or thing is meant. In reference to a person, one may use ''who'' (subject), ''whom'' (object) or ''whose'' (possessive); for example, '''''Who''' did that?'' In colloquial speech, ''[[whom]]'' is generally replaced by ''who''. English non-personal interrogative pronouns (''which'' and ''what'') have only one form.&lt;ref name=Borjars/&gt;{{rp|56–57}}

In English and many other languages (e.g. [[French language|French]] and [[Czech language|Czech]]), the sets of relative and interrogative pronouns are nearly identical. Compare English: '''''Who''' is that?'' (interrogative) and ''I know the woman '''who''' came'' (relative). In some other languages, interrogative pronouns and indefinite pronouns are frequently identical; for example, [[Standard Chinese]] 什么 ''shénme'' means "what?" as well as "something" or "anything".

===Archaic forms===

|}

Though the personal pronouns described above are the ''contemporary'' English pronouns, older forms of ''modern'' English (as used by Shakespeare, for example) use a slightly different set of personal pronouns as shown in the table. The difference is entirely in the second person. Though one would rarely find these older forms used in literature from recent centuries, they are nevertheless considered ''modern''.

{{-}}

==Antecedents==
The use of pronouns often involves [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on another referential element. The [[referent]] of the pronoun is often the same as that of a preceding (or sometimes following) noun phrase, called the [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] of the pronoun. The following sentences give examples of particular types of pronouns used with antecedents:
*Third-person personal pronouns:
**'''''That poor man''' looks as if '''he''' needs a new coat.'' (the noun phrase ''that poor man'' is the antecedent of ''he'')
**'''''Julia''' arrived yesterday. I met '''her''' at the station.'' (''Julia'' is the antecedent of ''her'')
**''When '''they''' saw us, '''the lions''' began roaring'' (''the lions'' is the antecedent of ''they''; as it comes after the pronoun it may be called a ''postcedent'')
*Other personal pronouns in some circumstances:
**'''''Terry and I''' were hoping no-one would find '''us'''.'' (''Terry and I'' is the antecedent of ''us'')
**'''''You and Alice''' can come if '''you''' like.'' (''you and Alice'' is the antecedent of the second – plural – ''you'')
*Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns:
**'''''Jack''' hurt '''himself'''.'' (''Jack'' is the antecedent of ''himself'')
**'''''We''' were teasing '''each other'''.'' (''we'' is the antecedent of ''each other'')
*Relative pronouns:
**'''''The woman who''' looked at you is my sister.'' (''the woman'' is the antecedent of ''who'')

Some other types, such as [[indefinite pronoun]]s, are usually used without antecedents. Relative pronouns are used without antecedents in [[free relative clause]]s. Even third-person personal pronouns are sometimes used without antecedents ("unprecursed") – this applies to special uses such as [[dummy pronoun]]s and [[generic they|generic ''they'']], as well as cases where the referent is implied by the context.

==Theoretical considerations==
Pronouns ''(antōnymía)'' are listed as one of [[Part of speech#Western tradition|eight parts of speech]] in ''[[The Art of Grammar]]'', a treatise on Greek grammar attributed to [[Dionysius Thrax]] and dating from the 2nd century BC. The pronoun is described there as "a part of speech substitutable for a noun and marked for a person." Pronouns continued to be regarded as a part of speech in [[Latin]] grammar (the Latin term being ''pronomen'', from which the English name – through [[Middle French]] – ultimately derives), and thus in the European tradition generally.

In more modern approaches, pronouns are less likely to be considered to be a single [[word class]], because of the many different syntactic roles that they play, as represented by the various different types of pronouns listed in the previous sections.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Vulf Plotkin (''The Language System of English'', Universal Publishers, 2006, pp. 82–83) writes: "[...] Pronouns exemplify such a word class, or rather several smaller classes united by an important semantic distinction between them and all the major parts of speech. The latter denote things, phenomena and their properties in the ambient world. [...] Pronouns, on the contrary, do not denote anything, but refer to things, phenomena or properties without involving their peculiar nature."&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain types of pronouns are often identical or similar in form to [[determiner (class)|determiner]]s with related meaning; some English examples are given in the table on the right. This observation has led some linguists, such as [[Paul Postal]], to regard pronouns as determiners that have had their following noun or noun phrase deleted.&lt;ref name=Postal&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Such patterning can even be claimed for certain personal pronouns; for example, ''we'' and ''you'' might be analyzed as determiners in phrases like ''we Brits'' and ''you tennis players''.) Other linguists have taken a similar view, uniting pronouns and determiners into a single class, sometimes called "determiner-pronoun", or regarding determiners as a subclass of pronouns or vice versa. The distinction may be considered to be one of [[subcategorization]] or [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], rather like the distinction between [[transitivity (grammar)|transitive and intransitive]] verbs – determiners take a noun phrase [[complement (grammar)|complement]] like transitive verbs do, while pronouns do not.&lt;ref&gt;For detailed discussion see George D. Morley, ''Explorations in Functional Syntax: A New Framework for Lexicogrammatical Analysis'', Equinox Publishing Ltd., 2004, pp. 68–73.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the [[determiner phrase]] viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of the phrase.

The grammatical behavior of certain types of pronouns, and in particular their possible relationship with their antecedents, has been the focus of studies in [[Binding (linguistics)|binding]], notably in the Chomskyan [[government and binding theory]]. In this context, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns (such as ''himself'' and ''each other'') are referred to as [[anaphor]]s (in a specialized restricted sense) rather than as pronominal elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13056">'''Proto-Mayan''' is the hypothetical common ancestor of the 30 living [[Mayan languages]], as well as the [[Classic Maya language]] documented in the [[Maya script|Maya inscriptions]]. While there has been some controversy with Mayan subgrouping, there has been a general agreement that the following are the main five subgroups of the family: Huastecan, Yucatecan, Cholan-Tzeltalan, Kanjobalan-Chujean, and Quichean-Mamean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAYAN LINGUISTICS:WHERE ARE WE NOW?|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.an.14.100185.001155|language=en|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
The Proto-Mayan language is reconstructed (Campbell and Kaufman 1985) as having the following sounds:

Five vowels: '''''a''''', '''''e''''', '''''i''''', '''''o''''' and '''''u'''''.
Each of these occurring as short and long: '''''aa''''', '''''ee''''', '''''ii''''', '''''oo''''' and '''''uu''''',

===Developments===

The palatalized plosives {{IPA|[tʲʼ]}} and {{IPA|[tʲ]}} are not carried down into any of the modern families. Instead they are reflected differently in different branches allowing a reconstruction of these phonemes as palatalized plosives. In the western branch (Chujean-Q'anjob'alan and Cholan) they are reflected as {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[tʼ]}}. In Mamean they are reflected as {{IPA|[ts]}} and {{IPA|[tsʼ]}} and in Yukatek and K'ichean as {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}} and {{IPA|[tʃʼ]}}.&lt;ref name="England 1994, p.35"&gt;England (1994), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proto-Mayan liquid {{IPA|[r]}} is reflected as {{IPA|[j]}} in the western languages (Chujean- Q'anjob'alan and Cholan), Huastecan and Yukatek but as {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}} in Mamean and {{IPA|[r]}} in K'ichean and Poqom.&lt;ref name="England 1994, p.35"/&gt;

Proto-Mayan velar nasal {{IPA|*[ŋ]}} is reflected as {{IPA|[x]}} in the eastern branches (K'ichean Mamean), as {{IPA|[n]}} in Q'anjob'alan, Cholan and Yukatekan, and only conserved as {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in Chuj and Poptí.&lt;ref&gt;England (1994), pp.30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In Huastecan {{IPA|*[ŋ]}} is reflected as {{IPA|[h]}}.

The changes of Proto-Mayan glottal fricative {{IPA|[h]}} are many and it has different reflexes according to position. In some positions it has added length to the preceding vowel in languages that preserve a length distinction. In other languages it has the reflexes {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, {{IPA|[x]}} or a zero-reflex.&lt;ref&gt;England (1994), p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only K'ichean-Mamean and some Q'anjob'alan languages have retained Proto-Mayan uvular stops {{IPA|[q]}} and {{IPA|[qʼ]}} whereas all other branches have changed these into {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[kʼ]}} respectively.

In Mamean a chain shift took place changing {{IPA|*[r]}} into {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|*[t]}} into {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|*[tʃ]}} into {{IPA|[tʂ]}} and {{IPA|*[ʃ]}} into {{IPA|[ʂ]}}. These retroflex affricates and fricatives later diffused into Q'anjob'alan.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1997),  p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[polysyllabic]] words Kaqchikel and Tz'utujil have changed a final Proto-Mayan {{IPA|*[w]}} and {{IPA|*[ɓ]}} into {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|*[ʔ]}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle, 1998, "Historical Linguistics", Thames &amp; Hudson p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

Huastecan is the only branch to have changed Proto-Mayan {{IPA|*[w]}} into {{IPA|[b]}}. Wastek also is the only Mayan language to have a phonemic labialized velar phoneme {{IPA|[kʷ]}}, but this is known to be a postcolonial development. Comparing colonial documents in Wastek to modern Wastek it can be seen that they were originally clusters of {{IPA|[k]}} and a rounded vowel followed by a glide. For example the word for "vulture" which in modern Wastek is pronounced {{IPA|[kʷiːʃ]}} was written   &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;cuyx&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; in colonial Wastek and pronounced {{IPA|[kuwiːʃ]}}.

The Yucatecan languages have all shifted Proto-Mayan {{IPA|*[t]}} into {{IPA|[tʃ]}} in wordfinal position.

Several languages particularly Cholan and Yucatecan have changed short {{IPA|[a]}} into {{IPA|[ɨ]}}.

All Cholan languages have changed long proto-Mayan vowels {{IPA|[eː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}} into {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} respectively.

Vowel length distinction has been lost in Q'anjob'alan-Chujean (except for Mocho' and Akateko), Kaqchikel and Cholan. Some languages have reduced the vowel length distinction into a tense lax distinction that was later lost for most vowels, Kaqchikel however retains a centralized lax [[schwa]]-like vowel as a reflex of Proto-Mayan {{IPA|[a]}}.&lt;ref&gt;England (1994), pp.110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Two languages, Yukatek and Uspantek and one dialect of Tzotzil have introduced a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] distinction in vowels between high and low tones as reflexes of former vowel length and {{IPA|[h]}} and {{IPA|[ʔ]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6501">[[File:Bedes Britain by Reginald Piggott.jpg|thumb|''Bede's Britain'' c. 700 by Reginald Piggott, 2012. Drawn for the University of Cambridge.]]
'''Reginald "Reg" Piggott''' (1930 – c. 2014) was a British book [[cartographer]] whose maps were known for their elegance, clarity, and distinctive italic script. His work was published by [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[The Folio Society]] among other presses. Early in his life, he was a campaigner for better handwriting and in 1957 organised a survey of British handwriting which drew over 25,000 responses and was subsequently published in book form. He advocated the use of a form of italic script to replace the civil service script widely used in Britain which he thought tended to illegibility when written at speed.

==Early life and family==
Reginald Piggott was born in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;British Library catalogue. Retrieved 23 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He married Marjorie. He was a long time resident of Decoy Lodge, Decoy Road, [[Potter Heigham]], Norfolk.

==Handwriting survey==
In February 1957,&lt;ref&gt;"Handwriting", Reginald Piggott, Letters to the Editor, ''The Observer'', 17 February 1957, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; eleven newspapers and journals published a letter from Reginald Piggott of 10 Finlay Drive, Dennistoun, Glasgow, in which he requested samples of handwriting. By far the greatest response came from readers of ''[[The Observer]]'' whose readers sent him 15,000 samples of their writing. In an article in that paper in March 1957, Piggott explained that he had been interested in the history of handwriting since he had begun to study [[calligraphy]] and that he wished to develop a "practical, everyday cursive" script to replace the civil service style then in use in Britain that was derived from Victorian [[Copperplate script|copperplate writing]] but which tended to illegibility when written at speed. By gathering samples of handwriting, he hoped to develop a new style that would command widespread acceptance. He made clear that he was not a [[Graphology|graphologist]] and was not offering insights into the character of the writer.&lt;ref name=obs&gt;"Handwriting To-morrow", Reginald Piggott, ''The Observer'', 10 March 1957, pp. 10 &amp; 12. ProQuest Historical Newspapers. Retrieved 4 July 2016. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piggott envisaged a simplified script that dispensed with loops and flourishes and reduced letter forms to as fundamental a shape as possible. In a [[running script]], joins were to be made in the simplest manner. He went on to discuss the beauty of [[italic script]], which he used in his own writing, and the unsuitability of the [[ball point pen]] to produce it before concluding that once his research was complete "and it is certain that the new style is near perfect", then it could be widely adopted, leading to a great improvement in the handwriting of the nation.&lt;ref name=obs/&gt;

==Cartography==
Piggott's cartography was known for its clarity and elegance which was aided by his distinctive italic lettering. In 2014, the travel writer [[Nicholas Crane]] described him as "the most brilliant book-cartographer of our generation".&lt;ref&gt;"Cartographers: Masters of omission" by Nicholas Crane in ''Folio'', March 2014, pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

He produced numerous maps for Cambridge University Press,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemble.asnc.cam.ac.uk/node/79 Maps of Anglo-Saxon England.] Kemble: The Anglo-Saxon Charters Website. Retrieved 22 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a long association with The Folio Society for whose books he produced many works, including a double page map of the spread of the [[Great Fire of London]] which was included in their volume on that subject published in 2003. He prepared the maps for ''[[The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain]]'' (1984) and with his wife Marjorie for volumes of [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s ''The Buildings of England''.

In 2012, Aurum Press published ''Mile by mile London to Paris'' in which the route between the cities was mapped out by Piggott with a text by Matt Thompson, assuming a journey by the [[Golden Arrow (train)|Golden Arrow]], when it existed, and the [[Eurostar]] more recently.

In [[United States law]], a '''statement against penal interest''' is a statement that puts the statement-maker at risk of prosecution.  It is the criminal equivalent of a [[statement against interest]], a statement a person would not normally make, which would put them in a disadvantaged position to that they would have had if they had not made the statement in the first place.

In certain circumstances, it can be a factor in allowing as evidence statements that would otherwise be excluded through the law of [[hearsay]].&lt;ref&gt;See Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(4), available at https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rules.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistic_typology_topics}}

The '''syntactic pivot''' is the [[verb argument]] around which [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s "revolve" in a given [[language]]. This usually means the following:

*If the [[verb]] has more than zero arguments, then one argument is the syntactic pivot.
*If the verb agrees with at least one of its arguments, then it agrees with the syntactic pivot.
*In coordinated propositions, in languages where an argument can be left out, the omitted argument is the syntactic pivot.

The first two characteristics have to do with simple [[morphosyntax]], and from them, it is quite obvious the syntactic pivot in [[English language|English]] (and most other European languages) is called the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. An English verb cannot lack a subject (even in the [[imperative mood]], the subject is implied to be "you" and is not ambiguous or unspecified) and cannot have just a direct [[object (grammar)|object]] and no subject; and (at least in the present tense, and for the verb ''to be'') it agrees partially with the subject.

The third point deserves an explanation. Consider the following sentence:

:I shot the deer and killed it.

There are two coordinated propositions, and the second proposition lacks an explicit subject, but since the subject is the syntactic pivot, the second proposition is assumed to have the same subject as the first one. One cannot do so with a direct object (in English). The result would be ungrammatical or have a different meaning:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;I shot the deer and I killed.
&lt;!-- 'it' deliberately deleted --&gt;
The syntactic pivot is a feature of the [[morphosyntactic alignment]] of the language. In [[nominative–accusative language]]s, the syntactic pivot is the so-called "subject" (the argument marked with the [[nominative case]]). In [[ergative–absolutive language]]s, the syntactic pivot may be the argument marked with the [[absolutive case]] but not always so since ergative languages are often not "pure" and show a mixed behaviour (they can have ergative morphology and accusative syntax).

Languages with a [[passive voice]] construction may resort to it to allow the default syntactic pivot to shift its semantic role (from agent to patient) in a coordinated proposition:

:He worked hard and was awarded a prize.

It is easier in English because it is secundative in passives and dative/unmarked in active and in passive with pronouns.

==Varieties and related languages==
Thai is the [[official language]] of Thailand, natively spoken by, according to Ethnologue, over 20&amp;nbsp;million people (2000). In reality, the number of native Thai speakers is likely to be much higher, since the Thai people of [[Thai Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] origins throughout the country learn it as their first language. The populations of western and eastern parts of Thailand, which had since ancient time formed the core territory of Siam, also speak central Thai as their first language. Moreover, most Thais in the northern and the northeastern (Isaan) parts of the country today are bilingual speakers of Central Thai and their respective regional dialects due to the fact that (Central) Thai is the language of television, education, news reporting, and all forms of media.&lt;ref name=bangkok&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent research finds that the speakers of [[Northern Thai language]] (or Kham Mueang) have become so few, as most people in northern Thailand now invariably speak standard Thai, such that they are now using mostly central Thai words and seasoning their speech only with "kham mueang" accent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|first1=Pim|last1=Kemasingki|first2= Pariyakorn|last2= Prateepkoh|title= Kham Mueang: the slow death of a language|journal= Chiang Mai City Life|date= August 1, 2017|page=8|quote=there are still many people speaking kham mueang, but as an accent, not as a language.

Linguists refer to Bangkok Thai as "Thonburi-side dialect", which was originally spoken by [[Iranians in Thailand|Persians origin]] and the residents of Portuguese origin. The name of Krungthep refers to Phra-Nakhon side, which is spoken mainly by [[Thai Chinese|Sino-Siamese]] and Mon-Siamese residents; the Royal Society classified it as Chinese accent. The ''Outer Bangkok'' dialect is a more lenient concept to linguists, and is usually referred to as Ayutthayan dialect, for being a standard dialect spoken by [[Thai people|Siamese]] and [[Mon people|Siamese of ethnic Mon]], which originated in [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya Province]] and [[Pathum Thani Province]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linguistic register|register]] in the educated classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to Central Thai, Thailand is home to other related [[Tai languages]]. Although some linguists classify these dialects as related but distinct languages, there is a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between these regional dialects/languages. Nonetheless, it is often claimed that the [[Thaification|language policy]] of the Thai government{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} has shaped the dominant view that these languages are only regional variants or dialects of the "same" Thai language, or as "different kinds of Thai".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antonio L.

*[[Isan language|Isan]] (Northeastern Thai), the language of the [[Isan]] region of Thailand, a collective term for the various [[Lao language|Lao]] dialects spoken in Thailand that show some Central Thai influences, which is written with the [[Thai script]]. It is spoken by about 20&amp;nbsp;million people. Thais from both inside and outside the Isan region often simply call this variant "Lao" when speaking informally.
*[[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]] (Phasa Nuea, Lanna, Kam Mueang, or [[Thai Yuan]]), spoken by about 6&amp;nbsp;million (1983) in the formerly independent kingdom of [[Lanna]] ([[Chiang Mai]]).

===Registers===
Central Thai is composed of several distinct [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], forms for different social contexts:
*Street or Common Thai ({{wiktth|ภาษาพูด}}, ''phasa phut'', spoken Thai): informal, without polite terms of address, as used between close relatives and friends.
*Elegant or Formal Thai ({{wiktth|ภาษาเขียน}}, ''phasa khian'', written Thai): official and written version, includes respectful terms of address; used in simplified form in newspapers.
*Rhetorical Thai: used for public speaking.
*Religious Thai: (heavily influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]]) used when discussing Buddhism or addressing monks.
*Royal Thai (ราชาศัพท์, ''racha sap''): influenced by [[Khmer language|Khmer]], this is used when addressing members of the [[Royal Family of Thailand|royal family]] or describing their activities. (See {{section link|Monarchy of Thailand|Rachasap}}.)

Most Thais can speak and understand all of these contexts. Street and Elegant Thai are the basis of all conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/TH-language.htm|title=The Languages spoken in Thailand|website=Studycountry|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Rhetorical, religious, and royal Thai are taught in schools as the national curriculum.

==Script==
{{main|Thai alphabet|Thai braille}}

Many scholars believe{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that the Thai script is derived from the [[Khmer script]]. Certainly the numbers were lifted directly from Khmer. The language and its script are closely related to the [[Lao language]] and [[Lao script|script]]. Most literate Lao are able to read and understand Thai, as more than half of the Thai vocabulary, grammar, intonation, vowels and so forth are common with the Lao language.

Much like the Burmese adopted the [[Mon alphabet|Mon script]] (which also has Indic origins), the Thais adopted and modified the Khmer script to create their own writing system. While in Thai the pronunciation can largely be inferred from the script, the orthography is complex, with silent letters to preserve original spellings and many letters representing the same sound. While the oldest known inscription in the [[Khmer language]] dates from 611 CE, inscriptions in Thai writing began to appear around 1292 CE. Notable features include:

#It is an [[abugida]] script, in which the [[implicit vowel]] is a short {{IPA|/a/}} in a syllable without final [[consonant]] and a short {{IPA|/o/}} in a syllable with final consonant.
#Tone markers, if present, are placed above the final [[Syllable onset#Onset|onset]] consonant of the syllable.
#[[Vowel]]s sounding after an initial consonant can be located before, after, above or below the consonant, or in a combination of these positions.

===Transcription===
{{Main|Romanization of Thai}}
There is no universally applied method for transcribing Thai into the Latin alphabet. For example, the name of the main airport is transcribed variously as Suvarnabhumi, Suwannaphum, or Suwunnapoom. Guide books, textbooks and dictionaries may each follow different systems. For this reason, most language courses recommend that learners master the Thai script.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Official standards are the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]] (RTGS), published by the [[Royal Institute of Thailand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royin.go.th/ Royal Thai General System of Transcription], published by the Thai Royal Institute only in Thai&lt;/ref&gt; and the almost identical {{nobreak|[[ISO 11940-2]]}} defined by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]. The RTGS system is increasingly used in Thailand by central and local governments, especially for road signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ooh5.go.th/book/CA/CA01.pdf|at=Appendix ง|language=Thai|title=Handbook and standard for traffic signs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main drawbacks are that it does not indicate tone or vowel length. As the system is based on pronunciation, not orthography, reconstruction of Thai spelling from RTGS romanisation is not possible.

===Transliteration===
{{Main|Thai transliteration}}
The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] published an international standard for the [[Thai transliteration|transliteration of Thai]] into Roman script in September 2003 ([[ISO 11940]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=29544 ISO Standard].&lt;/ref&gt; By adding diacritics to the Latin letters, it makes the transcription reversible, making it a true [[transliteration]]. Notably, this system is used by [[Google Translate]], although it seems not to appear in many other contexts, such as textbooks and other instructional media. This may be because the particular problems of writing Thai for foreigners, including silent letters and placement of vowel markers, decrease the usefulness of literal transliteration.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}

===Consonants===

====Initials====
Thai distinguishes three [[voice-onset time]]s among plosive and affricate consonants:
*[[voiced consonant|voiced]]
*[[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (unvoiced, unaspirated)
*[[aspirated consonant|aspirated]]

Where English makes a distinction between voiced {{IPA|/b/}} and aspirated {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, Thai distinguishes a third sound that is neither voiced nor aspirated, which occurs in English only as an allophone of {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, for example after an {{ipa|/s/}} as in the sound of the ''p'' in "spin". There is similarly an alveolar  {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/tʰ/}} triplet in Thai. In the velar series there is a {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/kʰ/}} pair and in the postalveolar series a {{IPA|/t͡ɕ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡ɕʰ/}} pair, but the language lacks the corresponding voiced sounds {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/dʑ/}}. (In loanwords from English, English {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} are borrowed as the tenuis stops {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/t͡ɕ/}}.)

In each cell below, the first line indicates [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the second indicates the Thai characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation). Note also that ห, one of the two ''h'' letters, is also used to help write certain tones (described below).

:&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ฃ and ฅ are no longer used. Thus, modern Thai is said to have 42 consonant letters.
:&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; Initial อ is silent and therefore considered as a [[glottal stop]].
&lt;/small&gt;

====Finals====
Although the overall 44 Thai consonant letters provide 21 sounds in case of initials, the case for finals is different. For finals, only eight sounds, as well as no sound, called ''mātrā'' ({{wiktth|มาตรา}}) are used. To demonstrate, at the end of a syllable, บ ({{IPA|/b/}}) and ด ({{IPA|/d/}}) are devoiced, becoming pronounced as {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} respectively. Additionally, all plosive sounds are [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]]. Hence, final {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} sounds are pronounced as {{IPA|[p̚]}}, {{IPA|[t̚]}}, and {{IPA|[k̚]}} respectively.

Of the consonant letters, excluding the disused ฃ and ฅ, six (ฉ ผ ฝ ห อ ฮ) cannot be used as a final and the other 36 are grouped as following.

| 
|
|}

:&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; The glottal plosive appears at the end when no final follows a short vowel&lt;/small&gt;

====Clusters====
In Thai, each syllable in a word is considered separate from the others, so combinations of consonants from adjacent syllables are never recognised as a cluster. Thai has [[Phonotactics|phonotactical constraints]] that define permissible syllable structure, [[consonant cluster]]s, and vowel sequences. Original Thai vocabulary introduces only 11 combined consonantal patterns:
* {{IPA|/kr/}} (กร), {{IPA|/kl/}} (กล), {{IPA|/kw/}} (กว)
* {{IPA|/kʰr/}} (ขร,คร), {{IPA|/kʰl/}} (ขล,คล), {{IPA|/kʰw/}} (ขว,คว)
* {{IPA|/pr/}} (ปร), {{IPA|/pl/}} (ปล)
* {{IPA|/pʰr/}} (พร), {{IPA|/pʰl/}} (ผล,พล)
* {{IPA|/tr/}} (ตร)

The number of clusters increases when a few more combinations are presented in loanwords such as {{IPA|/tʰr/}} (ทร) in {{wiktth|อินทรา}} ({{IPA|/intʰraː/}}, from Sanskrit ''indrā'') or {{IPA|/fr/}} (ฟร) in {{wiktth|ฟรี}} ({{IPA|/friː/}}, from English ''free''); however, it can be observed that Thai language supports only those in initial position, with either {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, or {{IPA|/w/}} as the second consonant sound and not more than two sounds at a time.

===Vowels===
The vowel nuclei of the Thai language, which includes monophthongs and opening diphthongs, are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], the second entry gives the spelling in the [[Thai alphabet]], where a dash (–) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant must follow.

The vowels each exist in [[vowel length|long-short pairs]]: these are distinct [[phoneme]]s forming unrelated words in Thai,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tingsabadh &amp; Abramson|1993|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but usually transliterated the same: เขา (''khao'') means "he" or "she", while ขาว (''khao'') means "white".

}}
There are five phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]: mid, low, falling, high, and rising, sometimes referred to in older reference works as ''rectus, gravis, circumflexus, altus,'' and ''demissus,'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, Oscar. Elements of Siamese grammar with appendices. American Presbyterian mission press, 1900 [https://books.google.com/books?id=h6U6AAAAMAAJ] (Full text available on Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; The table shows an example of both the [[phoneme|phonemic]] tones and their [[phonetics|phonetic]] realization, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].
&lt;!-- The whole point of this table is to illustrate phonetic detail of the tones. This doesn't occur anywhere else, and is from the IPA Handbook. --&gt;
[[File:Thai tones.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Thai language tone chart]]

The full complement of tones exists only in so-called "live syllables", those that end in a long vowel or a [[sonorant]] ({{IPA|/m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /j/, /w/}}).

For "dead syllables", those that end in a plosive ({{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}}) or in a short vowel, only three tonal distinctions are possible: low, high, and falling. Because syllables analyzed as ending in a short vowel may have a final [[glottal stop]] (especially in slower speech), all "dead syllables" are phonetically [[Checked tone|checked]], and have the reduced tonal inventory characteristic of checked syllables.

==Grammar==
{{main|Thai grammar}}
From the perspective of [[linguistic typology]], Thai can be considered to be an [[analytic language]]. The [[word order]] is [[subject–verb–object]], although the subject is often [[Pro-drop language|omitted]]. Thai pronouns are selected according to the gender and relative status of speaker and audience.

===Adjectives and adverbs===
There is no morphological distinction between [[adverbs]] and [[adjectives]]. Many words can be used in either function. They follow the word they modify, which may be a noun, verb, or another adjective or adverb.
*คนอ้วน (''khon uan'', {{IPA|[kʰon ʔûən ]}}) ''a fat person''
*คนที่อ้วนเร็ว (''khon thi uan reo'', {{IPA|[khon tʰîː ʔûən rew]}}) ''a person who became fat quickly''

[[Comparison (grammar)|Comparative]]s take the form "A X กว่า  B" (''kwa'', {{IPA|[kwàː]}}), ''A is more X than B''. The [[superlative]] is expressed as "A X ที่สุด" (''thi sut'', {{IPA|[tʰîːsùt]}}), ''A is most X''.
*เขาอ้วนกว่าฉัน (''khao uan kwa chan'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw ʔûən kwàː tɕ͡ʰǎn]}}) ''S/he is fatter than me.''
*เขาอ้วนที่สุด (''khao uan thi sut'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw ʔûən tʰîːsùt]}}) ''S/he is the fattest (of all).''

Because adjectives can be used as complete predicates, many words used to indicate tense in verbs (see Verbs:Tense below) may be used to describe adjectives.
*ฉันหิว (''chan hiu'', {{IPA|[tɕ͡ʰǎn hǐw]}}) ''I am hungry.''
*ฉันจะหิว (''chan cha hiu'', {{IPA|[tɕ͡ʰǎn tɕ͡àʔ hǐw]}}) ''I will be hungry.''
*ฉันกำลังหิว (''chan kamlang hiu'', {{IPA|[tɕ͡ʰǎn kamlaŋ hǐw]}}) ''I am hungry right now.''
*ฉันหิวแล้ว (''chan hiu laeo'', {{IPA|[tɕ͡ʰǎn hǐw lɛ́ːw]}}) ''I am already hungry.''

:* '''Remark''' ฉันหิวแล้ว mostly means "I am hungry right now" because normally, แล้ว ({{IPA|[lɛ́ːw]}}) marks the change of a state, but แล้ว has many other uses as well. For example, in the sentence, แล้วเธอจะไปไหน ({{IPA|[lɛ́ːw tʰɤː tɕ͡àʔ paj nǎj]}}): ''So where are you going?'', แล้ว ({{IPA|[lɛ́ːw]}}) is used as a discourse particle.

===Verbs===
[[Verb]]s do not [[inflected language|inflect]]. They do not change with person, tense, voice, mood, or number; nor are there any [[participles]].
* ฉันตีเขา (''chan ti khao'', {{IPA|[t͡ɕʰǎn tiː kʰǎw]}}), ''I hit him''.
* เขาตีฉัน (''khao ti chan'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw tiː t͡ɕʰǎn]}}), ''He hit me''.
The [[passive voice]] is indicated by the insertion of ถูก (''thuk'', {{IPA|[tʰùːk]}}) before the verb. For example:
* เขาถูกตี (''khao thuk ti'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw tʰùːk tiː]}}), ''He is hit''. This describes an action that is out of the receiver's control and, thus, conveys suffering.

To convey the opposite sense, a sense of having an opportunity arrive, ได้ (''dai'', {{IPA|[dâj]}}, can) is used. For example:
* เขาจะได้ไปเที่ยวเมืองลาว (''khao cha dai pai thiao mueang lao'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw t͡ɕaʔ dâj paj tʰîow mɯːəŋ laːw]}}), ''He gets to visit Laos.''

Note, ''dai'' ({{IPA|[dâj]}} and {{IPA|[dâːj]}}), though both spelled ได้, convey two separate meanings. The short vowel ''dai'' ({{IPA|[dâj]}}) conveys an opportunity has arisen and is placed before the verb. The long vowel ''dai'' ({{IPA|[dâːj]}}) is placed after the verb and conveys the idea that one has been given permission or one has the ability to do something. Also see the past tense below.

* เขาตีได้ (''khao ti dai'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw tiː dâːj]}}), ''He is/was allowed to hit'' or ''He is/was able to hit''

[[Negation (rhetoric)|Negation]] is indicated by placing ไม่ (''mai'',{{IPA|[mâj]}} not) before the verb.
* เขาไม่ตี, (''khao mai ti'') ''He is not hitting.'' or ''He doesn't hit.''

[[Grammatical tense|Tense]] is conveyed by [[grammatical tense#tense marking|tense markers]] before or after the verb.
:[[Present tense|Present]] can be indicated by กำลัง (''kamlang'', {{IPA|[kamlaŋ]}}, currently) before the verb for ongoing action (like English -ing form), by อยู่ (''yu'', {{IPA|[jùː]}}) after the verb, or by both. For example:
:* เขากำลังวิ่ง (''khao kamlang wing'',  {{IPA|[kʰǎw kamlaŋ wîŋ]}}), or
:* เขาวิ่งอยู่ (''khao wing yu'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw wîŋ jùː]}}), or
:* เขากำลังวิ่งอยู่ (''khao kamlang wing yu'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw kamlaŋ wîŋ jùː]}}), ''He is running.''

:[[Future tense|Future]] can be indicated by จะ (''cha'', {{IPA|[t͡ɕaʔ]}}, "will") before the verb or by a time expression indicating the future. For example:
:* เขาจะวิ่ง (''khao cha wing'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw t͡ɕaʔ wîŋ]}}), ''He will run'' or ''He is going to run.''

:[[Past tense|Past]] can be indicated by ได้ (''dai'', {{IPA|[dâːj]}}, "did") before the verb or by a time expression indicating the past. However, แล้ว (''laeo'',  :{{IPA|[lɛ́ːw]}}, already) is often used to indicate the past tense by being placed behind the verb. Or, both ได้ and แล้ว are put together to form the past tense expression. For example:
:* เขาได้กิน (''khao dai kin'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw dâːj kin]}}), ''He ate.''
:* เขากินแล้ว (''khao kin laeo'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw kin lɛ́ːw]}}, ''He has eaten.''
:* เขาได้กินแล้ว (''khao dai kin laeo'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw dâːj kin lɛ́ːw]}}), ''He's already eaten.''
Tense markers are not required.
:* ฉันกินที่นั่น (''chan kin thinan'', {{IPA|[t͡ɕʰǎn kin tʰîːnân]}}), ''I eat there.''
:* ฉันกินที่นั่นเมื่อวาน (''chan kin thinan mueawan''), ''I ate there yesterday.''
:* ฉันกินที่นั่นพรุ่งนี้ (''chan kin thinan phrungni''), ''I'll eat there tomorrow.''

Thai exhibits [[serial verb construction]]s, where verbs are strung together. Some word combinations are common and may be considered set phrases.
* เขาไปกินข้าว (''khao pai kin khao'', {{IPA|[kʰǎw paj kin kʰâːw]}}) ''He went out to eat'', literally ''He go eat rice''
* ฉันฟังไม่เข้าใจ (''chan fang mai khao chai'', {{IPA|[tɕ͡ʰǎn faŋ mâj kʰâw tɕ͡aj]}}) ''I don't understand what was said'', literally ''I listen not understand''
* เข้ามา (''khao ma'', {{IPA|[kʰâw maː]}}) ''Come in'', literally ''enter come''
* ออกไป! (''ok pai'', {{IPA|[ʔɔ̀ːk paj]}}) ''Leave!'' or ''Get out!'', literally ''exit go''

===Nouns===
[[Noun]]s are [[Uninflected word|uninflected]] and have no [[Grammatical gender|gender]]; there are no [[article (grammar)|article]]s.

Nouns are neither [[grammatical number|singular]] nor [[plural]]. Some specific nouns are [[reduplication|reduplicated]] to form [[collective number|collective]]s: เด็ก (''dek'', child) is often repeated as เด็ก ๆ (''dek dek'') to refer to a group of children. The word พวก (''phuak'', {{IPA|[pʰûak]}}) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word. (พวกผม, ''phuak phom'', {{IPA|[pʰûak pʰǒm]}}, ''we'', masculine; พวกเรา ''phuak rao'', {{IPA|[pʰûak raw]}}, emphasised ''we''; พวกหมา ''phuak ma'', ''(the) dogs''). Plurals are expressed by adding [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s, used as [[measure word]]s (ลักษณนาม), in the form of noun-number-classifier (ครูห้าคน, "teacher five person" for "five teachers"). While in English, such classifiers are usually absent ("four chairs") or optional ("two bottles of beer" ''or'' "two beers"), a classifier is almost always used in Thai (hence "chair four item" and "beer two bottle").

===Pronouns===
Subject [[pronoun]]s are often omitted, with [[nickname]]s used where English would use a pronoun. See [[Thai names#Formal and informal names|informal and formal names]] for more details. Pronouns, when used, are ranked in  [[Thai honorifics|honorific registers]], and may also make a [[T–V distinction#Thai|T–V distinction]] in relation to [[kinship terminology|kinship]] and [[social status]]. Specialised pronouns are used for those with [[Thai royal and noble titles|royal and noble titles]], and for [[Bhikkhu|clergy]]. The following are appropriate for [[conversation]]al use:

{|class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| คุณ || khun || {{IPA|[kʰun]}} || you (polite)
|-
| ท่าน || than || {{IPA|[tʰân]}} || you (highly [[honorific]])
|-

|}

The reflexive pronoun is ตัวเอง (tua eng), which can mean any of: myself, yourself, ourselves, himself, herself, themselves. This can be mixed with another pronoun to create an [[intensive pronoun]], such as ตัวผมเอง (tua phom eng, lit: I myself) or ตัวคุณเอง (tua khun eng, lit: you yourself). Thai also does not have a separate [[possessive pronoun]]. Instead, possession is indicated by the particle ของ (khong).  For example, "my mother" is แม่ของผม (mae khong phom, lit: mother of I). This particle is often implicit, so the phrase is shortened to แม่ผม (mae phom). Plural pronouns can be easily constructed by adding the word พวก (puak) in front of a singular pronoun as in พวกเขา (puak khao) meaning they or พวกเธอ (puak thoe) meaning the plural sense of you. The only exception to this is เรา (rao), which can be used as singular (informal) or plural, but can also be used in the form of พวกเรา (puak rao), which is only plural.

Thai has many more pronouns than those listed above. Their usage is full of nuances. For example:

* "ผม เรา ฉัน ดิฉัน หนู กู ข้า กระผม ข้าพเจ้า กระหม่อม อาตมา กัน ข้าน้อย ข้าพระพุทธเจ้า อั๊ว เขา" all translate to "I", but each expresses a different gender, age, politeness, status, or relationship between speaker and listener.
* เรา (rao) can be first person (I), second person (you), or both (we), depending on the context.
* Children or younger female could use or being referred by word หนู (nu) when talking with older person. The word หนู could be both feminine first person (I) and feminine second person (you) and also neuter first and neuter second person for children.
** หนู commonly means rat or mouse. It could refers to small creature in general
* The second person pronoun เธอ (thoe) (lit: you) is semi-feminine. It is used only when the speaker or the listener (or both) are female. Males usually don't address each other by this pronoun.
* Both คุณ (khun) and เธอ (thoe) are polite neuter second person pronouns.  However, คุณเธอ (khun thoe) is a feminine derogative third person.
* Instead of a second person pronoun such as "คุณ" (you), it is much more common for unrelated strangers to call each other "พี่ น้อง ลุง ป้า น้า อา ตา ยาย" (brother/sister/aunt/uncle/granny).
* To express deference, the second person pronoun is sometimes replaced by a profession, similar to how, in English, presiding judges are always addressed as "your honor" rather than "you".  In Thai, students always address their teachers by "ครู" or "คุณครู" or "อาจารย์" (each means "teacher") rather than คุณ (you).  Teachers, monks, and doctors are almost always addressed this way.

===Particles===
The [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s are often untranslatable words added to the end of a sentence to indicate respect, a request, encouragement or other moods (similar to the use of [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] in English), as well as varying the level of formality. They are not used in elegant (written) Thai. The most common particles indicating respect are ครับ (''khrap'', {{IPA|[kʰráp]}}, with a high tone) when the speaker is male, and ค่ะ (''kha'', {{IPA|[kʰâ]}}, with a falling tone) when the speaker is female; these can also be used to indicate an affirmative, though the ค่ะ (falling tone) is changed to a คะ (high tone).

Other common particles are:

== Register ==
As noted above, Thai has several registers, each having certain usages, such as colloquial, formal, literary, and poetic. Thus, the word "eat" can be กิน (''kin''; common), แดก (''daek''; vulgar), ยัด (''yat''; vulgar), บริโภค (''boriphok''; formal), รับประทาน (''rapprathan''; formal), ฉัน (''chan''; religious), or เสวย (''sawoei''; royal), as illustrated below:

Thailand also uses the distinctive [[Thai six-hour clock]] in addition to the [[24-hour clock]].

==Vocabulary==
{{Main|List of loanwords in Thai}}
Other than [[compound word]]s and words of foreign origin, most words are [[syllable|monosyllabic]].

Chinese-language influence was strong until the 13th century when the use of Chinese characters was abandoned, and replaced by Sanskrit and Pali scripts. However, the vocabulary of Thai retains many words borrowed from [[Middle Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Haspelmath, Uri Tadmor ''Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook'' 2009 -- Page 611 "Thai is of special interest to lexical borrowing for various reasons. The copious borrowing of basic vocabulary from Middle Chinese and later from Khmer indicates that, given the right sociolinguistic context, such vocabulary is not at all immune ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harald Haarmann  Language in Ethnicity: A View of Basic Ecological Relations  1986- Page 165 "In Thailand, for instance, where the Chinese influence was strong until the Middle Ages, Chinese characters were abandoned in written Thai in the course of the thirteenth century."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Leppert Doing Business With Thailand -1992 Page 13 "At an early time the Thais used Chinese characters. But, under the influence of Indian traders and monks, they soon dropped Chinese characters in favor of Sanskrit and Pali scripts."&lt;/ref&gt;

Later most vocabulary was borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]]; [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] terminology is particularly indebted to these. Indic words have a more formal register, and may be compared to Latin and French borrowings in English. Old [[Khmer language|Khmer]] has also contributed its share, especially in regard to royal court terminology. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the [[English language]] has had the greatest influence, especially for scientific, technical, international, and other modern terms. Many [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] Chinese words are also used, some replacing existing Thai words (for example, the names of basic numbers; see also [[Sino-Xenic]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Portuguese-origin ===
The Portuguese were the first Western-nation to arrive in what is modern-day Thailand in the 16th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya period]]. Its influence in trade, especially weaponry, allowed them to establish a community just outside the capital and practice their faith, as well as exposing and converting the locals to [[Christianity]]. Thus, Portuguese words involving trade and religion were introduced and used by the locals.

==History==
Thai has undergone various historical sound changes.  Some of the most significant changes, at least in terms of consonants and tones, occurred between Old Thai spoken when the language was first written and Thai of present, reflected in the [[Thai alphabet|orthography]].

===Old Thai===
Old Thai had a three-way tone distinction on live syllables (those not ending in a stop), with no possible distinction on dead syllables (those ending in a stop, i.e. either {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}} or the [[glottal stop]] which automatically closes syllables otherwise ending in a short vowel).

There was a two-way voiced vs. voiceless distinction among all [[fricative]] and [[sonorant]] consonants, and up to a four-way distinction among [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[affricate]]s.  The maximal four-way occurred in [[labial consonant|labial]]s ({{IPA|/p pʰ b ʔb/}}) and [[dental consonant|dental]]s ({{IPA|/t tʰ d ʔd/}}); the three-way  distinction among [[velar consonant|velar]]s ({{IPA|/k kʰ ɡ/}}) and [[palatal consonant|palatal]]s ({{IPA|/tɕ tɕʰ dʑ/}}), with the glottalized member of each set apparently missing.

The major change between old and modern Thai was due to voicing distinction losses and the concomitant [[tone split]].  This may have happened between about 1300 and 1600 CE, possibly occurring at different times in different parts of the Thai-speaking area.  All voiced–voiceless pairs of consonants lost the voicing distinction:
*Plain voiced stops ({{IPA|/b d ɡ dʑ/}}) became voiceless aspirated stops ({{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ tɕʰ/}}).&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="Explanation 4"&gt;The glottalized stops {{IPA|/ʔb ʔd/}} were unaffected, as they were treated in every respect like voiceless unaspirated stops due to the initial glottal stop. These stops are often described in the modern language as phonemically plain stops {{IPA|/b d/}}, but the glottalization is still commonly heard.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Voiced fricatives became voiceless.
*Voiceless sonorants became voiced.
However, in the process of these mergers the former distinction of voice was transferred into a new set of tonal distinctions.  In essence, every tone in Old Thai split into two new tones, with a lower-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiced consonant, and a higher-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiceless consonant (including glottalized stops).  An additional complication is that formerly voiceless unaspirated stops/affricates (original {{IPA|/p t k tɕ ʔb ʔd/}}) also caused original tone 1 to lower, but had no such effect on original tones 2 or 3.

The above consonant mergers and tone splits account for the complex relationship between spelling and sound in modern Thai.  Modern "low"-class consonants were voiced in Old Thai, and the terminology "low" reflects the lower tone variants that resulted.  Modern "mid"-class consonants were voiceless unaspirated stops or affricates in Old Thai—precisely the class that triggered lowering in original tone 1 but not tones 2 or 3.  Modern "high"-class consonants were the remaining voiceless consonants in Old Thai (voiceless fricatives, voiceless sonorants, voiceless aspirated stops).  The three most common tone "marks" (the lack of any tone mark, as well as the two marks termed ''mai ek'' and ''mai tho'') represent the three tones of Old Thai, and the complex relationship between tone mark and actual tone is due to the various tonal changes since then.  Note also that since the tone split, the tones have changed in actual representation to the point that the former relationship between lower and higher tonal variants has been completely obscured.  Furthermore, the six tones that resulted after the three tones of Old Thai were split have since merged into five in standard Thai, with the lower variant of former tone 2 merging with the higher variant of former tone 3, becoming the modern "falling" tone.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="Explanation 5"&gt;Modern [[Lao language|Lao]] and [[Northern Thai language|northern Thai dialects]] are often described as having six tones, but these are not necessarily due to preservation of the original six tones resulting from the tone split.  For example, in standard Lao, both the high and low variants of Old Thai tone 2 merged; however, the mid-class variant of tone 1 became pronounced differently from either the high-class or low-class variants, and all three eventually became phonemic due to further changes, e.g. {{IPA|/kr/}} &gt; {{IPA|/kʰ/}}.  For similar reasons, Lao has developed more than two tonal distinctions in "dead" syllables.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Old Thai also apparently had velar fricatives {{IPA|/x ɣ/}} as distinct phonemes.  These were represented by the now-obsolete letters ฃ ''kho khuat'' and ฅ ''kho khon'', respectively.  During the Old Thai period, these sounds merged into the corresponding stops {{IPA|/kʰ ɡ/}}, and as a result the use of these letters became unstable.

At some point in the history of Thai, a palatal nasal phoneme {{IPA|/ɲ/}} also existed, inherited from [[Proto-Tai]].  A letter ญ ''yo ying'' also exists, which is used to represent a palatal nasal in words borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], and is currently pronounced {{IPA|/j/}} at the beginning of a syllable but {{IPA|/n/}} at the end of a syllable.  Most native Thai words that are reconstructed as beginning with {{IPA|/ɲ/}} are also pronounced {{IPA|/j/}} in modern Thai, but generally spelled with ย ''yo yak'', which consistently represents {{IPA|/j/}}.  This suggests that {{IPA|/ɲ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/j/}} in native words occurred in the pre-literary period.  It is unclear whether Sanskrit and Pali words beginning with {{IPA|/ɲ/}} were borrowed directly with a {{IPA|/j/}}, or whether a {{IPA|/ɲ/}} was re-introduced, followed by a second change {{IPA|/ɲ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/j/}}.

Proto-Tai also had a glottalized palatal sound, reconstructed as {{IPA|/ʔj/}} in Li Fang-Kuei (1977{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}).  Corresponding Thai words are generally spelled หย, which implies an Old Thai pronunciation of {{IPA|/hj/}} (or {{IPA|/j̊/}}), but a few such words are spelled อย, which implies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/ʔj/}} and suggests that the glottalization may have persisted through to the early literary period.

===Vowel developments===
The vowel system of modern Thai contains nine pure vowels and three centering diphthongs, each of which can occur short or long. According to Li (1977{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}), however, many Thai dialects have only one such short–long pair ({{IPA|/a aː/}}), and in general it is difficult or impossible to find minimal short–long pairs in Thai that involve vowels other than {{IPA|/a/}} and where both members have frequent correspondences throughout the Tai languages.  More specifically, he notes the following facts about Thai:
*In [[open syllable]]s, only long vowels occur. (This assumes that all apparent cases of short open syllables are better described as ending in a glottal stop.  This makes sense from the lack of tonal distinctions in such syllables, and the glottal stop is also reconstructible across the Tai languages.)
*In [[closed syllable]]s, the long high vowels {{IPA|/iː ɯː uː/}} are rare, and cases that do exist typically have diphthongs in other Tai languages.
*In closed syllables, both short and long mid {{IPA|/e eː o oː/}} and low {{IPA|/ɛ ɛː ɔ ɔː/}} do occur.  However, generally, only words with short {{IPA|/e o/}} and long {{IPA|/ɛː ɔː/}} are reconstructible back to Proto-Tai.
*Both of the mid back unrounded vowels {{IPA|/ɤ ɤː/}} are rare, and words with such sounds generally cannot be reconstructed back to Proto-Tai.
Furthermore, the vowel that corresponds to short Thai {{IPA|/a/}} has a different and often higher quality in many of the Tai languages compared with the vowel corresponding to Thai {{IPA|/aː/}}.

This leads Li to posit the following:
#Proto-Tai had a system of nine pure vowels with no length distinction, and possessing approximately the same qualities as in modern Thai: high {{IPA|/i ɯ u/}}, mid {{IPA|/e ɤ o/}}, low {{IPA|/ɛ a ɔ/}}.
#All Proto-Tai vowels were lengthened in open syllables, and low vowels were also lengthened in closed syllables.
#Modern Thai largely preserved the original lengths and qualities, but lowered {{IPA|/ɤ/}} to {{IPA|/a/}}, which became short {{IPA|/a/}} in closed syllables and created a phonemic length distinction {{IPA|/a aː/}}.  Eventually, length in all other vowels became phonemic as well and a new {{IPA|/ɤ/}} (both short and long) was introduced, through a combination of borrowing and sound change.  Li believes that the development of long {{IPA|/iː ɯː uː/}} from diphthongs, and the lowering of {{IPA|/ɤ/}} to {{IPA|/a/}} to create a length distinction {{IPA|/a aː/}}, had occurred by the time of Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but the other missing modern Thai vowels had not yet developed.

Note that not all researchers agree with Li.  Pittayaporn (2009{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}), for example, reconstructs a similar system for Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but believes that there was also a mid back unrounded vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} (which he describes as {{IPA|/ɤ/}}), occurring only before final velar {{IPA|/k ŋ/}}.  He also seems to believe that the Proto-Southwestern-Tai vowel length distinctions can be reconstructed back to similar distinctions in Proto-Tai.

===Connection to ancient Yue language(s)===
{{further|Baiyue#Language|Chu_(state)#Linguistic_influences}}
Thai descends from proto-Tai-Kadai, which has been hypothesized to originate in the Lower Yangtze valleys. Ancient Chinese texts refer to non-Sinitic languages spoken cross this substantial region and their speakers as ''"[[Baiyue#Language|Yue]]"''. Although those languages are extinct, traces of their existence could be found in unearthed inscriptional materials, ancient Chinese historical texts and non-Han substrata in various Southern Chinese dialects. Thai, as the most-spoken language in [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai language family]], has been used extensively in historical-comparative linguistics to identify the origins of language(s) spoken in the ancient region of South China. One of the very few direct records of non-Sinitic speech in pre-Qin and Han times having been preserved so far is the ''"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]"'' (Yueren Ge 越人歌), which was transcribed phonetically in Chinese characters in 528 BC, and found in the 善说 Shanshuo chapter of the Shuoyuan 说苑 or 'Garden of Persuasions'.  In the early 80’s the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] linguist Wei Qingwen using reconstructed Old Chinese for the characters discovered that the resulting vocabulary showed strong resemblance to [[Zhuang language|modern Zhuang]].{{sfn|Edmondson|2007|p= 16}} Later, Zhengzhang Shangfang (1991) followed Wei’s insight but used [[Thai script]] for comparison, since this orthography dates from the 13th century and preserves archaisms viz-à-viz the modern pronunciation.{{sfn|Zhengzhang|1991|pp= 159–168}} The following is a simplified interpretation of the ''"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]"'' by Zhengzhang Shangfang quoted by David Holm (2013) with Thai script and Chinese glosses being omitted:{{sfn|Holm|2013|pp= 784-785}}&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="Explanation 6"&gt;The upper row represents the original text, the next row the Old Chinese pronunciation, the third a transcription of written Thai, and the fourth line English glosses. Finally, there is Zhengzhang's English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides this classical case, various papers in historical linguistics have employed Thai for comparative purposes in studying the linguistic landscape of the ancient region of Southern China. Proto-reconstructions of some scattered non-Sinitic words found in the two ancient Chinese fictional texts, ''Mu tianzi zhuan'' 穆天子傳 (4th c. B.C.) and ''Yuejue shu'' 越絕書 (1st c. A.D.), are used to compare to Thai/Siamese and its related languages in [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai language family]] in an attempt to identify the origins of those words. The following examples are cited from Wolfgang Behr's work (2002):

'''Thangmi''', also called '''Thāmī''', '''Thangmi Kham''', '''Thangmi Wakhe''', and '''Thani''', is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] spoken in central-eastern Nepal and northeastern India by the [[Thami|Thami people]]. The Thami refer to their language as ''Thangmi Kham'' or ''Thangmi Wakhe'' while the rest of Nepal refers to it as ''Thāmī''. The majority of these speakers, however, live in [[Nepal]] in their traditional homeland of [[Dolakha District|Dolakhā District]]. In [[India]], the Thami population is concentrated mostly in [[Darjeeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turin|first=Mark|date=1998|title=The Thangmi Verbal Agreement System and the Kiranti Connection|url=|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=476–491|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00019303|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thangmi language is written using the [[Devanagari]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&amp;key=Deva|title=Script Devanagari (Nagari)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Thangmi is spoken in:
*[[Janakpur Zone]]: northern and western [[Dolakha District]]; [[Ramechhap District]] (villages on Sailung Khola)
*[[Bagmati Zone]]: eastern [[Sindhupalchok District]]
*[[Kathmandu]]

Ethnic Thami outside Dolakha and Sindhupalcok districts no longer speak Thangmi.

== Classification ==
[[File:Devanagari-con1.gif|thumb|Devanagari is the script that the Thangmi language uses.]]The Thangmi language seems to have many similarities with other languages in Nepal. For example, [[Baram language|Barām]], [[Kiranti languages|Kiranti]] and [[Newar language|Newar]]. Studies from Konow (1909), Shafer (1966), Stein (1970), Toba (1990), van Driem (1992) and Turin demonstrate that Thangmi is closely related to the Rai and Newar languages.

== Dialects ==

=== Dolakhā vs. Sindhupālcok ===
[[File:Dolakha, Nepal, 2005.jpg|thumb|Dolakha, Nepal]]
Thangmi consists of two dialects, [[Dolakha District|Dolakhā]] (East) and [[Sindhupalchowk District|Sindhupālcok]] (West). They differ in terms of phonology, nominal, and verbal morphology and in lexicon. The majority of the Thangmi speaking population use the Dolakhā dialect while only a handful speak in Sindhupālcok. The Dolakhā dialect offers a more complete verbal agreement system while the Sindhupālcok dialect has a more complex nominal morphology.

== Thangmi songs ==
The [[Thami]] population are people who are rich in cultural and traditions. Their language is a large part of who they are and they portray this in their cultural, mostly in music. The Nepal Tham Society (NTS) produced a handful of Thangmi songs that were recorded in 2007. The lyrics were written by Singh Bahadur Thami, Devendra Thami and Lok Bahadur Thami. Here are some examples:

His paternal grandfather was [[Jews|Jewish]] (of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian]] origin), while the rest of his ancestry is northern European, including some [[Scottish people|Scottish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timwise.org/2010/11/silly-nazis-encounters-with-idiots-from-childhood-to-the-present/ |title=Silly Nazis: Encounters With Idiots, from Childhood to the Present |publisher=Tim Wise |date=2010-11-08 |accessdate=2013-05-28|quote=More to the point, and as regards myself, my Jewish lineage extends only on my Y-chromosome, that is to say, my paternal paternal line, as three of my four grandparents are of Northern European and decidedly non-Jewish derivation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Tim|title=White Like Me|year=2005|publisher=Soft Skull Press|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=1-932360-68-9|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/31410673/White-Like-Me-Excerpt|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wise has said that when he was about 12 years old his [[synagogue]] was attacked by [[white supremacist]]s.&lt;ref name="Interview1"&gt;[http://www.timwise.org/2014/12/tim-wise-on-the-rock-newman-show-race-and-racism-in-america-121014/ Tim Wise on Race and Racism in America]; The Rock Newman Show (44-47 min. mark); December 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Wise attended public schools in Nashville, graduating from [[Hillsboro Comprehensive High School|Hillsboro High School]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Class of 1986, Hillsboro H.S.

Wise attended college at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]] and received his B.A. there, with a major in [[Political Science]] and a minor in [[Latin American Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Wise|url=http://libguides.depauw.edu/timwise|publisher=DePauw University|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student, he was a leader in the campus anti-[[apartheid]] movement, which sought to force Tulane to divest from companies still doing business with the government of [[South Africa]]. His anti-apartheid activism was first brought to national attention in 1988, when South African Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] announced he would turn down an offer of an honorary degree from Tulane after Wise's group informed him of the school's ongoing investments there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power of One: Tim Wise|url=http://suavv.com/2011/05/power-of-one-tim-wise/|publisher=SUAVV|author=Kadeem|date=May 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130114955/http://suavv.com/2011/05/power-of-one-tim-wise/|archivedate=January 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1990s===
After graduating in 1990, Wise started his work as an anti-racism activist after receiving training from the New Orleans-based People's Institute for Survival and Beyond. Wise began his anti-racism work first as a youth coordinator, and then associate director, of the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and [[Nazism]], the largest of the various organizations founded for the purpose of defeating political candidate [[David Duke]] when Duke ran for U.S. Senate in 1990 and Governor of Louisiana in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Martin A.|title=Detailing David Duke|journal=Intelligence Report|year=Spring 2003|issue=109|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2003/spring/detailing-david-duke|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Applebome|first=Peter|title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans; Duke's Candidacy Raises Legal Questions About State Ballot Laws|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/06/us/1992-campaign-republicans-duke-s-candidacy-raises-legal-questions-about-state.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 6, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his work campaigning against David Duke, Wise worked for a number of community-based organizations and political groups in [[Baton Rouge]] and New Orleans, including the Louisiana Coalition for Tax Justice, the Louisiana Injured Worker's Union and Agenda for Children, where he worked as a policy analyst and community organizer in New Orleans public housing.&lt;ref&gt;''White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son''; Tim Wise; [[Soft Skull Press]]; Pgs. 168-173&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Wise began lecturing around the country on the issues of racism, criticizing white privilege (his own included)&lt;ref name=wp_review /&gt; and proposing his solutions. The following year, he returned to his hometown Nashville, and he continued his work around the US, gaining a national reputation for his work in defense of [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reverse discrimination debate causes outrage |url=http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/fall96/oct22/04.html |newspaper=Golden Gater |date=October 22, 1996 |author=Mugo wa Macharia |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970521100844/http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/fall96/oct22/04.html |archivedate=May 21, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
From 1999 to 2003, Wise served as an advisor to the [[Fisk University]] Race Relations Institute.  Wise received the 2002 [[National Youth Advocacy Coalition]]'s Social Justice Impact Award. He has appeared on numerous radio and television broadcasts, including ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', ''[[Donahue (TV series)|Donahue]]'', ''[[Paula Zahn NOW]]'', ''[[MSNBC Live]]'', and ABC's ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'', arguing the case for affirmative action and to discuss the issue of white privilege and racism in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A conversation about race|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24165209/ns/msnbc_tv-documentaries/38502415|publisher=MSNBC|location=Crampton Auditorium at Howard University in Washington, DC|date=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise argues that racism in the United States is institutionalized due to past overt racism (and its ongoing effects) along with current-day discrimination. Although he concedes that personal, overt bias is less common than in the past (or at least less openly articulated), Wise argues that existing institutions continue to foster and perpetuate [[white privilege]], and that subtle, impersonal, and even ostensibly race-neutral policies contribute to racism and racial inequality today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLarin|first=Kim|title=MODERN LOVE; Race Wasn't an Issue to Him, Which Was an Issue to Me|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E5D61E3EF930A3575AC0A9609C8B63&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=September 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In multi-racial societies such as the U.S., Wise argues that all people (white or people of color) will have internalized various elements of racist thinking. However just because society has been conditioned this way does not mean that society is committed to racist thinking. Wise argues that members of society can challenge this conditioning and be taught to believe in equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tim|first1=Wise|title=Tim Wise F.A.Q|url=http://www.timwise.org/f-a-q-s/|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ''[[Utne Reader]]'' magazine listed Wise as one of the "25 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World".&lt;ref name="utne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Wise: The Confrontationalist|url=http://www.utne.com/Politics/Utne-Reader-Visionaries-Tim-Wise-Race-Colorblind.aspx|date=November–December 2010|work=Utne Reader|author=Joe Hart|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Wise posted a commentary on his Facebook page describing the hate mail and death threats he receives, and addressing the people who troll his site. Many commenters criticized the commentary as reflecting white privilege, and questioned his role in the discussion of race in the United States. One commenter found Wise's remarks demeaning to anti-racist work done by people of color.&lt;ref name="Stream Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/the-stream/the-stream-officialblog/2013/9/17/anti-racism-activistgetsbacklashoverrant.html|title=Anti-racism activist gets backlash over Facebook rant|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|author=The Stream Team|date=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two others compared Wise to [[Hugo Schwyzer]], who was famous in feminist circles but later exposed for misogynistic attitudes.&lt;ref name="Stream Team"/&gt; Wise posted a response on Facebook saying in part, "I won't try and defend the tone of most of my remarks. It was inappropriate. Period. ... I fell into the same kind of vitriolic and sometimes personal attack mode that had gotten me angry in the first place. I shouldn't have. I will strive to do better."&lt;ref name="Stream Team"/&gt;

Wise starred in a 2013 documentary entitled ''[[White Like Me]]'', based on the book by Wise of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=August 16, 2013|title=Are You White?

==Personal life==
After living in New Orleans for ten years, Wise relocated to his native Nashville&lt;ref name=TS/&gt; in 1996. In 1998, he married Kristy Cason. Together they have two children.&lt;ref name=TS&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Sun (magazine)|The Sun]]|url=http://thesunmagazine.org/issues/403/by_the_color_of_their_skin|issue=403|date=July 2009|title=By The Color Of Their Skin, Tim Wise On The Myth Of A Postracial America|first=David|last=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wise has referred to himself as Jewish&lt;ref name="Interview1"/&gt; and as an [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] Jew&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timwise.org/tag/zionism/|title=Zionism articles|publisher=TimWise.org|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not practice [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timwise.org/2015/03/responding-to-a-young-reactionary-white-privilege-judaism-and-the-making-of-sloppy-analogies/ Time Wise website: "Responding to a Young Reactionary: White Privilege, Judaism and the Making of Sloppy Analogies"] March 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
