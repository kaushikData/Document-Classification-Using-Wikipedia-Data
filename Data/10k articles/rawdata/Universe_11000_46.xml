'''3T Cycling''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] cycle sport company associated with many champion cyclists. It was founded in 1961 and soon won a reputation for lightweight racing cycle componentry.&lt;ref name=3t&gt;{{cite web|title=3T|url=http://www.3tcycling.com/|publisher=.3tcycling.com|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Upgrade to the Full 3T Look|url=http://italiancyclingjournal.blogspot.com/2013/09/upgrade-to-full-3t-look.html|publisher=blogspot.com|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=youtube&gt;{{cite web|title=HANDMADE IN ITALY - 3T Cycling WHEELS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191ad3YGWjc|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=99bikes&gt;{{cite web|title=3T Cycling|url=http://99bikes.com.au/brands/3t-cycling|publisher=99bikes.com.au|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company used aerospace-grade [[Aluminium alloy|aluminum alloys]] in its products, designing handlebars with input from professional riders.{{who|date=February 2016}}

3T switched production to [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon-fiber]] composite materials and in 2008 returned to pro cycling after several years' absence. For the 2008 season it sponsored the [[Team Saxo-Tinkoff|CSC]] team,{{fact|date=February 2016}} which won the [[Tour de France]]. 3T sponsored three pro teams{{which|date=February 2016}} for the 2009 professional season.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In 2013 3T was a sponsor for {{ct|BMC}}.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In June 2017, 3T introduced its first bicycle, the Strada. The bicycle was notable for eliminating one of the front rings, doing away with the need for a front derailleur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bikeradar.com/road/news/article/3t-stada-aero-gravel-bike-50225/|title=3T Strada 1x aero bike for rough roads|last=Eich|first=Russell|date=2017-06-23|work=BikeRadar|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The quest for light weight==

3T is an Italian cycle sport firm, located in [[Bergamo]], near [[Milan]]o. It was originally known as 3TTT — Tecnologia del Tubo Torino (Turin Tube Technology). Many competitions have been won on 3T components, including the Tour de France, Olympic races, World Championships, and the World [[Hour record]].

The firm was founded by Mario Dedioniggi in [[Torino]] in 1961. Dedioniggi was skilled at manipulating and bending steel tubes to fabricate the lightweight handlebars desired by racing cyclists, and Italian professional riders were among 3T’s first customers.

By 1970 3T handlebars and stems were in widespread use in the [[Europe]]an professional [[peloton]]. In the quest for lighter weight, 3T switched production to [[aluminum alloy]] in place of steel. It was among the first to use aluminum for these components, where strength is critical to safety.

In 1975 it produced the Superleggera handlebar weighing 250&amp;nbsp;grammes — claimed to be the world's lightest drop handlebar. This bar was the first to be made of [[7075 aluminium alloy]], a material usually used in aerospace applications. The high [[specific strength|strength-to-weight ratio]] of this alloy, also known as Ergal, found uses in other sports: 3T ski poles sold well for several seasons during the 1970s.

==Aerodynamics arrive==
The firm worked closely with professional racers to refine the design of their handlebars. The various 'bends' took their name from the champions of the era — [[Eddy Merckx|Merckx]], [[Giuseppe Saronni|Saronni]], [[Francesco Moser|Moser]], and [[Felice Gimondi|Gimondi]]. In 1984 Francesco Moser used a newly developed 3T bar to capture the [[world hour record]], breaking through the 50-kilometre barrier for the first time.

This new 'bullhorn' bar put the rider in a lower, more aerodynamic position for greater speed. Most riders in search of pure speed now use a similar position. In Moser's honor, 3T named the bar '51.151' — the distance Moser covered in kilometres (31.784 miles) at the [[Mexico City]] [[velodrome]] on January 23, 1984.

==Transatlantic alliances==
3T continued to develop new handlebar designs to assist riders reach their goal of greater speed. The growing power in world cycling, the [[United States]], started to take notice. [[Scott USA]] commissioned 3T to create the first handlebars specific to [[triathlon]] use, and in a departure from its roots in road racing, 3T partnered with Salsa Cycles to create a range of mountain-bike components. Success was immediate: in 1994, [[Nicolas Vouilloz]] won the third of his many World Championship downhill titles in [[Vail]] (CO) on a 3T bar.

==New technology drivers==
Bicycle components underwent radical change in the 1990s. The traditional quill handlebar [[stem (bicycle part)|stem]] was rendered obsolete by the introduction of the threadless [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]]. 3T responded with the industry's first forged stem for this application, the ForgeAhead. Other manufacturers followed 3T's lead and switched to this technique, abandoning welded stems.

By the late 1990s, carbon-fiber [[Composite material|composites]] were becoming the major driver of change. 3T, best known for its skill in aluminum alloy fabrication, took up the challenge of re-engineering to build components in composite materials. Race successes continued with Gold in the World Championships in 2000 and 2002 and a string of popular wins for [[Erik Zabel]] in the Italian home classic, [[Milan–San Remo]], but it was not until 2008 that 3T again saw victory in a major tour.

==Renewed race success==
For the 2008 season, 3T sponsored [[Team CSC]]. The team debuted a new, all-composites [[Airfoil|aerofoil]] time-trial bar, the 3T Ventus. The team's World Champion time trialist, [[Fabian Cancellara]], rode this to victory at the Prologue of the Amgen [[Tour of California]]. Moving on to the European season at the [[Giro d'Italia]], CSC's youthful team narrowly failed to win the race's opening [[Team Time Trial]].

Great success followed at the Tour de France. CSC captain [[Carlos Sastre]] won the [[General classification in the Tour de France|Yellow Jersey]] of the Overall winner, his team mate [[Andy Schleck]] won the [[General classification in the Tour de France|White Jersey]] for Best Young Rider, and CSC won Best Team. Race reports noted Sastre's outstanding performance in limiting his losses in the final weekend's Individual [[Time trial]], where he was widely expected to lose the lead to his nearest rival, [[Cadel Evans]].

Riding for [[Switzerland]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]] shortly after, Cancellara won Gold in the Men's Time Trial, beating his team mate [[Gustav Larsson]], riding for [[Sweden]], into second place, both riders using the Ventus bar. Their team captain Carlos Sastre animated the Men's Road Race, while Cancellara eventually placed third, one of three riders in the first five finishers riding 3T.

For the 2009 season, 3T is sponsoring three professional teams: [[Cervélo TestTeam]] (captained by Carlos Sastre), [[Garmin-Sharp|Garmin Slipstream]], and [[Team Milram|Milram]].

== Management software ==
* All Smart-UPS units work with APC's proprietary [[APC_by_Schneider_Electric#PowerChute|PowerChute]] software which is available for a variety of operating systems.
* A free alternative to PowerChute is the [[Free software]] project [[Apcupsd|APC UPS Daemon (Apcupsd)]], which supports Linux, Mac OS X, UNIX and Microsoft Windows operating systems and can run in stand alone or client-server modes.
* Legacy Smart-UPS (Not SMX, SMT, or SURTD series &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apcupsd.com/|title=Apcupsd a daemon for controlling APC UPSes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can also work with [[Network UPS Tools|Network UPS Tools (NUT)]], a third party application, under Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkupstools.org/stable-hcl.html|title=Network UPS Tools - Hardware compatibility list|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The software is designed to safely and automatically shut down any connected computers before the batteries are depleted.

[[File:APC AP9606 Web-SNMP Management Card.jpg|thumb|right|AP9606, an early SmartSlot Web/SNMP Management Card]]

As a way to provide UPS management, monitoring and automatic shutdown of attached equipment, all Smart-UPS models include at least one serial data interface ([[RS-232]] or [[USB]]), while most models also have at least one ''SmartSlot'' expansion port, with the larger (and in many cases older) Smart-UPS models supporting two SmartSlots.  Availability of more SmartSlots in a single Smart-UPS unit can be achieved via expansion modules such as the AP9600 and AP9604 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/SMARTSLOT-EXPANSION-CHASSIS/P-AP9600|title=SMARTSLOT EXPANSION CHASSIS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-SmartSlot-Triple-Chassis-Black/P-AP9604BLK|title=APC SmartSlot Triple Chassis Black|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Installing an add-on card into a SmartSlot will provide the UPS with additional features, capable beyond the default serial data interface.

Early SmartSlot cards, such as the AP9605, provide [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] functionality and [[Telnet]] access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonsteiger.com/WWW/AP9605/index.html|title=AP9605 Network Management Card|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AP9606 and later cards add a web interface that can be used to configure and administer the UPS, as well as email-based alerting.  The AP9617 and newer cards add [[Ethernet|10/100Base-T]] connectivity, Secure [[HTTP]], [[Secure Shell]] (SSH), [[RADIUS]], SNMP Version&amp;nbsp;3, PCNS and [[syslog]] functionalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=AP9617 |title=UPS Network Management Card |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118082807/http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=AP9617 |archivedate=January 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AP9612, AP9618, AP9619 and AP9631 models provide environmental monitoring when used together with APC temperature/humidity probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/UPS-Network-Management-Card-w-Environmental-Monitoring-Out-of-Band-Management/P-AP9618|title=AP9618 Network Management Card|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=AP9619 |title=AP9619 Network Management Card |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029125120/http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=AP9619 |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/UPS-Network-Management-Card-2-with-Environmental-Monitoring/P-AP9631|title=AP9631 Network Management Card|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AP9618 model also provides [[out-of-band management]] via a modem connection in case the 10/100 [[Ethernet]] connection is down.

SmartSlot cards remain powered by the battery even when the UPS is switched off, allowing the UPS to be remotely cold-started even in a power loss situation (providing the network infrastructure is still powered up and functioning).  The cards will also continue to work for a short while after the UPS has been switched off either manually or due to a low battery condition.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

Beginning with the 2009 release of the SMT models (and later SMX and SURTD models), the old RS-232 data interface (a serial port with [[DB-9 connector]]) has been replaced with a 10-pin [[RJ50]] socket and an RJ50-to-DB-9 cable connecting to the protected computer's serial port (together with a standard USB interface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinoutsguide.com/UPS/apc_usb_cable_pinout.shtml|title=APC USB cable scheme|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Also, SmartSlot interface has been electrically modified in a backward-incompatible way and appropriately keyed mechanically.  As stated by APC, "the new connection arrangement denotes the new signalling systems."{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  These new serial and SmartSlot interfaces use the new ''Microlink'' signalling protocol which, unlike the previous APC protocol ''UPSLINK'', {{As of|2015|04|lc=yes}} has not been publicly documented.  However, using the new AP9620 interface card, users are able to add support for the previous signalling protocol to the newer SMT and SMX models.  Addition of this card makes the current models backwards compatible with older software built for the older Smart-UPS series.

{{As of|2013|08}}, an additional option has been made available in form of new [[firmware]] for certain SMT and SURTD models, adding publicly documented [[Modbus]] signalling capability to the proprietary Microlink protocol, allowing third-party developers to support UPS signalling and control on the newer Smart-UPS series.&lt;ref name="Microlink protocol in Apcupsd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.apc.com/spaces/5/smart-ups-symmetra-lx-rm/forums/general/5957/microlink-protocol-in-apcupsd/2|title=Microlink protocol in Apcupsd (forum thread, see 2013-08-16 post)|date=2013-08-16|accessdate=2015-04-26|website=forums.apc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MPAO-98KJ7F_R1_EN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apcmedia.com/salestools/MPAO-98KJ7F/MPAO-98KJ7F_R1_EN.pdf?sdirect=true|title=Modbus Implementation in APC Smart-UPS|date=2014-09-19|accessdate=2015-04-26|website = apcmedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:APC AP9617 on top of SMT1500I.jpg|thumb|right|An AP9617 SmartSlot Network Management Card sitting on top of a Smart-UPS SMT1500I, showing the differences in slot keying]]

In late 2009, with the release of the SMT and SMX product lines, SmartSlot was migrated to a new communications platform utilizing the APC Microlink protocol.  Both electrical and mechanical (slot keying) properties of the new SmartSlot make older SmartSlot cards incompatible with current Smart-UPS models.&lt;ref name="SMT/SMX FAQ"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.apcmedia.com/salestools/RMUZ-7XGLRR/RMUZ-7XGLRR_R0_EN.pdf?sdirect=true

 | date = 2009-11-19 | accessdate = 2015-05-07
 | publisher = [[APC by Schneider Electric]] | format = PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, current ({{As of|2015|04|lc=yes}}) Smart-UPS model SMT1500 is compatible only with AP9613, AP9620, AP9630 and AP9631 SmartSlot cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Smart-UPS-1500VA-LCD-120V/P-SMT1500#options | title = APC Smart-UPS 1500VA LCD 120V | publisher = [[APC by Schneider Electric|APC]] | accessdate = 2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new card/slot design is referred-to as "Network Management Card&amp;nbsp;2" or NMC2.  However, most new-style SmartSlot cards (including AP9613, AP9630 and AP9631) are backward compatible with older Smart-UPS models.&lt;ref name="ARAJ-9GEEBC"&gt;{{cite web

The paper's goal is to describe how the combined structure and dynamics of all [[gravitational]] and [[Standard Model]] particle fields, including [[fermions]], are part of the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Lie algebra.&lt;ref name="SciAm" /&gt;

The theory is presented as an extension of the [[grand unified theory]] program, incorporating gravity and fermions. In the paper, Lisi states that all three generations of fermions do not directly embed in E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; with correct quantum numbers and spins, but that they must be described via a [[triality]] transformation, noting that the theory is incomplete and that a correct description of the relationship between triality and generations, if it exists, awaits a better understanding.

The theory received accolades from a few physicists amid a flurry of media coverage, but also met with widespread skepticism.&lt;ref name="sym"&gt;{{cite news |author=Amber Dance |title=Outsider Science |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000607 |work=Symmetry Magazine |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-06-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705195339/http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000607| archivedate= 5 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Scientific American]]'' reported in March 2008 that the theory was being "largely but not entirely ignored" by the mainstream physics community, with a few physicists picking up the work to develop it further.&lt;ref name="wipeout"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collins |first=Graham P. |date=March 2008 |title=Wipeout? |journal=[[Scientific American]] |pages=30–32  |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=wipeout-theory |accessdate=2008-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up paper, [[Lee Smolin]] proposed a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism for obtaining the classical action in Lisi's model, and speculated on the path to its quantization.&lt;ref name="Smolin" /&gt; In July 2009, [[Jacques Distler]] and [[Skip Garibaldi]] published a critical paper in ''[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]]'' called "There is no 'Theory of Everything' inside E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;",&lt;ref name="DistlerGaribaldi"/&gt; arguing that Lisi's theory, and a large class of related models, cannot work.

The goal of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory is to describe all elementary particles and their interactions, including gravitation, as quantum excitations of a single [[Lie group]] geometry—specifically, excitations of the noncompact quaternionic real form of the largest simple exceptional Lie group, [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A Lie group, such as a one-dimensional circle, may be understood as a smooth [[manifold]] with a fixed, highly symmetric geometry. Larger Lie groups, as higher-dimensional manifolds, may be imagined as smooth surfaces composed of many circles (and hyperbolas) twisting around one another. At each point in a N-dimensional Lie group there can be N different orthogonal circles, tangent to N different orthogonal directions in the Lie group, spanning the N-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] of the Lie group. For a Lie group of rank R, one can choose at most R orthogonal circles that do not twist around each other, and so form a ''maximal torus'' within the Lie group, corresponding to a collection of R mutually-commuting Lie algebra generators, spanning a ''Cartan subalgebra''. Each elementary particle state can be thought of as a different orthogonal direction, having an integral number of twists around each of the R directions of a chosen maximal torus. These R twist numbers (each multiplied by a scaling factor) are the R different kinds of elementary charge that each particle has. Mathematically, these charges are [[eigenvalues]] of the Cartan subalgebra generators, and are called [[Root system|roots]] or [[Weight (representation theory)|weights]] of a [[Lie algebra representation|representation]].

In the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, each different kind of elementary particle has four different [[Charge (physics)|charges]], corresponding to twists along directions of a four-dimensional maximal torus in the twelve-dimensional Standard Model Lie group, SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1). The two strong “color” charges, g&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and g&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, correspond to twists along directions in the two-dimensional maximal torus of the eight-dimensional SU(3) Lie group of the [[strong interaction]]. The [[weak isospin]], T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (or W), and [[weak hypercharge]], Y&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; (or Y), correspond to twists along directions in the two-dimensional maximal torus of the four-dimensional SU(2)×U(1) Lie group of the [[electroweak interaction]], with W and Y combining as electric charge, Q. Whenever an interaction occurs between elementary particles, with two coming together and becoming a third, or one particle becoming two, each type of charge must be conserved. For example, a red [[up quark]], having [[quantum numbers|charges]] (g&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}=\tfrac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, g&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}=\tfrac {1}{2{\sqrt{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;, ''W''&lt;math&gt;=\tfrac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, ''Y''&lt;math&gt;{}=\tfrac {1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;) can interact with a [[weak boson]], ''W''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, having charges (''g''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, ''g''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, ''W'' = −1, ''Y'' = 0), to produce a red [[down quark]], having charges (''g''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;{}=\tfrac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, ''g''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}=\tfrac {1}{2{\sqrt{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;, ''W''&lt;math&gt;{}=\tfrac {-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, ''Y''&lt;math&gt;{}=\tfrac {1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;). The complete pattern of all Standard Model particle charges in four dimensions may be projected down to two dimensions and plotted in a charge diagram.

In [[grand unified theories]] (GUTs), the 12-dimensional Standard Model Lie group, SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) (modded by '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), is considered as a subgroup of a higher-dimensional Lie group, such as of 24-dimensional [[SU(5)]] in the [[Georgi–Glashow model]] or of 45-dimensional [[Spin group|Spin(10)]] in the [[SO(10) (physics)|SO(10) model]] (Spin(10) being the double cover of SO(10), and having the same Lie algebra). Since there is a different elementary particle for each dimension of the Lie group, in addition to the 12 Standard Model [[gauge bosons]] there are 12 [[X and Y bosons]] in the SU(5) Model and 18 more X bosons and 3 [[W' and Z' bosons]] in Spin(10). In Spin(10) there is a five-dimensional maximal torus, and the Standard Model hypercharge, Y, is a combination of two new Spin(10) charges: “weaker charge”, W', and [[B − L|baryon minus lepton number]], B. In the Spin(10) model, one generation of 16 fermions (including left-handed electrons, neutrinos, three colors of up quarks, three colors of down quarks, and their anti-particles) lives neatly in the 16-complex-dimensional [[spinor]] representation space of Spin(10). The combination of these 32 real fermions and 45 bosons, along with another U(1) Lie group (corresponding to [[Peccei–Quinn symmetry]]), constitute the 78-dimensional real compact exceptional Lie group, [[E6 (mathematics)|E6]]. (This unusual algebraic structure, reminiscent of [[supersymmetry]], of gauge fields and spinors combined in a simple Lie group, is characteristic of the exceptional groups.)

As well as being in some representation space of the Standard Model or Grand Unified Theory Lie group, each physical fermion is a [[spinor]] under the [[Cartan formalism (physics)|gravitational]] noncompact [[Spin connection|Spin(1,3)]] Lie group of rotations and boosts. This six-dimensional Lie group has a two-dimensional maximal torus (technically a hyperboloid) and thus two kinds of charge, [[Spin (physics)|spin]], S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, and boost, S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. A [[Dirac fermion]] (consisting of fermion and anti-fermion) has eight real degrees of freedom corresponding to its real vs. imaginary parts, left or right '''chirality''', and being spin up or down. Using the Lie group equivalence of Spin(1,3) and SL(2,'''C'''), and the [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of Standard Model [[weak force]] fermion interactions, each fermion (and each anti-fermion) can be described as a two-complex-dimensional left-chiral [[Weyl spinor]] under gravitational SL(2,'''C'''). Accounting for the up or down spin for each of the 16 left-chiral fermions of one generation (or 15 fermions if neutrinos are [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]]), each fermion generation corresponds to 64 (or 60) real degrees of freedom.

In GraviGUT unification, the gravitational Spin(1,3) and Spin(10) GUT Lie groups are combined (modded by '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as parts of a Spin(11,3) Lie group, acting on each generation of fermions in a real 64-dimensional spinor representation. The remaining parts of Spin(11,3) include the 4-dimensional [[Frame fields in general relativity|spacetime frame]] and a [[Higgs field]] transforming as a 10 under Spin(10). The resulting [[gauge theory]] of [[Gauge gravitation theory|gravity]], Higgs, and [[gauge bosons]] is an extension of the [[MacDowell–Mansouri action|MacDowell-Mansouri formalism]] to higher dimensions. Several physicists objected to the apparent violation of the [[Coleman-Mandula theorem]], which states the impossibility of mixing gravity and gauge fields in a unified Lie group over spacetime, given reasonable assumptions. Proponents of GraviGUT unification and E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory claim that the Coleman-Mandula theorem is not violated because the assumptions are not met.&lt;ref name="Roberto Percacci 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roberto Percacci |arxiv=0803.0303 |title=Mixing internal and spacetime transformations: some examples and counterexamples |date=2008 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/41/33/335403 |volume=41 |journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical |page=335403|bibcode = 2008JPhA...41G5403P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory, it is observed that the GraviGUT algebra of spin(11,3) acting on one generation of fermions in a real positive-chiral 64-spinor, 64&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, can be part of the 248-dimensional real quaternionic e8 Lie algebra,
:e8 = spin(12,4) + 128&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;

The strongest criticism of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory, stated by Distler, Garibaldi, and others, including Lisi in the original paper, is that given an embedding of gravitational spin(1,3) in the spin(12,4) subalgebra of e8, the 128&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; includes not only the 64&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; of a generation of fermions, but a 64&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; “anti-generation” of [[Mirror matter|mirror fermions]] with non-physical chirality. Since we do not see mirror fermions in nature, Distler and Garibaldi consider this to be a disproof of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory. Lisi has voiced two responses to this criticism. The first response is that these mirror fermions might exist and have very large masses. The second response, stated in the original paper and in his latest work, is that there is not a single embedding of gravitational spin(1,3) in e8, but three embeddings related by [[triality]], with respect to which the 64&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; contains a second generation of physical fermions, and the third generation of fermions is contained within spin(12,4).&lt;ref name="virginia_edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/A_Geometric_Theory_of_Everything.pdf |title=A Geometric Theory of Everything}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The algebraic breakdown of the 248-dimensional e8 Lie algebra relevant to E8 Theory is
:e8 = spin(4,4) + spin(8) + 8&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ 8&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; + 8&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ 8&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; + 8&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ 8&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;

This decomposition, attributed to [[Bertram Kostant]], relies on the [[triality]] isomorphism between eight-dimensional vectors, 8&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, positive-chiral spinors, 8&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, and negative-chiral spinors, 8&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, relating to the division algebra of the [[octonions]].&lt;ref name="octonions"&gt;{{Cite journal | ref = harv | last1 = Baez | first1 = John C. | authorlink = John Baez | title = The Octonions | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | issn = 0273-0979 | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–205 | date = 2002 | url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/ | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-01-00934-X | arxiv = math/0105155v4 | mr = 1886087 | access-date = 2015-12-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081009232658/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/ | archive-date = 2008-10-09 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this decomposition, the strong force su(3) embeds in spin(8), three triality-related gravitational spin(1,3)’s embed in spin(4,4), the three [[Generation (particle physics)|generations]] of 60 fermions embed in 8&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ 8&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; + 8&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ 8&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; + 8&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ 8&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, and the gravitational frame, Higgs, and electroweak bosons embed throughout, with 18 colored X bosons remaining as new predicted particles.&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Big Bang: what will we find? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/03/25/scicomments125.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2008-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory’s current state, it is not possible to calculate masses for the existing or predicted particles. Lisi states the theory is young and incomplete, requiring a better understanding of the three fermion generations and their masses, and places a low confidence in its predictions. However, the discovery of new particles that do not fit in Lisi's classification, such as [[superpartner]]s or new fermions, would fall outside the model and falsify the theory.

==Technical overview==

The fundamental geometric idea of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory is that our universe and its contents exists as quantum excitations of the largest simple real quaternionic exceptional Lie group, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8(−24)&lt;/sub&gt;. This is described via an extension of [[Cartan geometry]] employing a '''superconnection'''. The relevant Cartan geometry is modeled on [[Klein geometry]], beginning with a [[homogeneous space]], G/H, in which the initial Lie group is ''G'' = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8(−24)&lt;/sub&gt; and the subgroup is ''H'' = SL(2,'''C''')xS(U(3)×U(2))x'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in which '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {1,''T'',''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} is the [[cyclic group]] of order three corresponding to a triality automorphism, T, of E&lt;sub&gt;8(−24)&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lisi4"/&gt;

Usually, in Cartan geometry, the deformation of a Lie group, ''G'', preserving the structure of a subgroup, ''H'', is described by allowing the Lie group’s [[Maurer–Cartan form]], θ, to vary, becoming the [[Cartan connection]],
:''C'' = ''W'' + ''Ɛ''

The resulting geometry, ''G̃'', is that of a [[principal bundle]], with W the [[Connection (principal bundle)|principal H-connection]], a [[1-form]] valued in Lie(H) over a base manifold, ''B'', modeled on ''G''/''H'', with the '''frame''', Ɛ, a 1-form valued in Lie(G/H). If H is a reductive subgroup of ''G'', the [[Curvature form|curvature]] of the Cartan connection is
:''F''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''dC'' + ''CC'' = (''dW'' + ''WW'' + ''ƐƐ'') + (''dƐ'' + ''WƐ'' + ''ƐW'')

In Lisi’s extension of Cartan geometry, the Cartan connection over B is interpreted as a superconnection,
:''G'' = ''W'' + ''E'' + ''Ψ''

over spacetime, M (a subspace of B), in which, Ψ, a Lie(G/H) valued 1-form over B assumed to be orthogonal to M, is interpreted as a set of three fermionic ([[Grassmann number]]) fields over M, valued in Lie(G/H), related by triality, T.&lt;ref name="Lisi4"/&gt; According to Lisi, the description of Grassmann number fermions as 1-forms orthogonal to spacetime, valued in a spinor representation, provides a clear geometric understanding of what fermions are.&lt;ref name="Horgan"/&gt; In E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory, the H-connection is physically the gravitational [[spin connection]], ½ω, plus the Standard Model and X boson gauge fields, H = g + W + B + X, while E is the 1-form frame over M, assumed to equal the gravitational frame 1-form, e, times (in the [[Clifford algebra]] sense) the Higgs, E = eΦ. The fermionic part of the superconnection, Ψ, is interpreted as the three generation multiplets of Standard Model [[fermions]]. The curvature of the resulting superconnection,
:G = ½ω + H + eΦ + Ψ
is
:F = dG + GG = (½R − e e Φ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + F&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; + (TΦ + eDΦ) + DΨ + ΨΨ

in which R = dω + ½ωω is the gravitational [[Riemann curvature tensor|Riemann curvature]] 2-form, F&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = d H + H H is the [[Curvature form|gauge field curvature]], T = de + ½ωe + ½eω is the [[Torsion tensor|gravitational torsion]], DΦ = dΦ + [H,Φ] is the [[Gauge covariant derivative|covariant derivative]] of the Higgs, and DΨ = dΨ + [½ω + H + eΦ,Ψ]  is the [[Dirac equation|covariant Dirac derivative]] of the fermions in curved spacetime.

In this geometric description, physical four-dimensional spacetime, M, is considered as a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of gauge-related subspaces of G̃. For the case in which the curvature vanishes, F = 0, there is no excitation of the Lie group, G, and the Higgs field has a vacuum expectation value, Φ=Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponding to a positive [[cosmological constant]], Λ = − 12 Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with the vacuum spacetime, as a subspace of G, identified as [[de Sitter space]]time, satisfying R = −6Λee.

Within a Lie group, the [[Maurer–Cartan form]], θ, is the natural frame and determines the [[Haar measure]] for integration over the group manifold. With the [[Killing form]] of the Lie algebra, this also determines a natural [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] and [[Hodge dual|Hodge duality operator]] on the group manifold. For a deforming Lie group, the Maurer–Cartan form is replaced by the superconnection, G, defined over the entire deforming Lie group manifold via [[gauge transformation]]. This superconnection, G, determines the [[Hodge dual|Hodge duality operator]], &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;, and the curvature, F, of the deforming Lie group. The action for E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory is the [[Yang–Mills action]], integrated over the entire deforming Lie group.
:S = ½ &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \int&lt;/math&gt; (F,&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;F)

Since the structure of the H subgroup and fermionic directions of B are preserved, this action reduces to an integral over spacetime,
:S = ½ V &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \int&lt;/math&gt; {(ee,&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;ee) Φ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − (R,&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;ee) Φ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ¼ (R,&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;R) + (DΦ,&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;DΦ) − (T,&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;T) Φ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (F&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) + (DΨ,&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;DΨ)}

in which V is a constant volume factor, and the Hodge star, &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;, is now the Hodge star for M determined by the gravitational frame, e. As well as the usual [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] for gravity, [[Yang–Mills action]], and Higgs action, this action includes a quadratic torsion term, a quadratic curvature term, and a quadratic spinor Lagrangian.&lt;ref name="Lisi4"/&gt;

==Chronology and reaction==
Three previous arXiv preprints by Lisi deal with mathematical physics related to the theory. "Clifford Geometrodynamics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author=A. G. Lisi |eprint=gr-qc/0212041 |title=Clifford Geometrodynamics |date=2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002, endeavors to describe fermions geometrically as [[BRST quantization|BRST ghosts]]. "Clifford bundle formulation of BF gravity generalized to the standard model",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author=A. G. Lisi |eprint=gr-qc/0511120 |title=Clifford bundle formulation of BF gravity generalized to the standard model |date=2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005, describes the algebra of gravitational and Standard Model fields acting on a generation of fermions, but does not mention E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

Lisi |eprint=physics/0605068 |title=Quantum mechanics from a universal action reservoir |date=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006, attempts to derive quantum mechanics using information theory.

Before writing his 2007 paper, Lisi discussed his work on an [[Foundational Questions Institute]] (FQXi) forum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/68 |title=Pieces of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; |accessdate=2008-06-15 |author=A.

Numerous news sites from all over the world reported on the new theory in 2007 and 2008, noting Lisi's personal history and the controversy in the physics community. The first mainstream and scientific press coverage began with articles in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[New Scientist]]'',&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite news |author=Zeeya Merali |title=Is mathematical pattern the theory of everything? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/dn12891-is-mathematical-pattern-the-theory-of-everything.html |work=New Scientist |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2008-06-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512055932/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/dn12891-is-mathematical-pattern-the-theory-of-everything.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with articles soon following in many other newspapers and magazines.

Lisi's paper spawned a variety of reactions and debates across various physics [[blog]]s and online [[discussion groups]]. The first to comment was Sabine Hossenfelder, summarizing the paper and noting the lack of a dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2007/11/theoretically-simple-exception-of.html |title=A Theoretically Simple Exception of Everything |accessdate=2008-06-15 |author=Sabine Hossenfelder |date=2007-11-06 |work=Backreaction | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080526135422/http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2007/11/theoretically-simple-exception-of.html| archivedate= 26 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luboš Motl]] offered a colorful critique, objecting to the addition of bosons and fermions in Lisi's superconnection, and to the violation of the [[Coleman-Mandula theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motls.blogspot.com/2007/11/exceptionally-simple-theory-of.html |title=Garrett Lisi: An exceptionally simple theory of everything |accessdate=2008-06-15 |author=Luboš Motl |date=2007-11-07 |work=The Reference Frame }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presentation "What's new at the arXiv?" on May 20, 2008, Simeon Warner stated that Lisi's paper is the most downloaded article on the arXiv.&lt;ref name="woit arx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=693 |title=INSPIRE |accessdate=2008-08-05 |author=Peter Woit |date=2008-05-28 |work=Not Even Wrong }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indico.desy.de/conferenceOtherViews.py?confId=800#2008-05-20 |title=What's new at the arXiv? |accessdate=2008-07-22 |author=Simeon Warner |date=2008-05-20 |work=HEP Information Resource Summit }} (The slide containing this statement was subsequently removed from the presentation file.)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the physicists early to comment on E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory, Sabine Hossenfelder, Peter Woit and [[Lee Smolin]] were generally supportive, while [[Luboš Motl]] and [[Jacques Distler]] were critical.

On his blog, ''Musings'', Jacques Distler offered one of the strongest criticisms of Lisi's approach, claiming to demonstrate that, unlike in the Standard Model, Lisi's model is nonchiral&amp;nbsp;— consisting of a generation and an anti-generation&amp;nbsp;— and to prove that any alternative embedding in E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; must be similarly nonchiral.&lt;ref name="Distler1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001505.html |title=A Little Group Theory |accessdate=2008-06-15 |author=Jacques Distler |date=2007-11-21 |work=Musings | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512092837/http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001505.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distler0"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001532.html |title=A Little More Group Theory |accessdate=2008-11-15 |author=Jacques Distler |date=2007-12-09 |work=Musings }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distler3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001795.html |title=My Dinner with Garrett |accessdate=2008-11-15 |author=Jacques Distler |date=2008-09-14 |work=Musings | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081119093646/http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001795.html| archivedate= 2008-11-19 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments were distilled in a paper written jointly with Skip Garibaldi, "There is no 'Theory of Everything' inside E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;",&lt;ref name="DistlerGaribaldi"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Jacques Distler | author2=Skip Garibaldi |arxiv=0905.2658 |title=There is no 'Theory of Everything' inside E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; |date=2009 | doi=10.1007/s00220-010-1006-y | volume=298 | journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics | pages=419–436|bibcode = 2010CMaPh.298..419D }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in ''[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]]''. In this paper, Distler and Garibaldi offer a proof that it is impossible to embed all three generations of fermions in E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, or to obtain even the one-generation Standard Model. In a press release from his university, "Rock climber takes on surfer's theory",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esciencecommons.blogspot.com/2010/03/rock-climber-takes-on-surfers-theory.html |title=Rock climber takes on surfer's theory |accessdate=2011-07-30 |author= Carol Clark |date=2010-03-18 |work=esciencecommons }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100326132341.htm |title=No 'Simple Theory of Everything' Inside the Enigmatic E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, Researcher Says |accessdate=2011-07-30 |date=2010-03-26 |work=ScienceDaily }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garibaldi states that his article with Distler is a rebuttal of Lisi's theory. In response, Lisi argues that Distler and Garibaldi made unnecessary assumptions about how the embedding needs to happen.&lt;ref name="criticism"/&gt; Addressing the one generation case, in June 2010 Lisi posted a new paper on E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Theory, "An Explicit Embedding of Gravity and the Standard Model in E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;",&lt;ref name="Lisi2"/&gt; peer reviewed and published in a [[proceedings|conference proceedings]], describing how the algebra of gravity and the Standard Model with one generation of fermions embeds in the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Lie algebra explicitly using matrix representations. When this embedding is done, Lisi agrees that there is an antigeneration of fermions (also known as "mirror fermions") remaining in E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;; but while Distler and Garibaldi state that these mirror fermions make the theory nonchiral, Lisi states that these mirror fermions might have high masses, making the theory chiral, or that they might be related to the other generations.&lt;ref name="criticism"/&gt;

The group blog, ''The n-Category Cafe'', provides some of the more technical discussions, with posts by Lisi, Urs Schreiber,&lt;ref name="schreiber"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/e8_quillen_superconnection.html |title=E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Quillen Superconnection |accessdate=2008-06-15 |author=Urs Schreiber |date=2008-05-10 |work=The n-Category Cafe | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619050339/http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/e8_quillen_superconnection.html| archivedate= 2008-06-19 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kea,&lt;ref name="golem.ph.utexas.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/e8_quillen_superconnection.html#c016877|title=The n-Category Café|work=utexas.edu|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacques Distler.&lt;ref name="golem.ph.utexas.edu"/&gt;

'''Beaver Dyke Reservoirs''' are two water supply reservoirs near to [[Harrogate]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The main reservoir was constructed in 1890 and has a surface area of 9 Ha. The water is relatively nutrient rich, but it has been known to suffer from potentially toxic blooms of [[Blue green algae]].

{{coord|53.9864|-1.6614|type:waterbody_region:GB|display=title}}

As of 2013 the main Beaver Dyke Reservoir is being decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decommisioning of a reservoir -Creating a biodiversity haven|url=http://www.yorkshirewater.com/our-environment/biodiversity/beaver-dyke-decomissioning.aspx|website=Yorkshire Water|accessdate=31 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002019/http://www.yorkshirewater.com/our-environment/biodiversity/beaver-dyke-decomissioning.aspx|archivedate=11 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller reservoir (also called John O'Gaunts due to the proximity of [[John O'Gaunt's Castle]]) is still filled with water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8931">In [[physics]], there is a speculative notion that if there were a [[black hole]] with the same mass, charge and angular momentum as an [[electron]], it would share some of the properties of the electron.  Most notably, [[Brandon Carter]] showed in 1968 that the [[electron magnetic moment|magnetic moment]] of such an object would match that of an electron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carter| first1=B.| authorlink1=Brandon Carter| title=Global structure of the Kerr family of gravitational fields | journal=[[Physical Review]] | volume=174 | issue=5 |date=25 October 1968 | pages=1559–1571 |doi=10.1103/physrev.174.1559|bibcode = 1968PhRv..174.1559C }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is interesting because calculations ignoring special relativity and treating the electron as a small rotating sphere of charge give a magnetic moment that is off by roughly a factor of 2, the so-called [[Gyromagnetic ratio#Gyromagnetic ratio for an isolated electron|gyromagnetic ratio]].

However, Carter's calculations also show that a would-be black hole with these parameters would be '[[extremal black hole|super-extremal]]'.  Thus, unlike a true black hole, this object would display a [[naked singularity]], meaning a singularity in spacetime not hidden behind an [[event horizon]].   It would also give rise to [[closed timelike curves]].

Standard [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) treats the electron as a point particle, a view completely supported by experiment.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  There is no evidence that the electron is a black hole (or naked singularity).  Furthermore, since the electron is quantum mechanical in nature,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} any description purely in terms of general relativity is inadequate.

==Details==
A paper published in 1938 by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Leopold Infeld]] and [[Banesh Hoffmann]] showed that if elementary particles are treated as singularities in spacetime, it is unnecessary to postulate [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]] motion as part of general relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Einstein | first1=A. |authorlink1=Albert Einstein | last2=Infeld | first2=L. | authorlink2=Leopold Infeld | last3=Hoffmann | first3=B. | authorlink3=Banesh Hoffmann | title=The gravitational equations and the problem of motion | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | volume=39 | issue=1 |date=January 1938 | pages=65–100 | jstor=1968714 |doi=10.2307/1968714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electron may be treated as such a singularity.

If one ignores the electron's angular momentum and charge, as well as the effects of [[quantum mechanics]], one can treat the electron as a [[black hole]] and attempt to compute its radius. The [[Schwarzschild radius]] {{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} of a mass {{mvar|m}} is the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating, uncharged [[black hole]] of that mass. It is given by

:&lt;math&gt;r_s = \frac{2Gm}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where {{mvar|G}} is Newton's [[gravitational constant]] and {{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]].  For the electron,
 
:{{mvar|m}} = {{val|9.109|e=-31|u=[[kilogram|kg]]}},

so

:{{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|1.353|e=-57|u=m}}.

Thus, if we ignore the electric charge and angular momentum of the electron, and naively apply general relativity on this very small length scale without taking quantum theory into account, a black hole of the electron's mass would have this radius.

In reality, physicists expect quantum gravity effects to become significant even at much larger length scales, comparable to the [[Planck length]]

:&lt;math&gt;\ell_P = \sqrt{\frac{G\hbar}{c^3}} = 1.616 \times 10^{-35}&lt;/math&gt; m

So, the above purely classical calculation cannot be trusted. Furthermore, even classically, electric charge and angular momentum affect the properties of a black hole. To take them into account, while still ignoring quantum effects, one should use the [[Kerr–Newman metric]].  If we do, we find the angular momentum and charge of the electron are too large for a black hole of the electron's mass: a Kerr-Newman object with such a large angular momentum and charge would instead be '[[extremal black hole|super-extremal]]', displaying a [[naked singularity]], meaning a singularity not shielded by an [[event horizon]].

To see that this is so, it suffices to consider the electron's charge and neglect its angular momentum. In the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]], which describes electrically charged but non-rotating black holes, there is a quantity {{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;}}, defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{q} = \sqrt{\frac{q^{2}G}{4\pi\epsilon_{0} c^{4}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|q}} is the electron's charge and {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[vacuum permittivity]].  For an electron with {{mvar|q}} = −[[elementary charge|{{mvar|e}}]] = {{val|-1.602|e=-19|u=[[coulomb|C]]}}, this gives a value

:{{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|1.3807|e=-36|u=m}}.

Since this (vastly) exceeds the Schwarzschild radius, the Reissner–Nordström metric has a naked singularity.

If we include the effects of the electron's rotation using the [[Kerr-Newman metric]], there is still a naked singularity, which is now a [[ring singularity]], and spacetime also has [[closed timelike curve]]s.   The size of this ring singularity is on the order of

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{a} = \frac{J}{m c}
&lt;/math&gt;,

where as before {{mvar|m}} is the electron's mass and {{mvar|c}} is the speed of light, but {{mvar|J}} = &lt;math&gt;\hbar/2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[angular momentum]] of the electron.  This gives

:{{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|1.9295|e=-13|u=m}}

which is much larger than the length scale {{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;}} associated to the electron's charge. As noted by Carter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Carter| first=B.| authorlink=Brandon Carter| title=Global structure of the Kerr family of gravitational fields | journal=[[Physical Review]] | volume=174 | issue=5 |date=25 October 1968 | pages=1559–1571 |doi=10.1103/physrev.174.1559|bibcode = 1968PhRv..174.1559C }}&lt;/ref&gt; this length {{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} is on the order of the electron's [[Compton wavelength]]. Unlike the Compton wavelength, it is not quantum-mechanical in nature.

More recently, Alexander Burinskii has pursued the idea of treating the electron as Kerr–Newman naked singularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burinskii |first=Alexander |arxiv=hep-th/0507109 |title=The Dirac-Kerr-Newman electron |journal=Gravitation and Cosmology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=109–122 |date=April 2008 |bibcode=2008GrCo...14..109B |doi=10.1134/S0202289308020011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last=Burinskii | first=Alexander | year=2007 | eprint=0712.0577 | title=Kerr geometry as space–time structure of the Dirac electron }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bredig's arc method''' is a method of preparation of [[Colloidal suspension|colloidal solution]], of metals such as [[gold]], [[silver]] or [[platinum]].

This method consists of both dispersion and condensation.  An arc is struck between [[electrode]]s, under the surface of water containing some [[stabilizing agent]] such as traces of KOH ([[potassium hydroxide]]).The intense heat of the arc vaporizes some of the metal which then condenses under cold water. The water is kept cold as an ice bath.The Colloidal particle prepared is stabilised by adding a small amount of KOH to it. 

This method is not suitable when the [[dispersion medium]] is an [[organic liquid]] as considerable [[charring]] occurs.

'''Caking''' is a powder's tendency to form lumps or masses rather than flow smoothly.

Factors involved in the degree of caking include the substance's particle surface chemistry, particle size and [[particle-size distribution]], particle shape, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Caking also depends on any pressure on the powdered substance, and how long the substance has been stored.

Physically, the caking process involves [[electrostatic attraction]] or the formation of weak [[chemical bond]]s between the particle surfaces. This gives the bulk substance the strength to crack and collapse abruptly, to form vertical surfaces, and so on.

Usually caking is undesirable, but is useful when pressing powdered substances into pills or [[briquette]]s. [[Granular material]]s can also be subject to caking, particularly those that are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] such as salt, sugar, and many [[chemical fertilizer]]s, because of the effects of moisture on grain surfaces.

Caking properties must be considered when designing and constructing [[bulk material handling]] equipment. Powdered substances that need to be stored, and flow smoothly at some time in the future, are often [[pelletize]]d or made into [[pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s. [[Anti caking agent]]s are also commonly added to control caking.

&lt;/ref&gt; are categorized in four groups, each based on physical and chemical forms derived from [[coal]] [[combustion]] methods and emission controls:

[[File:CoalCombustionWastes-01.png|thumb|right|Diagram of the disposition of coal combustion wastes]]

:*'''[[Fly ash]]''' is captured after coal combustion by filters [[Dust_collector#Fabric_filters|Bag Houses]], electrostatic precipitators and other air pollution control devices. It comprises 60 percent of all coal combustion waste (labeled here as coal combustion products).It is most commonly used as a high-performance substitute for [[portland cement]] or as clinker for portland cement production. Cements blended with fly ash are becoming more common. Building material applications range from grouts and masonry products to cellular concrete and roofing tiles. Many asphaltic concrete pavements contain fly ash. Geotechnical applications include soil stabilization, road base, structural fill, embankments and mine reclamation. Fly ash also serves as filler in wood and plastic products, paints and metal castings.

:*'''[[Flue-gas desulfurization]] (FGD) materials''' are produced by chemical “scrubber” emission control systems that remove sulfur and oxides from power plant [[flue gas]] streams. FGD comprises 24 percent of all coal combustion waste. Residues vary, but the most common are FGD gypsum (or “synthetic” gypsum) and spray dryer absorbents. FGD gypsum is used in almost thirty percent of the gypsum panel products manufactured in the U.S. It is also used in agricultural applications to treat undesirable soil conditions and to improve crop performance. Other FGD materials are used in mining and land reclamation activities.
  
:*'''[[Bottom ash]]''' and '''boiler slag''' can be used as a raw feed for manufacturing portland cement clinker, as well as for skid control on icy roads. The two materials comprise 12 and 4 percent of coal combustion waste respectively. These materials are also suitable for geotechnical applications such as structural fills and land reclamation. The physical characteristics of bottom ash and boiler slag lend themselves as replacements for aggregate in flowable fill and in concrete masonry products. Boiler slag is also used for roofing granules and as blasting grit.

:*'''The majority of CCPs''' are landfilled, placed in mine shafts or stored on site at coal-fired power plants. About 43 percent of CCPs were recycled for "beneficial uses" in 2008, according to the American Coal Ash Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acaa-usa.org&lt;/ref&gt; The chief benefit of recycling is to stabilize the environmental harmful components of the CCPs such as arsenic, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, chromium VI, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum,selenium, strontium, thallium, and vanadium, along with [[dioxin]]s and PAH compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Managing Coal Combustion Residues in Mines, Committee on Mine Placement of Coal Combustion Wastes, National Research Council of the National Academies, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human and Ecological Risk Assessment of Coal Combustion Wastes, RTI, Research Triangle Park, August 6, 2007, prepared for the US Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
Observations of gravitational effects, that cannot be explained by [[Baryonic matter|visible matter]] alone, imply the existence of matter which does not or does only very weakly couple to the known forces of Nature. This dark matter dominates the matter density of the Universe, but its particles (if there are any) have eluded direct and indirect detection so far. Given the rich interaction structure of the well-known Standard Model particles, which make up only the subdominant component of the Universe, it is natural to think about a similarly interactive behaviour of dark sector particles. Dark photons could be part of these interactions among dark matter particles and provide a non-gravitational window (a so-called vector portal) into their existence by kinematically mixing with the Standard Model photon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Battaglieri|first=Marco|last2=Belloni|first2=Alberto|last3=Chou|first3=Aaron|last4=Cushman|first4=Priscilla|last5=Echenard|first5=Bertrand|last6=Essig|first6=Rouven|last7=Estrada|first7=Juan|last8=Feng|first8=Jonathan L.|last9=Flaugher|first9=Brenna|date=2017-07-14|title=US Cosmic Visions: New Ideas in Dark Matter 2017: Community Report|eprint=1707.04591|class=hep-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further motivation for the search for dark photons comes from several observed anomalies in astrophysics (e.g. in [[cosmic ray]]s) that could be related to dark matter interacting with a dark photon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pospelov|first=Maxim|last2=Ritz|first2=Adam|date=January 2009|title=Astrophysical Signatures of Secluded Dark Matter|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=671|issue=3|pages=391–397|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.12.012|arxiv=0810.1502|bibcode=2009PhLB..671..391P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arkani-Hamed|first=Nima|last2=Finkbeiner|first2=Douglas P.|last3=Slatyer|first3=Tracy R.|last4=Weiner|first4=Neal|date=2009-01-27|title=A Theory of Dark Matter|journal=Physical Review D|volume=79|issue=1|pages=015014|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.015014|issn=1550-7998|arxiv=0810.0713|bibcode=2009PhRvD..79a5014A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the most interesting application of dark photons arises in the explanation of the discrepancy between the measured and the calculated [[Anomalous magnetic dipole moment|anomalous magnetic moment of the muon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pospelov|first=Maxim|date=2009-11-02|title=Secluded U(1) below the weak scale|journal=Physical Review D|volume=80|issue=9|pages=095002|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.80.095002|issn=1550-7998|arxiv=0811.1030|bibcode=2009PhRvD..80i5002P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Endo|first=Motoi|last2=Hamaguchi|first2=Koichi|last3=Mishima|first3=Go|date=2012-11-27|title=Constraints on Hidden Photon Models from Electron g-2 and Hydrogen Spectroscopy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=86|issue=9|pages=095029|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.86.095029|issn=1550-7998|arxiv=1209.2558|bibcode=2012PhRvD..86i5029E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giusti|first=D.|last2=Lubicz|first2=V.|last3=Martinelli|first3=G.|last4=Sanfilippo|first4=F.|last5=Simula|first5=S.|date=October 2017|title=Strange and charm HVP contributions to the muon ($g - 2)$ including QED corrections with twisted-mass fermions|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2017|issue=10|pages=157|doi=10.1007/JHEP10(2017)157|issn=1029-8479|arxiv=1707.03019|bibcode=2017JHEP...10..157G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy is usually thought of as a persisting hint for [[physics beyond the Standard Model]] and should be accounted for by general [[New Physics|new physics]] models. Beside the effect on electromagnetism via kinetic mixing and possible interactions with dark matter particles, dark photons (if massive) can also play the role of a dark matter candidate themselves. This is theoretically possible through the [[misalignment mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arias|first=Paola|last2=Cadamuro|first2=Davide|last3=Goodsell|first3=Mark|last4=Jaeckel|first4=Joerg|last5=Redondo|first5=Javier|last6=Ringwald|first6=Andreas|date=2012-06-08|title=WISPy Cold Dark Matter|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|volume=2012|issue=6|pages=013|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2012/06/013|issn=1475-7516|arxiv=1201.5902|bibcode=2012JCAP...06..013A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Adding a sector containing dark photons to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of the Standard Model can be done in a straightforward and minimal way by introducing a new U(1) [[gauge field]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The specifics of the interaction between this new field, potential new particle content (e.g. a [[Dirac fermion]] for dark matter) and the Standard Model particles are virtually only limited by the creativity of the theorist and the constraints that have already been put on certain kinds of couplings. The arguably most popular basic model involves a single new broken U(1) gauge symmetry and kinetic mixing between the corresponding dark photon field &lt;math&gt;A^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Electroweak interaction|Standard Model hypercharge fields]]. The operator at play is &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}^\prime B^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[field strength tensor]] of the dark photon field and &lt;math&gt;B^{\mu\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;denotes the field strength tensor of the Standard Model weak hypercharge fields. This term arises naturally by writing down all terms allowed by the gauge symmetry. After [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] and diagonalising the terms containing the field strength tensors (kinetic terms) by redefining the fields, the relevant terms in the Lagrangian are

&lt;math display="block" id="lagrange"&gt;\mathcal{L}\supset-\frac{1}{4}F^{\prime\mu\nu}F^{\prime}_{\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}m_{A^\prime}^{2}A^{\prime\mu}A^{\prime}_\mu+\epsilon e A^{\prime\mu}J_{\mu}^{EM}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{A^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;is the mass of the dark photon (in this case it can be thought of as being generated by the [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs]] or [[Stueckelberg action|Stueckelberg mechansim]]), &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter describing the kinetic mixing strength and &lt;math&gt;J_{\mu}^{EM}&lt;/math&gt;denotes the [[Four-current|electromagnetic current]] with its coupling &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. The fundamental parameters of this model are thus the mass of the dark photon and the strength of the kinetic mixing. Other models leave the new U(1) gauge symmetry unbroken, resulting in a massless dark photon carrying a long-range interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=Lotty|last2=Buckley|first2=Matthew R.|last3=Carroll|first3=Sean M.|last4=Kamionkowski|first4=Marc|date=2009-01-23|title=Dark Matter and Dark Radiation|journal=Physical Review D|volume=79|issue=2|pages=023519|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.023519|issn=1550-7998|arxiv=0810.5126|bibcode=2009PhRvD..79b3519A}}&lt;/ref&gt; A massless dark photon, however, will experimentally be hard to distinguish from the Standard Model photon. The incorporation of new Dirac fermions as dark matter particles in this theory is uncomplicated and can be achieved by simply adding the [[Dirac equation|Dirac terms]] to the Lagrangian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ilten|first=Philip|last2=Soreq|first2=Yotam|last3=Williams|first3=Mike|last4=Xue|first4=Wei|date=2018-01-15|title=Serendipity in dark photon searches|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2018|issue=6|arxiv=1801.04847|doi=10.1007/JHEP06(2018)004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quantum field theory}}

In [[mathematical physics]], '''the Dirac equation in curved spacetime''' generalizes the original [[Dirac equation]] to [[curved space]].

It can be written by using [[vierbein]] fields and the gravitational [[spin connection]]. The vierbein defines a local rest [[Frame fields in general relativity|frame]], allowing the constant [[Dirac matrices]] to act at each spacetime point. In this way, Dirac's equation takes the following form in curved spacetime:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Unified Grand Tour of Theoretical Physics|first=Ian D. |last=Lawrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;!-- Could someone please put this in a nondimensionalized form, i.e include c and h, I'm sure if anyone wants to use this with natural units they can figure out how to write the equation. --&gt;&lt;math&gt;i\gamma^a e_a^\mu D_\mu \Psi - m \Psi = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the [[vierbein]] and {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[covariant derivative]] for [[fermionic field]]s, defined as follows
:&lt;math&gt;D_\mu = \partial_\mu - \frac{i}{4} \omega_{\mu}^{ab} \sigma_{ab},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the commutator of Dirac matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ab}=\frac{i}{2} \left[\gamma_{a},\gamma_{b}\right], &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are the [[spin connection]] components.

Note that here Latin indices denote the "Lorentzian" vierbein labels while Greek indices denote [[manifold]] coordinate indices.

'''Electron cyclotron resonance''' is a phenomenon observed in [[plasma physics]], [[condensed matter physics]], and [[accelerator physics]]. An [[electron]] in a static and uniform [[magnetic field]] will move in a circle due to the [[Lorentz force]].  The circular motion may be superimposed with a uniform axial motion, resulting in a [[helix]], or with a uniform motion perpendicular to the field (e.g., in the presence of an electrical or gravitational field) resulting in a [[cycloid]].  The [[angular frequency]] (ω&amp;nbsp;= 2π[[Frequency|''f'']] ) of this ''cyclotron'' motion for a given magnetic field strength ''B'' is given (in [[SI]] units)&lt;ref&gt;In SI units, the elementary charge ''e'' has the value 1.602×10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; [[coulomb]]s, the mass of the electron ''m''{{sub|e}} has the value 9.109×10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms, the magnetic field ''B'' is measured in [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s, and the angular frequency ω is measured in [[radian]]s per second.&lt;/ref&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{ce} = \frac{eB}{m_\text{e}}&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]] and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the electron. For the commonly used [[microwave]] frequency [[ISM band|2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz]] and the bare electron charge and mass, the resonance condition is met when ''B'' = 875{{nbsp}}[[gauss (unit)|G]] = 0.0875{{nbsp}}[[tesla (unit)|T]].

For particles of charge ''q'', electron rest mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0,e&lt;/sub&gt; moving at relativistic speeds ''v'', the formula needs to be adjusted according to the [[special theory of relativity]] to:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{ce} = \frac{eB}{\gamma m_{0,\text{e}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==In plasma physics==
An ionized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] may be efficiently produced or heated by superimposing a static [[magnetic field]] and a high-frequency [[electromagnetic field]] at the electron cyclotron [[resonance]] frequency. In the toroidal magnetic fields used in [[magnetic fusion energy]] research, the magnetic field decreases with the major radius, so the location of the power deposition can be controlled within about a centimeter. Furthermore, the heating power can be rapidly modulated and is deposited directly into the electrons. These properties make electron cyclotron heating a very valuable research tool for energy transport studies. In addition to heating, electron cyclotron waves can be used to drive current. The inverse process of [[Cyclotron radiation|electron cyclotron emission]] can be used as a [[Plasma diagnostics|diagnostic]] of the radial electron temperature profile.

==ECR ion sources==
Since the early 1980s, following the [[Tom W. Bonner Prize|award-winning]] pioneering work done by Dr. [[Richard Geller (physicist)|Richard Geller]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Geller, Peroc. 1st Int. Con. Ion Source, Saclay, p. 537, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Claude Lyneis]], and Dr. H. Postma;&lt;ref&gt;H. Postma, Phys. Lett. A, 31, p. 196, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; respectively from [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|French Atomic Energy Commission]], [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], the use of electron cyclotron resonance for efficient plasma generation, especially to obtain large numbers of multiply charged ions, has acquired a unique importance in various technological fields. Many diverse activities depend on electron cyclotron resonance technology, including
* advanced cancer treatment, where ECR [[ion sources]] are crucial for [[proton therapy]],
* advanced [[Semiconductor fabrication|semiconductor manufacturing]], especially for high density [[DRAM]] memories, through [[plasma etching]] or other [[plasma processing]] technologies,
* [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] devices for [[spacecraft propulsion]], where a broad range of devices ([[HiPEP]], some [[Electrostatic ion thruster|ion thruster]]s, or [[electrodeless plasma thruster]]s),
* for [[particle accelerator]]s, on-line mass separation and radioactive ion charge breeding,&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Ion Source'', B. Wolf, {{ISBN|0-8493-2502-1}}, p136-146&lt;/ref&gt;
* and, as a more mundane example, painting of plastic bumpers for cars.

The ECR ion source makes use of the electron cyclotron resonance to ionize a plasma. Microwaves are injected into a volume at the frequency corresponding to the electron cyclotron resonance, defined by the magnetic field applied to a region inside the volume. The volume contains a low pressure gas. The alternating electric field of the microwaves is set to be synchronous with the gyration period of the free electrons of the gas, and increases their perpendicular kinetic energy. Subsequently, when the energized free electrons collide with the gas in the volume they can cause ionization if their kinetic energy is larger than the ionization energy of the atoms or molecules. The ions produced correspond to the gas type used, which may be pure, a compound, or vapor of a solid or liquid material.

ECR ion sources are able to produce singly charged ions with high intensities (e.g. [[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Deuterium|D]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions of more than 100 [[milliampere|mA]] (electrical) in DC mode&lt;ref&gt;R. Gobin et al., [http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/e02/PAPERS/THPRI003.pdf Saclay High Intensity Light Ion Source Status] The Euro. Particle Accelerator Conf. 2002, Paris, France, June 2002, p1712&lt;/ref&gt; using a 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz ECR ion source).

For multiply charged ions, the ECR ion source has the advantages that it is able to confine the ions for long enough for multiple collisions and multiple ionization to take place, and the low gas pressure in the source avoids recombination. The VENUS ECR ion source at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] has produced in intensity of 0.25 mA (electrical) of [[Bismuth|Bi]]&lt;sup&gt;29+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29329 VENUS reveals the future of heavy-ion sources] CERN Courier, 6 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important industrial fields would not exist without the use of this fundamental technology, which makes electron cyclotron resonance ion and plasma sources one of the enabling technologies of today's world.

==In condensed matter physics==
Within a solid the mass in the cyclotron frequency equation above is replaced with the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] tensor &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt;.  Cyclotron resonance is therefore a useful technique to measure [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and [[Fermi surface]] cross-section in solids.  In a sufficiently high magnetic field at low temperature in a relatively pure material

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         \omega_\text{ce} &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{\tau} \\
  \hbar{\omega}_\text{ce} &amp;&gt; k_B T \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the carrier scattering lifetime, &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature.  When these conditions are satisfied, an electron will complete its cyclotron orbit without engaging in a collision, at which point it is said to be in a well-defined Landau level.

The '''Energy Technology Data Exchange''' (ETDE) was formed in 1987 and officially ended 30 June 2014.&lt;ref name=home2016&gt;

  | accessdate =2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated as a [[multilateral agreement]] under the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) agreement network, replacing numerous other [[bilateral agreement]]s. The multilateral agreement was for the international exchange of [[energy research]] and development and information. The exchange resulted in a [[database]] which was the world's largest collection of energy research, technology, and development (RTD) information ([[ETDEWEB]] - described below).  The collection of information was generated from energy RTD literature published in member countries and through other partnering arrangements with organizations such as the [[International Nuclear Information System]] (a unit of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]).  This had the effect of creating a broad spectrum of information that was included in the ETDE database. The range of content included [[fossil fuel]]s, [[renewable energies]] (including [[Hydrogen]]), End-Use ([[Building]]s, [[Industry]] and [[Transport]]), [[fusion power|fusion]], energy policy, conservation, and efficiency, and cross-sectional activities. This fulfilled the need for timely exchange of global information towards the goal of a sustainable energy future.  ETDE operated under an IEA Implementing Agreement and was governed by an Executive Committee of delegates from ETDE member countries.  Officers of the Executive Committee included a Chair and two Vice-Chairs, elected to three-year terms.  Day-to-day operations were managed through an operating agent organization, which reported to the Executive Committee.

==Energy Database==
ETDE's '''Energy Database''' was a substantial collection that focused on [[energy research]] literature and [[technology]] literature. This database contained more than 4.5 million abstracted and indexed records, and was updated twice per month. Temporal coverage was from 1974 to 2014. The principle access point for this database was [[ETDEWEB]] (see next section). However, access was also available through commercial online hosts, and some countries offered their own products for access. Member country representatives supplied the best options for their citizens to access this database. Furthermore, the United States fed this database to [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]] which provided online access. Likewise, Germany fed this database to [[STN International]].

Broad subject coverage included information on energy research and development; [[energy policy]] and planning; basic sciences (e.g., [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biomedical]]) and [[materials research]]; the [[Sustainability|environmental impact]] of [[energy production]] and use, including [[climate change]]; [[energy conservation]]; nuclear (e.g., [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactors]], isotopes, [[nuclear waste management|waste management]]); coal and [[fossil fuels]]; and renewable energy technologies (e.g., [[solar energy]], [[wind energy]], [[biomass]], [[geothermal]], hydro). The scope of topical coverage was worldwide in some areas. The database was used by scientists, researchers, engineers, policymakers, information specialists, librarians, industry leaders, university faculty, and university students, among others.

== ETDEWEB ==
Energy Technology Data Exchange employed an [[internet]] related database to disseminate the energy research and technology information which was collected and exchanged.  The database was named '''''ETDE World Energy Base''''' or '''''ETDEWEB'''''.&lt;ref name=home&gt;
{{cite web
  | last =Energy Technology Data Exchange

  | publisher =International Energy Agency
  | date =July 2010
  | url =http://www.etde.org/
  | accessdate =2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ETDEWEB was produced and made available by ETDE.  It had over 5 million references for literature that encompassed broad topical coverage, and allowed access to more than 500 000 full text documents and reports, which amounted to more than 1 million pages. ETDEWEB had unique access to these reports, which were often not available through other conventional sources.  Over a million other references linked to sites containing cited documents. Open access was provided to member countries, countries with developing country status, or by Executive Committee decision.&lt;ref name=etdewebpg&gt;

  | publisher =International Energy Agency
  | date =August 2010
  | url =http://www.etde.org/
  | accessdate =2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online access was extended through the wordwideenergy.org website.

===WorldWideENERGY.org (WWE)===
After the previous ETDE consortium ended in 2014, the WWE application allowed ETDEWEB and other content to remain accessible, thanks to remaining funds and former member country support. But this extended access also ended in July 2016.&lt;ref name=WWE&gt;
{{cite web

  | publisher =International Energy Agency

  | accessdate =2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a possibility that ETDEWEB will again become accessible at some unspecified time in the future via the US DOE’s Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) systems.

=== Subject coverage ===
ETDEWEB covered an extensive base of topics,  the main areas included information on energy research and development along with energy policy and planning.  Other areas of coverage included basic sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry and biomedical); materials research; the environmental impacts of energy production and use (including climate change); energy conservation; nuclear energy (e.g., reactors, isotopes, and nuclear waste management); coal and fossil fuels; and renewable energy technologies (e.g., solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro).&lt;ref name=energyDB&gt;

'''Explosives trace detectors''' ('''ETD''') are [[explosive detection]] equipment able to detect [[explosive]]s of small magnitude. The detection is accomplished by sampling non-visible "trace" amounts of particulates.  Devices similar to ETDs are also used to detect [[narcotic]]s. The equipment is used mainly in [[airport]]s and other vulnerable areas considered susceptible to acts of unlawful interference. Dr. Stephen Lee is credited with inventing the [[Fido explosives detector]] while working at the [[Army Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= |title=Research lab chief scientist gains presidential recognition |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=978 |website=www.arl.army.mil |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Sensitivity===
[[Detection limit]] is defined as the lowest amount of explosive matter a detector can detect reliably. It is expressed in terms of nano-grams (ng), pico-grams (pg) or femto-grams (fg) with fg being better than pg better than ng. It can also be expressed in terms of parts per billion (ppb), parts per trillion (ppt) or parts per quadrillion (ppq).

Sensitivity is important because most explosives have a low vapor pressure . The detector with the highest sensitivity is the best in detecting vapors of explosives reliably.

===Light weight===
Portable explosive detectors need to be as light weight as possible to allow users to not fatigue when holding them. Also, light weight detectors can easily be placed on top of robots.

===Size===
Portable explosive detectors need to be as small as possible to allow for sensing of explosives in hard to reach places like under a car or inside a trash bin.

===Cold start up time and analysis time===
The start up time for any trace detector is the time required by the detector to reach the optimized temperature for detection of contraband substances.

==Technologies==

=== Colorimetrics ===
The use of colorimetric test kits for explosive detection is one of the oldest, simplest, and most widely used methods for the detection of explosives. Colorimetric detection of explosives involves applying a chemical reagent to an unknown material or sample and observing a color reaction. Common color reactions are known and indicate to the user if there is an explosive material present and in many cases the group of explosive from which the material is derived. The major groups of explosives are nitroaromatic explosives, nitrate ester and nitramine explosives, improvised explosives not containing nitro groups which includes inorganic nitrate based explosives, chlorate based explosives, and peroxide based explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=Maurice |last2=Oxley |first2=Jimmie |date=2009 |title=ASPECTS OF EXPLOSIVES DETECTION}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ion mobility spectrometry ===
Explosive detection using [[ion mobility spectrometry]] (IMS) is based on velocities of ions in a uniform electric field. There are some variant to IMS such as Ion trap mobility spectrometry (ITMS) or Non-linear dependence on ion mobility (NLDM) which are based on IMS principle. The sensitivity of devices using this technology is limited to pg levels. The technology also requires the ionization of sample explosives which is accomplished by a radioactive source such as [[nickel-63]] or [[americium-241]]. This technology is found in most commercially available explosive detectors such as the GE VaporTracer, Smith Sabre 4000 and Russian built MO-2M and MO-8.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The presence of radioactive materials in these equipments cause regulatory hassles and requires special permissions at customs ports. These detectors cannot be field serviced and may pose radiation hazard to the operator if the casing of the detector cracks due to mishandling. Bi-yearly{{clarify|twice a year or once every two years?|date=February 2011}} checks are mandatory on such equipment in most countries by regulating agencies to ensure that there are no radiation leaks. Disposal of these equipments is also controlled owing to the high half-life of the radioactive material used.

[[Electrospray ionization]], mobility analysis (DMA) and [[tandem mass spectrometry]] (MS/MS) is used by SEDET (Sociedad Europea de Detección) for the “Air Cargo Explosive Screener (ACES)”, targeted to aviation cargo containers currently under development in Spain.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Thermo redox===

This technology is based on decomposition of explosive substance followed by the reduction of the nitro groups. Most military grade explosives are [[nitro compound]]s and have an abundance of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups on them. Explosive vapors are pulled into an adsorber at a high rate and then pyrolized. The presence of nitro groups in the pyrolized products is then detected. This technology has significantly more false alarms because many other harmless compounds also have an abundance of nitro groups. For example, most fertilizers have nitro groups which are falsely identified as explosives, and the sensitivity of this technology is also fairly low. A popular detector using this technology is Scientrex EVD 3000.

===Chemiluminescence===
This technology is based on the luminescence of certain compounds when they attach to explosive particles. This is mostly used in non-electronic equipment such as sprays and test papers. The sensitivity is pretty low in the order of nanograms.

===Amplifying fluorescent polymer===
Amplifying fluorescent polymer (AFP) is a promising new technology and is based on synthesized polymers which bind to explosive molecules and give an amplified signal upon detection. When compounds that are not polymers are utilized for such purpose, the quenching of the fluorescence by the traces of explosives is not detectable. When amplifying fluorescent polymer in thin films absorbs a photon of light, excited state polymers ([[Exciton|exitons]]) are able to migrate along the polymer backbone and between the adjacent polymer films. These sensors were originally made in order to detect [[trinitrotoluene]]. In AFP, binding of one TNT molecule results in quenching of fluorescence significantly due to the conjugated structure of the polymers.  It has been reported that in practice the polymers result in 100-1000 fold increase of amplification of the quenching response.

"During its excited state lifetime, the exciton propagates by a random walk through a finite volume of the polymer film."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-2319-7_4|title=Electronic Noses &amp; Sensors for the Detection of Explosives|last=Cumming|first=Colin|last2=Fisher|first2=Mark|last3=Sikes|first3=John|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402023170|editor-last=Gardner|editor-first=Julian W.|series=NATO Science Series II: Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry|pages=53–69|language=en|doi=10.1007/1-4020-2319-7_4|editor-last2=Yinon|editor-first2=Jehuda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once TNT, or any other electron-deficient (i.e., electron accepting) molecule comes in contact with the polymer, a so-called low-energy ‘trap’ forms. "If the exciton migrates to the site of the bound electron-deficient molecule before transitioning back to the ground state, the exciton will be trapped (a non-radiative process), and no fluorescence will be observed from the excitation event. Since the exciton samples many potential analyte binding sites during its excited state lifetime, the probability that the exciton will sample an occupied ‘receptor’ site and be quenched is greatly increased."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

]]
The explosive trace detectors utilizing AFPs, known as Fido, were originally developed under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Dog’s Nose program and is now produced by [[FLIR Systems]]. The current generation, provides broad-band trace explosive detection and weighs less than 3 lbs.  The sensitivity is in the order of femtogram (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; grams). This is the only such technology in the field that can achieve such sensitivity.

===Mass spectrometry===
Recently, [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) has emerged as another ETD technology. Adoption of mass spectrometry should lower false alarms rates often associated with ETD due to the higher resolution of the core technology.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} It also uses a non-radioactive ionization method.  Primarily used in desktop ETD systems, mass spectrometry can be miniaturized for handheld ETD but at the cost of compromising much of the performance that defines the technology.

[[File:Ceramic magnets.jpg|thumb|A stack of ferrite magnets]]
A '''ferrite''' is a [[ceramic]] material made by mixing and firing large proportions [[iron(III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [[rust]]) blended with small proportions of one or more additional [[metal]]lic [[chemical element|elements]], such as [[barium]], [[manganese]], [[nickel]], and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name="Carter 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=C.

Grant |year=2007 |title=Ceramic Materials: Science and Engineering |pages=212–15 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-46270-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both [[electrical conductivity|electrically ''non''-conductive]], meaning that they are insulators, and [[ferrimagnetic]], meaning they can easily be [[magnet]]ized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrites can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized (magnetic [[coercivity]]).

'''Hard ferrites''' have high [[coercivity]], so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent [[magnet]]s for [[refrigerator magnet]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, small [[electric motor]]s, and so on.

'''Soft ferrites''' have low [[coercivity]], so they easily change their magnetization, and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient [[magnetic core]]s called [[ferrite core]]s for high-frequency [[inductor]]s and [[transformer]]s, and in various [[microwave]] components.

Ferrite compounds have extremely low cost, being made of mostly [[rust|rusted iron (iron oxide)]], and also have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces. Yogoro Kato and Takeshi Takei of the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] synthesized the first ferrite compounds in 1930.&lt;ref name= Okamoto&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okamoto |first1=A. |chapter=The Invention of Ferrites and Their Contribution to the Miniaturization of Radios |doi=10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360693 |title=2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops |pages=1–42 |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4244-5626-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition, structure, and properties==
Ferrites are usually [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] ceramic compounds derived from [[iron oxide]]s. [[Magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a famous example. Like most of the other ceramics, ferrites are hard, [[brittle]], and poor [[electrical conductivity|conductors of electricity]].

Many ferrites adopt the [[Spinel group|spinel]] structure with the [[Chemical formula|formula]] AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where A and B represent various metal [[cation]]s, usually including iron (Fe). Spinel ferrites usually adopt a crystal motif consisting of cubic close-packed (fcc) oxides (O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) with A cations occupying one eighth of the tetrahedral holes and B cations occupying half of the octahedral holes, i.e., {{chem|A|2+|B|2|3+|O|4|2−}}.

Ferrite crystals do not adopt the ordinary spinel structure, but rather the inverse spinel structure: One eighth of the tetrahedral holes are occupied by B cations, one fourth of the octahedral sites are occupied by A cations. and the other one fourth by B cation. It is also possible to have mixed structure spinel ferrites with formula [M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1−δ&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt;][M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2−δ&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; where δ is the degree of inversion.

The magnetic material known as "ZnFe" has the formula ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, with Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; occupying the octahedral sites and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; occupy the tetrahedral sites, it is an example of normal structure spinel ferrite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Shriver |first1=D.F. |title=Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7167-4878-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2014}}

Some ferrites adopt hexagonal crystal structure, like [[barium]] and [[strontium]] ferrites BaFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; (BaO:6Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and SrFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; (SrO:6Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Zaka"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.12.061|title=Influence of Pb doping on structural, electrical and magnetic properties of Sr-hexaferrites|year=2013|last1=Ullah|first1=Zaka|last2=Atiq|first2=Shahid|last3=Naseem|first3=Shahzad|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|volume=555|pages=263–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of their magnetic properties, the different ferrites are often classified as "soft", "semi-hard" or "hard", which refers to their low or high magnetic [[coercivity]], as follows.

===Soft ferrites===
[[Image:Ferrite cores.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Various ferrite cores used to make small transformers and inductors]]

Ferrites that are used in [[transformer]] or [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[Magnetic core|cores]] contain [[nickel]], [[zinc]], and/or [[manganese]] compounds. They have a low [[coercivity]] and are called '''soft ferrites'''. The low coercivity means the material's [[magnetization]] can easily reverse direction without dissipating much energy ([[hysteresis loss]]es), while the material's high [[resistivity]] prevents [[eddy current]]s in the core, another source of energy loss. Because of their comparatively low losses at high frequencies, they are extensively used in the cores of [[Radio frequency|RF]] transformers and [[inductor]]s in applications such as [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] and [[loopstick antenna]]s used in AM radios.

The most common soft ferrites are:&lt;ref name="Zaka"/&gt;
* '''Manganese-zinc ferrite''' ('''MnZn''', with the formula {{nowrap|Mn&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;(1-a)&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}). MnZn have higher [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[saturation induction]] than NiZn.
* '''Nickel-zinc ferrite''' ('''NiZn''', with the formula {{nowrap|Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;(1-a)&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}). NiZn ferrites exhibit higher resistivity than MnZn, and are therefore more suitable for frequencies above 1&amp;nbsp;MHz.  &lt;!-- Ferroxcube Product Selection Guide 2003, page 5 --&gt;

For applications below 5&amp;nbsp;MHz, MnZn ferrites are used; above that, NiZn is the usual choice. The exception is with [[Choke (electronics)#Common-mode choke|common mode inductors]], where the threshold of choice is at 70&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mag-inc.com/products/ferrite-cores/learn-more-about-ferrites&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-hard ferrites===
* '''Cobalt ferrite''', CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CoO·Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is in between soft and hard magnetic material and is usually classified as a semi-hard material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hosni|title=Semi-hard magnetic properties of nanoparticles of cobalt ferrite synthesized by the co-precipitation process|date=2016|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838816330158}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly used for its magnetostrictive applications like sensors and actuators &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olabi|title=Design and application of magnetostrictive materials|date=2008|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261306907000027}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to its high saturation [[magnetostriction]] (~200 ppm). CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has also the benefits to be [[rare-earth]] free, which makes it a good substitute for [[Terfenol-D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sato Turtelli et al.|title=Co-ferrite – A material with interesting magnetic properties|journal=Iop Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering|volume=60|pages=012020|date=2014|doi=10.1088/1757-899X/60/1/012020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, its magnetostrictive properties can be tuned by inducing a magnetic uniaxial anisotropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=J. C. Slonczewski|title=Origin of Magnetic Anisotropy in Cobalt-Substituted Magnetite|journal=Physical Review|volume=110|issue=6|pages=1341–1348|date=1958|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.110.1341}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done by magnetic annealing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lo|title=Improvement of magnetomechanical properties of cobalt ferrite by magnetic annealing|date=2005|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1519408/}}&lt;/ref&gt; magnetic field assisted compaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|title=Magnetostriction properties of oriented polycrystalline CoFe2O4|date=2015|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304885315307071}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reaction under uniaxial pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubert|first=A.|date=2017|title=Uniaxial anisotropy and enhanced magnetostriction of CoFe2O4 induced by reaction under uniaxial pressure with SPS|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01636264|journal=Journal of European Ceramic Society|volume=37 |issue=9|pages=3101-3105|doi=10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.03.036|via=|arxiv=1803.09656}}&lt;/ref&gt; This last solution has the advantage to be ultra fast (20 min) thanks to the use of [[spark plasma sintering]]. The induced magnetic anisotropy in cobalt ferrite is also beneficial to enhance the [[magnetoelectric effect]] in composite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aubert|first=A.|date=2017|title=Enhancement of the Magnetoelectric Effect in Multiferroic CoFe2O4/PZT Bilayer by Induced Uniaxial Magnetic Anisotropy|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01636268|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|volume=53 |issue=11|pages=1-5|doi=10.1109/TMAG.2017.2696162|via=|arxiv=1803.09677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hard ferrites===
In contrast, permanent ferrite [[magnet]]s are made of '''hard ferrites''', which have a high [[coercivity]] and high [[remanence]] after magnetization. [[Iron oxide]] and [[barium carbonate|barium]] or [[strontium carbonate]] are used in manufacturing of hard ferrite magnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/Ferrite.aspx |title=Ferrite Permanent Magnets |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Arnold Magnetic Technologies |accessdate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514152507/http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/Ferrite.aspx |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc-us.com/products/barium-carbonate.html |title=Barium Carbonate |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Chemical Products Corporation |accessdate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201172918/http://www.cpc-us.com/products/barium-carbonate.html |archivedate=1 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high coercivity means the materials are very resistant to becoming demagnetized, an essential characteristic for a permanent magnet.  They also have high [[magnetic permeability]].  These so-called ''ceramic magnets'' are cheap, and are widely used in household products such as [[refrigerator magnet]]s. The maximum magnetic field ''B'' is about 0.35 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] and the magnetic field strength ''H'' is about 30 to 160 kiloampere turns per meter (400 to 2000 [[oersted]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hilltech.com/products/emc_components/Amorphous_Shielding.html |title=Amorphous Magnetic Cores |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2006 |website= |publisher=Hill Technical Sales |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of ferrite magnets is about 5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The most common hard ferrites are:
* '''Strontium ferrite''', SrFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; (SrO·6Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), used in small electric motors, micro-wave devices, recording media, magneto-optic media, telecommunication and electronic industry.&lt;ref name="Zaka"/&gt;
* '''[[Barium ferrite]]''', BaFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; (BaO·6Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a common material for permanent magnet applications. Barium ferrites are robust ceramics that are generally stable to moisture and corrosion-resistant. They are used in e.g. [[loudspeaker]] magnets and as a medium for [[magnetic recording]], e.g. on [[magnetic stripe card]]s.

==Production==
Ferrites are produced by heating a mixture of the oxides of the constituent metals at high temperatures, as shown in this idealized equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growth and Characterization of Single Crystals of Zinc Ferrites, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3−x&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Inorg. Synth.|authors=M. Wittenauer, P. Wang, P. Metcalf, Z. Ka̧kol, J. M. Honig|pages=124–132|doi=10.1002/9780470132616.ch27|series=Inorganic Syntheses|year=2007|isbn=9780470132616}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  ZnO   →   ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
In some cases, the mixture of finely-powdered precursors is pressed into a mold.  For barium and strontium ferrites, these metals typically supplied as their carbonates, [[Barium carbonate|BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[Strontium carbonate|SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. During the heating process, these carbonates undergo [[calcination]]:
:MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → MO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
After this step, the two oxides combine to give the ferrite.  The resulting mixture of oxides undergoes [[sintering]].

===Processing===
Having obtained the ferrite, the cooled product is milled to particles smaller than 2 [[micrometer (unit)|µm]], sufficiently small that each particle consists of a [[single domain (magnetic)|single magnetic domain]]. Next the powder is pressed into a shape, dried, and re-sintered. The shaping may be performed in an external magnetic field, in order to achieve a preferred orientation of the particles ([[anisotropy]]).

Small and geometrically easy shapes may be produced with dry pressing. However, in such a process small particles may agglomerate and lead to poorer magnetic properties compared to the wet pressing process. Direct calcination and sintering without re-milling is possible as well but leads to poor magnetic properties.

Electromagnets are pre-sintered as well (pre-reaction), milled and pressed. However, the sintering takes place in a specific atmosphere, for instance one with an [[oxygen]] shortage. The chemical composition and especially the structure vary strongly between the precursor and the sintered product.

To allow efficient stacking of product in the furnace during sintering and prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using ceramic powder separator sheets. These sheets are available in various materials such as alumina, zirconia and magnesia. They are also available in fine, medium and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to the ware being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced while maximizing furnace loading.

==Uses==
[[Ferrite core]]s are used in electronic [[inductor]]s, [[transformer]]s, and [[electromagnet]]s where the high [[electrical resistance]] of the ferrite leads to very low [[eddy current]] losses. They are commonly seen as a lump in a computer cable, called a [[ferrite bead]], which helps to prevent high frequency electrical noise ([[radio frequency interference]]) from exiting or entering the equipment.

Early [[computer memory|computer memories]] stored data in the residual magnetic fields of hard ferrite cores, which were assembled into arrays of ''[[core memory]]''. Ferrite powders are used in the coatings of [[magnetic tape|magnetic recording tapes]]. One such type of material is [[iron (III) oxide]].

Ferrite particles are also used as a component of radar-absorbing materials or coatings used in [[Stealth technology#Principles|stealth]] aircraft and in the absorption tiles lining the rooms used for [[electromagnetic compatibility]] measurements.

Most common audio magnets, including those used in loudspeakers and [[Pick up (music technology)#Magnetic pickups|electromagnetic instrument pickups]], are ferrite magnets. Except for certain "vintage" products, ferrite magnets have largely displaced the more expensive [[Alnico]] magnets in these applications.

[[Magnetic nanoparticles|Ferrite nanoparticles]] exhibit [[superparamagnetic]] properties.

==History==
Yogoro Kato and Takeshi Takei of the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] synthesized the first ferrite compounds in 1930.  This led to the founding of [[TDK]] Corporation in 1935, to manufacture the material.

Barium hexaferrite (BaFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) was discovered in 1950 at the [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium]] (''Philips Physics Laboratory'').  The discovery was somewhat accidental—due to a mistake by an assistant who was supposed to be preparing a sample of hexagonal [[lanthanum]] ferrite for a team investigating its use as a semiconductor material.  On discovering that it was actually a magnetic material, and confirming its structure by [[X-ray crystallography]], they passed it on to the magnetic research group.&lt;ref&gt;Marc de Vries, ''80 Years of Research at the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium (1914-1994)'', p. 95, Amsterdam University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|9085550513}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barium hexaferrite has both high coercivity (170 kA/m) and low raw material costs.  It was developed as a product by [[Philips]] Industries (Netherlands) and from 1952 was marketed under the trade name ''Ferroxdure''.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Valenzuela, ''Magnetic Ceramics'', p. 76, Cambridge University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0521018439}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The low price and good performance led to a rapid increase in the use permanent magnets.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerber, C.D. Wright, G. Asti, ''Applied Magnetism'', p. 335, Springer, 2013 {{ISBN|9401582637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s Philips developed strontium hexaferrite (SrFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;), with better properties than barium hexaferrite.  Barium and strontium hexaferrite dominate the market due to their low costs.  However other materials have been found with improved properties.  BaFe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; came in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;F. K. Lotgering, P. H. G. M. Vromans, M. A. H. Huyberts, [http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/51/11/10.1063/1.327493 "Permanent‐magnet material obtained by sintering the hexagonal ferrite ''W''=BaFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;"], ''Journal of Applied Physics'', vol. 51, pp. 5913-5918, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; came in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Valenzuela, ''Magnetic Ceramics'', p. 76-77, Cambridge University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0521018439}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant''' is located at [[Flamanville, Manche]], [[France]] on the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]. The [[power plant]] houses two [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWRs) that produce 1.3 [[GWe|GW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]] each and came into service in 1986 and 1987, respectively. It produced 18.9 TWh in 2005, which amounted to 4% of the electricity production in France. In 2006 this figure was about 3.3%.

A third reactor at the site, a [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]] unit, is currently under construction. 
As of July 2016, the project was three times over budget and years behind schedule. 
Various safety problems have been raised, including weakness in the steel used in the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Rankin.

In 2006, before the start of construction of the EPR (unit 3), there were 671 workers regularly working at the two operational reactors.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The new unit is an [[Areva]] [[European Pressurized Reactor]] type and is planned to have a [[nameplate capacity]] of 1,650&amp;nbsp;MWe.

EDF has previously said France's first EPR would cost €3.3&amp;nbsp;billion&lt;ref name=wnn041207 /&gt; and start commercial operations in 2012, after construction lasting 54 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2048041 |title=Flamanville 3 concrete poured |newspaper=Nuclear Engineering International |date=6 December 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613091002/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2048041 |archivedate=June 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest cost estimate (July 2018) is at €10.9 billion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In November 2014 EDF announced that completion of construction was delayed to 2017 due to delays in component delivery by [[Areva]].&lt;ref name=ft-20141118&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/adc90b3e-6f67-11e4-8d86-00144feabdc0.html |title=EDF in fresh delay for flagship nuclear plant |author=Michael Stothard |newspaper=Financial Times |date=18 November 2014 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 Areva informed the French nuclear regulator, [[Autorité de sûreté nucléaire]] (ASN), that anomalies had been detected in the reactor vessel steel, causing "lower than expected mechanical toughness values".

The EPR (Flamanville 3) aimed to be safer than any previous reactor, but as of 2016 the project is three times over budget and years behind schedule. In September 2015 EDF announced that the estimated costs had escalated to €10.5&amp;nbsp;billion, and the start-up of the reactor was delayed to the fourth quarter of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edf.fr/en/edf/press_release/Flamanville-EPR-optimised-project-management-and-a-new-timetable&lt;/ref&gt;

The delays of Unit 3 of Flamanville received additional attention when in December 2016 [[The Economist]] reported that the British loan guarantees for [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station|Hinkley Point C]] require Unit 3 to be operational by 2020, that the regulator will rule on the future of Unit 3 mid-2017 and that one possible outcome of this ruling can delay its opening far beyond 2018, thus jeopardizing the British loan guarantees thereby preventing EDF from building the EPRs at Hinkley Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.economist.com/news/business/21711087-electricit-de-france-has-had-shut-down-18-its-58-nuclear-reactors-frances-nuclear-energy |title= France’s nuclear-energy champion is in turmoil |work= [[The Economist]] |date= 2016-12-03 |accessdate= 2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 renewed delays in the construction of the EPR-reactors at [[Taishan Nuclear Power Plant]] prompted EDF to state that Flamanville 3 remains on schedule to start operations by the end of 2018, assuming it receives regulator approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/edf-confirms-flamanville-timetable-after-taishan-epr-delay/articleshow/57294950.cms |title= EDF confirms Flamanville timetable after Taishan EPR delay |work= [[Times of India]] |date= 2017-02-22 |accessdate= 2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 the French regulator issued a provisional ruling that Flamanville 3 is safe to start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-French-regulator-says-Flamanville-3-is-safe-to-start-29061701.html |website= [[world-nuclear-news.org]] |title= French regulator says Flamanville 3 is safe to start |date= 2017-06-28 |accessdate= 2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, cold functional tests were completed.&lt;ref&gt;http://world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Flamanville-EPR-completes-key-pre-operational-tests-0901184.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In February EDF found that some secondary cooling circuit welds did not meet specifications, causing EDF to carry out further checks and a report. Following this ASN requested EDF to extend the welding checks to other systems. Hot functional tests have been postponed.&lt;ref name=nei-20180604&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newspossible-reprieve-for-fessenheim-due-to-further-flamanville-delays-6175762 |title=Possible reprieve for Fessenheim due to further Flamanville delays |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=4 June 2018 |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, EDF further delayed fuel loading to Q4 2019 and increased the project's cost estimate by a further €400 million ($467.1 million USD). Startup is now scheduled to occur no earlier than Q2 2020 and EDF now estimates project costs at €10.9 billion ($12.75 billion USD), three times the original cost estimates. Hot testing is currently planned to occur by the end of 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=EDF Announces More Delays, Cost Overruns for Flamanville 3 Reactor|url=http://www.powermag.com/edf-announces-more-delays-cost-overruns-for-flamanville-3-reactor/|accessdate=31 July 2018|work=POWER Magazine|date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friendship One''' was a successful attempt at beating the round-the-world air speed record.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10136">In [[plasma physics]], the '''Hasegawa–Mima equation''', named after Akira Hasegawa and Kunioki Mima, is an equation that describes a certain regime of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], where the time scales are very fast, and the distance scale in the direction of the [[magnetic field]] is long. In particular the equation is useful for describing [[turbulence]] in some [[tokamak]]s. The equation was introduced in Hasegawa and Mima's paper submitted in 1977 to ''Physics of Fluids'', where they compared it to the results of the ATC tokamak.

==Assumptions==
* The magnetic field is large enough that:

::&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\omega_{ci}}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ll 1
&lt;/math&gt;

:for all quantities of interest. When the particles in the plasma are moving through a magnetic field, they spin in a circle around the magnetic field. The frequency of oscillation, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{ci}&lt;/math&gt; known as the [[cyclotron frequency]] or gyrofrequency, is directly proportional to the magnetic field.

* The particle density follows the [[quasineutrality condition]]:

::&lt;math&gt;
n_e \approx Z n_i \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:where Z is the number of protons in the ions. If we are talking about hydrogen Z = 1, and n is the same for both species. This condition is true as long as the electrons can shield out electric fields. A cloud of electrons will surround any charge with an approximate radius known as the [[Debye length]]. For that reason this approximation means the size scale is much larger than the Debye length. The ion particle density can be expressed by a first order term that is the density defined by the quasineutrality condition equation, and a second order term which is how much it differs from the equation.

* The first order ion particle density is a function of position, but not time. This means that perturbations of the particle density change at a timescale much slower than the scale of interest. The second order particle density which causes a charge density and thus an electric potential can change with time.
* The magnetic field, '''B''' must be uniform in space, and not be a function of time. The magnetic field also moves at a timescale much slower than the scale of interest. This allows the time derivative in the momentum balance equation to be neglected.
* The ion temperature must be much smaller than the electron temperature. This means that the ion pressure can be neglected in the ion momentum balance equation.
* The electrons follow a [[Boltzmann distribution]] where:

::&lt;math&gt;
n = n_0 e^{e\phi/T_e} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:Since the electrons are free to move along the direction of the magnetic field, they screen away electric potentials. This screening causes a Boltzmann distribution of electrons to form around the electric potentials.

==The equation==
The Hasegawa–Mima equation is a second order nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the electric potential. The form of the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2\phi-\phi\right)-\left[\left(\nabla\phi\times \mathbf{\hat z}\right)\cdot\nabla\right]\left[\nabla^2\phi-\ln\left(\frac{n_0}{\omega_{ci}}\right)\right]=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Although the quasi neutrality condition holds, the small differences in density between the electrons and the ions cause an electric potential.
The Hasegawa–Mima equation is derived from the continuity equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot (n\mathbf{ v}) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The fluid velocity can be approximated by the E cross B drift:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{ v_E} = \frac{\mathbf{ E}\times \mathbf{ B}}{cB^2} = \frac{-\nabla\phi\times\mathbf{\hat z}}{cB}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Previous models derived their equations from this approximation. The divergence of the [[E cross B drift]] is zero, which keeps the fluid incompressible. However, the compressibility of the fluid is very important in describing the evolution of the system. Hasegawa and Mima argued that the assumption was invalid. The Hasegawa–Mima equation introduces a second order term for the fluid velocity known as the [[polarization drift]] in order to find the divergence of the fluid velocity. Due to the assumption of large magnetic field, the polarization drift is much smaller than the E cross B drift. Nevertheless, it introduces important physics.

For a two-dimensional incompressible fluid which is not a plasma, the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] say:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2\psi\right)-\left[\left(\nabla\psi\times \mathbf{\hat z}\right)\cdot\nabla\right]\nabla^2\psi =0
&lt;/math&gt;

after taking the curl of the momentum balance equation. This equation is almost identical to the Hasegawa–Mima equation except the second and fourth terms are gone, and the electric potential is replaced with the fluid velocity vector potential where:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{ v} = -\nabla\psi\times\mathbf{\hat z}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The first and third terms to the Hasegawa–Mima equation, which are the same as the Navier Stokes equation, are the terms introduced by adding the polarization drift. In the limit where the wavelength of a perturbation of the electric potential is much smaller than the gyroradius based on the sound speed, the Hasegawa–Mima equations become the same as the two-dimensional incompressible fluid.

==Normalization==
One way to understand an equation more fully is to understand what it is normalized to, which gives you an idea of the scales of interest. The time, position, and electric potential are normalized to t',x', and &lt;math&gt;\phi'&lt;/math&gt;

The time scale for the Hasegawa–Mima equation is the inverse ion gyrofrequency:

:&lt;math&gt;
t' = \omega_{ci} t, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \omega_{ci} = \frac{eZB}{m_i c}.
&lt;/math&gt;

From the large magnetic field assumption the normalized time is very small. However, it is still large enough to get information out of it.

The distance scale is the [[gyroradius]] based on the sound speed:

:&lt;math&gt;
x' = \frac{x}{\rho_s}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \rho_s^2 \equiv \frac{T_e}{m_i\omega_{ci}^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If you transform to k-space, it is clear that when k, the wavenumber, is much larger than one, the terms that make the Hasegawa–Mima equation differ from the equation derived from Navier-Stokes equation in a two dimensional incompressible flow become much smaller than the rest.

From the distance and time scales we can determine the scale for velocities. This turns out to be the sound speed. The Hasegawa–Mima equation, shows us the dynamics of fast moving sounds as opposed to the slower dynamics such as flows that are captured in the [[Magnetohydrodynamics|MHD equations]]. The motion is even faster than the sound speed given that the time scales are much smaller than the time normalization.

The potential is normalized to:

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi' =\frac{e\phi}{T_e}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the electrons fit a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] and the quasineutrality condition holds, this normalized potential is small, but similar order to the normalized time derivative.

The entire equation without normalization is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\omega_{ci}}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_s^2\nabla^2\frac{e\phi}{T_e}-\frac{e\phi}{T_e}\right)-\left[\left(\rho_s\nabla \frac{e\phi}{T_e}\times \mathbf{\hat z}\right)\cdot\rho_s\nabla\right]\left[\rho_s^2\nabla^2\frac{e\phi}{T_e}-\ln\left(\frac{n_0}{\omega_{ci}}\right)\right]=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Although the time derivative divided by the cyclotron frequency is much smaller than unity, and the normalized electric potential is much smaller than unity, as long as the gradient is on the order of one, both terms are comparable to the nonlinear term. The unperturbed density gradient can also be just as small as the normalized electric potential and be comparable to the other terms.

==Other forms of the equation==
Often the Hasegawa–Mima equation is expressed in a different form using [[Poisson bracket]]s. These Poisson brackets are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[A,B\right] \equiv \frac{\partial A}{\partial x}\frac{\partial B}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial A}{\partial y}\frac{\partial B}{\partial x}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using these Poisson brackets, the equation can be reexpressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2\phi-\phi\right)+\left[\phi,\nabla^2\phi\right]-\left[\phi,\ln\left(\frac{n_0}{\omega_{ci}}\right)\right]=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Often the particle density is assumed to vary uniformly just in one direction, and the equation is written in a sightly different form. The Poisson bracket including the density is replaced with the definition of the Poisson bracket, and a constant replaces the derivative of the density dependent term.

==Conserved quantities==
There are two quantities that are conserved in a two-dimensional incompressible fluid.
The [[kinetic energy]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int\left(\nabla\psi\right)^2dV = \int v_x^2 + v_y^2\,dV.
&lt;/math&gt;

And the [[enstrophy]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int\left(\nabla^2\psi\right)^2\,dV = \int\left(\nabla\times \mathbf{ v}\right)^2\,dV.
&lt;/math&gt;

For the Hasegawa–Mima equation, there are also two conserved quantities, that are related to the above quantities.  The generalized energy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int\left[\phi^2+\left(\nabla\phi\right)^2\right]\,dV.
&lt;/math&gt;

And the generalized enstrophy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int\left[\left(\nabla\phi\right)^2+\left(\nabla^2\phi\right)^2\right]\,dV.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit where the Hasegawa–Mima equation is the same as an incompressible fluid, the generalized energy, and enstrophy become the same as the kinetic energy and enstrophy.

'''Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie''' (Helmholtz Center for Materials and Energy, HZB) is part of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]. The institute studies the structure and dynamics of materials and investigates [[solar cell]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/zentrum/beispiele-wissenschaft/index_en.html HZB: Research highlights]&lt;/ref&gt; Several large scale facilities are available, the most important of which are the 10 MW BER II [[nuclear research reactor]] at the Lise Meitner &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT [[WP:Internal link|link]]; she is properly linked as the namesake in the history below --&gt; campus in [[Wannsee]] and the third-generation [[BESSY]] II [[synchrotron]] in [[Adlershof]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/zentrum/index_en.html Overview of HZB on the official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin was created on 1 January 2009 by the merger of Hahn-Meitner-Institut Berlin (HMI) and Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY), thus bringing BESSY into the Helmholtz Association.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/news_seite?nid=14905&amp;sprache=de&amp;typoid=50025 Grünes Licht für die Fusion von HMI und BESSY: Official press release on the decided merger of the HMI and BESSY (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hahn-Meitner-Institut Berlin (HMI), named after [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]], was founded 14 March 1959 in Berlin-Wannsee to operate the BER I research reactor that began operation with 50 kW on 24 July 1958. Research originally focused on radiochemistry. In 1971, the federal government took over a 90% share in the HMI.

The Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung ([[BESSY]]) was founded in 1979. The first synchrotron BESSY I in Berlin-Wilmersdorf began operations in 1982.

'''Hydraulics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: Υδραυλική) is a technology and [[applied science]] using [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], and other sciences involving the mechanical properties and use of [[liquid]]s. At a very basic level, hydraulics is the liquid counterpart of [[pneumatics]], which concerns [[gas]]es. [[Fluid mechanics]] provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the applied engineering using the properties of fluids. In its [[fluid power]] applications, hydraulics is used for the generation, control, and transmission of [[Power (physics)|power]] by the use of [[pressure|pressurized]] liquids. Hydraulic topics range through some parts of science and most of engineering modules, and cover concepts such as pipe [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], [[dam]] design, [[fluidics]] and fluid control circuitry. The principles of hydraulics are in use naturally in the human body within the vascular system and erectile tissue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.industrialoutpost.com/human-circulatory-system-heart-modern-hydraulic/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501112640/http://www.industrialoutpost.com/human-circulatory-system-heart-modern-hydraulic/ |date=1 May 2017 }}{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meldrum |first1=David R. |last2=Burnett |first2=Arthur L. |last3=Dorey |first3=Grace |last4=Esposito |first4=Katherine |last5=Ignarro |first5=Louis J. |title=Erectile Hydraulics: Maximizing Inflow While Minimizing Outflow |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=1208–20 |year=2014 |pmid=24521101 |doi=10.1111/jsm.12457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Free surface hydraulics is the branch of hydraulics dealing with [[free surface]] flow, such as occurring in [[river]]s, [[canal]]s, [[lake]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[sea]]s. Its sub-field [[open-channel flow]] studies the flow in open [[channel (geography)|channels]].

The word "hydraulics" originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ὑδραυλικός}} (''hydraulikos'') which in turn originates from {{lang|grc|ὕδωρ}} (''hydor'', Greek for [[water]]) and {{lang|grc|αὐλός}} (''aulos'', meaning [[plumbing|pipe]]).

==Ancient and medieval era==
[[File:Tuebingen-gerstenmuehle.jpg|thumb|200px|Waterwheel.]]
Early uses of water power date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], where [[irrigation]] has been used since the 6th millennium BC and [[water clock]]s had been used since the early 2nd millennium BC. Other early examples of [[water]] power include the [[Qanat]] system in ancient Persia and the [[Turpan water system]] in ancient Central Asia.

===Greek / Hellenistic age===
The Greeks constructed sophisticated water and hydraulic power systems. An example is the construction by [[Eupalinos]], under a public contract, of a watering channel for [[Samos]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]]. An early example of the usage of hydraulic wheel, probably the earliest in Europe, is the Perachora wheel (3rd century BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomlinson |first1=R. A. |title=The Perachora Waterworks: Addenda |journal=The Annual of the British School at Athens |volume=71 |year=2013 |pages=147–8 |jstor=30103359 |doi=10.1017/S0068245400005864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the first hydraulic [[automata]] by [[Ctesibius]] (flourished c. 270 BC) and [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10 – 80 AD) is notable. Hero describes a number of working machines using hydraulic power, such as the [[force pump]], which is known from many Roman sites as having been used for raising water and in fire engines.&lt;ref&gt;Museum, Victoria and Albert.

=== Ancient Persia ===
The Persians constructed an intricate system of water mills, canals and dams known as the [[Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System]]. The project, commenced by [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] king [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] and finished by a group of Roman engineers captured by Sassanian king [[Shapur I]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1315|title=Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has been referred to by [[UNESCO]] as "a masterpiece of creative genius."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1315|title=Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the inventors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The qanats of Iran|last=Goldsmith|first=Edward|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Qanat]], an underground aqueduct.

===China===
In [[ancient China]] there was [[Sunshu Ao]] (6th century BC), [[Ximen Bao]] (5th century BC), [[Du Shi]] (circa 31 AD), [[Zhang Heng]] (78 – 139 AD), and [[Ma Jun]] (200 – 265 AD), while medieval China had [[Su Song]] (1020 – 1101 AD) and [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). Du Shi employed a [[waterwheel]] to power the [[bellows]] of a [[blast furnace]] producing [[cast iron]]. Zhang Heng was the first to employ hydraulics to provide motive power in rotating an [[armillary sphere]] for [[Chinese astronomy|astronomical observation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71370433|title=Origins of Chinese science and technology|last=1974-|first=Fu, Chunjiang,|last2=Liping.|first2=Yang,|last3=N.|first3=Han, Y.|last4=Editorial.|first4=Asiapac|date=2006|publisher=Asiapac|isbn=978-9812293763|oclc=71370433}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sigiriya moat and garden2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Moat and gardens at [[Sigiriya]].]]
In ancient [[Sri Lanka]], hydraulics were widely used in the ancient kingdoms of [[Anuradhapura]] and [[Polonnaruwa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/Sri%20Lanka%20Study_1.pdf |title=SriLanka-A Country study |author= |year=1990 |website= |publisher=USA Government, Department of Army|accessdate=9 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905131619/http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/Sri%20Lanka%20Study_1.pdf|archivedate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the principle of the valve tower, or valve pit, (Bisokotuwa in Sinhalese) for regulating the escape of water is credited to ingenuity more than 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/south_asia/sri_lanka/history.htm|title=SriLanka – History|author=|date=|website=|publisher=Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University|accessdate=9 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228234152/http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/south_asia/sri_lanka/history.htm|archivedate=28 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the first century AD, several large-scale irrigation works had been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/SriLanka.html|title=Traditional SriLanka or Ceylon|author=|date=|website=|publisher=Sam Houston State University|accessdate=9 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927020022/http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/SriLanka.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macro- and micro-hydraulics to provide for domestic horticultural and agricultural needs, surface drainage and erosion control, ornamental and recreational water courses and retaining structures and also cooling systems were in place in [[Sigiriya]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The coral on the massive rock at the site includes [[cistern]]s for collecting water.  Large ancient reservoirs of Sri Lanka are Kalawewa (King Dhatusena), Parakrama Samudra (King Parakrama Bahu), Tisa Wewa (King Dutugamunu), Minneriya (King Mahasen)

===Innovations in Ancient Rome===
[[File:Segovia Aqueduct.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Aqueduct of Segovia]], a 1st-century AD masterpiece.]]

In [[Ancient Rome]], many different hydraulic applications were developed, including public water supplies, innumerable [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s, power using [[watermill]]s and [[hydraulic mining]]. They were among the first to make use of the [[siphon]] to carry water across valleys, and used [[hushing]] on a large scale to prospect for and then extract metal [[ore]]s. They used [[lead]] widely in [[plumbing]] systems for domestic and public supply, such as feeding [[thermae]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[Hydraulic mining]] was used in the gold-fields of northern Spain, which was conquered by [[Augustus]] in 25 BC. The alluvial [[gold-mine]] of [[Las Medulas]] was one of the largest of their mines. It was worked by at least 7 long aqueducts, and the water streams were used to erode the soft deposits, and then wash the tailings for the valuable gold content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/803|title=Las Médulas|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patrimoniocastillayleon.com/en/las-medulas|title=Las Médulas|last=ricardo|date=2014-10-30|work=Castilla y León World Heritage UNESCO|access-date=2017-06-13|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, David.

In 1619 [[Benedetto Castelli]] (1576 – 1578–1643), a student of [[Galileo Galilei]], published the book ''Della Misura dell'Acque Correnti'' or "On the Measurement of Running Waters", one of the foundations of modern hydrodynamics. He served as a chief consultant to the Pope on hydraulic projects, i.e., management of rivers in the Papal States, beginning in 1626.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/castelli.html|title=The Galileo Project – Science – Benedetto Castelli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blaise Pascal===
[[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) studied fluid hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the [[hydraulic press]], which multiplied a smaller force acting on a smaller area into the application of a larger force totaled over a larger area, transmitted through the same pressure (or same change of pressure) at both locations. [[Pascal's law]] or principle states that for an incompressible fluid at rest, the difference in pressure is proportional to the difference in height and this difference remains the same whether or not the overall pressure of the fluid is changed by applying an external force. This implies that by increasing the pressure at any point in a confined fluid, there is an equal increase at every other point in the container, i.e., any change in pressure applied at any point of the fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluids.

===Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille===
A French physician, [[Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille|Poiseuille]] researched the flow of blood through the body and discovered an important law governing the rate of flow with the diameter of the tube in which flow occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Sutera and Skalak, Salvatore and Richard. The History of Poiseuille's Law. Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 1993. 25: 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===In the UK===
Several cities developed citywide [[hydraulic power network]]s in the 19th century, to operate machinery such as lifts, cranes, capstans and the like. [[Joseph Bramah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/technology/engineering/biography/bramah.htm |title=Joseph Bramah |publisher=Robinsonlibrary.com |date=2014-03-23 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early innovator and [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/technology/engineers/armstrong.html |title=William George Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Cragside (1810-1900) |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; perfected the apparatus for power delivery on an industrial scale.  In London, the [[London Hydraulic Power Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/sites/h/hydraulic_power_in_london/index.shtml |title=Subterranea Britannica: Sites: Hydraulic power in London |publisher=Subbrit.org.uk |date=1981-09-25 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a major supplier its pipes serving large parts of the [[West End of London]], [[City of London|City]] and the [[London Docks|Docks]], but there were schemes restricted to single enterprises such as docks and [[railway]] [[goods yard]]s.

=== Hydraulic models ===

After students understand the basic principles of hydraulics, some teachers use a hydraulic [[analogy]] to help students learn other things.
For example:
* The [[MONIAC Computer]] uses water flowing through hydraulic components to help students learn about economics.
* The [[thermal resistance#Analogies|thermal-hydraulic analogy]] uses hydraulic principles to help students learn about thermal circuits.
* The electronic–[[hydraulic analogy]] uses hydraulic principles to help students learn about electronics.

The [[conservation of mass]] requirement combined with fluid [[compressibility]] yields a fundamental relationship between pressure, fluid flow, and volumetric expansion, as shown below &lt;ref&gt;http://opac.vimaru.edu.vn/edata/DHHH/2017/02/22/SDHLT%2002954%20-%20Hydraulic%20control%20systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt} = \frac \beta V \cdot \left( \sum_{IN} Q - \frac{dV}{dt} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming an incompressible fluid or a "very large" ratio of compressibility to contained fluid volume, a finite rate of pressure rise requires that any net flow into the contained fluid volume create a volumetric change.

The Incredible Edible project is an [[Urban agriculture|urban gardening]] project which was started in 2008 by [[Pamela Warhurst]], Mary Clear and a group of like minded people in [[Todmorden]], [[West Yorkshire]], England.&lt;ref name=tod&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19523/1/Paull2011TodmordenFM.pdf "Incredible Edible Todmorden: Eating the Street"], Farming Matters, 27(3):28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/24956/28/24956.pdf  "Please Pick Me" – How Incredible Edible Todmorden is repurposing the commons for open source food and agricultural biodiversity],  In J. Franzo, D. Hunter, T. Borelli &amp; F. Mattei (Eds.). Diversifying Foods and Diets: Using Agricultural Biodiversity to Improve Nutrition and Health. Oxford: Earthscan, Routledge, pp.336-345.&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to bring people together through actions around [[local food]], helping to change behaviour towards the environment and to build a kinder and more resilient world. In some cases, it also envisions to have the groups become self-sufficient in food production, hence having all food being produced locally. 

==Incredible Edible Movement==
Since its conception, the Incredible Edible ethos has been taken up by communities all over the world and there are now 120 Incredible Edible official groups in the UK and more than 700 worldwide. In 2008 to help sustain existing groups and continue to inspire new ones in the UK,  the Incredible Edible Network was launched with [[Pamela Warhurst|Pam Warhurst]] as its chair and Tanya Wall, as its operational lead.

In the UK, these groups' collective success has begun to directly influence decision-makers both on a national and local level. In response, the network has evolved from a resource for members into a fully fledged movement, simply known as Incredible Edible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.incredibleedible.org.uk|title = Incredible Edible|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At first, we had trouble getting people to help themselves, because we're from a country where people say, 'Get off my land', so we had to tell people it was OK .... nearly 50% said it had had a positive impact on their income." &lt;ref name=website&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Killian|title=Incredible Edible 'It's not all about free food'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/feb/18/50-new-radicals-incredible-edible|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 August 2012|location=London|date=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  -- Mary Clear
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, [[Prince Charles]] visited the Incredible Edible Todmorden project in support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todmordennews.co.uk/news/local/incredible-it-s-a-national-breakthrough-as-tod-representatives-meet-prince-charles-1-1846416|title=Incredible...it's a national breakthrough as Tod representatives meet Prince Charles|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group meet regularly at [[Todmorden Unitarian Church]] and manage plantings and other food producing projects throughout the town.

[[Maxwell's equations]] for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/6.123329 |author=Nahin, P.J. |journal=Spectrum, IEEE |volume =29 |issue =3 |year=1992 |page=45 |title=Maxwell's grand unification}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the first one realised by [[Isaac Newton]].

With the publication of "[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]" in 1865, Maxwell demonstrated that [[electric force|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s travel through space as [[wave]]s moving at the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1045|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.&lt;ref name="ADTEF"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459–512 |year=1865 |bibcode=1865RSPT..155..459C |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728140123/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |archivedate=28 July 2011 }} (This article accompanied an 8 December 1864 presentation by Maxwell to the Royal Society.  His statement that "light and magnetism are affections of the same substance" is at page 499.)&lt;/ref&gt; The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of [[radio waves]].

Maxwell helped develop the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], a statistical means of describing aspects of the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. He is also known for presenting the first durable [[Color photography|colour photograph]] in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing the [[Structural rigidity|rigidity]] of rod-and-joint frameworks ([[truss]]es) like those in many bridges.

His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as [[Theory of relativity|special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th-century scientist having the greatest influence on 20th-century physics. His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8688302|title=James Clerk Maxwell : a biography|last=Tolstoy|first=Ivan|date=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1981|isbn=0226807851|location=Chicago|pages=2|oclc=8688302}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the millennium poll – a survey of the 100 most prominent physicists – Maxwell was voted the third greatest physicist of all time, behind only Newton and Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/541840.stm |work=BBC News |title=Einstein the greatest |publisher=BBC |date=29 November 1999 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111155707/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/541840.stm |archivedate=11 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the centenary of Maxwell's birthday, Einstein described Maxwell's work as the "most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxwellyear2006.org/html/press_coverage.html#Press5 |title=Brainy young James wasn't so daft after all |last1=McFall |first1=Patrick |date=23 April 2006 |work=The Sunday Post |publisher=maxwellyear2006.org |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620031659/http://www.maxwellyear2006.org/html/press_coverage.html |archivedate=20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Maxwell was young his family moved to [[Glenlair House]], which his parents had built on the {{convert|1500|acre|ha}} Middlebie estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=186–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; All indications suggest that Maxwell had maintained an unquenchable curiosity from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8688302|title=James Clerk Maxwell : a biography|last=Tolstoy|first=Ivan|date=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1981|isbn=0226807851|location=Chicago|pages=13|oclc=8688302}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of three, everything that moved, shone, or made a noise drew the question: "what's the go o' that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a passage added to a letter from his father to his sister-in-law Jane Cay in 1834, his mother described this innate sense of inquisitiveness:
{{Quote|He is a very happy man, and has improved much since the weather got moderate; he has great work with doors, locks, keys, etc., and "show me how it doos" is never out of his mouth. He also investigates the hidden course of streams and bell-wires, the way the water gets from the pond through the wall....&lt;ref name="Campbell_p 27"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Education, 1839–1847===
Recognising the potential of the young boy, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for James's early education, which in the [[Victorian times|Victorian era]] was largely the job of the woman of the house.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At eight he could recite long passages of [[John Milton|Milton]] and the whole of the [[Psalm 119|119th psalm]] (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of [[Religious text|scripture]] was already detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with [[abdominal cancer]] and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. His education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8688302|title=James Clerk Maxwell : a biography|last=Tolstoy|first=Ivan|date=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1981|isbn=0226807851|location=Chicago|pages=15-16|oclc=8688302}}&lt;/ref&gt; His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a 16 year old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man hired to instruct Maxwell, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The  tutor was dismissed in November 1841 and, after considerable thought, Maxwell was sent to the prestigious [[Edinburgh Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.&lt;ref name="mahon_p 12-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edinburgh Academy frontage.jpg|right|thumb|Edinburgh Academy, where Maxwell was schooled.]]

The 10 year old Maxwell, having been raised in isolation on his father's countryside estate, did not fit in well at school.&lt;ref name="mahon_p 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first year had been full, obliging him to join the second year with classmates a year his senior.&lt;ref name="mahon_p 10"/&gt; His mannerisms and [[Galloway]] accent struck the other boys as rustic. Having arrived on his first day of school wearing a pair of homemade shoes and a tunic, he earned the unkind nickname of "[[wikt:daft|Daftie]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never seemed to resent the epithet, bearing it without complaint for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social isolation at the Academy ended when he met [[Lewis Campbell (classicist)|Lewis Campbell]] and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]], two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life. They remained lifelong friends.&lt;ref name="oxford_506"/&gt;

Maxwell was fascinated by [[geometry]] at an early age, rediscovering the [[regular polyhedra]] before he received any formal instruction.&lt;ref name="mahon_p 12-14"/&gt; Despite winning the school's scripture biography prize in his second year, his academic work remained unnoticed&lt;ref name="mahon_p 12-14"/&gt; until, at the age of 13, he won the school's mathematical medal and first prize for both English and poetry.&lt;ref name="Campbell, p 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell's interests ranged far beyond the school syllabus and he did not pay particular attention to examination performance.&lt;ref name="Campbell, p 43"/&gt; He wrote his first [[scientific paper]] at the age of 14. In it he described a mechanical means of drawing [[Curve|mathematical curves]] with a piece of twine, and the properties of [[ellipse|ellipses]], [[Cartesian ovals]], and related curves with more than two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]]. His work "Oval Curves" was presented to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] by [[James David Forbes|James Forbes]], a professor of [[natural philosophy]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name="oxford_506"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;{{harvnb|Gardner|2007|pp=46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Maxwell was deemed too young to present the work himself.&lt;ref name="Mahon_2003_p_16"&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was not entirely original, since [[René Descartes]] had also examined the properties of such [[multifocal ellipse|multifocal ellipses]] in the 17th century, but he had simplified their construction.&lt;ref name="Mahon_2003_p_16"/&gt;

===University of Edinburgh, 1847–1850===
[[File:Edinburgh University 1827.jpg|left|thumb|Old College, University of Edinburgh]]

Maxwell left the Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began attending classes at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="Harman_p 662"&gt;{{harvnb|Harman|2004|p=662}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the opportunity to attend the [[University of Cambridge]], but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of the University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]], who lectured him on [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]], [[Philip Kelland]] on mathematics, and [[James David Forbes|James Forbes]] on [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name="oxford_506"/&gt; He did not find his classes at the University demanding,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the University and particularly when back home at Glenlair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, however his chief concerns regarded the properties of [[polarized light|polarised light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He constructed shaped blocks of [[gelatine]], subjected them to various [[stress (physics)|stresses]], and with a pair of [[Nicol prism|polarising prisms]] given to him by [[William Nicol (inventor)|William Nicol]], viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Timoshenko|1983|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this practice he discovered [[photoelasticity]], which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russo|1996|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 18, Maxwell contributed two papers for the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. One of these, "On the Equilibrium of Elastic Solids", laid the foundation for an important discovery later in his life, which was the temporary [[double refraction]] produced in [[viscosity|viscous]] liquids by [[shear stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Timoshenko|1983|pp=268–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other paper was "Rolling Curves" and, just as with the paper "Oval Curves" that he had written at the Edinburgh Academy, he was again considered too young to stand at the rostrum to present it himself. The paper was delivered to the Royal Society by his tutor Kelland instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Cambridge, 1850–1856===
[[File:YoungJamesClerkMaxwell.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A young Maxwell at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He is holding one of his [[colour wheel]]s.]]

In October 1850, already an accomplished mathematician, Maxwell left Scotland for the [[University of Cambridge]]. He initially attended [[Peterhouse College, Cambridge|Peterhouse]], however before the end of his first term transferred to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], where he believed it would be easier to obtain a [[fellow|fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Trinity he was elected to the elite secret society known as the [[Cambridge Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's intellectual understanding of his Christian faith and of science grew rapidly during his Cambridge years. He joined the "Apostles", an exclusive debating society of the intellectual elite, where through his essays he sought to work out this understanding.

{{quote|Now my great plan, which was conceived of old, ... is to let nothing be wilfully left unexamined. Nothing is to be holy ground consecrated to Stationary Faith, whether positive or negative. All fallow land is to be ploughed up and a regular system of rotation followed. ... Never hide anything, be it weed or no, nor seem to wish it hidden. ... Again I assert the Right of Trespass on any plot of Holy Ground which any man has set apart. ... Now I am convinced that no one but a Christian can actually purge his land of these holy spots. ... I do not say that no Christians have enclosed places of this sort. Many have a great deal, and every one has some. But there are extensive and important tracts in the territory of the Scoffer, the Pantheist, the Quietist, Formalist, Dogmatist, Sensualist, and the rest, which are openly and solemnly Tabooed. ..."

Christianity – that is, the religion of the Bible – is the only scheme or form of belief which disavows any possessions on such a tenure. Here alone all is free. You may fly to the ends of the world and find no God but the Author of Salvation. You may search the Scriptures and not find a text to stop you in your explorations. ...

The Old Testament and the Mosaic Law and Judaism are commonly supposed to be "Tabooed" by the orthodox. Sceptics pretend to have read them, and have found certain witty objections ... which too many of the orthodox unread admit, and shut up the subject as haunted. But a Candle is coming to drive out all Ghosts and Bugbears. Let us follow the light.&lt;ref name="MIT IAP Seminar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/maxwell |title=James Clerk Maxwell and the Christian Proposition |publisher=MIT IAP Seminar |accessdate=13 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025173206/http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/maxwell/ |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The extent to which Maxwell "ploughed up" his Christian beliefs and put them to the intellectual test, can be judged only incompletely from his writings. But there is plenty of evidence, especially from his undergraduate days, that he did deeply examine his faith. Certainly, his knowledge of the Bible was remarkable, so his confidence in the Scriptures was not based on ignorance.

In the summer of his third year, Maxwell spent some time at the [[Otley, Suffolk|Suffolk]] home of the [[Charles Benjamin Tayler|Rev C.B. Tayler]], the uncle of a classmate, G.W.H. Tayler. The love of God shown by the family impressed Maxwell, particularly after he was nursed back from ill health by the minister and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8_iS-4ec9wwC&amp;pg=PA170 169–170]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Cambridge, Maxwell writes to his recent host a chatty and affectionate letter including the following testimony,&lt;ref name="MIT IAP Seminar"/&gt;

{{quote|... I have the capacity of being more wicked than any example that man could set me, and ... if I escape, it is only by God's grace helping me to get rid of myself, partially in science, more completely in society, — but not perfectly except by committing myself to God ...}}

In November 1851, Maxwell studied under [[William Hopkins]], whose success in nurturing mathematical genius had earned him the nickname of "[[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|senior wrangler]]-maker".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warwick|2003|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Maxwell graduated from Trinity with a degree in mathematics. He scored second highest in the final examination, coming behind [[Edward Routh]] and earning himself the title of Second Wrangler. He was later declared equal with Routh in the more exacting ordeal of the [[Smith's Prize]] examination.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy_p 62"&gt;{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after earning his degree, Maxwell read his paper "On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending" to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harman|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the few purely mathematical papers he had written, demonstrating Maxwell's growing stature as a mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell decided to remain at Trinity after graduating and applied for a fellowship, which was a process that he could expect to take a couple of years.&lt;ref name="Mahon_p 47-48"&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyed by his success as a research student, he would be free, apart from some tutoring and examining duties, to pursue scientific interests at his own leisure.&lt;ref name="Mahon_p 47-48"/&gt;

The nature and perception of colour was one such interest which he had begun at the University of Edinburgh while he was a student of Forbes.&lt;ref name="Mahon_p 51"&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the coloured [[top|spinning tops]] invented by Forbes, Maxwell was able to demonstrate that white light would result from a mixture of red, green, and blue light.&lt;ref name="Mahon_p 51"/&gt; His paper "Experiments on Colour" laid out the principles of colour combination and was presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March 1855.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy_p 64-65"&gt;{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|pp=64–65. The full title of Maxwell's paper was "Experiments on colour, as perceived by the eye, with remarks on colour-blindness".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell was this time able to deliver it himself.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy_p 64-65"/&gt;

Maxwell was made a fellow of Trinity on 10 October 1855, sooner than was the norm,&lt;ref name="Tolstoy_p 64-65"/&gt; and was asked to prepare lectures on [[hydrostatics]] and [[optics]] and to set examination papers.&lt;ref name="Glazebrook_p 43-46"&gt;{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|pp=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following February he was urged by Forbes to apply for the newly vacant [[chair (academic)|Chair]] of Natural Philosophy at [[Marischal College]], [[Aberdeen]].&lt;ref name="Campbell p 126"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father assisted him in the task of preparing the necessary references, but died on 2 April at Glenlair before either knew the result of Maxwell's candidacy.&lt;ref name="Campbell p 126"/&gt; Maxwell accepted the professorship at Aberdeen, leaving Cambridge in November 1856.&lt;ref name="Glazebrook_p 43-46"/&gt;

===Marischal College, Aberdeen, 1856–1860===
[[File:Saturn HST 2004-03-22.jpg|thumb|left|Maxwell proved that the [[Rings of Saturn]] were made of numerous small particles.]]
The 25-year-old Maxwell was a good 15 years younger than any other professor at Marischal. He engaged himself with his new responsibilities as head of a department, devising the syllabus and preparing lectures.&lt;ref name="Mahon_p 69-71"&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; He committed himself to lecturing 15 hours a week, including a weekly ''[[pro bono]]'' lecture to the local working men's college.&lt;ref name="Mahon_p 69-71"/&gt; He lived in Aberdeen with his cousin [[William Dyce Cay]], a Scottish civil engineer, during the six months of the academic year and spent the summers at Glenlair, which he had inherited from his father.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt;

[[File:JamesClerkMaxwell-KatherineMaxwell-1869.jpg|thumb|upright|James and Katherine Maxwell, 1869]]
He focused his attention on a problem that had eluded scientists for 200 years: the nature of [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's rings]]. It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away or crashing into Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harman|1998|pp=48–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because [[St John's College, Cambridge]] had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 [[Adams Prize]].&lt;ref name="oxford_508"&gt;{{harvnb|Harman|2004|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell devoted two years to studying the problem, proving that a regular solid ring could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs. Since neither was observed, Maxwell concluded that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called "brick-bats", each independently orbiting Saturn.&lt;ref name="oxford_508"/&gt; Maxwell was awarded the £130 Adams Prize in 1859 for his essay "On the stability of the motion of Saturn's rings";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/onstabilityofmot00maxw |title=On the stability of the motion of Saturn's rings |accessdate=24 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616221114/https://archive.org/details/onstabilityofmot00maxw |archivedate=16 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was so detailed and convincing that when [[George Biddell Airy]] read it he commented "It is one of the most remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that I have ever seen."&lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt; It was considered the final word on the issue until direct observations by the ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' flybys of the 1980s confirmed Maxwell's prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/scientists/biographies/james-clerk-maxwell/index.html |title=James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) |publisher=National Library of Scotland |accessdate=27 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006063943/http://digital.nls.uk/scientists/biographies/james-clerk-maxwell/index.html |archivedate=6 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 Maxwell befriended the Reverend Daniel Dewar, who was then the Principal of Marischal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I20494&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged |title=Very Rev.

They were engaged in February 1858 and married in Aberdeen on 2 June 1858. On the marriage record, Maxwell is listed as Professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;James Clerk Maxwell and Katherine Mary Dewar marriage certificate, Family History Library film #280176, district 168/2 (Old Machar, Aberdeen), page 83, certificate No. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years Maxwell's senior, comparatively little is known of Katherine, although it is known that she helped in his lab and worked on experiments in [[viscosity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|2001|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's biographer and friend, Lewis Campbell, adopted an uncharacteristic reticence on the subject of Katherine, though describing their married life as "one of unexampled devotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|pp=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860 Marischal College merged with the neighbouring [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] to form the [[University of Aberdeen]]. There was no room for two professors of Natural Philosophy, so Maxwell, despite his scientific reputation, found himself laid off. He was unsuccessful in applying for Forbes's recently vacated chair at Edinburgh, the post instead going to [[Peter Tait (physicist)|Tait]]. Maxwell was granted the Chair of Natural Philosophy at [[King's College, London]], instead.&lt;ref name="Glazebrook_p 54"&gt;{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering from a near-fatal bout of [[smallpox]] in 1860, Maxwell moved to London with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===King's College, London, 1860–1865===

Maxwell's time at King's was probably the most productive of his career. He was awarded the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]] [[Rumford Medal]] in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy_p 103-104"&gt;{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the [[viscosity]] of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as [[dimensional analysis]]. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the [[Royal Institution]], where he came into regular contact with [[Michael Faraday]]. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40&amp;nbsp;years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of [[senility]]. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|pp=100–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Clerk Maxwell 16 Palace Gardens Terrace blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 16 Palace Gardens Terrace, Kensington, Maxwell's home, 1860–1865]]
This time is especially noteworthy for the advances Maxwell made in the fields of electricity and magnetism. He examined the nature of both electric and magnetic fields in his two-part paper "[[On physical lines of force]]", which was published in 1861. In it he provided a conceptual model for [[electromagnetic induction]], consisting of tiny spinning cells of [[magnetic flux]]. Two more parts were later added to and published in that same paper in early 1862. In the first additional part he discussed the nature of [[electrostatics]] and [[displacement current]]. In the second additional part, he dealt with the rotation of the plane of the [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation of light]] in a magnetic field, a phenomenon that had been discovered by Faraday and is now known as the [[Faraday effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 Maxwell resigned the chair at King's College, London, and returned to Glenlair with Katherine. In his paper 'On governors' (1868) he mathematically described the behaviour of governors, devices that control the speed of steam engines, thereby establishing the theoretical basis of control engineering &lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C. (1868),'On governors', from the proceedings of the Royal Society, No. 100&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Electromagnetism===

[[File:Postcard-from-Maxwell-to-Tait.jpg|thumb|left|A postcard from Maxwell to [[Peter Guthrie Tait|Peter Tait]]]]
Maxwell had studied and commented on electricity and magnetism as early as 1855 when his paper "On Faraday's lines of force" was read to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39568221/maxwell-on-faraday-s-lines-of-force |title=On Faraday's Lines of Force |last1=Maxwell |first1=James Clerk |year=1855 |work=Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |publisher=blazelabs.com |accessdate=27 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317170056/http://www.scribd.com/doc/39568221/maxwell-on-faraday-s-lines-of-force |archivedate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work and how electricity and magnetism are related. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of [[differential equation]]s with 20 equations in 20 variables. This work was later published as "[[On Physical Lines of Force]]" in March 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx |title=1861: James Clerk Maxwell's greatest year |date=18 April 2011 |publisher=King's College London |accessdate=28 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622095747/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx |archivedate=22 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1862, while lecturing at King's College, Maxwell calculated that the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic field is approximately that of the speed of light (see [[speed of light#electromagnetic constants]]). He considered this to be more than just a coincidence, commenting, "We can scarcely avoid the conclusion that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena."&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Maxwell.html |title=James Clerk Maxwell |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.

Working on the problem further, Maxwell showed that the [[Electromagnetic wave equation|equations]] predict the existence of waves of [[electromagnetic radiation|oscillating electric and magnetic fields]] that travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments; using the data available at the time, Maxwell obtained a velocity of {{convert|310740000|m/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen3410/ECEN3410-FirstClass.pdf |title=ECEN3410 Electromagnetic Waves |publisher=University of Colorado |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317170802/http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen3410/ECEN3410-FirstClass.pdf |archivedate=17 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1864 paper "[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]", Maxwell wrote, "The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism are affections of the same substance, and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to electromagnetic laws".&lt;ref name=ADTEF/&gt;

His famous twenty equations, in their modern form of four [[partial differential equation]]s, first appeared in fully developed form in his textbook ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/150books/2011/01/19/1873/ |title=Year 13 – 1873: A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism by James Clerk Maxwell |publisher=MIT Libraries |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707121529/http://libraries.mit.edu/150books/2011/01/19/1873/ |archivedate=7 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this work was done by Maxwell at Glenlair during the period between holding his London post and his taking up the Cavendish chair.&lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt; Maxwell expressed electromagnetism in the algebra of [[quaternions]] and made the electromagnetic potential the centrepiece of his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch4.htm |title=Extraordinary Physics |publisher=The Tom Bearden Website |accessdate=30 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304022724/http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch4.htm |archivedate=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 [[Oliver Heaviside]] replaced Maxwell's electromagnetic potential field by 'force fields' as the centrepiece of electromagnetic theory. Heaviside reduced the complexity of Maxwell's theory down to four [[differential equations]], known now collectively as Maxwell's Laws or [[Maxwell's equations]]. According to Heaviside, the electromagnetic potential field was arbitrary and needed to be "murdered".&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Hunt (1991) [[The Maxwellians]], [[Cornell University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of scalar and vector potentials is now standard in the solution of Maxwell's equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyges|1972|p=section 11.6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later there was a debate between Heaviside and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] about the relative merits of [[vector analysis]] and [[quaternions]]. The result was the realisation that there was no need for the greater physical insights provided by [[quaternions]] if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrett|Grimes|1995|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century [[mathematical physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6shu_hAiGkC&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=86 |title=Dot-Dash to Dot.Com: How Modern Telecommunications Evolved from the Telegraph to the Internet |isbn=9781441967602 |last=Wheen |first=Andrew |year=2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617122830/https://books.google.com/books?id=B6shu_hAiGkC&amp;pg=PA86 |archivedate=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell also introduced the concept of the ''electromagnetic field'' in comparison to force lines that Faraday described.&lt;ref name="tef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/Johnson/Chapters/Ch4_4.html |title=The Electromagnetic Field |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=30 June 2013 |author=Johnson, Kevin |date=May 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827131533/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/Johnson/Chapters/Ch4_4.html |archivedate=27 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By understanding the propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the propagation of light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the [[luminiferous aether]].&lt;ref name="tef"/&gt; Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Michelson |first1=Albert Abraham |last2=Morley |first2=Edward Williams |title=[[s:On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether|On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether]] |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=34 |year=1887 |pages=333–345 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-34.203.333 |issue=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute [[frame of reference]] in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired [[Albert Einstein]] to formulate the theory of [[special relativity]]; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary [[luminiferous aether]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Einstein_ether.html |title=Ether and the Theory of Relativity |last=Einstein |first=Albert |accessdate=19 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121211828/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Einstein_ether.html |archivedate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour vision===
[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|First durable colour photographic image, demonstrated by James Clerk Maxwell in an 1861 lecture]]

Along with most physicists of the time, Maxwell had a strong interest in psychology. Following in the steps of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], he was particularly interested in the study of [[colour vision]]. From 1855 to 1872, Maxwell published at intervals a series of investigations concerning the perception of colour, [[colour-blindness]], and colour theory, and was awarded the [[Rumford Medal]] for "On the Theory of Colour Vision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/Johnson/Chapters/Ch4_2.html |title=Colour Vision |publisher=University of St Andrews |author=Johnson, Kevin |date=May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044045/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/Johnson/Chapters/Ch4_2.html |archivedate=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] had demonstrated, using prisms, that white lights, such as [[sunlight]], are composed of a number of [[Spectral color|monochromatic components]] which could then be recombined into white light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton |first=Isaac |date=1704 |title=Opticks: or a treatise of the reflexions, refractions, inflexions and colours of light |url=https://archive.org/details/opticksortreatisnewt |location=London |publisher=Printed for Sam. Smith, and Benj. Walford, Printers to the Royal Society, at the Prince's Arms in St. Paul's Church-yard |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224071454/https://archive.org/details/opticksortreatisnewt |archivedate=24 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called ''[[Metamerism (color)|metameres]]''. [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young |first=Thomas |title=Bakerian Lecture:  Experiments and calculations relative to physical optics |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |year=1804 |volume=94 |pages=1–16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |bibcode=1804RSPT...94....1Y |doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427130034/https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=27 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Young–Helmholtz theory|trichromatic colour theory]]''. Maxwell used the recently developed [[Linear algebra]] to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |date=1857 |title=XVIII.—Experiments on Colour, as perceived by the Eye, with Remarks on Colour-Blindness |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8419209&amp;fileId=S0080456800032117 |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=275–298 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800032117 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222122002/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8419209&amp;fileId=S0080456800032117 |archivedate=22 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inventing colour matching experiments and [[Colourimetry]].

Maxwell was also interested in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in [[colour photography]]. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced with a set of three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through [[RGB color model|red, green and blue]] [[filter (optics)|filters]] and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maxwell |first1=James Clerk |year=1855 |title=Experiments on Colour, as Perceived by the Eye, with Remarks on Colour-Blindness |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=275–298 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800032117}} (This thought-experiment is described on pages 283–4. The short-wavelength filter is specified as "violet", but during the 19th century "violet" could be used to describe a deep violet-blue such as the colour of cobalt glass.)&lt;/ref&gt;

During an 1861 Royal Institution lecture on colour theory, Maxwell presented the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]], inventor of the [[single-lens reflex camera]], took the picture. He photographed a [[tartan]] ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's [[photographic plate]]s were  insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, the results of this pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue," it "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved."&lt;ref name="Tolstoy_p 103-104"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://notesonphotographs.org/index.php?title=Maxwell,_J._Clerk._%22On_the_Theory_of_Three_Primary_Colours.%22|author=Maxwell, J.

===Kinetic theory and thermodynamics===
{{main|Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution}}
[[File:Maxwell's demon.svg|thumb|right|[[Maxwell's demon]], a thought experiment where entropy decreases.]]
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell - Thermodynamic Maxwell surface - sketch 8 July 1875.jpg|thumb|Maxwell's sketch of the three-dimensional [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|thermodynamic surface later named after him]] (letter to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson]], 8 July 1875).]]
Maxwell also investigated the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases. Originating with [[Daniel Bernoulli]], this theory was advanced by the successive labours of [[John Herapath]], [[John James Waterston]], [[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]], and particularly [[Rudolf Clausius]], to such an extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/biographies/maxwell.cfm |title=Archives Biographies: James Clerk Maxwell |publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology |accessdate=1 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627090441/http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/biographies/maxwell.cfm |archivedate=27 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1859 and 1866, he developed the theory of the distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~alan/ECE6451/Lectures/StudentLectures/Hill_5p4_MaxwellBoltzmannDistribution.pdf |title=The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |last=Hill |first=Melanie |accessdate=28 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103232904/http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~alan/ECE6451/Lectures/StudentLectures/Hill_5p4_MaxwellBoltzmannDistribution.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWRkfjIFdOIC&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=51 |title=The Corresponding-States Principle and its Practice: Thermodynamic, Transport and Surface Properties of Fluids |isbn=9780080459042 |author1=Xiang |first1=Hong Wei |year=2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512213205/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWRkfjIFdOIC&amp;pg=PA51 |archivedate=12 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula, called the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on [[thermodynamics]] led him to devise the [[thought experiment]] that came to be known as [[Maxwell's demon]], where the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya|title=Demonic device converts information to energy|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101114/full/news.2010.606.html|work=Nature News|date=14 November 2010|language=en|doi=10.1038/news.2010.606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 he established [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's thermodynamic relations]], which are statements of equality among the second derivatives of the [[thermodynamic potentials]] with respect to different thermodynamic variables. In 1874, he constructed a [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|plaster thermodynamic visualisation]] as a way of exploring phase transitions, based on the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]'s graphical [[thermodynamics]] papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=West, Thomas G. |title=James Clerk Maxwell, Working in Wet Clay |url=http://www.siggraph.org/publications/newsletter/v33n1/columns/west.html |journal=SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Newsletter |volume=33 |issue=1 |date=February 1999 |pages=15–17 |doi=10.1145/563666.563671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC |page=118 |title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking |isbn=9780195173246 |last=Cropper |first=William H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203175602/https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC |archivedate=3 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control theory===
{{main|Control theory}}
Maxwell published a paper "On governors" in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society'', vol. 16 (1867–1868).&lt;ref name="Maxwell1867"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maxwell, James Clerk |year=1868 |title=On Governors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=16 |pages=270–283 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055 |jstor=112510}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper is considered a central paper of the early days of [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Otto | author-link= Otto Mayr |title=Maxwell and the Origins of Cybernetics |journal=Isis |volume=62 |issue=4 |year=1971 |pages=424–444 |doi=10.1086/350788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here "governors" refers to the [[governor (device)|governor]] or the [[centrifugal governor]] used to regulate [[steam engine]]s.

The '''Neelum–Jhelum Hydropower Plant''' is part of a [[run-of-the-river]] [[hydroelectric]] power scheme in Pakistan, designed to divert water from the [[Neelum River]] to a power station on the [[Jhelum River]]. The power station is located in (Independent)Azad Kashmir, {{Convert|42|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Muzaffarabad]], and has an installed capacity of 969 MW. Construction on the project began in 2008 after a Chinese consortium was awarded the construction contract in July 2007. After delay of many years, the first generator was commissioned in April 2018 and the entire project is completed in August 2018 when the fourth and last unit was synchronized with the national grid on 13 August and attained its maximum generation capacity of 969 MW on August 14, 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1780780/2-neelum-jhelum-project-attains-full-generation-capacity-969mw/|title=Neelum-Jhelum project attains full generation capacity of 969MW|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will generate 5,150 gigawatt per year at the levelised tariff of Rs 13.50 per unit for 30 years.

==Background==
After being approved in 1989, the design was improved, increasing the tunnel length and generation capacity. The project was intended to begin in 2002 and be completed in 2008 but this time-frame experienced significant delays due to problems meeting rising costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project|url=http://waterinfo.net.pk/cms/pdf/njhp.pdf|publisher=Water Info|accessdate=19 December 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] which devastated the region required a redesign of the project to conform to more stringent seismic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project delayed for 7–8 months|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/74677-neelum-jhelum-hydropower-project-delayed-for-7-8-months|accessdate=13 March 2016|agency=The News (Pakistan)|date=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2007, the Chinese consortium CGGC-CMEC ([[Gezhouba Group]] and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation) were offered a contract to construct the dam and power station. Terms were settled by the end of the year and in January 2008, the letter of commencement was issued. On 8 February, Pakistan's President [[Pervez Musharraf]] announced that the project would begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commencement of Neelam- Jhelum Hydroelectric Project|url=http://www.gzbgj.com/english/article.asp?id=836|publisher=China Gezhouba Group Corporation|accessdate=19 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526093749/http://www.gzbgj.com/english/article.asp?id=836|archivedate=26 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, the diversion tunnel required to reroute the Neelum River around the dam site was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jhelum Hydropower Project Dam Diversion Tunnel completed|url=http://www.officialnews.pk/government-institutions/10440|publisher=OfficialNews.pk|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=11 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426062243/http://www.officialnews.pk/government-institutions/10440|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 November, Pakistan's Prime Minister [[Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani]] publicly stated his concern for the project's delay. At its appraisal in 1989, it was to cost $167 million USD (2011) and after another redesign in 2005, that cost rose to $935 million USD (2011). Currently costs have risen to $2.89 billion USD (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PM displeased with delay in Neelum-Jhelum project|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=10021&amp;Cat=13|publisher=International News|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is being constructed under the supervision of the [[Water and Power Development Authority]] (WAPDA) and funding is being achieved through the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company, taxes, bond offerings, Middle Eastern and Chinese banks. WAPDA has successfully secured loans from a consortium of Chinese banks and from Middle East. [[Tunnel-boring machine]]s (TBM) were brought to help speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels. They became operational in February 2013.&lt;ref name=WAPDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Nhelum Jhelum Hydropower Project|url=http://www.wapda.gov.pk/vision2025/htmls_vision2025/njhp.html|publisher=Water and Power Development Authority|accessdate=19 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229234527/http://wapda.gov.pk/vision2025/htmls_vision2025/njhp.html|archivedate=29 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was 66 percent complete as of August 2013 while at the same time the diversion tunnel was 75 percent complete. US$475 million in funding was still not secured by the Economic Affairs Division at that time.&lt;ref name=finance&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kiani|first1=Khaleeq|title=Neelum-Jhelum project facing financial problems|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1129742|publisher=Dawn|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2014 Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] visited the construction site and expressed the hope that at least one generator would be operational by mid-2015. On 24 December 2014 a wall near the diversion tunnel's intake collapsed, killing four workers including a Chinese engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese engineer among four killed in Neelum-Jhelum dam accident|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1152914/chinese-engineer-among-four-killed-in-neelum-jhelum-dam-accident|publisher=Dawn|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 05, 2016, the project  entered into terminal phase with 100 percent perfect design while achieving 85.5 percent progress and is heading towards completion despite all delays in release of funds, weather conditions, non-availability of power during early stage of construction and delays in land acquisition. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/162544-Neelum-Jhelum-project-enters-terminal-phase-CEO&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Mar 2017 it was reported that the cost of the dam had escalated to PKR 500 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/03/09/cost-of-969mw-neelum-jhelum-hydropower-project-increased-to-rs-500bln/&lt;/ref&gt; thus the cost of electricity from Neelum Jhelum will be Pakistani Rupees 20 per unit. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/166564-Neelum-Jhelum-projects-electricity-to-cost-Rs20-per-unit&lt;/ref&gt;

All the civil work including tunnel boring, installation of generators and turbines was completed and water filling of the dam began on October 17, 2017 to put it on the test. &lt;ref&gt;https://tribune.com.pk/story/1534015/water-filling-begins-neelum-jhelum-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, residents of Muzaffarabad expressed serious concerns that the commissioning of Neelum Jhelum project will drastically reduce the flow of Neelum river thru Muzaffarabad town.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/1367049&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Jan 2018 it was reported that the retaining wall of the rock filled dam has got shifted by 18mm from its original position in Nov 2017 when the dam was loaded to design height of 1017 meter. The electricity generation from the dam may be delayed to June-July 2018. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/275086-will-neelum-jhelum-project-get-operational-by-march-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March 2018 it was reported that the filling of water in the head race tunnel has started and the first unit will start electricity generation by end-March, followed by the second, third and fourth units at one month intervals respectively &lt;ref&gt;https://tribune.com.pk/story/1648558/2-hydel-power-neelum-jhelum-set-start-electricity-generation/&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018 the first unit of 242.25 MW was commissioned at a levelised tariff of Rs 13.50 per unit.  

The strategically crucial Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project achieved a historic landmark, as the project attained its maximum generation capacity of 969 megawatts (MW) on 14 August 2018. All units of the project are generating power to their maximum capacity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2007, India began construction on a run-of-the-river power station on the Kishanganga (Neelum) River upstream of the  Neelum–Jhelum Dam. The [[Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant]] operates in a similar sense as the  Neelum–Jhelum, using a dam to divert the Kishanganga (Neelum) River to a power station before it is discharged into [[Wular Lake]] which is fed by the Jhelum River. The Kishanganga Project will divert a portion of the Neelum River from Pakistan which will reduce power generation at the Neelum–Jhelum Hydropower Plant. India states the project will divert 10 percent of the river's flow while other estimates stand as high as 33 percent. Nevertheless, water flow below the  Neelum–Jhelum Dam, in Pakistan's Neelum Valley, is expected to be minimal as both projects are diverting water to the Jhelum River. This has the potential to have adverse impacts in the Neelum Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neelum-Jhelum project contract awarding: delay led India to begin Kishanganga hydel works|url=http://finance.kalpoint.com/highlights/business-news/neelum-jhelum-project-contract-awarding-delay-led-india-to-begin-kishanganga-hydel-works.html|publisher=FOREX.pk|accessdate=19 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711150419/http://finance.kalpoint.com/highlights/business-news/neelum-jhelum-project-contract-awarding-delay-led-india-to-begin-kishanganga-hydel-works.html|archivedate=11 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Pakistan appealed to the Hague's [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (CoA), complaining that the Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant violates the [[Indus River Treaty]] by increasing the catchment of the Jhelum River and depriving Pakistan of its water rights. In June 2011, the CoA visited both the Kishanganga and Neelum–Jhelum Projects. In August 2011, they ordered India to submit more technical data on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kishanganga issue: Pakistan offers no comments to CoA|url=http://www.brecorder.com/fuel-a-energy/single/630/193/1246448/|publisher=Business Recorded|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; India had previously reduced the height of the dam from {{Convert|98|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|37|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q.2506 Lowering of height of kishanganga dam|url=http://trade.nic.in/mystart.php?id=220118165|publisher=Indian Ministry of External Affairs|accessdate=20 December 2011|date=25 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426062419/http://trade.nic.in/mystart.php?id=220118165|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their application was first rejected, the court asked India late September to stop constructing any permanent works that would inhibit restoration of the river. While India could not construct the dam, they continued work on the tunnel and power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hague Court asks India to stop Kishanganga project|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=9086&amp;Cat=13|publisher=The International News|accessdate=20 December 2011|date=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013 the Hague ruled that India could divert a minimum of water for the Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India can divert only minimum water from Kishanganga: tribunal|url=http://dawn.com/2013/02/19/india-can-divert-only-minimum-water-from-kishanganga-tribunal/|publisher=Dawn|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and operation==
The Neelum–Jhelum Dam will be a {{Convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{Convert|125|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long [[gravity dam]]. It will withhold a [[pondage]] (reservoir) with a  {{Convert|8000000|m3|acre feet|0|abbr=on}} capacity of which  {{Convert|2800000|m3|acre feet|0|abbr=on}} is peak storage. The dam diverts up to {{Convert|280|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}} of the Neelum southeast into a {{Convert|28.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long head-race tunnel, the first {{Convert|15.1|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the head-race is two tunnels which later meet into one. The tunnel passes {{Convert|380|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below the Jhelum River and through its bend. At the terminus of the tunnel, the water reaches the [[surge chamber]] which contains a {{Convert|341|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall surge shaft (to prevent [[water hammer]]) and a {{Convert|820|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long surge tunnel. From the surge chamber, the water is split into four different [[penstock]]s which feed each of the four 242 MW [[Francis turbine]]-generators in the [[underground power house]]. After being used to generate electricity, the water is discharged southeast back into the Jhelum River at {{Coord|34|10|29|N|73|29|34|E|name=Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant Discharge}} through a {{Convert|3.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long tail-race tunnel. The drop in elevation between the dam and power station afford an average [[hydraulic head]] of  {{Convert|420|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=WAPDA/&gt;

==Corruption allegations==
It is alleged that the procurement of TBM machines resulted in $74 million in kickbacks, according to Transparency International Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://nation.com.pk/national/03-Jan-2013/nab-pm-secretariat-reluctant-to-take-action&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rolls of finished newsprint at Macmillan-Bloedel Ltd in the Fraser River Valley, British Columbia, Canada.JPG|thumb|Rolls of newsprint.]]
'''Newsprint''' is a low-cost [[Preservation (library and archival science)|non-archival]] [[paper]] consisting mainly of wood pulp and most commonly used to print [[newspaper]]s and other publications and advertising material. Invented in 1844 by [[Charles Fenerty]] of [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, it usually has an [[off white]] cast and distinctive feel. It is designed for use in [[printing press]]es that employ a long web of paper ([[Offset printing|web offset]], [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]] and [[Flexography|flexographic]]) rather than individual sheets of paper.

Newsprint is favored by publishers and printers as it is relatively low cost (compared with paper grades used for glossy [[magazine]]s and sales [[brochure]]s), strong (to run through modern high-speed web printing presses) and can accept [[Color printing|four-color printing]] at qualities that meet the needs of typical newspapers.

==Invention==
Charles Fenerty began experimenting with [[wood pulp]] around 1838, making his discovery in 1844. On October 26, 1844, Fenerty took a sample of his paper to Halifax's top [[newspaper]], the [[Acadian Recorder]], where he had written a letter on his newly invented paper saying:
{{cquote|Messrs. English &amp; Blackadar,

Enclosed is a small piece of PAPER, the result of an experiment I have made, in order to ascertain if that useful article might not be manufactured from WOOD. The result has proved that opinion
to be correct, for- by the sample which I have sent you, Gentlemen- you will perceive the feasibility of it. The enclosed, which is as firm in its texture as white, and to all appearance as durable as the common wrapping paper made from hemp, cotton, or the ordinary materials of manufacture is ACTUALLY COMPOSED OF SPRUCE WOOD, reduced to a pulp, and subjected to the same treatment as paper is in course of being made, only with this exception, VIZ: my insufficient means of giving it the required pressure. I entertain an opinion that our common forest trees, either hard or soft wood, but more especially the fir, spruce, or poplar, on account of the fibrous quality of their wood, might easily be reduced by a chafing machine, and manufactured into paper of
the finest kind. This opinion, Sirs, I think the experiment will justify, and leaving it to be prosecuted further by the scientific, or the curious.

I remain, Gentlemen, your obdt. servant,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHARLES FENERTY.

''The Acadian Recorder''&lt;br /&gt;
Halifax, N.S.&lt;br /&gt;
Saturday, October 26, 1844}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesfenerty.ca/book.html Burger, Peter]. ''Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention''. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}} pp.32 (The biography has a photo of the original letter.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The web of paper is placed on the printer, in the form of a roll of paper, from a [[paper mill]] (surplus newsprint can also be cut into individual sheets by a processor for use in a variety of other applications such as wrapping or commercial printing). World demand of newsprint in 2006 totaled about 37.2 million metric tonnes, according to the Montreal-based Pulp &amp; Paper Products Council (PPPC). This was about 1.6% less than in 2000. Between 2000 and 2006, the biggest changes were in [[Asia]]—which saw newsprint demand grow by about 20%—and [[North America]], where demand fell by about 25%. Demand in [[People's Republic of China|China]] virtually doubled during the period, to about 3.2 million metric tonnes.

About 35% of global newsprint usage in 2006 was in Asia, with approximately 26% being in North America and about 25% in [[Europe|Western Europe]]. [[Latin America]] and [[Europe|Eastern Europe]] each represented about 5% of world demand in 2006, according to PPPC, with smaller shares going to [[Oceania]] and [[Africa]].

Among the biggest factors depressing demand for newsprint in North America have been the decline in newspaper readership among many sectors of the population—particularly young adults—along with increasing competition for advertising business from the [[Internet]] and other media. According to the [[Newspaper Association of America]], a United States newspaper trade group, average U.S. daily circulation in 2006 on a typical weekday was 52.3 million (53.2 million on Sundays), compared with 62.5 million in 1986 (58.9 million on Sundays) and 57.0 million in 1996 (60.8 million on Sundays). According to NAA, daily ad revenues (not adjusted for inflation) reached their all-time peak in 2000, and by 2007 had fallen by 13%. Newsprint demand has also been affected by attempts on the part of newspaper publishers to reduce marginal printing costs through various conservation measures intended to cut newsprint usage.

While demand has been trending down in North America in recent years, the rapid economic expansion of such Asian countries as China and India greatly benefited the print newspaper, and thus their newsprint suppliers. According to the World Association of Newspapers, in 2007 Asia was the home to 74 of the world’s 100 highest-circulation dailies. With millions of Chinese and Indians entering the ranks of those with disposable income, newspapers have gained readers along with other news media.

Newsprint is used worldwide in the printing of newspapers, flyers, and other printed material intended for mass distribution. In the U.S., about 80% of all newsprint that is consumed is purchased by daily newspaper publishers, according to PPPC. Dailies use a large majority of total demand in most other regions as well.

Typically in North America, newsprint is purchased by a daily newspaper publisher and is shipped from the mill to the publisher's pressroom or pressrooms, where it is used to print the main body of the newspaper (called the run-of-press, or ROP, sections). The daily newspaper publisher may also be hired by outside companies such as advertisers or publishers of weekly newspapers or other daily newspapers to produce printed products for those companies using its presses. In such cases the press owner might also purchase newsprint from the mill for such contract printing jobs.

For the roughly 20% of demand which is not purchased by a daily newspaper, common end uses include the printing of weekly newspapers, advertising flyers and other printed products, generally by a commercial printer, a company whose business consists largely of printing products for other companies using its presses. In such a case, the newsprint may be purchased by the printer on behalf of an advertiser or a weekly newspaper publisher, or it may be purchased by the client and then ordered to be shipped to the printer's location.

===Economic issues===
The biggest inputs to the newsprint manufacturing process are energy, fiber, and labor. Mill operating margins have been significantly affected in the 2006–2008 time-frame by rising energy costs. Many mills' fiber costs have also been affected during the U.S. housing market slowdown of 2007–8 by the shutdown of many sawmills, particularly in Canada, since the virgin fiber used by mills generally comes from nearby sawmills in the form of wood chips produced as a residual product of the saw milling process.

===Distribution===
Another consideration in the newsprint business is delivery, which is affected by energy cost trends. Newsprint around the world may be delivered by rail or truck; or by barge, container or break-bulk shipment if a water delivery is appropriate. (Aside from delivery cost, another consideration in selecting freight mode may be the potential for avoiding damage to the product.) All things being equal, for domestic shipments in areas like North America or Europe where modern road and rail networks are readily available, trucks can be more economical than rail for short-haul deliveries (a day or less from the mill), while rail may be more economical for longer shipments. The cost-competitiveness of each freight mode for a specific mill’s business may depend on local infrastructure issues, as well as the degree of truck-vs-freight competition in the mill's region. The appropriate freight mode for delivery from a mill to a specific pressroom can also depend on the press room ability to accept enough trucks or rail cars.

===Web (width) downsizing===
A newspaper roll's width is called its web width and is defined by how many front pages it can print. A full roll prints four front pages with four back pages behind it (two front and back on each of the two sections). Modern printing facilities most efficiently print newspapers in multiples of eight pages on a full newsprint roll in two sections of four pages each. The two sections are then cut in half.

Faced with dwindling revenue from competition with broadcast, cable,  and internet outlets, U.S. newspapers in the 21st century—particularly [[broadsheet]]s—have begun to reduce the width of their newsprint rolls, and hence of the newspapers, to a standard size across the business.

The longtime standard 54-inch web (13½ inch front page) (metric: 137.16&amp;nbsp;cm web, 34.29&amp;nbsp;cm front page) has given way to smaller newspaper sizes. New broadsheet standards in the U.S. are 44, 46, and 48-inch webs (11, 11.5, and 12&amp;nbsp;inch newspaper page widths, respectively) (metric: 111.76&amp;nbsp;cm, 116.84&amp;nbsp;cm, 121.92&amp;nbsp;cm, page widths: 27.94&amp;nbsp;cm, 29.21&amp;nbsp;cm, 30.48&amp;nbsp;cm respectively). Newspapers such as ''[[USA Today]]'' have already converted to new, narrower web width standards, which are also easier for readers to handle, especially commuters. Interest in the reduced standard increased when ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' abandoned its iconic 60-inch web (15&amp;nbsp;inch page) format (metric: 152.4&amp;nbsp;cm, 38.1&amp;nbsp;cm page) in favor of the new 48-inch newspaper industry standard starting on January 2, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katharine Q. |last=Seelye |title=In Tough Times, a Redesigned Journal |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/04/business/media/04journal.html |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' has followed suit, abandoning its 54-inch web (13½ inch page) on August 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=The New York Times Plans to Consolidate New York Print Run at Newest Facility in College Point, Queens and Sublease Older Edison, New Jersey, Printing Plant in Early 2008 |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=105317&amp;p=irol-pressArticle&amp;ID=883079 |date=2006-07-18 |accessdate=2013-03-20 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' moved from a 50-inch web to a 46-inch web, producing an 11½ inch page width (metric: was 127&amp;nbsp;cm, became 116.84&amp;nbsp;cm, page 29.21&amp;nbsp;cm).

Newspapers in many other parts of the world, including ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1560525,00.html |title=New-look Guardian launches on September 12 |work=MediaGuardian |date=1 September 2005 |last1=Cozens |first1=Claire |location=London |publisher=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], are also downsizing their broadsheets.

==Manufacturing==
{{Main|Wood pulp|Paper machine}}
Newsprint is generally made by a mechanical milling process, without the chemical processes that are often used to remove [[lignin]] from the pulp. The lignin causes the paper to become brittle and yellow when exposed to air or sunlight. Traditionally, newsprint was made from fibers extracted from various softwood species of trees (most commonly, [[spruce]], [[fir]], [[balsam fir]] or [[pine]]). However, an increasing percentage of the world's newsprint is made with [[deinked pulp|recycled fibers]].

==Sustainability==
{{Main|Paper recycling|Recycling}}

There are upper limits on the percentage of the world's newsprint that can be manufactured from recycled fiber. For instance, some of the fiber that enters a recycled pulp mill is lost in pulping, due to inefficiencies inherent in the process. According to the web site of the U.K. chapter of Friends of the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/paper_recycling.html Friends of the Earth]&lt;/ref&gt; wood fiber can normally only be recycled up to five times due to damage to the fiber. Thus, unless the quantity of newsprint used each year worldwide declines in line with the lost fiber, a certain amount of new (virgin) fiber is required each year globally, even though individual newsprint mills may use 100% recycled fiber.

'''Nylon''' is a generic designation for a family of [[synthetic polymer]]s, based on [[aliphatic]] or [[Aromaticity|semi-aromatic]] [[polyamide]]s. 
Nylon is a [[thermoplastic]] silky material&lt;ref name="Vogler"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Wettstreit um die Polyamidfasern|journal=Chemie in unserer Zeit|volume=47|pages=62–63|doi=10.1002/ciuz.201390006|last1=Vogler|first1=H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nylon was the first commercially successful synthetic thermoplastic polymer.&lt;ref name="PlasticsCHF"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/science-of-plastics|title=Science of Plastics|website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DuPont]] began its research project in 1930.
The first example of nylon ([[Nylon 66|nylon 6,6]]) was produced using [[diamine]]s on February 28, 1935, by [[Wallace Hume Carothers]] at DuPont's research facility at the [[DuPont Experimental Station]].&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Chemical Society National Historic Chemical Landmarks|title=Foundations of Polymer Science: Wallace Hume Carothers and the Development of Nylon|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/carotherspolymers.html|website=ACS Chemistry for Life|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carothers&gt;{{cite web|title=Wallace Hume Carothers|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/wallace-hume-carothers|website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to Carothers' work, [[Paul Schlack]] at [[IG Farben]] developed [[nylon 6|nylon&amp;nbsp;6]], a different molecule based on [[caprolactam]], on January 29, 1938.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McIntyre|first1=J.

Nylon is made of [[polymer|repeating units]] linked by amide links&lt;ref name="Chemguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/amides/polyamides.html|title=Polyamides|website=Chemguide|last1=Clark|first1=Jim|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[peptide bond]]s in [[protein]]s.
Commercially, nylon polymer is made by reacting monomers which are either [[lactam]]s, acid/amines or stoichiometric mixtures of [[diamine]]s (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[diacid]]s  (-COOH). Mixtures of these can be polymerized together to make copolymers. Nylon polymers can be mixed with a wide variety of additives to achieve many different property variations.
Nylon polymers have found significant commercial applications in [[fabric]] and fibers (apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), in shapes (molded parts for cars, electrical equipment, etc.), and in films (mostly for food packaging).&lt;ref name="BPF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nylons (Polyamide)|url=http://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/polymers/polyamides.aspx|website=British Plastics Federation|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Wallace Carothers, in the lab.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Wallace Carothers]]]]

=== DuPont and the invention of Nylon ===
[[DuPont]], founded by [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], first produced gunpowder and later cellulose-based paints. Following [[World War I|WWI]], DuPont produced synthetic [[ammonia]] and other chemicals. DuPont began experimenting with the development of cellulose based fibres, eventually producing the synthetic fibre [[rayon]]. DuPont's experience with rayon was an important precursor to its development and marketing of nylon.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ndiaye|first1=Pap A.|last2=Forster|first2=Elborg|title=Nylon and bombs : DuPont and the march of modern America|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801884443|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHH3iE2LPCoC&amp;pg=PA236#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8,64,236}}

DuPont's invention of nylon spanned a nine-year period, ranging from the start of the project in 1930 to its exhibition at the [[World's fair|World Fair]] in New York in 1939.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt; The project grew from a new structure at DuPont, suggested by [[Charles Stine]] in 1927, in which the chemical department would be composed of several small research teams that would focus on “pioneering research” in chemistry and would “lead to practical applications”.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|92}} Harvard instructor [[Wallace Carothers|Wallace Hume Carothers]] was hired to direct the polymer research group. Initially he was allowed to focus on pure research, building on and testing the theories of German chemist [[Hermann Staudinger]].&lt;ref name="Kativa"/&gt; He was very successful as research he undertook greatly improved the knowledge of polymers and contributed to science.&lt;ref name="Meikle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meikle|first1=Jeffrey L.|title=American plastic : A cultural history|date=1995|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=0813522358|edition=1. ppb. print|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_1ePU4GEGAC&amp;pg=PA1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1930, Carothers and his team had already synthesized two new polymers. One was [[neoprene]], a synthetic rubber greatly used during the war. The other was a white elastic but strong paste that would later become nylon. After these discoveries Carother’s team was made to shift its research from a more pure research approach investigating general polymerization to a more practically-focused goal of finding “one chemical combination that would lend itself to industrial applications”.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|94}}

It wasn’t until the beginning of 1935 that a polymer called "polymer 6-6" was finally produced. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced by Wallace Carothers on February 28, 1935, at DuPont's research facility at the [[DuPont Experimental Station]].&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; It had all the desired properties of elasticity and strength.
However, it also required a complex manufacturing process that would become the basis of industrial production in the future. DuPont obtained a patent for the polymer in September 1938,&lt;ref name="US 2130523"/&gt; and quickly achieved a monopoly of the fibre.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;

The production of nylon required interdepartmental collaboration between three departments at DuPont: the Department of Chemical Research, the Ammonia Department, and the Department of Rayon. Some of the key ingredients of nylon had to be produced using [[high pressure chemistry]], the main area of expertise of the Ammonia Department. Nylon was considered a “godsend to the Ammonia Department”,&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt; which had been in financial difficulties. The reactants of nylon soon constituted half of the Ammonia department’s sales and helped them come out of the period of the [[Great Depression]] by creating jobs and revenue at DuPont.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;

DuPont's nylon project demonstrated the importance of [[chemical engineering]] in industry, helped create jobs, and furthered the advancement of chemical engineering techniques.  In fact, it developed a chemical plant that provided 1800 jobs and used the latest technologies of the time, which are still used as a model for chemical plants today.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt; “The success of the nylon project thus had to do with its ability to achieve the rapid mobilization of a large number of DuPont’s chemists and engineers”.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|100–101}}  The first nylon plant was located at Seaford, Delaware, beginning commercial production on December 15, 1939.  On October 26, 1995, the Seaford plant was designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmark]] by the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref name="Landmark"&gt;{{cite web|title=A NATIONAL HISTORIC CHEMICAL LANDMARK THE FIRST NYLON PLANT|url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/carotherspolymers/first-nylon-plant-historical-resource.pdf|website=AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of the name ===
DuPont went through an extensive process to generate names for its new product.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;{{rp|138–139}} 
In 1940, John W. Eckelberry of DuPont stated that the letters "nyl" were arbitrary and the "on" was copied from the suffixes of other fibers such as [[cotton]] and Rayon. A later publication by DuPont (''Context'', vol.&amp;nbsp;7, no.&amp;nbsp;2, 1978) explained that the name was originally intended to be "No-Run" ("run" meaning "unravel"), but was modified to avoid making such an unjustified claim. Since the products were not really run-proof, the vowels were swapped to produce "nuron", which was changed to "nilon" "to make it sound less like a nerve tonic". For clarity in pronunciation, the "i" was changed to "y."&lt;ref name=Wolfe2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Algeo|first=John|authorlink=John Algeo|title=The Origins and Development of the English Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znFmBZ2D8rEC&amp;pg=PA224|volume=6|year=2009|publisher=Cengage|isbn=9781428231450|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early marketing strategies ===
An important part of nylon’s popularity stems from DuPont’s marketing strategy. The fibre was promoted to increase demand before the product was available to the general market.  Nylon’s commercial announcement occurred on October 27, 1938, at the final session of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]''{{'}}s yearly "Forum on Current Problems", on the site of the approaching New York City world's fair.&lt;ref name="Kativa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kativa|first1=Hillary|title=Synthetic Threads|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=16–21|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/synthetic-threads|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;{{rp|141}} The “first man-made organic textile fiber” which was derived from “coal, water and air” and promised to be “as strong as steel, as fine as the spider’s web”  was received enthusiastically by the audience, many of them middle-class women, and made the headlines of most newspapers.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;{{rp|141}} Nylon was introduced as part of "The world of tomorrow" at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]&lt;ref name="Blakinger"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blakinger|first1=Keri |title=A look back at some of the coolest attractions at the 1939 World’s Fair|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/back-attractions-1939-world-fair-article-1.2619155|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=New York Daily News|date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured at DuPont's "Wonder World of Chemistry" at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco in 1939.&lt;ref name="Kativa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sundberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sundberg|first1=Richard J.|title=The Chemical Century: Molecular Manipulation and Its Impact on the 20th Century|date=2017|publisher=Apple Academic Press, Incorporated|isbn=9781771883665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9eRDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual nylon stockings were not shipped to selected stores in the national market until May 15, 1940. However, a limited number were released for sale in Delaware before that.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;{{rp|145–146}} The first public sale of nylon stockings occurred on October 24, 1939, in Wilmington, Delaware. 4,000 pairs of stockings were available, all of which were sold within three hours.&lt;ref name="Kativa"/&gt;

Another added bonus to the campaign was that it meant reducing silk imports from Japan, an argument that won over many wary customers. Nylon was even mentioned by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]’s cabinet, which addressed its “vast and interesting economic possibilities” five days after the material was formally announced.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;

However, the early excitement over nylon also caused problems.  It fueled unreasonable expectations that nylon would be better than silk, a miracle fabric as strong as steel that would last forever and never run.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;{{rp|145–147}}&lt;ref name="Wolfe2008"/&gt; Realizing the danger of claims such as “New Hosiery Held Strong as Steel” and “No More Runs”, Du Pont scaled back the terms of the original announcement, especially those stating that nylon would possess the strength of steel.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;

Also, DuPont executives marketing nylon as a revolutionary man-made material did not at first realize that some consumers experienced a sense of unease and distrust, even fear, towards synthetic fabrics.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;{{rp|126–128}}
A particularly damaging news story, drawing on DuPont's 1938 patent for the new polymer, suggested that one method of producing nylon might be to use [[cadaverine]] (pentamethylenediamine),&lt;ref&gt;Actually the most common nylon polymers are made from hexamethylenediamine, with one more CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group than cadaverine.&lt;/ref&gt; a chemical extracted from corpses.  Although scientists asserted that cadaverine was also extracted by heating coal, the public often refused to listen. A woman confronted one of the lead scientists at DuPont and refused to accept that the rumour was not true.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;{{rp|146–147}}

DuPont changed its campaign strategy, emphasizing that nylon was made from “coal, air and water”, and started focusing on the personal and aesthetic aspects of nylon, rather than its intrinsic qualities.&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt;{{rp|146–147}} Nylon was thus domesticated,&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|151–152}} and attention shifted to the material and consumer aspect of the fiber with slogans like “If it’s nylon, it’s prettier, and oh! How fast it dries!”.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

After nylon’s nationwide release in 1940, production was increased. 1300 tons of the fabric were produced during 1940.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|100}}  During their first year on the market, 64 million pairs of nylon stockings were sold.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|101}}

While nylon was marketed as the durable and indestructible material of the people, it was sold at almost twice the price of [[silk]] stockings ($4.27 per pound of nylon versus $2.79 per pound of silk).&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|101}} Sales of nylon stockings were strong in part due to changes in women’s fashion. As Lauren Olds explains: “by 1939 [hemlines] had inched back up to the knee, closing the decade just as it started off”. The shorter skirts were accompanied by a demand for stockings that offered fuller coverage without the use of garters to hold them up.&lt;ref name="Olds"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olds|first1=Lauren|title=World War II and Fashion: The Birth of the New Look|journal=Constructing the Past|date=2001|volume=2|issue=1|page=Article 6|url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1062&amp;context=constructing|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of February 11, 1942, nylon production was redirected from being a consumer material to one used by the military.&lt;ref name="Kativa" /&gt; DuPont's production of nylon stockings and other lingerie stopped, and most manufactured nylon was used to make parachutes and tents for [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Krier"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-27/news/vw-227_1_years-ago-today|title=How Nylon Changed the World : 50 Years Ago Today, It Reshaped the Way We Live--and Think|last=Krier|first=Beth Ann|date=27 October 1988|website=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the war ended, the return of nylon was awaited with great anticipation. Although DuPont projected yearly production of 360 million pairs of stockings, there were delays in converting back to consumer rather than wartime production.&lt;ref name="Kativa" /&gt; In 1946, the demand for nylon stockings could not be satisfied, which led to the [[Nylon riots|Nylon Riots]].  In one case, an estimated 40,000 people lined up in Pittsburgh to buy 13,000 pairs of nylons.&lt;ref name="Wolfe2008"/&gt; In the meantime, women cut up nylon tents and parachutes left from the war in order to make blouses and wedding dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parachute Wedding Dress, 1947|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/snapshot/parachute-wedding-dress|website=Smithsonian National Museum of American History|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Woman's Home Companion|date=1948|publisher=Crowell-Collier Publishing Company|volume=75|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the end of the war and 1952, production of stockings and lingerie used 80% of the world’s nylon. DuPont put a lot of focus on catering to the civilian demand, and continually expanded its production.

=== Introduction of nylon blends ===
As pure nylon hosiery was sold in a wider market, problems became apparent. Nylon stockings were found to be fragile, in the sense that the thread often tended to unravel lengthwise, creating ‘runs’.&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|101}}  People also reported that pure nylon textiles could be uncomfortable due to nylon's lack of absorbency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Digest|first1=Reader's|title=New complete guide to sewing : step-by-step techniques for making clothes and home accessories|date=2002|publisher=Reader's Digest|location=London|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1ZVvZTdZRMC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moisture stayed inside the fabric near the skin under hot or moist conditions instead of being "wicked" away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How to buy a trail bed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_98DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=26 June 2017|journal=Backpacker|volume=5|number=3|page=70|date=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nylon fabric could also be itchy, and tended to cling and sometimes spark as a result of static electrical charge built up by friction.&lt;ref name="Mendelson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendelson|first1=Cheryl|title=Home comforts : the art and science of keeping house|date=2005|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-0743272865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfB99Kf38MwC&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaeffer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaeffer|first1=Claire|title=Claire Shaeffer's fabric sewing guide.|date=2008|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|isbn=978-0896895362|pages=88–90|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0t6AWUQgTsC&amp;pg=PA88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, under some conditions stockings could decompose&lt;ref name="Meikle" /&gt; turning back into nylon's original components of air, coal, and water. Scientists explained this as a result of air pollution, attributing it to London smog in 1952, as well as poor air quality in New York and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Cheremisinoff"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheremisinoff|first1=Nicholas P.|title=Handbook of air pollution prevention and control|date=2002|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080507927|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Stern|editor-first1=Arthur C.|title=Air pollution and its effects|date=1970|publisher=Academic press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-12-666551-2|page=72|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07FA4WIBkf8C&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garte"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garte|first1=Seymour|title=Where we stand : a surprising look at the real state of our planet|date=2008|publisher=AMACOM|location=New York|isbn=0814409105|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3yafZTSgYC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution found to problems with pure nylon fabric was to blend nylon with other existing fibres or polymers such as [[cotton]], [[polyester]], and [[spandex]].  This led to the development of a wide array of blended fabrics. The new nylon blends retained the desirable properties of nylon (elasticity, durability, ability to be dyed) and kept clothes prices low and affordable.&lt;ref name="Krier" /&gt;{{rp|2}}
As of 1950, the New York Quartermaster Procurement Agency (NYQMPA), which developed and tested textiles for the army and navy, had committed to developing a wool-nylon blend. They were not the only ones to introduce blends of both natural and synthetic fibres. ''America's Textile Reporter'' referred to 1951 as the "Year of the blending of the fibers".&lt;ref name="Haggard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haggard|first1=John V.|title=Chapter III: Collaborative Procurement of Textiles|journal=Procurement of Clothing and Textiles, 1945-53|date=16 May 1957|volume=2|issue=3|pages=79–84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Pw6alchdDkC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabric blends included mixes like "Bunara" (wool-rabbit-nylon) and "Casmet" (wool-nylon-fur).&lt;ref name="Handley"/&gt;  In Britain in November 1951, the inaugural address of the 198th session of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce focused on the blending of textiles.&lt;ref name="GOODALE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GOODALE|first1=ERNEST W.|title=THE BLENDING &amp; MIXTURE OF TEXTILE FIBRES &amp; YARNS|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|date=16 November 1951|volume=100|issue=4860|pages=4–15|jstor=41368063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DuPont's Fabric Development Department cleverly targeted French fashion designers, supplying them with fabric samples. In 1955, designers such as [[Coco Chanel]], [[Jean Patou]], and [[Christian Dior]] showed gowns created with DuPont fibers, and fashion photographer [[Horst P. Horst]] was hired to document their use of DuPont fabrics.&lt;ref name="Wolfe2008"/&gt; ''American Fabrics'' credited blends with providing "creative possibilities and new ideas for fashions which had been hitherto undreamed of."&lt;ref name="Handley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handley|first1=Susannah|title=Nylon: The Story of a Fashion Revolution|date=1999|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-0756771720|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YAYdk30VyIC&amp;pg=PA68|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Longer-term popularity ===
In spite of oil shortages in the 1970s, consumption of nylon textiles continued to grow by 7.5 per cent per annum between the 1960s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink3=Imre Szeman|last1=Wilson|first1=Sheena|last2=Carlson|first2=Adam|last3=Szeman|first3=Imre|title=Petrocultures: Oil, Politics, Culture|date=2017|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal, Quebec|pages=246|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc8mDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall production of synthetic fibres, however, dropped from 63% of the worlds textile production in 1965, to 45% of the world's textile production in early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; The appeal of "new" technologies wore off, and nylon fabric "was going out of style in the 1970s".&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;  Also, consumers became concerned about environmental costs throughout the production cycle: obtaining the raw materials (oil), energy use during production, waste produced during creation of the fibre, and eventual waste disposal of materials that were not biodegradable.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; 
Synthetic fibres have not dominated the market since the 1950s and 1960s. {{As of|2008}}, nylon continued to represent about 12% (8 million pounds) of the world's production of synthetic fibres.&lt;ref name="Wolfe2008" /&gt;

Although pure nylon has many flaws and is now rarely used, its derivatives have greatly influenced and contributed to society. From scientific discoveries relating to the production of plastics and polymerization, to economic impact during the depression and the changing of women's fashion, nylon was a revolutionary product.&lt;ref name="Wolfe2008"/&gt; The [[Lunar Flag Assembly]], the first flag planted on the moon in a symbolic gesture of celebration, was made of nylon.  The flag itself cost $5.50, but had to have a specially-designed flagpole with a horizontal bar so that it would appear to "fly".&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/apollo-flags-moon-faded-white-2016-5?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=The American Flags on the Moon Have All Turned White|last=Welsh|first=Jennifer|date=21 May 2016|work=Business Insider|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platoff"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Platoff|first1=Anne M.|title=NASA Contractor Report 188251 Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon|url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/flag/flag.htm|website=NASA|date=1993|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Nylon is one of the great symbols of the American century, on a par no doubt with Coca-Cola in the consumer dreams of 20th century men and women. [...] it is not only a technologically advanced product, it has also captured the public's imagination [...]: nylon as an object of desire."&lt;ref name="Ndiaye" /&gt;{{rp|182}}

Nylons are [[condensation polymer]]s or [[copolymer]]s, formed by reacting difunctional monomers containing equal parts of [[amine]] and [[carboxylic acid]], so that [[amide]]s are formed at both ends of each monomer in a process analogous to [[polypeptide]] [[biopolymer]]s. Most nylons are made from the reaction of a [[dicarboxylic acid]] with a [[diamine]] (e.g. PA66) or a [[lactam]] or amino acid with itself (e.g. PA6).&lt;ref name="Ratner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratner|first1=Buddy D.|title=Biomaterials science : an introduction to materials in medicine|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080877808|pages=74–77|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hBq-dLLaxwC&amp;&amp;pg=PA75|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first case, the "repeating unit" consists of one of each monomer, so that they alternate in the chain,  similar to the so-called ABAB structure of [[polyester]]s and [[polyurethane]]s. Since each monomer in this copolymer has the same [[functional group|reactive group]] on both ends, the direction of the [[peptide bond|amide bond]] reverses between each monomer, unlike natural [[polyamide]] [[protein]]s, which have overall directionality: [[carboxyl|C&amp;nbsp;terminal]]&amp;nbsp;→ [[amino|N&amp;nbsp;terminal]]. In the second case (so called AA), the repeating unit corresponds to the single monomer.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"/&gt;{{rp|45–50}}&lt;ref name="Denby"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denby|first1=Derek|last2=Otter|first2=Chris|last3=Stephenson|first3=Kay|title=Chemical storylines.|date=2008|publisher=Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=9780435631475|page=96|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qj8qryYjlX0C&amp;pg=RA1-PT68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nomenclature ===
In common usage, the prefix 'PA' ([[polyamide]]) or the name 'Nylon' are used interchangeably and are equivalent in meaning.

The nomenclature used for nylon polymers was devised during the synthesis of the first simple aliphatic nylons and uses numbers to describe the number of carbons in each monomer unit, including the carbon(s) of the carboxylic acid(s).&lt;ref&gt;Cowie J.M.G. ''Polymers: Chemistry and Physics of Modern Materials'' (2nd ed. Blackie 1991), p.16-17  {{ISBN|0-216-92980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, Alfred "Elements of Polymer Science and Engineering" (Academic Press 1982), p.32-33 {{ISBN|0-12-601680-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent use of cyclic and aromatic monomers required the use of letters or sets of letters. One number after 'PA' or 'Nylon' indicates a [[homopolymer]] which is ''monadic'' or based on one amino acid (minus H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) as monomer:

:PA 6 or [[Nylon 6]]: [NH−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;−CO]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; made from ε-[[Caprolactam]].
Two numbers or sets of letters indicate a ''dyadic'' homopolymer formed from two monomers: one [[diamine]] and one [[dicarboxylic acid]]. The first number indicates the number of carbons in the diamine. The two numbers should be separated by a comma for clarity, but the comma is often omitted.
:PA or Nylon 6,10 (or 610) : [NH−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;−NH−CO−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;−CO]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; made from [[hexamethylenediamine]] and [[sebacic acid]];

For [[copolymers]] the comonomers or pairs of comonomers are separated by slashes:
:PA 6/66 : [NH-(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;−NH−CO−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;−CO]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;−[NH−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;−CO]&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; made from caprolactam, hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid ;
:PA 66/610 : [NH−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;−NH−CO−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;−CO]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;−[NH−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;−NH−CO−(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;−CO]&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; made from hexamethylenediamine, adipic acid and [[sebacic acid]].

The term [[polyphthalamide]] (abbreviated to PPA) is used when 60% or more moles of the carboxylic acid portion of the repeating unit in the polymer chain is composed of a combination of [[terephthalic acid]] (TPA) and [[isophthalic acid]] (IPA).

=== Types of nylon ===

==== [[Nylon 66]] ====
Wallace Carothers at DuPont patented nylon&amp;nbsp;66 using amides.&lt;ref name="US 2130523"&gt;{{cite web|title=Linear polyamides and their production US 2130523 A|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2130523|website=Patents|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamine-dicarboxylic acid salts and process of preparing same US 2130947 A|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2130947|website=Patents|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthetic fiber US 2130948 A|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2130948|website=Patents|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the case of nylons that involve reaction of a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid, it is difficult to get the proportions exactly correct, and deviations can lead to chain termination at molecular weights less than a desirable 10,000 [[atomic mass unit|daltons]] ([[unified atomic mass unit|u]]). To overcome this problem, a [[crystal]]line, solid "nylon [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]" can be formed at [[room temperature]], using an exact 1:1 [[ratio]] of the [[acid]] and the [[Base (chemistry)|base]] to neutralize each other. The salt is crystallized to purify it and obtain the desired precise stoichiometry.  Heated to 285&amp;nbsp;°C (545&amp;nbsp;°F), the salt reacts to form nylon polymer with the production of water.

==== Nylon 6 ====
The synthetic route using [[lactams]] (cyclic amides) was developed by [[Paul Schlack]] at [[IG Farben]], leading to [[nylon 6|nylon&amp;nbsp;6]], or [[caprolactam|polycaprolactam]] — formed by a [[ring-opening polymerization]]. The peptide bond within the caprolactam is broken with the exposed [[functional group|active groups]] on each side being incorporated into two new bonds as the monomer becomes part of the polymer backbone.

The 428&amp;nbsp;°F (220&amp;nbsp;°C) melting point of [[nylon 6]] is lower than the 509&amp;nbsp;°F (265&amp;nbsp;°C) melting point of [[nylon 66]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiber-reinforced composite articles and methods of making them CA 2853925 A1|url=https://google.com/patents/CA2853925A1|website=Patents|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[Nylon 46]] ====

==== Nylon 510 ====
Nylon&amp;nbsp;510, made from [[pentamethylene diamine]] and [[sebacic acid]], was studied by Carothers even before nylon&amp;nbsp;66 and has superior properties, but is more expensive to make. In keeping with this naming convention, "nylon&amp;nbsp;6,12" or "PA 612" is a copolymer of a 6C diamine and a 12C diacid. Similarly for PA 510 PA 611; PA 1012, etc. Other nylons include copolymerized dicarboxylic acid/diamine products that are ''not'' based upon the monomers listed above. For example, some fully [[aromatic]] nylons (known as "[[aramids]]") are polymerized with the addition of diacids like [[terephthalic acid]] (→ [[Kevlar]], [[Twaron]]) or [[isophthalic acid]] (→ [[Nomex]]), more commonly associated with polyesters. There are copolymers of PA 66/6; copolymers of PA 66/6/12; and others. In general linear polymers are the most useful, but it is possible to introduce branches in nylon by the condensation of dicarboxylic acids with [[polyamine]]s having three or more [[amino group]]s.

The general reaction is:
[[Image:Condensation polymerization diacid diamine.svg|centre|600px]]

Two molecules of [[water (molecule)|water]] are given off and the nylon is formed. Its properties are determined by the R and R' groups in the monomers. In nylon 6,6, R&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4C and R'&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6C [[alkane]]s, but one also has to include the two carboxyl [[carbon]]s in the diacid to get the number it donates to the chain. In [[Kevlar]], both R and R' are [[benzene]] rings.

Industrial synthesis is usually done by heating the acids, amines or lactams to remove water, but in the laboratory, diacid chlorides can be reacted with diamines. For example, a popular demonstration of interfacial polymerization (the "[[nylon rope trick]]") is the synthesis of nylon 66 from [[adipoyl chloride]] and hexamethylene diamine.

==== Nylon 1,6 ====
Nylons can also be synthesized from dinitriles using acid catalysis. For example, this method is applicable for preparation of [[nylon 1,6]] from [[adiponitrile]], [[formaldehyde]] and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magat|first=Eugene E.|last2=Faris|first2=Burt F.|last3=Reith|first3=John E.|last4=Salisbury|first4=L.

=== Monomers ===
Nylon monomers are manufactured by a variety of routes, starting in most cases from crude oil but sometimes from biomass. Those in current production are described below.

==== Amino acids and lactams ====
* ε-[[Caprolactam]]: [[Crude oil]] → [[benzene]] → [[cyclohexane]] → [[cyclohexanone]] → cyclohexanone [[oxime]] → caprolactam
* [[11-Aminoundecanoic acid|11-aminoundecanoic acid]]: [[Castor oil]] → [[ricinoleic acid]] → methylricinoleate → methyl-11-undecenoate → undecenoic acid → 11-undecenoic acid → 11-bromoundecanoic acid → 11-aminoundecanoic acid&lt;ref name="Gotro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gotro|first1=Jeffrey|title=Bio-Polyamides: Where Do They Come From?|url=http://polymerinnovationblog.com/bio-polyamides-where-do-they-come-from/|website=Polymer Innovation Blog|date=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Laurolactam]]: [[Butadiene]] → [[cyclododecatriene]] → [[cyclododecane]] → [[cyclododecanone]] → cyclododecanone [[oxime]] → laurolactam

==== Diacids ====
* [[Adipic acid]]: [[Crude oil]] → [[benzene]] → [[cyclohexane]] → [[cyclohexanone]] + [[cyclohexanol]] → adipic acid

* [[Terephthalic acid]]: [[Crude oil]] → [[p-xylene]] → terephthalic acid
* [[Isophthalic acid]]: [[Crude oil]] → [[m-xylene]] → isophthalic acid

==== Diamines ====
Various diamine components can be used, which are derived from a variety of sources. Most are [[petrochemical]]s, but [[bio-based material]]s are also being developed.
* Tetramethylene diamine ([[putrescine]]): [[Crude oil]] → [[propylene]] → [[acrylonitrile]] → [[succinonitrile]] → tetramethylene diamine
* [[Hexamethylene diamine]] (HMD): [[Crude oil]] → [[butadiene]] → [[adiponitrile]] → hexamethylene diamine

==== Copolymers ====
It is easy to make mixtures of the monomers or sets of monomers used to make nylons to obtain copolymers. This lowers [[crystallinity]] and can therefore lower the melting point.

Some copolymers that have been or are commercially available are listed below:

==== Blends ====
Most nylon polymers are miscible with each other allowing a range of blends to be made.  The two polymers can react with one another by transamidation to form random copolymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Samperi| first1=Filippo| last2=Montaudo| first2=Maurizio S.| last3=Puglisi| first3=Concetto| last4=Di Giorgi|first4=Sabrina|last5=Montaudo|first5=Giorgio|title=Structural Characterization of Copolyamides Synthesized via the Facile Blending of Polyamides| journal=Macromolecules| date=August 2004| volume=37| issue=17| pages=6449–6459| doi=10.1021/ma049575x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their crystallinity, polyamides can be:
* semi-[[crystal]]line: 
** high crystallinity: PA46 and PA66;
** low crystallinity: PAMXD6 made from m-xylylenediamine and adipic acid;
* [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]]: PA6I made from hexamethylenediamine and [[isophthalic acid]].

According to this classification, PA66, for example, is an aliphatic semi-crystalline homopolyamide.

=== Flammability ===
Nylon clothing tends to be less flammable than cotton and rayon, but nylon fibres may melt and stick to skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flammable clothing|url=https://kidshealth.schn.health.nsw.gov.au/flammable-clothing|website=The Children’s Hospital at Westmead|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Phillips|editor-first1=Anne W.|editor-last2=Walter|editor-first2=Carl W.|author=Workshop on Mass Burns (1968 : Washington, D.C.)|title=Mass burns : proceeding of a workshop, 13-14 March 1968 / sponsored by the Committee on Fire Research, Division of Engineering, National Research Council and the Office of Civil Defense, Dept. of the Army|date=1969|publisher=National Academy of Sciences ; Springfield, Va. : reproduced by the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific &amp; Technical Information|location=Washington, D.C.|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bulk properties ==
Above their [[glass transition temperature|melting temperatures]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, [[thermoplastic]]s like nylon are [[amorphous solid]]s or viscous [[fluid]]s in which the chains approximate [[random coil]]s. Below ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, amorphous regions alternate with regions which are [[lamellae (materials)|lamellar]] [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041230231859/http://www.aml.arizona.edu/classes/mse222/1998/nylon66/mse222.htm Valerie Menzer's Nylon 66 Webpage]. Arizona University&lt;/ref&gt; The amorphous regions contribute elasticity and the crystalline regions contribute strength and rigidity. The [[Plane (geometry)|planar]] amide (-CO-NH-) groups are very [[chemical polarity|polar]], so nylon forms multiple [[hydrogen bond]]s among adjacent strands. Because the nylon backbone is so regular and symmetrical, especially if all the amide bonds are in the [[geometric isomerism|''trans'' configuration]], nylons often have high crystallinity and make excellent fibers. The amount of crystallinity depends on the details of formation, as well as on the kind of nylon.

[[File:Nylon-3D-h bond.png|thumb|316px|Hydrogen bonding in Nylon&amp;nbsp;6,6 (in mauve).]]

Nylon&amp;nbsp;66 can have multiple parallel strands aligned with their neighboring peptide bonds at coordinated separations of exactly 6 and 4 carbons for considerable lengths, so the [[carbonyl]] [[oxygen]]s and amide [[hydrogen]]s can line up to form interchain [[hydrogen bond]]s repeatedly, without interruption (see the figure opposite). Nylon&amp;nbsp;510 can have coordinated runs of 5 and 8 carbons. Thus parallel (but not antiparallel) strands can participate in extended, unbroken, multi-chain [[beta sheet|β-pleated sheets]], a strong and tough supermolecular structure similar to that found in natural [[keratin#Molecular biology and biochemistry|silk fibroin]] and the [[keratin|β-keratins]] in [[feather]]s. (Proteins have only an amino acid α-carbon separating sequential -CO-NH- groups.) Nylon&amp;nbsp;6 will form uninterrupted [[hydrogen bond|H-bonded]] sheets with mixed directionalities, but the β-sheet wrinkling is somewhat different. The three-dimensional disposition of each [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon chain]] depends on [[rotation]]s about the 109.47° [[alkane#Molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] bonds of singly bonded carbon atoms.

When [[extrusion|extruded]] into fibers through pores in an industry [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]], the individual polymer chains tend to align because of [[viscosity|viscous]] [[rheology|flow]]. If subjected to [[cold drawing]] afterwards, the fibers align further, increasing their crystallinity, and the material acquires additional [[tensile strength]]. In practice, nylon fibers are most often drawn using heated rolls at high speeds.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Ian M.|title=Introduction to synthetic polymers|date=2000|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198564706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Block nylon tends to be less crystalline, except near the surfaces due to [[Shear (fluid)|shearing]] [[stress (physics)|stresses]] during formation. Nylon is clear and [[color]]less, or milky, but is easily [[dye]]d. Multistranded nylon cord and rope is slippery and tends to unravel. The ends can be [[melting|melted]] and fused with a heat source such as a [[flame]] or [[electrode]] to prevent this.

Nylons are hygroscopic, and will absorb or desorb moisture as a function of the ambient humidity. Variations in moisture content have several effects on the polymer.  Firstly, the dimensions will change, but more importantly moisture acts as a plasticizer, lowering the [[glass transition temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), and consequently the elastic modulus at temperatures below the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measurement of Moisture Effects on the Mechanical Properties of 66 Nylon - TA Instruments Thermal Analysis Application Brief TA-133|url=http://www.tainstruments.com/pdf/literature/TA133.pdf|website=TA Instruments|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When dry, polyamide is a good electrical insulator. However, polyamide is [[hygroscopic]]. The absorption of water will change some of the material's properties such as its [[electrical resistance]]. Nylon is less absorbent than wool or cotton.

=== Characteristics ===

[[Bill Pittendreigh]], [[DuPont]], and other individuals and corporations worked diligently during the first few months of [[World War II]] to find a way to replace Asian [[silk]] and [[hemp]] with nylon in [[parachute]]s. It was also used to make [[tire]]s, [[tent]]s, [[rope]]s, [[poncho]]s, and other [[armed forces|military]] supplies. It was even used in the production of a high-grade paper for U.S. [[currency]]. At the outset of the war, [[cotton]] accounted for more than 80% of all fibers used and manufactured, and [[wool]] fibers accounted for nearly all of the rest. By August 1945, manufactured fibers had taken a market share of 25%, at the expense of cotton. After the war, because of shortages of both silk and nylon, nylon parachute material was sometimes repurposed to make dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caruso|first=David|title=Saving the (Wedding) Day: Oral History Spotlight|journal=Transmutations|year=2009|volume=Fall|issue=5|pages=2|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/Publications/Transmutations/05-Transmutations_Fall-2009.pdf|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509093859/http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/Publications/Transmutations/05-Transmutations_Fall-2009.pdf|archivedate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nylon 6 and 66 fibers are used in [[Carpet#Nylon|carpet]] manufacture.

Its various properties also make it very useful as a material in [[additive manufacturing]]; specifically as a filament in consumer and professional grade [[fused deposition modeling]] 3D printers. Nylon can be used as the matrix material in [[composite material]]s, with reinforcing fibers like glass or carbon fiber; such a composite has a higher [[density]] than pure nylon.&lt;ref name=PerformanceComposites&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiberglass and Composite Material Design Guide|url=http://www.performancecomposites.com/about-composites-technical-info/122-designing-with-fiberglass.html|website=Performance Composites Inc.|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such thermoplastic composites (25% to 30% glass fiber) are frequently used in car components next to the engine, such as intake manifolds, where the good heat resistance of such materials makes them feasible competitors to metals.&lt;ref name=Page2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Page|first1=I.

=== Food packaging ===
Nylon resins are used as a component of food packaging films where an oxygen barrier is needed.&lt;ref name="BPF"/&gt; Some of the terpolymers based upon nylon are used every day in packaging. Nylon has been used for [[meat]] wrappings and [[sausage]] sheaths.&lt;ref name=Colbert2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colbert|first1=Judy|title=It happened in Delaware : remarkable events that shaped history|date=2013|publisher=Morris Book Publishing|isbn=978-0-7627-6968-1|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJOEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high temperature resistance of nylon makes it useful for oven bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oven Bags|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/oven-bags|website=Cooks Info|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filaments ===
Nylon filaments are primarily used in brushes especially [[Toothbrush#End-tuft brush|toothbrushes]]&lt;ref name="AOGHS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nylon, a Petroleum Polymer|url=http://aoghs.org/products/petroleum-product-nylon-fiber/|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=American Oil and Gas Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[string trimmer]]s. They are also used as monofilaments in [[Fishing line#Modern lines|fishing line]]. Nylon 610 and 612 are the most used polymers for filaments.

Its various properties also make it very useful as a material in [[additive manufacturing]]; specifically as a filament in consumer and professional grade [[fused deposition modeling]] 3D printers.

=== Other forms ===

==== Extruded Profiles ====
Nylon resins can be extruded into rods, tubes and sheets.&lt;ref name="Kohan"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

==== Powder Coating ====
Nylon powders are used to powder coat metals. [[Nylon 11]] and nylon 12 are the most widely used.&lt;ref name="Kohan"/&gt;{{rp|53}}

==== Instrument strings ====
In the mid-1940s, classical guitarist [[Andrés Segovia]] mentioned the shortage of good guitar strings in the United States, particularly his favorite Pirastro [[catgut]] strings, to a number of foreign diplomats at a party, including General Lindeman of the British Embassy. A month later, the General presented Segovia with some nylon strings which he had obtained via some members of the DuPont family. Segovia found that although the strings produced a clear sound, they had a faint metallic [[timbre]] which he hoped could be eliminated.&lt;ref name=Guitar&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Classical guitar strings|url=http://www.maestros-of-the-guitar.com/classicalguitarstrings.html|website=Maestros of the Guitar|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nylon strings were first tried on stage by Olga Coelho in New York in January, 1944.&lt;ref name="Bellow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellow|first1=Alexander|title=The Illustrated History of the Guitar|date=1970|publisher=Franco Colombo|location=New York|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Segovia and string maker [[Albert Augustine Ltd.|Albert Augustine]] were introduced by their mutual friend Vladimir Bobri, editor of Guitar Review. On the basis of Segovia's interest and Augustine's past experiments, they decided to pursue the development of nylon strings. DuPont, skeptical of the idea, agreed to supply the nylon if Augustine would endeavor to develop and produce the actual strings. After three years of development, Augustine demonstrated a nylon first string whose quality impressed guitarists, including Segovia, in addition to DuPont.&lt;ref name=Guitar/&gt;

Wound strings, however, were more problematic. Eventually, however, after experimenting with various types of metal and smoothing and polishing techniques, Augustine was also able to produce high quality nylon wound strings.&lt;ref name=Guitar/&gt;

== Hydrolysis and degradation ==
All nylons are susceptible to [[hydrolysis]], especially by [[strong acid]]s, a reaction essentially the reverse of the synthetic reaction shown above. The [[molecular weight]] of nylon products so attacked drops, and cracks form quickly at the affected zones. Lower members of the nylons (such as nylon 6) are affected more than higher members such as nylon 12. This means that nylon parts cannot be used in contact with [[sulfuric acid]] for example, such as the electrolyte used in [[Lead–acid battery|lead–acid batteries]].

When being molded, nylon must be dried to prevent hydrolysis in the molding machine barrel since water at high temperatures can also degrade the polymer.&lt;ref name=Reltek&gt;{{cite web|title=Adhesive for nylon &amp; kevlar|url=http://reltekllc.com/adhesivesfornylon.aspx|website=Reltek|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction is of the type:
:[[Image:amide hydrolysis.svg]]

== Environmental impact, incineration and recycling ==

Berners-Lee calculates the average [[GHG footprint|greenhouse gas footprint]] of nylon in manufacturing carpets at 5.43&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent per kg, when produced in Europe. This gives it almost the same carbon footprint as [[wool]], but with greater durability and therefore a lower overall carbon footprint.&lt;ref name="Berners-Lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berners-Lee|first1=Mike|title=How bad are bananas? : the carbon footprint of everything|date=2010|publisher=Profile Books|location=London|page=112, table 6.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data published by PlasticsEurope indicates for nylon 66 a [[GHG footprint|greenhouse gas footprint]] of 6.4&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent per kg, and an energy consumption of 138 kJ/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eco-profiles and Environmental Product Declarations of the European Plastics Manufacturers: Polyamide 6.6|date=2014|publisher=PlasticsEurope AISBL|location=Brussels|url=http://www.plasticseurope.org/plasticssustainability/eco-profiles/browse-by-flowchart.aspx?LCAID=r307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When considering the environmental impact of nylon, it is important to consider the use phase.  In particular when cars are lightweighted, significant savings in fuel consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are realised.

Various nylons break down in fire and form hazardous smoke, and toxic fumes or ash, typically containing [[hydrogen cyanide]].

The ''Off-Site Source Recovery Project'' (OSRP) is a U.S. government project funded by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].  The OSRP mission is to remove excess, unwanted, abandoned, or orphan radioactive sealed sources that pose a potential risk to health, safety, and national security.

This government project had its beginnings in the Energy Department's early Environmental Management program. Environmental management was intended to clean up environmental contamination and dispose of vast quantities of radioactive and hazardous waste stemming from several decades of nuclear weapons design, research, testing and production.  

One of the issues faced by the early Environmental Management program was substantial amounts of radioactive and hazardous materials at universities and other locations left over from contracts and grants into various aspect of nuclear technology research. The Energy Department began addressing this problem with a low-budget effort called the Offsite Waste Program.

The initial scope of the OSR Project included all Greater than Class C (GTCC) sealed sources. However, since September 11, 2001, the mission expanded from environmental concerns to public safety and national security. As a result, OSRP direction and oversight moved from the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management, to the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] in 2003. 

The project mainly addresses sources containing [[americium]] and [[plutonium]].  The recently expanded mission also includes recovery of beta or gamma emitting sources, like caesium and strontium. 

OSRP has been able to recover more than 18,000 sources from nearly 700 sites in 48 States, the DC area, Puerto Rico and a few foreign countries.

In [[hydrology]], '''pipeflow''' is  a type of [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] water flow where water travels along cracks in the soil or old root systems found in above ground [[vegetation]].

In such soils which have a high vegetation content water is able to travel along the 'pipes', allowing water to travel faster than [[throughflow]]. Here, water can move at speeds between 50 and 500 m/h.

In electronics, a '''plate detector''' ('''anode bend detector, grid bias detector''') is a [[vacuum tube]] circuit in which an amplifying tube having a control grid is operated in a non-linear region of its grid voltage versus plate current transfer characteristic near plate current cutoff in order to [[demodulation|demodulate]] an amplitude modulated carrier signal.&lt;ref name="zep"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Zepler_1943_The_Technique_of_Radio_Design#page/n113/mode/2up E.E. Zepler, ''The Technique of Radio Design'', New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1943, p. 105]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/CommunicationEngineering/Everitt-CommunicationEngineering#page/n443 W. L. Everitt, ''Communication Engineering'', 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937, pp. 433-446]&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from the [[grid-leak detector|grid leak detector]], which utilizes non-linearity of the grid voltage versus grid current characteristic for demodulation. It also differs from the diode detector, which is a two terminal device.

== History ==

Plate detector circuits were commonly used from the 1920s until the start of World War II. In 1927, the advent of screen grid tubes permitted much more radio frequency amplification prior to the detector stage than previously practically possible.&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Robinson, "The Operating Characteristics of Vacuum Tube Detectors", Part 1. ''QST'', vol. XIV, no. 8, p. 27, Aug. 1930&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Wenaas, ''Radiola: the Golden Age of RCA, 1919 - 1929'', Chandler, AZ: Sonoran Publishing LLC, 2007, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; The previously used grid leak detector was less suited to the higher radio frequency signal level than the plate detector. Diode detectors also became popular during the later 1920s because, unlike plate detector circuits, they could also provide automatic gain control voltage (A.V.C.) for the radio frequency amplifier stages of the receiver. However, the [[double diode triode|dual-diode/triode]] and dual-diode/pentode tubes commonly used for detection/A.V.C. circuits had bulk [[wholesale]] costs that were as much as twice the cost of the tubes commonly used as plate detectors. This made plate detector circuits more practical for low-priced radios sold during the depths of the [[Great Depression]].

== Operation ==

Negative bias is applied to the grid to bring the plate current almost to cutoff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Bookshelf/Technology/The-Manual-Of-Modern-Radio-John%20Scott-Taggart.pdf J. Scott-Taggart, ''The Manual of Modern Radio'', London: The Amalgamated Press LTD., 1933, pp. 114]&lt;/ref&gt; The grid is connected directly to the secondary of a radio frequency or [[intermediate frequency]] transformer. An incoming signal will cause the plate current to increase much more during the positive 180 degrees of the carrier frequency cycle than it decreases during the negative 180 degrees. The plate current variation will include the modulation envelope. The plate current is passed through a plate load impedance chosen to produce the desired amplification in conjunction with the tube characteristics.&lt;ref name="zep" /&gt; A capacitor of low impedance at the carrier frequency and high impedance at audio frequencies is provided between the tube plate and cathode, to minimize amplification of the carrier frequency and remove carrier frequency variations from the recovered modulation waveform.&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Everitt, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; The allowable peak 100% modulated input signal voltage is limited to the magnitude of the bias voltage, corresponding to an unmodulated carrier peak voltage of half the bias voltage magnitude.&lt;ref name="zep" /&gt;

Either fixed [[Biasing#Vacuum tubes (thermionic valves)|bias]] or cathode bias may be used for the plate detector. When cathode bias is implemented, a capacitor of low impedance at the carrier frequency and high impedance at audio frequencies bypasses the cathode resistor.&lt;ref name="zep" /&gt; Cathode bias reduces the amplification obtainable.&lt;ref name="zep" /&gt;

===Controlling volume level===

Plate detector circuits usually do not produce A.V.C. voltage for the radio frequency (R.F.) stages of the receiver. In these receivers, volume control is often accomplished by providing variable cathode bias of one or more stages prior to the detector. A potentiometer is used to implement the variable cathode bias. The most common connection of the potentiometer (typically 4 kΩ to 15 kΩ linear taper) is as follows:

*One end of the potentiometer is connected to the antenna coupling component;
*The wiper is connected to ground (in A.C. receivers) or B minus (in A.C./D.C. receivers);
*The other end of the potentiometer is connected to the cathode of at least one R.F. amplifier (in T.R.F. receivers) or the cathode of the converter and/or the I.F. amplifier (in superheterodyne receivers).

To set a limit on the ability of the volume control to reduce the bias on the stages that it controls, the potentiometer is often equipped with a mechanical rotation limit facility that prevents the resistance from being reduced below a specific amount.

*Other volume control circuits in non-A.V.C. receivers include:
**A potentiometer (typically 500 kΩ audio taper) where the high end and center wiper are connected as above, but where the low end is connected to the control grid of audio output tube.  (In this circuit, the potentiometer replaces the bias resistor for the output tube's control grid);
**A linear taper potentiometer that adjusts the screen grid voltages of the R.F. amplifiers (if they are tetrodes or pentodes);
**A linear taper potentiometer connected to the antenna (high end), ground (low end) and the antenna transformer primary or first tuned circuit (center wiper).

Because the volume control in non-A.V.C. receivers adjusts R.F. signal levels rather than A.F. signal levels, the volume control must be manipulated while tuning the radio in order to find weak signals.

===Tubes commonly used as plate detectors===
*''''01A, 1H4G, 6C6, 6J7, 6SJ7, 12F5, 12J5, 12J7, 12SF5, 12SJ7, 24, 24A, 27, 30, 36, 37, 56, 57, 76, 77, 201A, 301A'''

== Comparison with Alternative Envelope Detectors ==

===Infinite-Impedance Detector===
[[File:Infinite-Impedance Detector circuit - Simple JFET version.gif|thumb|right|Infinite-Impedance Detector (JFET implementation)]] 
In the Infinite-Impedance detector, the load resistance is placed in series with the cathode, rather than the plate, and the demodulated output is taken from the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Wireless-World/30s/Wireless-World-1937-01.pdf W. N. Weeden, "New Detector Circuit", ''Wireless World'', no. 905, vol. XL, no. 1, Jan. 1st 1937, p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruft"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n731 Cruft Electronics Staff, ''Electronic Circuits and Tubes'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1947, p. 710]&lt;/ref&gt; The circuit is operated in the region where grid current does not occur during any portion of the carrier frequency cycle, thus the name "Infinite Impedance Detector". An example schematic diagram of an implementation using a field effect transistor is shown.

As with the standard plate detector, the device is biased almost completely off. The positive-going 180 degrees of the carrier input signal causes substantial increase of cathode or source current above the amount set by the bias, and the negative going 180 degrees of the carrier cycle causes very little decrease of cathode current below the level set by the bias. C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is charged to a dc voltage determined by the carrier amplitude. C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can only be discharged via R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the circuit acts as a peak detector at the carrier frequency. The C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; time constant is much shorter than the period of the highest modulating frequency, permitting the voltage across C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to follow the modulation envelope. Negative feedback takes place at the recovered modulation frequencies, reducing distortion. The infinite impedance detector can demodulate higher modulation percentages with less distortion than the plate detector.&lt;ref&gt;B. Goodman, "The Infinite Impedance Detector", ''[[QST]]'', vol. XXIII, p. 21, Oct. 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; values of 50,000 to 150,000 ohms are typical for tubes.&lt;ref&gt;B. Goodman, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; The time constant of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen to be several times the period of the lowest carrier frequency, with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; values of 100 to 500 picofarads being typical. The low pass filter in the V+ power supply line, C4 and the RFC ([[Choke (electronics)#RF Chokes|RF Choke]]) shown in the diagram, minimizes unwanted [[Radio Frequency|RF]] coupling through the power supply to other circuitry and does not contribute to the function of the detector.

This pure plutonium is needed to avoid premature ignition of low-mass [[nuclear weapon]] designs by neutrons produced by spontaneous fission of [[plutonium-240]].

'''Plymax''' is a building material, used in [[airplane]]s. It consists of a thin sheet of [[duralumin]] bonded to a thicker sheet of [[plywood]]. Most notably it was used in the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]], and [[France|French]] aircraft of the 1930s. It was also used on the bodies of some cars such as a 1931 Triumph Super 9. The articulated body of the Trojan Tasker also used this material.

In [[physics]], '''polaritons''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ær|ᵻ|t|ɒ|n|z|,_|p|oʊ|-}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-21|Polariton}}}} are [[quasiparticle]]s resulting from strong coupling of [[electromagnetic wave]]s with an electric or magnetic [[dipole]]-carrying excitation.{{example needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- is an "excitation" an object or a field or a charge or what? --&gt; They are an expression of the common [[quantum]] phenomenon known as [[level repulsion]], also known as the [[Avoided crossing|avoided crossing principle]]. Polaritons describe the crossing of the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light with any interacting [[resonance]]. To this extent polaritons can also be thought as the new [[normal modes]] of a given material or structure arising from the strong coupling of the bare modes, which are the photon and the dipolar oscillation. The polariton is a [[boson]]ic quasiparticle, and should not be confused with the [[polaron]] (a [[fermion]]ic one), which is an electron plus an attached phonon cloud.

Whenever the polariton picture is valid,{{huh|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- when is this the case, exactly? --&gt; the model of photons propagating freely in crystals is insufficient. A major feature of polaritons is a strong dependency of the propagation speed of light through the crystal on the [[frequency]] of the photon. For exciton-polaritons, rich experimental results on various aspects have been gained in [[copper (I) oxide]].

== History ==
Oscillations in ionized gases were observed by Tonks and Langmuir in 1929. Polaritons were first considered theoretically by [[Kirill Borisovich Tolpygo|Tolpygo]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;K.B. Tolpygo, "Physical properties of a rock salt lattice made up of deformable ions," ''Zh. Eks.Teor.

That name was suggested by [[Solomon Isaakovich Pekar|Pekar]], but the term ''polariton,'' proposed by [[John Hopfield|Hopfield]], was adopted.

==Types==
A '''polariton''' is the result of the mixing of a [[photon]] with a polar excitation of a material. The following are types of polaritons:
* Phonon polaritons result from coupling of an [[infrared]] photon with an optic [[phonon]]; 
*[[Exciton-polaritons|Exciton polaritons]] result from coupling of [[visible light]] with an [[exciton]];
*[[Intersubband polariton]]s result from coupling of an [[infrared]] or [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] photon with an [[intersubband excitation]];
*[[Surface plasmon polaritons]] result from coupling of [[surface plasmon]]s with light (the wavelength depends on the substance and its geometry); 
*Bragg polaritons ("Braggoritons") result from coupling of [[Photonic crystal|Bragg photon modes]] with bulk [[exciton]]s;&lt;ref name="eradat"&gt;Eradat N., et al. (2002) Evidence for braggoriton excitations in opal photonic crystals infiltrated with highly polarizable dyes'','' ''Appl. Phys. Lett.'' '''80''': 3491.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pump''''' is a 2014 [[documentary film]] by [[Josh Tickell]] and [[Rebecca Harrell Tickell]].  The film begins by exploring the history of petroleum-based fuel consumption, the use of the [[Internal combustion engine]] and the geopolitics involved with petroleum. It is primarily focuses on the United States but also includes a segment on the [[automotive industry in China]]. The film then explores in-depth on the [[alternative energy]] options for vehicles that are either readily available for use or can be on a mass scale. This includes [[ethanol fuel]], [[methanol fuel]], [[Flexible-fuel vehicles in Brazil]], [[flexible-fuel vehicles in the United States]], and [[electric vehicles]] including [[Tesla Motors]].

Funding for the film came from [[Patrón]] tequila founder John [[Paul DeJoria]], [[Rhino Films]] executive Stephen Nemeth and the [[Fuel Freedom Foundation]].&lt;ref name="In1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=|title='Pump' documentary filled with fuel alternatives|first=Susan|last=Carpenter|date=September 19, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mineral]] '''pyrite''', or '''iron pyrite''', also known as '''fool's gold''', is an [[iron sulfide]] with the [[chemical formula]] FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (iron(II) disulfide). Pyrite is considered the most common of the [[sulfide mineral]]s.

Pyrite's metallic [[Luster (mineralogy)|luster]] and pale brass-yellow [[hue]] give it a superficial resemblance to [[gold]], hence the well-known nickname of ''fool's gold''. The color has also led to the nicknames ''brass'', ''brazzle'', and ''Brazil'', primarily used to refer to pyrite found in [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jackson, Julia A. |author2=Mehl, James |author3=Neuendorf, Klaus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;pg=PA82 |via=Google Books |title=Glossary of Geology |publisher=American Geological Institute |year=2005 |page=82|isbn=9780922152766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fay, Albert H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fB4bAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA103 |via=Google Books |title=A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry |publisher=United States Bureau of Mines |year=1920 |pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''pyrite'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πυρίτης (''pyritēs''), "of fire" or "in fire",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpuri%2Fths1 |article=πυρίτης |editor1=Henry George Liddell |editor2=Robert Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |via=Perseus |publisher=Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from πύρ (''pyr''), "fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpu%3Dr |article=πύρ |editor1=Henry George Liddell |editor2=Robert Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon  |via=Perseus |publisher=Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times, this name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when struck against [[steel]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] described one of them as being brassy, almost certainly a reference to what we now call pyrite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dana, James Dwight |author2=Dana, Edward Salisbury |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHS7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |title=Descriptive Mineralogy |edition=6th |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1911 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Georgius Agricola]]'s time, c. 1550, the term had become a generic term for all of the [[Pyrite group|sulfide minerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |translator1=Hoover, H.C. |translator1-link=Herbert Clark Hoover |translator2=Hoover, L.H. |translator2-link=Lou Henry Hoover |author-link=Georgius Agricola |title=[[De re metallica]] |magazine=The Mining Magazine |location=London |orig-year=1912 |publisher=Dover |year=1950 |at=see footnote on p.&amp;nbsp;112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrite is usually found associated with other sulfides or [[oxides]] in [[quartz]] [[Vein (geology)|veins]], [[sedimentary rock]], and [[metamorphic rock]], as well as in coal beds and as a replacement mineral in [[fossil]]s, but has also been identified in the sclerites of [[scaly-foot gastropod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/11/1107_031107_snailarmor.html |title=Armor-plated snail discovered in deep sea |website=news.nationalgeographic.com |access-date=2016-08-29 |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small quantities of gold. Gold and [[arsenic]] occur as a coupled substitution in the pyrite structure. In the [[Carlin–type gold deposit]]s, arsenian pyrite contains up to 0.37%&amp;nbsp;gold by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fleet, M. E. |author2=Mumin, A.

Pyrite enjoyed brief popularity in the 16th and 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries as a source of [[Combustion|ignition]] in early [[firearm]]s, most notably the [[wheellock]], where the cock held a lump of pyrite against a circular file to strike the sparks needed to fire the gun.

Pyrite has been used since classical times to manufacture ''copperas'' ([[iron(II) sulfate]]). Iron pyrite was heaped up and allowed to weather (an example of an early form of [[heap leaching]]). The acidic runoff from the heap was then boiled with iron to produce iron sulfate.  In the 15th century, new methods of such leaching began to replace the burning of sulfur as a source of [[sulfuric acid]]. By the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, it had become the dominant method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Industrial England in the Middle of the Eighteenth Century |journal=Nature |volume=83 |issue=2113 |date=1910-04-28 |pages=264–268 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v83/n2113/abs/083264a0.html |doi=10.1038/083264a0|bibcode = 1910Natur..83..264. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrite remains in commercial use for the production of [[sulfur dioxide]], for use in such applications as the [[paper industry]], and in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Thermal decomposition of pyrite into FeS ([[iron(II) sulfide]]) and elemental sulfur starts at {{nowrap|540 °C}}; at around {{nowrap|700 °C}} ''p''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is about {{nowrap|1 atm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of extractive metallurgy |author=Rosenqvist, Terkel |edition=2nd |publisher=Tapir Academic Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-82-519-1922-7 |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I2mg2ine4AEC&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer commercial use for pyrite is as the [[cathode]] material in [[Energizer]] brand non-rechargeable [[lithium battery|lithium batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Energizer Corporation |url=http://data.energizer.com/PDFs/lithiuml91l92_appman.pdf |title=Lithium-Iron Disulfide (Li-FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) |series=Handbook and Application Manual |date=2017-09-19 |article=Cylindrical Primary Lithium [battery] |access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, pyrite was used as a [[Cat's-whisker detector|mineral detector]] in [[radio]] receivers, and is still used by [[crystal radio]] hobbyists. Until the [[vacuum tube]] matured, the crystal detector was the most sensitive and dependable [[detector (radio)|detector]] available – with considerable variation between mineral types and even individual samples within a particular type of mineral. Pyrite detectors occupied a midway point between [[galena]] detectors and the more mechanically complicated [[Cat's-whisker detector#Types|perikon]] mineral pairs. Pyrite detectors can be as sensitive as a modern 1N34A [[germanium]] [[diode]] detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSguAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 |title=The Principles Underlying Radio Communication |series=Radio Pamphlet |volume=40 |department=U.S. Army Signal Corps |date=1918 |at=section&amp;nbsp;179, pp.&amp;nbsp;302–305 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas H.

&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time when the term became common in jewelry making, "marcasite" referred to all iron sulfides including pyrite, and not to the orthorhombic FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mineral [[marcasite]] which is lighter in color, brittle and chemically unstable, and thus not suitable for jewelry making. Marcasite jewelry does not actually contain the mineral marcasite.

==Formal oxidation states for pyrite, marcasite, and arsenopyrite==
From the perspective of classical inorganic chemistry, which assigns formal oxidation states to each atom, pyrite is probably best described as Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. This formalism recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite occur in pairs with clear S–S bonds. These '''[[persulfide]]''' units can be viewed as derived from [[hydrogen disulfide]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus pyrite would be more descriptively called iron persulfide, not iron disulfide. In contrast, [[molybdenite]], [[molybdenum|Mo]]S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, features isolated sulfide (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) centers and the oxidation state of molybdenum is Mo&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. The mineral [[arsenopyrite]] has the formula Fe[[arsenic|As]]S.  Whereas pyrite has S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunits, arsenopyrite has [AsS] units, formally derived from [[deprotonation]] of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsSH.  Analysis of classical oxidation states would recommend the description of arsenopyrite as Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;[AsS]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Vaughan, D. J. |author2=Craig, J. R. |title=Mineral Chemistry of Metal Sulfides |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-521-21489-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crystallography==

Iron-pyrite FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the prototype compound of the crystallographic pyrite structure. The structure is simple [[cubic crystal system|cubic]] and was among the first [[crystal structures]] solved by [[X-ray diffraction]].&lt;ref name=Brag1913&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bragg, W.

Under thermodynamic standard conditions the [[lattice constant]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of stoichiometric iron pyrite FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amounts to {{nowrap|541.87 pm}}.&lt;ref name=Birk1991&gt;{{cite journal |title = Sulfur deficiency in iron pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt;) and its consequences for band structure models |journal=Physical Review B |volume = 43 |pages = 11926–11936 |year=1991 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.43.11926 |bibcode=1991PhRvB..4311926B |issue=14 |last1=Birkholz |first1=M. |last2=Fiechter |first2=S. |last3=Hartmann |first3=A. |last4=Tributsch |first4=H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cubic crystal system#unit cell|unit cell]] is composed of a Fe [[Bravais lattice|face-centered cubic sublattice]] into which the S ions are embedded.

Also certain [[pnictide|dipnictides]] with ''X'' standing for [[phosphorus|P]], [[arsenic|As]] and [[antimony|Sb]] etc. are known to adopt the pyrite structure.&lt;ref name=Bres1994&gt;{{cite journal |title = Bonding Trends in Pyrites and a Reinvestigation of the Structure of PdAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PdSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PtSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PtBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal = Z.

In the first bonding sphere, the Fe atoms are surrounded by six S nearest neighbours, in a distorted octahedral arrangement. The material is a [[diamagnetic]] [[semiconductor]] and the Fe ions should be considered to be in a ''[[low spin]]'' [[divalent]] state (as shown by [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]] as well as XPS), rather than a [[tetravalent]] state as the stoichiometry would suggest.

The positions of ''X'' ions in the pyrite structure may be derived from the [[fluorite]] structure, starting from a hypothetical Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure. Whereas [[fluorine|F]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions in CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occupy the centre positions of the eight subcubes of the cubic unit cell ({{frac|1|4}} {{frac|1|4}} {{frac|1|4}}) etc., the S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions in FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are shifted from these high symmetry positions along &lt;111&gt; axes to reside on (''uuu'') and symmetry-equivalent positions. Here, the parameter ''u'' should be regarded as a free atomic parameter that takes different values in different pyrite-structure compounds (iron pyrite FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: ''u''(S) = 0.385 &lt;ref name=Stev1980&gt;{{cite journal|title = Experimental observation of the Effect of Crystal Field Splitting on the Electron Density Distribution of Iron Pyrite|journal = Inorg. Chem.|volume = 19|pages = 813–820|year = 1980|doi = 10.1021/ic50206a006|issue = 4|last1 = Stevens|first1 = E. D.|last2 = Delucia|first2 = M. L.|last3 = Coppens|first3 = P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The shift from fluorite ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.25 to pyrite ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.385 is rather large and creates a S-S distance that is clearly a binding one. This is not surprising as in contrast to F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; an ion S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is not a closed shell species. It is isoelectronic with a chlorine ''atom'', also undergoing pairing to form Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Both low spin Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the disulfide S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; moeties are closed shell entities, explaining the diamagnetic and semiconducting properties.

The S atoms have bonds with three Fe and one other S atom. The site symmetry at Fe and S positions is accounted for by [[crystallographic point group|point symmetry groups]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The missing [[centrosymmetry|center of inversion]] at S lattice sites has important consequences for the crystallographic and physical properties of iron pyrite. These consequences derive from the crystal electric field active at the sulfur lattice site, which causes a [[dipole#Atomic dipoles|polarisation]] of S ions in the pyrite lattice.&lt;ref name= BJPC1992&gt;{{cite journal|author = Birkholz, M. |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231101585 |title = The crystal energy of pyrite|journal = J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|volume = 4|pages = 6227–6240|year = 1992|doi = 10.1088/0953-8984/4/29/007|bibcode=1992JPCM....4.6227B|issue = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarisation can be calculated on the basis of higher-order [[Madelung constant]]s and has to be included in the calculation of the [[lattice energy]] by using a generalised [[Born–Haber cycle]]. This reflects the fact that the covalent bond in the sulfur pair is inadequately accounted for by a strictly ionic treatment.

Arsenopyrite has a related structure with heteroatomic As-S pairs rather than homoatomic ones. Marcasite also possesses homoatomic anion pairs, but the arrangement of the metal and diatomic anions is different from that of pyrite. Despite its name a chalcopyrite does not contain dianion pairs, but single S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; sulfide anions.

==Crystal habit==
[[File:Pyrite elbe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dodecahedron]]- shaped crystals from Italy.]]
Pyrite usually forms cuboid crystals, sometimes forming in close association to form raspberry-shaped masses called [[framboid]]s.  However, under certain circumstances, it can form [[Anastomosis|anastamozing]] filaments or T-shaped crystals.&lt;ref name="Bonev2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bonev | first1 = I.

Pyrite can also form almost perfect [[dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] shapes known as pyritohedra and this suggests an explanation for the artificial geometrical models found in Europe as early as the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;The pyritohedral form is described as a dodecahedron with [[pyritohedral symmetry]]; Dana J. et al., (1944), ''System of mineralogy'', New York, p 282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
[[Cattierite]] ([[Cobalt|Co]] [[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[vaesite]] ([[Nickel|Ni]] [[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are similar in their structure and belong also to the pyrite group.

Bravoite is a nickel-cobalt bearing variety of pyrite, with &gt;&amp;nbsp;50% substitution of [[nickel|Ni]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within pyrite. Bravoite is not a formally recognised mineral, and is named after Peruvian scientist Jose J. Bravo (1874–1928).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-759.html Mindat – bravoite]. Mindat.org (2011-05-18). Retrieved on 2011-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing similar minerals==
It is distinguishable from [[native gold]] by its hardness, brittleness and crystal form. Natural gold tends to be anhedral (irregularly shaped), whereas pyrite comes as either cubes or multifaceted crystals. Pyrite can often be distinguished by the striations which, in many cases, can be seen on its surface. [[Chalcopyrite]] is brighter yellow with a greenish hue when wet and is softer (3.5–4 on Mohs' scale).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerals.net/mineral/sulfides/pyrite/pyrite.htm Pyrite on]. Minerals.net (2011-02-23). Retrieved on 2011-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arsenopyrite]] is silver white and does not become more yellow when wet.

==Hazards==
[[File:GoldinPyriteDrainage acide.JPG|thumb|A pyrite cube (center) has dissolved away from a host rock, leaving behind trace gold.]]
Iron pyrite is unstable at Earth's surface: iron pyrite exposed to air and water decomposes into [[iron oxides]] and [[sulfate]]. This process is hastened by the action of ''[[Acidithiobacillus]]'' bacteria which oxidize the pyrite to produce ferrous iron and sulfate. These reactions occur more rapidly when the pyrite is in fine crystals and dust, which is the form it takes in most mining operations.

===Acid drainage===
[[Sulfate]] released from decomposing pyrite combines with water, producing [[sulfuric acid]], leading to [[acid rock drainage]]. An example of acid rock drainage caused by pyrite is the [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill]].

===Dust explosions===
Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently [[exothermic]] that underground [[coal mine]]s in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with [[spontaneous combustion]] in the mined-out areas of the mine. The solution is to [[Hermetic seal|hermetically seal]] the mined-out areas to exclude oxygen.{{citation needed|reason=the referenced book does not contain the word pyrite. And why would coal mines be relevant? &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roy, Coal Mining in Iowa, ''Coal Trade Journal'', quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=nH0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA609&amp;pg=PA613 History of Lucas County Iowa], State Historical Company, Des Moines (1881) pp. 613–615.&lt;/ref&gt;|date=November 2016}}

In modern coal mines, [[limestone]] dust is sprayed onto the exposed coal surfaces to reduce the hazard of [[dust explosion]]s.  This has the secondary benefit of neutralizing the acid released by pyrite oxidation and therefore slowing the oxidation cycle described above, thus reducing the likelihood of spontaneous combustion. In the long term, however, oxidation continues, and the [[hydrated]] [[sulfate]]s formed may exert crystallization pressure that can expand cracks in the rock and lead eventually to [[cave-in|roof fall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.coal.2005.03.013 |title=Colliery and surface hazards through coal-pyrite oxidation (Pennsylvanian Sydney Coalfield, Nova Scotia, Canada) |year=2005 |last1=Zodrow |first1=E |journal=International Journal of Coal Geology |volume=64 |pages=145–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyritised fossils==

However, ''pyrite dollars'' or ''pyrite suns'' which have an appearance similar to [[sand dollar]]s are [[pseudofossil]]s and lack the [[pentagonal]] symmetry of the animal.

'''Special fine paper''' is a classification of [[paper]] used for [[xerography|copying]] and [[digital printing]].&lt;ref name=WFC&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 39–40 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copy paper ==

Copy paper is used for copying and [[laser printer]]s. The [[grammage|basis weight]] is 70-90 g/m² (approximately 18-24 lb) and ISO brightness 80-96%. It is made of 90–100% virgin chemical [[pulp (paper)|pulp]] or 100% [[deinked pulp]] with total [[pigment]] content of 10-15%. The most important quality is smooth run in a copying machine / printer and good dimensional stability. It must not show curling or cockling, nor may it retain dust.

== Digital printing paper ==

Digital printing paper is also called ''electronic printing paper''. The basis weight is 40-400 g/m².{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This paper quality may be either [[coated paper|coated]] or uncoated. The demands of the paper may vary substantially depending on printing method: [[electrical charge]], [[thermal printing|thermal]], magnetic or [[ink-jet]]. All require good dimensional stability, no curling or cockling, good surface strength and surface smoothness. For ink-jet paper it is also important with sufficient and uniform [[porosity]] to counteract spreading of the [[ink]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4573">The '''Szyskowski Equation'''&lt;ref&gt;B. von Szyszkowski, Z. physik. Chemie, 64, 385 (1908)&lt;/ref&gt; has been used by Meissner and Michaels&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Meissner, A.S. Michaels, Surface Tension s of Pure Liquids and Liquid Mixtures", Ind. Eng. Chem., 41(12), 2782, (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the decrease in [[surface tension]] of aqueous solutions of [[carboxylic acid]]s, [[alcohol]]s and [[ester]]s at varying mole fractions. It describes the exponential decrease of the surface tension at low concentrations reasonably but should be used only at concentrations below 1 mole%.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Poling, John M. Prausnitz, John P. O’Connell, The Properties of Gases and Liquids, 5th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equation ==
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_m =\sigma_w\left(1-0.411\log\left(1+\frac{x}{a}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
with:
*σ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is surface tension of the mixture
*σ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is surface tension of pure water 
*''a'' is component specific constant (see table below)
*x is mole fraction of the solvated component

The equation can be rearranged to be explicit in ''a'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a&amp;=\frac{x}{10^{\left(-1+\frac{\frac{\sigma_m}{\sigma_w}-1}{-0.411}\right)}}\\
&amp;=x10^{\left(1+\frac{\frac{\sigma_m}{\sigma_w}-1}{0.411}\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This allows the direct calculation of that component specific parameter ''a'' from experimental data.

The equation can also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\gamma_0-\frac{RT}{\omega}\ln(1+K_{ad}c)&lt;/math&gt;
with:
*γ is surface tension of the mixture
*γ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is surface tension of pure water
*R is ideal gas constant 8.31 J/(mol*K)
*T is temperature in K
*ω is cross-sectional area of the surfactant molecules at the surface

The surface tension of pure water is dependent on temperature. At room temperature (298 K), it is equal to 71.97&amp;nbsp;mN/m &lt;ref&gt;NIST Chemistry WebBook http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4158">[[File:Tilttest.jpg|right|thumb|Tilt test on a ''fitting'' discontinuity.]]
In geomechanics, a '''tilt test''' is a simple test to estimate the shear strength parameters of a [[Discontinuity (geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]].&lt;ref name=hoekbray/&gt;&lt;ref name=qincruden/&gt; Two pieces of rock containing a discontinuity are held in hand or mounted in test equipment with the discontinuity horizontal. The sample is slowly tilted until the top block moves. The angle with the horizontal at onset of movement is called the ''tilt-angle''.

The size of the specimen is limited to 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm for hand-held tests, while machine-operated tilt test equipment may handle up to meter-sized samples. In the field, the angle can be determined most easily with an [[inclinometer]] as present in most [[compass|geological or structural compasses]].

==Tilt-angle==
The ''tilt-angle'' equals the material friction of the [[Discontinuity (geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] wall plus the roughness i-angle (''tilt-angle'' = ''φ&lt;sub&gt;wall material&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''i'') if no real cohesion is present (i.e. no cementing or gluing material between the two blocks), no infill material is present, the [[Asperity (geotechnical engineering)|asperities]] do not break, and the walls of the discontinuity are completely fitting at the start of the test, while if the walls of the discontinuity are completely non-fitting, the ''tilt-angle'' equals the friction of the material of the discontinuity walls (''tilt-angle'' = ''φ&lt;sub&gt;wall material&lt;/sub&gt;''). If cementation or gluing material is present or asperities break, the ''tilt-angle'' represents a combination of the (apparent or real) cohesion and the friction along the discontinuity. If infill material is present, the ''tilt-angle'' is governed partially or completely by the infill, depending on the thickness of the infill and height of asperities.&lt;ref name=Phien-wej/&gt;

[[Image:Hardwood Pores.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image (top) and Transmission Light Microscope image (bottom) of vessel elements in [[Oak]]]]

A '''vessel element''' or '''vessel member''' (trachea) is one of the cell types found in [[xylem]], the water conducting tissue of plants. Vessel elements (tracheae) are typically found in [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms) but absent from most [[gymnosperm]]s such as [[conifers]]. Vessel elements are the main feature distinguishing the "[[hardwood]]" of angiosperms from the "[[softwood]]" of conifers.

==Morphology==

[[Xylem]] is the tissue in [[vascular plant]]s which conducts water (and substances dissolved in it) upwards in a plant. There are two kinds of cell which are involved in the actual transport: [[tracheid]]s and vessel elements. Vessel elements are the building blocks of vessels, which constitute the major part of the water transporting system in those plants in which they occur. Vessels form an efficient system for transporting water (including necessary minerals) from the root to the leaves and other parts of the plant.

In secondary xylem – the xylem which is produced as a stem thickens rather than when it first appears – a vessel element originates from the [[vascular cambium]]. A long cell, oriented along the axis of the stem, called a "fusiform initial", divides along its length forming new vessel elements. The cell wall of a vessel element becomes strongly "lignified", i.e. it develops reinforcing material made of [[lignin]]. The side walls of a vessel element have [[pit (botany)|pits]]: more or less circular regions in contact with neighbouring cells. Tracheids also have pits, but only vessel elements have openings at both ends that connect individual vessel elements to form a continuous tubular vessel. These end openings are called perforations or perforation plates. They have a variety of shapes: the most common are the simple perforation (a simple opening) and the scalariform perforation (several elongated openings in a ladder-like design). Other types include the foraminate perforation plate (several round openings) and the reticulate perforation plate (a net-like pattern, with many openings).

At maturity the protoplast – the living material of the cell – dies and disappears, but the lignified cell walls persist. A vessel element is then a dead cell, but one that still has a function, and is still being protected by surrounding living cells.

==Evolutionary significance==

The presence of vessels in xylem has been considered to be one of the key innovations that led to the success of the flowering plants. It was once thought that vessel elements were an evolutionary innovation of flowering plants, but their absence from some basal [[angiosperms]] and their presence in some members of the [[Gnetales]] suggest that this hypothesis must be re-examined; vessel elements in Gnetales may not be homologous with those of angiosperms, or vessel elements that originated in a precursor to the angiosperms may have been subsequently lost in some basal lineages (e.g., [[Amborellaceae]], [[Tetracentraceae]], [[Trochodendraceae]], and [[Winteraceae]]), described by [[Arthur Cronquist]] as "primitively vesselless".  Cronquist considered the vessels of ''[[Gnetum]]'' to be convergent with those of angiosperms.

Vessel-like cells have also been found in the xylem of ''[[Equisetum]]'' (horsetails), ''[[Selaginella]]'' (spike-mosses), ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' (bracken fern), ''[[Marsilea]]'' and ''[[Regnellidium]]'' ([[aquatic fern]]s), and the enigmatic fossil group [[Gigantopteridales]].  In these cases, it is generally agreed that the vessels evolved independently.  It is possible that vessels may have appeared more than once among the angiosperms as well.

==World Bank Group==
The World Bank is different from the [[World Bank Group]], an extended [[family]] of five international organizations:

*[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD)
*[[International Development Association]] (IDA)
*[[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC)
*[[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] (MIGA)
*[[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID)

==History==
[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right| [[John Maynard Keynes]] (right) and [[Harry Dexter White]], the "founding fathers" of both the World Bank and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).&lt;ref name="Bretton Woods Founding Fathers 2004"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Founding Fathers | publisher = Internashittional Monetary Fund | url = http://jolis.worldbankimflib.org/Bwf/60panel3.htm | accessdate = 11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The World Bank was created at the 1944 [[Bretton Woods Conference]] along with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The president of the World Bank is, traditionally, an American.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', 17 March 2015, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/business/france-germany-and-italy-join-asian-infrastructure-investment-bank.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news "France, Germany and Italy Say They'll Join China-Led Bank"]&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank and the IMF are both based in Washington, D.C., and work closely with each other.
[[File:The Gold Room - Bretton Woods Mount Washington Hotel.jpg|thumb|The Gold Room at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] where the International Monetary Fund and World Bank were established]]
Although many countries were represented at the Bretton Woods Conference, the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] were the most powerful in attendance and dominated the negotiations.&lt;ref name="Goldman 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Imperial Nature: The World Bank and Struggles for Social Justice in the Age of Globalization | author = Goldman, Michael | year = 2005 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, CT | isbn = 978-0-300-11974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–54}} The intention behind the founding of the World Bank was to provide temporary loans to low-income countries which were unable to obtain loans commercially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Bank may also make loans and demand policy reforms from recipients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Early History|1944|1974|1944-1974}} 1944–1974===
Before 1974, the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small. The Bank's staff were aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank. [[Fiscal conservatism]] ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict criteria.&lt;ref name="Goldman 2005" /&gt;{{rp|56–60}}

The first country to receive a World Bank loan was France. The Bank's president at the time, [[John J. McCloy|John McCloy]], chose France over two other applicants, Poland and Chile. The loan was for US$250&amp;nbsp;million, half the amount requested, and it came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments. World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the [[United States State Department]] told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed. The French government complied and removed the [[Communist Party of Ghana|Communist]] [[coalition government]] - the so-called [[Tripartite system (politics)|tripartite]]. Within hours, the loan to France was approved.&lt;ref name="Bird 1992"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Chairman: John J. McCloy, the Making of the American Establishment | author = Bird, Kai | year = 1992 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schumpeter | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-671-45415-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|288, 290–291}}

When the [[Marshall Plan]] went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were [[Earmark (finance)|earmark]]ed for the construction of infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the [[International Development Association]] was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.

===1974–1980===
From 1974 to 1980 the bank concentrated on meeting the basic [[Need|needs]] of people in the [[Developing World|developing world]]. The size and number of loans to borrowers was greatly increased as loan targets expanded from infrastructure into social services and other sectors.&lt;ref name="World Bank Historical Chronology 1970-1979"&gt;{{cite web | title = World Bank Historical Chronology: 1970–1979 | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/847R4CBE80 | accessdate = 31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes can be attributed to [[Robert McNamara]], who was appointed to the presidency in 1968 by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Goldman 2005" /&gt;{{rp|60–63}} McNamara implored bank treasurer [[Eugene Rotberg]] to seek out new sources of capital outside of the northern banks that had been the primary sources of funding. Rotberg used the global bond market to increase the capital available to the bank.&lt;ref name="Rotberg 1994"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Financial Operations of the World Bank | author = Rotberg, Eugene | encyclopedia = Bretton Woods: looking to the future: commission report, staff review, background papers | year = 1994 | publisher = Bretton Woods Commission | location = Washington, D.C. | url = http://external.worldbankimflib.org/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/0/0/5/?searchdata1=219610%7Bckey%7D#_ | date =  | accessdate = 13 August 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160705163027/http://external.worldbankimflib.org/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/0/0/5/?searchdata1=219610%7Bckey%7D#_ | archivedate = 5 July 2016 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One consequence of the period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of [[developing countries' debt|third world debt]].

In 1980 the World Bank Administrative Tribunal was established to decide on disputes between the World Bank Group and its staff where allegation of non-observance of contracts of employment or terms of appointment had not been honored.&lt;ref name="World Bank Admin Tribunal 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = World Bank Administrative Tribunal | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/crn/wbt/wbtwebsite.nsf/%28resultsweb%29/about?opendocument | accessdate = 14 August 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111229110521/http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/crn/wbt/wbtwebsite.nsf/%28resultsweb%29/about?opendocument | archive-date = 29 December 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980–1989===
In 1980 McNamara was succeeded by US [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]'s nominee, [[Alden W. Clausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/aw-clausen-former-bank-of-america-chief-dies-at-89.html |date=25 January 2013 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |title=A.W.

His 1982 decision to replace the bank's Chief Economist, [[Hollis B. Chenery]], with [[Anne Krueger]] was an example of this new focus. Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing [[Third World]] governments as "[[rent-seeking]] states."

During the 1980s the bank emphasized lending to service Third-World debt, and [[structural adjustment]] policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations. [[UNICEF]] reported in the late 1980s that the structural adjustment programs of the World Bank had been responsible for "reduced health, nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of children in Asia, Latin America, and Africa".&lt;ref name="Cornia et al. 1987"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Adjustment with a Human Face: Protecting the Vulnerable and Promoting Growth | editor = Cornia, Giovanni Andrea | editor2 = Jolly, Richard | editor3 = Stewart, Frances | year = 1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press USA | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-19-828609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989–present===
Beginning in 1989, in response to harsh criticism from many groups, the bank began including environmental groups and NGOs in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the criticism.&lt;ref name="Goldman 2005" /&gt;{{rp|93–97}} It also formed an implementing agency, in accordance with the Montreal Protocols, to stop ozone-depletion damage to the Earth's atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95% of ozone-depleting chemicals, with a target date of 2015. Since then, in accordance with its so-called "Six Strategic Themes", the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For example, in 1991 the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.

In order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces. In 2000 the bank announced a "war on AIDS" and in 2011 the Bank joined the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership.&lt;ref name="World Bank Results 2012"&gt;{{cite web |title = Results|publisher = World Bank Group|author = World Bank|url = https://www.worldbank.org/results/|accessdate = 31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, based on a tacit understanding between the United States and Europe, the [[World Bank presidential election, 2012|president of the World Bank]] has always been selected from candidates nominated by the United States. In 2012, for the first time, two non-US citizens were nominated.

On 23 March 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced that the United States would nominate [[Jim Yong Kim]] as the next president of the Bank.&lt;ref name="Office of the Press Secretary 2012"&gt;{{Cite news | title = President Obama Announces U.S. Nomination of Dr. Jim Yong Kim to Lead World Bank | author = Office of the Press Secretary | date = 23 March 2012 | publisher = The White House | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/23/president-obama-announces-us-nomination-dr-jim-yong-kim-lead-world-bank | accessdate = 23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Yong Kim was elected on 27 April 2012.

====Criteria====
Various developments had brought the [[Millennium Development Goals]] targets for 2015 within reach in some cases. For the goals to be realized, six criteria must be met: stronger and more inclusive growth in Africa and fragile states, more effort in health and education, integration of the development and environment agendas, more as well as better aid, movement on trade negotiations, and stronger and more focused support from multilateral institutions like the World Bank.&lt;ref name="World Bank MDGs 2012"&gt;{{cite web |title = Millennium Development Goals|publisher = World Bank Group|author = World Bank|url = https://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/|accessdate = 31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger''': From 1990 through 2004 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from almost a third to less than a fifth. Although results vary widely within regions and countries, the trend indicates that the world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty. Africa's poverty, however, is expected to rise, and most of the 36 countries where 90% of the world's undernourished children live are in Africa. Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving under-nutrition.
# '''Achieve Universal Primary Education''': The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005. Still, about 72&amp;nbsp;million children of primary school age, 57% of them girls, were not being educated {{as of|2005|lc=y}}.
# '''Promote Gender Equality''': The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more women than men- worldwide more than 60% – are contributing but unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created to advance women's economic empowerment and promote shared growth.
# '''Reduce Child Mortality''': There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005; most of their deaths were from preventable causes.
# '''Improve Maternal Health''': Almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible.
# '''Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases''': Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen, but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In the eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above 15 percent. Treatment has increased globally, but still meets only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across countries). AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.6&amp;nbsp;million deaths in 2007). There are 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;million cases of malaria each year, leading to more than 1&amp;nbsp;million deaths. Nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.
# '''Ensure Environmental Sustainability''': Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of biological diversity, which continues to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.
# '''Develop a Global Partnership for Development''': Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development. Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs' realization.

To make sure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation, environmental, social and legal safeguards were defined. However, these safeguards have not been implemented entirely yet. At the World Bank's annual meeting in Tokyo 2012 a review of these safeguards has been initiated, which was welcomed by several civil society organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Most relevant review |author=Korinna Horta |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/world-bank-reviewing-its-social-and-environmental-safeguards-and-civil-society-organisations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
[[File:Jim Yong Kim (cropped).jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|Jim Yong Kim, the current President of the World Bank Group]]

The President of the Bank is the president of the entire [[World Bank Group]]. The president, currently [[Jim Yong Kim]], is responsible for chairing the meetings of the Boards of Directors and for overall management of the Bank. Traditionally, the President of the Bank has always been a US citizen nominated by the United States, the largest shareholder in the bank (the managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] having always been a European). The nominee is subject to confirmation by the Board of Executive Directors, to serve for a five-year, renewable term. While most World Bank presidents have had banking experience, some have not.&lt;ref name="Hurlburt 2012"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Why Jim Yong Kim would make a great World Bank president | author = Hurlburt, Heather | date = 23 March 2012 | newspaper = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/23/jim-yong-kim-world-bank-president | accessdate = 23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Bank Leadership 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Leadership | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/HWEWI4KIO0 | accessdate = 17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vice presidents of the Bank are its principal managers, in charge of regions, sectors, networks and functions. There are two Executive Vice presidents, three Senior Vice presidents, and 24 Vice presidents.&lt;ref name="World Bank Senior Management 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Senior Management | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/DHWEE5LGQ0 | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boards of Directors consist of the World Bank Group President and 25 Executive Directors. The President is the presiding officer, and ordinarily has no vote except a deciding vote in case of an equal division. The Executive Directors as individuals cannot exercise any power nor commit or represent the Bank unless specifically authorized by the Boards to do so. With the term beginning 1 November 2010, the number of Executive Directors increased by one, to 25.&lt;ref name="World Bank Boards of Directors 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Boards of Directors | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/LHHOT1LSW0 | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
{{Main article|List of World Bank members}}

The [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) has 189 member countries, while the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) has 173 members. Each member state of IBRD should be also a member of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and only members of IBRD are allowed to join other institutions within the Bank (such as IDA).&lt;ref name="Member Countries"/&gt;

===Voting power===
In 2010 voting powers at the World Bank were revised to increase the voice of developing countries, notably China. The countries with most voting power are now the United States (15.85%), Japan (6.84%), [[People's Republic of China|China]] (4.42%), Germany (4.00%), the United Kingdom (3.75%), France (3.75%), [[India]] (2.91%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Developing nations get more say in World Bank affairs|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Developing-nations-get-more-say-in-World-Bank-affairs/articleshow/5858176.cms|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Times of India|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia (2.77%), Saudi Arabia (2.77%) and Italy (2.64%). Under the changes, known as 'Voice Reform – Phase 2', countries other than China that saw significant gains included [[South Korea]], Turkey, [[Mexico]], Singapore, [[Greece]], Brazil, [[India]], and Spain. Most developed countries' voting power was reduced, along with a few developing countries such as [[Nigeria]]. The voting powers of the United States, Russia and [[Saudi Arabia]] were unchanged.&lt;ref name="IBRD Voting Power Realignment 2010"&gt;{{Cite report | title = IBRD 2010 Voting Power Realignment | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2010 | author = International Bank for Reconstruction and Development | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NEWS/Resources/IBRD2010VotingPowerRealignmentFINAL.pdf | accessdate = 14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Veloo 2010"&gt;{{Cite news | title = China given more influence in World Bank | author = Veloo, Betsy May | date = 26 April 2010 | publisher = RTHK | url = http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?main&amp;20100426&amp;56&amp;663699 | accessdate = 26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes were brought about with the goal of making voting more universal in regards to standards, rule-based with objective indicators, and transparent among other things. Now, developing countries have an increased voice in the "Pool Model", backed especially by Europe. Additionally, voting power is based on economic size in addition to International Development Association contributions.&lt;ref name="Stumm 2011"&gt;{{Cite news | title = World Bank: More responsibility for developing countries | author = Stumm, Mario | date = March 2011 | publisher = D+C | url = http://www.dandc.eu/articles/193054/index.en.shtml | accessdate = 12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of 20 largest countries by voting power in each World Bank institution==
The following table shows the subscriptions of the top 20 member countries of the World Bank by voting power in the following World Bank institutions as of December 2014 or March 2015: the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD), the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), the [[International Development Association]] (IDA), and the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] (MIGA). Member countries are allocated votes at the time of membership and subsequently for additional subscriptions to capital (one vote for each share of capital stock held by the member).&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/BODINT/Resources/278027-1215524804501/IBRDCountryVotingTable.pdf International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as of March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/BODINT/Resources/278027-1215524804501/IFCCountryVotingTable.pdf International Finance Corporation as of March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/BODINT/Resources/278027-1215524804501/IDACountryVotingTable.pdf International Development Association as of December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/BODINT/Resources/278027-1215524804501/MIGACountryVotingTable.pdf Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency as of December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poverty reduction strategies==
For the poorest [[Developing country|developing countries]] in the world, the bank's assistance plans are based on [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper|poverty reduction strategies]]; by combining a cross-section of local groups with an extensive analysis of the country's financial and economic situation the World Bank develops a strategy pertaining uniquely to the country in question. The government then identifies the country's priorities and targets for the reduction of poverty, and the World Bank aligns its aid efforts correspondingly.

Forty-five countries pledged US$25.1 billion in "aid for the world's poorest countries", aid that goes to the World Bank [[International Development Association]] (IDA), which distributes the loans to eighty poorer countries. While wealthier nations sometimes fund their own aid projects, including those for diseases, and although IDA is the recipient of criticism, Robert B. Zoellick, the former president of the World Bank, said when the loans were announced on 15 December 2007, that IDA money "is the core funding that the poorest developing countries rely on".&lt;ref name="Landler 2007"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Britain Overtakes U.S. as Top World Bank Donor | author = Landler, Mark | date = 15 December 2007 | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/15/world/15worldbank.html | accessdate = 14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Bank organizes [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award|Development Marketplace Awards]], a competitive grant program that surfaces and funds innovative, development projects with high potential for development impact that are scalable and/or replicable. The grant beneficiaries are social enterprises with projects that aim to deliver a range of social and public services to the most underserved low-income groups.

==Global partnerships and initiatives==
The World Bank has been assigned temporary management responsibility of the [[Clean Technology Fund]] (CTF), focused on making [[renewable energy]] cost-competitive with coal-fired power as quickly as possible, but this may not continue after UN's Copenhagen climate change conference in December 2009, because of the Bank's continued investment in [[coal-fired power plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Wheeler 2008"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Climate Change in Nashville: A Gathering Storm for the World Bank? | author = Wheeler, David | date = 20 May 2008 | publisher = Center for Global Development | url = http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2008/05/climate-change-in-nashville-a.php | accessdate = 9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[World Health Organization]], the World Bank administers the [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+). IHP+ is a group of partners committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. Partners work together to put international principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development cooperation into practice in the health sector. IHP+ mobilizes national governments, development agencies, civil society and others to support a single, country-led national health strategy in a well-coordinated way.

===Climate change===
World Bank President [[Jim Yong Kim]] said in 2012 that: 
:"A 4 degree warmer world can, and must be, avoided – we need to hold warming below 2 degrees&amp;nbsp;... Lack of action on climate change threatens to make the world our children inherit a completely different world than we are living in today. Climate change is one of the single biggest challenges facing development, and we need to assume the moral responsibility to take action on behalf of future generations, especially the poorest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Report Examines Risks of 4 Degree Hotter World by End of Century|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/11/18/new-report-examines-risks-of-degree-hotter-world-by-end-of-century|work=worldbank.org|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A World Bank report into [[Climate change]] in 2012 noted that (p. xiii): "Even with the current mitigation commitments and pledges fully implemented, there is roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100." This is despite the fact that the "global community has committed itself to holding warming below 2&amp;nbsp;°C to prevent 'dangerous' climate change". Furthermore: "A series of recent extreme events worldwide highlight the vulnerability of all countries&amp;nbsp;... No nation will be immune to the impacts of climate change."&lt;ref name= "Turn down the heat"&gt;[http://climatechange.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/Turn_Down_the_heat_Why_a_4_degree_centrigrade_warmer_world_must_be_avoided.pdf Why a 4 degree centrigrade warmer world must be avoided] November 2012 World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank doubled its aid for [[climate change]] adaptation from $2.3bn (£1.47bn) in 2011 to $4.6bn in 2012. The planet is now 0.8&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than in pre-industrial times. It says that 2&amp;nbsp;°C warming will be reached in 20 to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/06/19/what-climate-change-means-africa-asia-coastal-poor What Climate Change Means for Africa, Asia and the Coastal Poor] World Bank 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/19/climate-change-developing-countries-world-bank World's poorest will feel brunt of climate change, warns World Bank] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training wings==
===World Bank Institute===
The World Bank Institute (WBI) creates learning opportunities for countries, World Bank staff and clients, and people committed to poverty reduction and sustainable development. WBI's work program includes training, policy consultations, and the creation and support of knowledge networks related to international economic and social development.

The World Bank Institute (WBI) is a "global connector of knowledge, learning and innovation for poverty reduction". It aims to inspire change agents and prepare them with essential tools that can help achieve development results. 
WBI has four major strategies to approach development problems: innovation for development, knowledge exchange, leadership and coalition building, and structured learning. World Bank Institute(WBI) was formerly known as Economic Development Institute (EDI), established on 11 March 1955 with the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The purpose of the institute was to serve as provide an open place where senior officials from developing countries could discuss development policies and programs. Over the years, EDI grew significantly and in 2000, the Institute was renamed as the World Bank Institute. Currently Sanjay Pradhan is the Vice President of the World Bank Institute.&lt;ref name="World Bank Institute About 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = About WBI | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank Institute | url = http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | accessdate = 31 May 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120529155048/http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | archive-date = 29 May 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Development Learning Network===
The Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) is a partnership of over 120 learning centers (GDLN Affiliates) in nearly 80 countries around the world. GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues.

GDLN clients are typically NGOs, government, private sector and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively, and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconference-based activities a year on behalf of their clients, reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.

====GDLN Asia Pacific====
The GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate, or are planned in 20 countries: Australia, Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Japan, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Timor Leste, Fiji, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and New Zealand. With over 180 Distance Learning Centers, it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region. The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.

GDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLN's East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006. Its vision is to become "the premier network exchanging ideas, experience and know-how across the Asia Pacific Region". GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank. It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and, in accordance with the Charter, a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed.

The committee comprises China (2), Australia (1), Thailand (1), The World Bank (1) and finally, a nominee of the Government of Japan (1). The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific.

The Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a "Foundation". The World Bank is currently engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this legal status.

GDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand – Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.

===The JUSTPAL Network===
A Justice Sector Peer-Assisted Learning (JUSTPAL) Network was launched in April 2011 by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Department of the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region. The JUSTPAL objective is to provide an online and offline platform for justice professionals to exchange knowledge, good practices and peer-driven improvements to justice systems and thereby support countries to improve their justice sector performance, quality of justice and service delivery to citizens and businesses.

The JUSTPAL Network includes representatives of judiciaries, ministries of justice, prosecutors, anti-corruption agencies and other justice-related entities from across the globe. The Network currently has active members from more than 50 countries.

To facilitate fruitful exchange of reform experiences and sharing of applicable good practices, the JUSTPAL Network has organized its activities under (currently) five Communities of Practice (COPs): (i) Budgeting for the Justice Sector; (ii) Information Systems for Justice Services; (iii) Justice Sector Physical Infrastructure; (iv) Court Management and Administration; and (v) Prosecution and Anti-Corruption Agencies.

==Country assistance strategies==
As a guideline to the World Bank's operations in any particular country, a Country Assistance Strategy is produced, in cooperation with the local government and any interested stakeholders and may rely on analytical work performed by the Bank or other parties.

==Clean Air Initiative==
Clean Air Initiative (CAI) is a World Bank initiative to advance innovative ways to improve air quality in cities through partnerships in selected regions of the world by sharing knowledge and experiences. It includes [[electric vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Initiative 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = Clean Air Initiative-Asia Center | author = Clean Air Initiative | url = http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/aboutus | accessdate = 31 May 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100625070337/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/aboutus | archive-date = 25 June 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives like this help address and tackle [[List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]].

==United Nations Development Business==
Based on an agreement between the United Nations and the World Bank in 1981, ''[[Development Business]]'' became the official source for World Bank Procurement Notices, Contract Awards, and Project Approvals.&lt;ref name="Development Business 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = United Nations | author = Development Business | url = http://www.devbusiness.com/DevBusinessViewer.aspx?Content=AboutUNDBPage | accessdate = 19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the agreement was re-negotiated, and included in this agreement was a joint venture to create an electronic version of the publication via the World Wide Web. Today, ''Development Business'' is the primary publication for all major multilateral development banks, United Nations agencies, and several national governments, many of whom have made the publication of their tenders and contracts in ''Development Business'' a mandatory requirement.&lt;ref name="Development Business 2012" /&gt;

The World Bank or the [[World Bank Group]] is also a sitting observer in the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref name="UN Development Group 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = UNDG Members | publisher = United Nations | author = United Nations Development Group | url = http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 | accessdate = 19 August 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 | archivedate = 11 May 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open data initiative==
The World Bank collects and processes large amounts of data and generates them on the basis of economic models.

==Criticisms &amp; Controversy==
The World Bank has long been criticized by non-governmental organizations, such as the indigenous rights group [[Survival International]], and academics, including its former Chief Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Henry Hazlitt]] and [[Ludwig Von Mises]].&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 2003a"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Roaring Nineties: A New History of the World's Most Prosperous Decade | author = Stiglitz, Joseph E. | year = 2003 | publisher = W.

W. Norton &amp; Company | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-393-33028-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Hazlitt argued that the World Bank along with the monetary system it was designed within would promote world inflation and "a world in which international trade is State-dominated" when they were being advocated.&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 1984"&gt;{{Cite book | title = From Bretton Woods to World Inflation: A Study of the Causes and Consequences | author = Hazlitt, Henry | year = 1984 | publisher = Regnery Publishing | location = Washington, D.C. | isbn = 978-0-89526-617-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz argued that the so-called [[free market]] reform policies that the Bank advocates are often harmful to [[economic development]] if implemented badly, too quickly ("[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]"), in the wrong sequence or in weak, uncompetitive economies.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 2003b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider 2002"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = World Markets: Anthropological Perspectives | author = Schneider, Jane | encyclopedia = Exotic No More: Anthropology on the Front Lines | editor = MacClancy, Jeremy | year = 2002 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, IL | isbn = 978-0-226-50013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Carmine Guerriero]] notices that these reforms have introduced in developing countries regulatory institutions typical of the common law legal tradition because allegedly more efficient according to the [[legal origins theory]]. The latter however has been fiercely criticized since it does not take into account that the legal institutions transplanted during the European colonization have been then reformed.&lt;ref name="Guerriero 2016a"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Endogenous Legal Traditions | journal = International Review of Law and Economics | volume = 46 | year = 2016 | pages = 49–69 | author = Carmine Guerriero | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818816300011 | doi=10.1016/j.irle.2016.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue makes the legal origins theory's inference unreliable and the World Bank reforms detrimental.&lt;ref name="Guerriero 2016b"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Endogenous Legal Traditions and Economic Outcomes | journal = Journal of Comparative Economics | volume = 44 | year = 2016 | pages = 416–433 | author = Carmine Guerriero | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596715001274 | doi=10.1016/j.jce.2015.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the strongest criticisms of the World Bank has been the way in which it is governed. While the World Bank represents 188 countries, it is run by a small number of economically powerful countries. These countries (which also provide most of the institution's funding) choose the leadership and senior management of the World Bank, and their interests dominate the bank.&lt;ref name="Woods 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Globalizers: The IMF, the World Bank, and Their Borrowers | author = Woods, Ngaire | year = 2007 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, NY | isbn = 978-0-8014-7420-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190}} Titus Alexander argues that the unequal voting power of western countries and the World Bank's role in developing countries makes it similar to the South African Development Bank under apartheid, and therefore a pillar of [[global apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Alexander 1996"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | author = Alexander, Titus | year = 1996 | publisher = Polity | location = Cambridge, UK | isbn = 978-0-7456-1352-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–141}}

In the 1990s, the World Bank and the IMF forged the [[Washington Consensus]], policies that included [[deregulation]] and liberalization of markets, [[privatization]] and the [[civil service reform in developing countries|downscaling of government]]. Though the Washington Consensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development, it was criticized for ignoring equity, employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out. Joseph Stiglitz argued that the Washington Consensus placed too much emphasis on the growth of GDP, and not enough on the permanence of growth or on whether growth contributed to better living standards.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 2007" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

The [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] report criticized the World Bank and other international financial institutions for focusing too much "on issuing loans rather than on achieving concrete development results within a finite period of time" and called on the institution to "strengthen anti-corruption efforts".&lt;ref name="Committee on Foreign Relations 2010"&gt;{{Cite report | title = The International Financial Institutions: A Call For Change | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | date = 2010 | author = Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, 111th Congress | url = http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/55285.pdf | accessdate = 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]] has argued that the main effect of many development projects carried out by the World Bank and similar organizations is not the alleviation of poverty. Instead the projects often serve to expand the exercise of bureaucratic state power. Through his case-studies of development projects in [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] he shows that the World Bank's characterization of the economic conditions in [[Lesotho]] was flawed, and the Bank ignored the political and cultural character of the state in crafting their projects. As a result, the projects failed to help the poor, but succeeded in expanding the government bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|last2=Lohmann|first2=Larry|date=September–October 1994|title=The Anti-Politics Machine|url=http://stuz-muk.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ferguson-The-Anti-Politics-Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24|issue=5|pages=176–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of the World Bank and other organizations often takes the form of [[protesting]] as seen in recent events such as the [[World Bank Oslo 2002 Protests]],&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2002"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Europe: Norway: Protests As World Bank Meets | author = Gibbs, Walter | date = 25 June 2002 | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/25/world/world-briefing-europe-norway-protests-as-world-bank-meets.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Foreign%20Aid | accessdate = 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[October Rebellion]],&lt;ref name="Williams &amp; Ruane 2007"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Violence Erupts at Protest in Georgetown | author = Williams, Clarence | author2 = Ruane, Michael E. | date = 20 October 2007 | newspaper = The Washington Post | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/19/AR2007101901728.html | accessdate = 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|Battle of Seattle]].&lt;ref name="Wilson 1999"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Embattled police chief resigns | author = Wilson, Kimberly A.C. | date = 7 December 1999 | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | url = http://www.iatp.org/news/embattled-police-chief-resigns | accessdate = 19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such demonstrations have occurred all over the world, even among the Brazilian [[Kayapo people]].&lt;ref name="Clendenning 2008"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Amazon Indians Attack Official Over Dam Project | author = Clendenning, Alan | date = 21 May 2008 | agency = Associated Press | publisher = National Geographic | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/05/080521-AP-indians-dam.html | accessdate = 21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of criticism has been the tradition of having an American head the bank, implemented because the United States provides the majority of World Bank funding. "When economists from the World Bank visit poor countries to dispense cash and advice", observed ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2012, "they routinely tell governments to reject [[cronyism]] and fill each important job with the best candidate available. It is good advice. The World Bank should take it."&lt;ref name="The Economist 2012"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Hats off to Ngozi | date = 31 March 2012 | newspaper = The Economist | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21551490 | accessdate = 2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Yong Kim, a Korean-American, is the most recently appointed president of the World Bank.&lt;ref name="Rushe et al. 2012"&gt;{{Cite news | title = World Bank names US-nominated Jim Yong Kim as president | author = Rushe, Dominic | author2 = Stewart, Heather | author3 = Mark, Monica | date = 16 April 2012 | newspaper = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/16/world-bank-president-jim-yong-kim | accessdate = 17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural adjustment===
The effect of [[structural adjustment]] policies on poor countries has been one of the most significant criticisms of the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|title=Direct Action: An Ethnography|publisher=[[AK Press]]|pages=442–443|isbn=978-1-904859-79-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1979 energy crisis]] plunged many countries into economic crisis.&lt;ref name="deVries 1996"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = The World Bank's Focus on Poverty | author = deVries, Barend A. | encyclopedia = The World Bank: Lending on a Global Scale | editor = Griesgraber, Jo Marie | editor2 = Gunter, Bernhard G. | year = 1996 | publisher = Pluto Press | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-0-7453-1049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}} The World Bank responded with [[structural adjustment loan]]s, which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging [[production (economics)|production]], investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real [[exchange rates]] and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural adjustment loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.&lt;ref name="deVries 1996" /&gt;{{rp|69}}

By the late 1980s, international organizations began to admit that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises.&lt;ref name="deVries 1996" /&gt;{{rp|70}} In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans.&lt;ref name="Tan 2007"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = The poverty of amnesia: PRSPs in the legacy of structural adjustment | author = Tan, Celine | encyclopedia = The World Bank and Governance: A Decade of Reform and Reaction | editor = Stone, Diane | editor2 = Wright, Christopher | year = 2007 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-41282-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|147}} The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted as an extension of structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities. Neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries.&lt;ref name="Tan 2007" /&gt;{{rp|152}}

===Fairness of assistance conditions===
Some critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/sites/default/files/treacherousconditions07052003.pdf | title=Treacherous conditions: How IMF and World Bank policies tied to debt relief are undermining development | publisher=World Development Movement | year=2003 | accessdate=12 May 2013 | author=Hardstaff, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; most prominently the author [[Naomi Klein]], are of the opinion that the World Bank Group's loans and aid have unfair conditions attached to them that reflect the interests, financial power and political doctrines (notably the [[Washington Consensus]]) of the Bank and, by extension, the countries that are most influential within it. Among other allegations, Klein says the Group's credibility was damaged "when it forced school fees on students in Ghana in exchange for a loan; when it demanded that Tanzania privatise its water system; when it made telecom privatisation a condition of aid for Hurricane Mitch; when it demanded labour 'flexibility' in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami; when it pushed for eliminating food subsidies in post-invasion Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/27/comment.business | title=The World Bank has the perfect standard bearer | newspaper=The Guardian | date=27 April 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2013 | author=Klein, Naomi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sovereign immunity===
The World Bank requires [[sovereign immunity]] from countries it deals with.&lt;ref name="IFI Watch 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The World Bank and the Question of Immunity | journal = IFI Watch – Bangladesh | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | year = 2004 | pages = 1–10 | author = IFI Watch | url = http://www.unnayan.org/Other/IFI_Watch_Bangladesh_Vol_1%20No_1.pdf | accessdate = 4 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Bank Sovereign Immunity 2007"&gt;{{Cite report | title = Sovereign Immunity | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2007 | author = World Bank | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINFANDLAW/Resources/sovereignimmunity.pdf | accessdate = 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasson 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Extraterritorial Jurisdiction and Sovereign Immunity on Trial: Noriega, Pinochet, and Milosevic – Trends in Political Accountability and Transnational Criminal Law | journal = Boston College International and Comparative Law Review | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 | pages = 125–158 | author = Hasson, Adam Isaac | url = http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/iclr/vol25/iss1/6/ | accessdate = 25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sovereign immunity waives a holder from all legal liability for their actions.

'''Zinsco''' was a manufacturer of electrical [[Distribution board|distribution panels]] and [[Circuit breaker|circuit breakers]], founded by Emile Martin Zinsmeyer and his son Martin Emile Zinsmeyer in the early 1930s.

== History ==

Frank Adam Electric, a manufacturer of [[Distribution board|electrical panels]] and [[Circuit breaker|circuit breakers]], was founded in 1891 as part of the Blacker and Adam Watch Company in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1928, a young sales manager named Emile Zinsmeyer took charge of Frank Adam Electric's western division in Los Angeles. In the latter part of the [[Great Depression]], Emile negotiated to buy Frank Adam's west coast stock, forming Zinsmeyer Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nachi.org/forum/f19/zinsco-history-11816/ "A History of Zinsco Electric"], InterNACHI Forum, January 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Adam Electric would continue manufacturing panels and breakers through the 1950s, and they are now extremely rare.

Located at 729 Turner Street in Los Angeles, the Zinsmeyer Company would soon undergo some changes. Zinsmeyer employed two of his sons, Wilford, who went by Bill, and Martin.  In 1943, Martin bought the company from his father and renamed it Zinsco Electric.  Almost immediately, Zinsco began development of new panel and circuit breaker designs, with patent applications dating back to 1946. The first Zinsco panels contained copper bus-bars and copper breaker clips. Original breakers were patented in 1950 and labeled “Magnatrip.”  Five additional patents would be issued for subsequent designs. These early breakers employed copper bus-clips, which matched the copper bus-bars in these panels.

Prior to [[World War II]], the only permissible electrical conductors were copper, gold, and silver.  A copper shortage during the war promoted code changes.  Although aluminum was initially expensive to manufacture, advancements in the processing and production of aluminum wire made it available by 1942 and it was added to the National Electrical Code.  In 1952, the [[Korean War]] would cause another major copper shortage in the U.S. Although some companies, such as FPE and Square-D, continued to use an all-copper design, other manufacturers switched to an aluminum alloy for bus bars and breakers. Zinsco would remain with copper in both their panels and breakers until the third major copper shortage in the early 1960s, when they would switch to an aluminum bus. In 1963, Zinsco introduced the R-38 twin breaker, which was the only twin circuit breaker that also made contact on both bus-bars for 240 volts in a single breaker space. This made the Zinsco brand hugely popular with contractors and millions of Zinsco service panels and load centers were installed through the 60s and 70s.

In 1973, Martin Zinsmeyer sold the Zinsco Electric Company to [[GTE-Sylvania]].  During that ownership, the product line remained the same, with new labeling and branding, while dropping the “Magnatrip” label.  In 1978, the line changed names again, and was re-labeled Challenger.

By 1981, GTE-Sylvania divested itself of the electrical distribution business and sold off its product lines and manufacturing facilities. The Challenger line, mostly manufactured at the time in Jackson, Mississippi, was sold to a former officer of GTE, who used the Challenger name as the name of his new company, Challenger Electrical Equipment Corporation.

The new Challenger Brand immediately ceased production of any new Zinsco frame panels and load-centers, but still produced the re-branded Zinsco circuit breaker line. Challenger concentrated on a new line of panel equipment using the same bus configuration proven with Murray, Crouse-Hinds, and others. But, from 1982 until 1994, the 200-amp service panels used a Zinsco frame main breaker. Challenger flourished through the 80s, and was eventually received by Westinghouse in a multi-asset deal, in order for Westinghouse to sell its remaining electrical manufacturing facilities to Eaton Corporation in 1994.  Both Challenger and [[Thomas &amp; Betts]] (T&amp;B) had manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, where T&amp;B received the Zinsco circuit breaker molds. T&amp;B then continued to fabricate and sell the breakers under their own label, tripling the price at that time, from about $7.00 for the popular R-38 twin breaker to $19.00.  T&amp;B would eventually close the Zinsco circuit breaker production altogether in 2005. Today, [[Connecticut Electric]] continues making Zinsco replacement aluminum bus kits and breakers.

== Safety Concerns ==
The copper shortage of the 1960s was primarily caused by the US government, which had huge contracts out, many of which were for air-conditioning, requiring over a million new copper coils.  This action depressed the market of available copper for other manufacturing needs and promoted the first real demand for aluminum NM cable. When Zinsco changed to an aluminum bus, the aluminum selected was Alloy 6061.  First developed in 1935, Alloy 6061 is a good conductor, a hard aluminum, and still a popular alloy for welding today.  But in 1961, another aluminum alloy was developed: 6101.  This alloy has a higher tensile strength and is the best conductor for electrical use.  It is the aluminum used in the current aluminum busing of panels and load-centers.

But Alloy 6061 continued to be used, both in wiring and in electrical panels. From 1964 to 1972, 6061 aluminum wire and quick-wire receptacles were being installed in over two million homes, particularly tract homes. This wire was inferior, and the aluminum had tremendous expansion and contraction between power consumption and rest. Since power outlets were also constructed of dissimilar metals, the receptacles caused the aluminum to oxidize. Oxidization of aluminum creates aluminum oxide, which insulates rather than conducts. This caused numerous fires, outlet burn-outs, and nearly 100 deaths as published by the NFPA.  Because of this, aluminum wiring received a very bad reputation.

In 1972 aluminum was changed from an inferior product and into a modified allow.  Modern aluminum wire is an AA800 series alloy, which has a higher tensile strength, so it undergoes less expansion and contraction.  This change was also followed in the late 90s by COLAR-rated receptacles as a requirement in aluminum device wiring.  Since that time, aluminum for anything smaller than 8-gauge wiring has virtually disappeared.

Currently, Zinsco electrical equipment is considered obsolete due to a design flaw in which the circuit breaker's connection to the [[bus bar]] becomes loose, causing [[arcing]] and subsequent overheating. Long-term exposure to this heat can cause the breaker to fuse to the bus bar, making it impossible to remove. Even worse, it can cause the breaker's contacts to fuse together, thus preventing the breaker from tripping even in an overcurrent situation, thereby causing a potential [[fire hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://inspectapedia.com/electric/GTE_Sylvania_Kearney_Zinsco_Failure.php Mechanism of failure for Zinsco breakers]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replacement Parts ==

Aftermarket replacements for the Zinsco breakers are available; however, it may be more cost effective simply to replace the entire panel with a more modern and safer design from another manufacturer (such as Eaton, GE, Siemens, or Square-D), depending on the number of breakers to be replaced. If the bus bar shows signs of corrosion, or if any of the breakers show signs of overheating, the panel should be replaced entirely. Many electricians advocate replacement of the panel in any case, due to its historically poor reliability.
