The '''1979 [[Australian Rally Championship]]''' was a series of five [[rallying]] events held across Australia. It was the twelfth season in the history of the competition.

[[Ross Dunkerton]] and navigator Jeff Beaumont in the [[Datsun Stanza]] won the 1979 Championship.

==Season review==

The '''Bachar ladder''' is a form of rope ladder used as a training device by [[rock climbers]] to improve overall [[upper body strength]].&lt;ref name="Hill2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pete Hill|title=Indoor Climbing: Skills for climbing wall users and instructors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xW-r4gaP0gC&amp;pg=PA21|date=18 February 2013|publisher=Cicerone Press Limited|isbn=978-1-84965-858-4|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named after noted [[free solo]]ist [[John Bachar]],&lt;ref name="Robinson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria Robinson|title=Rock Climbing: The Ultimate Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7AI-9TQibsC&amp;pg=PA103|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37861-4|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bachar ladders typically consist of [[PVC]] rungs joined by webbing or cord to create an unstable structure similar to the [[ratlines]] of a sailing ship. However, unlike ascending ratlines leaning inward using one's legs for upward progress and arms for steadying, the Bachar Ladder is typically hung at an overhanging angle of 20-45° and climbed from below using only the arms.

Whereas the [[campus board]]&lt;ref name="Sagar2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather Reynolds Sagar|title=Climbing Your Best: Training to Maximize Your Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leWrToHGo04C&amp;pg=PA32|year=2001|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-2735-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses more on powerful, sometimes far reaching movements, the Bachar ladder differs in that it swings slightly when it is being climbed, requiring the climber to use more core tension to maintain stability.

For athletes who have practiced pulling movements using only fixed or stable points, the Bachar ladder can improve strength and efficiency of climbing/pulling movements. It produces greater engagement of core musculature, benefiting shoulder stability, improving [[motor unit recruitment]] when pulling and [[proprioception]]. It could present an increased risk of [[elbow]] and [[shoulder joint]] tendon/ligament injury for users who are inexperienced or lack proper pulling mechanics such as poor shoulder [[range of motion]].

There are two levels at which this degree is offered. Some Indian Institutes offer a 1 or 2-years '''B.P.Ed.''' which can be pursued only after graduation. While some Institutes offer a 3–4 years of '''B.P.E.''' which requires 10+2 as eligibility criteria.{{Cn|date = October 2015}}

The '''Commonwealth Games'''  are an international [[multi-sport event]] involving athletes from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The event was first held in 1930, and has taken place every four years since then.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Commonwealth Games were known as the '''British Empire Games''' from 1930 to 1950, the '''British Empire and Commonwealth Games''' from 1954 to 1966, and '''British Commonwealth Games''' from 1970 to 1974. It is the world's first multi-sport event which inducted equal number of women’s and men’s medal events and was implemented recently in the 2018 Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/news/cgf-announces-gold-coast-2018-will-be-most-gender-equal-major-multi-sports-event-history|title=CGF announces Gold Coast 2018 will be the most gender equal major multi-sports event in history|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their creation was inspired by the  [[Festival of the Empire#Inter-Empire Championships|Inter-Empire Championships]], as a part of the [[Festival of Empire]], which were held in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] in 1911. [[Melville Marks Robinson]] founded the games as the British Empire Games which were first hosted in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in 1930.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 20th and 21st centuries, the evolution of the games movement has resulted in several changes to the Commonwealth Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the [[Commonwealth Winter Games]] for snow and ice sports for the commonwealth athletes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cabinetroom.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/the-commonwealth-winter-games/|title=The Commonwealth Winter Games: Who Knew?|date=2014-02-05|work=cabinetroom|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Commonwealth Paraplegic Games]] for commonwealth athletes with a disability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disabilitysport.org.uk/commonwealth-paraplegic-games.html|title=Commonwealth Paraplegic Games|website=www.disabilitysport.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] for commonwealth athletes aged 14 to 18. The first edition of the winter games and paraplegic games were held in 1958 and [[1962 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games|1962]] respectively, with their last edition held in 1966 and [[1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games|1974]] respectively and the first youth games were held in [[2000 Commonwealth Youth Games|2000]]. The 1942 and 1946 Commonwealth Games were cancelled because of the [[World War II|second world war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/history-of-the-commonwealth/first-commonwealth-games|title=First Commonwealth Games {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=|first=|date=|website=thecommonwealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth Games are overseen by the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] (CGF), which also controls the [[Commonwealth Games sports|sporting programme]] and selects the host cities. The games movement consists of [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs), [[:Category:Commonwealth Games Associations|Commonwealth Games Associations]] (CGAs), and organising committees for each specific Commonwealth Games. There are several rituals and symbols, such as the Commonwealth Games flag and [[Queen's Baton Relay|Queen's Baton]], as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 5,000 athletes compete at the Commonwealth Games in more than 15 different sports and more than 250 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Commonwealth Games medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively. Apart from many [[Olympic sports]], the games also include some sports that are played predominantly in Commonwealth countries but which are not part of the Olympic programme, such as [[lawn bowls]], [[netball]] and [[squash (sport)|squash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harold |first=Perkin | authorlink = Harold Perkin |date=September 1989 |title=Teaching the nations how to play: sport and society in the British Empire and Commonwealth |journal=International Journal of the History of Sport |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=145–155 |doi=10.1080/09523368908713685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are currently 53 members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], 71 teams currently participate in the Commonwealth Games, as a number of dependent territories compete under their own flags. The four [[Home Nations]] of the [[United Kingdom]]—[[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]]—also send separate teams.

Nineteen cities in nine countries (counting England, Wales, and Scotland separately) have hosted the event. [[Australia]] has hosted the Commonwealth Games five times ([[1938 Commonwealth Games|1938]], [[1962 Commonwealth Games|1962]], [[1982 Commonwealth Games|1982]], [[2006 Commonwealth Games|2006]] and [[2018 Commonwealth Games|2018]]); this is more times than any other nation. Two cities have hosted Commonwealth Games more than once: [[Auckland]] ([[1950 Commonwealth Games|1950]], [[1990 Commonwealth Games|1990]]) and [[Edinburgh]] ([[1970 Commonwealth Games|1970]], [[1986 Commonwealth Games|1986]]).

Only six countries have attended every Commonwealth Games: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England]], [[New Zealand]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]]. Australia has been the highest achieving team for twelve games, England for seven, and Canada for one.

The [[2018 Commonwealth Games|most recent Commonwealth Games]] were held in [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] from 4 to 15 April 2018. The [[2022 Commonwealth Games|next Commonwealth Games]] are to be held in [[Birmingham]] from 27 July to 7 August 2022.

==History of the Games==

A sporting [[competition]] bringing together the members of the [[British Empire]] was first proposed by John Astley Cooper in 1900, when he wrote an article in ''[[The Times]]'' suggesting a "Pan-Britannic-Pan-Anglican Contest and Festival every four years as a means of increasing goodwill and good understanding of the British Empire". John Astley Cooper Committees were formed worldwide (e.g. Australia) and helped [[Pierre de Coubertin]] to get his international [[Olympic Games]] off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] (1986): War John Astley Cooper der Erfinder der modernen Olympischen Spiele? In: LOUIS BURGENER u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Sport und Kultur'', Bd. 6. Bern: Lang, 72 - 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, the [[Festival of the Empire]] was held at [[The Crystal Palace]] in London to celebrate the [[coronation]] of [[George V]]. As part of the [[Festival of the Empire]], an [[Festival of the Empire#Inter-Empire Championships|Inter-Empire Championships]] were held in which teams from Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom competed in athletics, boxing, wrestling and swimming events.

Canada won the championships and was gifted a silver cup which was 2 feet 6 inch high and weighed 340 oz (9.6 kg). It was gifted by [[Earl of Lonsdale|Lord Lonsdale]]. However, the 1911 championships were followed by the [[first world war]] which happened from 1914 to 1918. The organisers had lost hopes of hosting such sporting events for the empire athletes. 

[[Melville Marks Robinson]], who went to the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]] to serve as the manager of the Canadian track and field team, strongly lobbied for the proposal of organising the first British Empire Games in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in 1930.

The host city was&amp;nbsp;[[London]], with the main venue at&amp;nbsp;[[Wembley Park]], although the track cycling events were in&amp;nbsp;[[Manchester]]. The 1934 Games had originally been awarded to [[Johannesburg]], but were given to [[London]] instead because of serious concerns about prejudice against black and Asian athletes in [[South Africa]].  Seventeen national teams took part, including the [[Irish Free State]] (the only Games in which they did take part) and new participants [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[British Raj|India]], [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/games/london-1934|title=London 1934|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;[[1938 British Empire Games]]&amp;nbsp;were the third&amp;nbsp;[[British Empire Games]], which were held in&amp;nbsp;[[Sydney]],&amp;nbsp;[[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. They were timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia).&amp;nbsp;Held in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]] for the first time, the III Games opening ceremony took place at the famed [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in front of 40,000 spectators.

The&amp;nbsp;[[1950 British Empire Games]]&amp;nbsp;were the fourth edition and was held in&amp;nbsp;[[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] after a 12-year gap from the third edition of the games. The fourth games were originally awarded to&amp;nbsp;[[Montreal, Canada]]&amp;nbsp;and were to be held in 1942 but were cancelled due to&amp;nbsp;the [[Second World War]]. The opening ceremony at [[Eden Park]] was attended by 40,000 spectators, while nearly 250,000 people attended the Auckland Games. Twelve countries sent a total of 590 athletes to [[Auckland]]. [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Nigeria]] made their first appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/games/auckland-1950|title=Auckland 1950|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth edition of the games, the [[1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]], were held in&amp;nbsp;[[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. These were the first games since the name change from&amp;nbsp;[[British Empire Games]]&amp;nbsp;took effect in 1952. The fifth edition of the Games placed [[Vancouver]] on a world stage and featured memorable sporting moments as well as outstanding entertainment, technical innovation and cultural events. The ‘Miracle Mile’, as it became known, saw both the gold medallist, [[Roger Bannister]] of [[England]] and silver medallist [[John Landy]] of [[Australia]], run sub-four minute races in an event that was televised live across the world for the first time. [[Northern Rhodesia]] and [[Pakistan]] made their debuts and both performed well, winning eight and six medals respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/games/vancouver-1954|title=Vancouver 1954|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;[[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] were held in&amp;nbsp;[[Cardiff]],&amp;nbsp;[[Wales]].&amp;nbsp;The sixth edition of the games marked the largest sporting event ever held in Wales and it was the smallest country ever to host a British Empire and Commonwealth Games. [[Cardiff]] had to wait 12 years longer than originally scheduled to become host of the Games, as the 1946 event was cancelled because of the [[Second World War]]. The Cardiff Games introduced the&amp;nbsp;[[Queen's Baton Relay]], which has been conducted as a prelude to every British Empire and Commonwealth Games ever since. Thirty-five nations sent a total of 1,122 athletes and 228 officials to the Cardiff Games and 23 countries and dependencies won medals, including for the first time, [[Singapore]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] and the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/games/cardiff-1958|title=Cardiff 1958|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;[[1974 British&amp;nbsp;Commonwealth Games]]&amp;nbsp;were held in&amp;nbsp;[[Christchurch]],&amp;nbsp;[[New Zealand]]. The Games were officially named ''"the friendly games"''.&amp;nbsp;Following the [[1972 Munich attack|massacre of Israeli athletes]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Munich Olympics]], the tenth games at [[Christchurch]] were the first [[multi-sport event]] to place the safety of participants and spectators as its uppermost requirement. Security guards surrounded the athlete’s village and there was an exceptionally high-profile police presence. Only 22 countries succeeded in winning medals from the total haul of 374 medals on offer, but first time winners included [[Western Samoa]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/games/christchurch-1974|title=Christchurch 1974|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes with a disability were then first included in exhibition events at the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Ooyen and Justin Anjema |first1=Mark |last2=Anjema |first2=Justin |title=A Review and Interpretation of the Events of the 1994 Commonwealth Games |publisher=Redeemer University College |date=25 March 2004 |url=http://sporthamilton.com/content/histroy/1994commonwealthgames.pdf |accessdate=25 February 2012 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731114220/http://sporthamilton.com/content/histroy/1994commonwealthgames.pdf |archivedate=31 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]], they were included as full members of their national teams, making them the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games. This meant that results were included in the medal count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Para-sports for elite athletes with a disability|url=http://www.thecgf.com/sports/ead.asp|work=Commonwealth Games Federation website|accessdate=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130060533/http://thecgf.com/sports/ead.asp|archive-date=30 November 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2007 General Assembly of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] (CGF) at [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]], the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) and CGF signed a co-operative agreement to ensure a formal institutional relationship between the two bodies and secure the future participation of elite athletes with a disability (EAD) in future Commonwealth Games.

IPC President [[Philip Craven]] said during the General Assembly:
{{Quote box
| quote = “We look forward to working with CGF to develop the possibilities of athletes with a disability at the Commonwealth Games and within the Commonwealth. This partnership will help to galvanize Paralympic sports development in Commonwealth countries/territories and seek to create and promote greater opportunities in sport for athletes with a disability.”
| source = — IPC President [[Sir Philip Craven]]
}}
The co-operation agreement outlined the strong partnership between the IPC and the CGF. It recognized the IPC as the organization for overseeing the co-ordination and delivery of the Commonwealth Games EAD sports programme and committed both organizations to work together in supporting the growth of the Paralympic and Commonwealth Games Movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/press-release/ipc-and-cgf-sign-co-operative-agreement|title=IPC and CGF Sign Co-operative Agreement|website=www.paralympic.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winter Games ===

{{Main|Commonwealth Winter Games}}

[[File:StMoritz.jpg|thumb|[[St. Moritz]], the venue for all three Games from 1958-66]]

The [[Commonwealth Winter Games]] were a [[multi-sport event]] comprising [[winter sports]], last held in 1966. Three editions of the Games have been staged. The Winter Games were designed as a counterbalance to the Commonwealth Games, which focuses on summer sports, to accompany the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] and [[Summer Olympic Games]]. The winter Games were founded by [[T.D. Richardson]].&lt;ref name="Semanticus-Richardson"&gt;Semanticus.info, [http://semanticus.info/en/meaning/T-D-Richardson-27279302/ T.D.

=== Youth Games ===

{{main article|Commonwealth Youth Games}}

The Commonwealth Youth Games are an international [[multi-sport event]] organized by the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]]. The games are held every four years with the current Commonwealth Games format. The [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] discussed the idea of a Millennium Commonwealth Youth Games in 1997. In 1998 the concept was agreed on for the purpose of providing a Commonwealth multi-sport event for young people born in the calendar year 1986 or later. The first version was held in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] from 10 to 14 August [[2000 Commonwealth Youth Games|2000]]. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bendigo2004.thecgf.com/About_the_Games/|title=Commonwealth Youth Games - About the Games|website=bendigo2004.thecgf.com|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:London Shopping 002 (6166876525) (2).jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation|CGF]] at the Commonwealth House (centre) in [[London]]]]
The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is the international organisation responsible for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games and [[Commonwealth Youth Games]], and is the foremost authority in matters relating to the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/about/role.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation - The Role of The CGF|website=thecgf.com|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth House in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] hosts the headquarters of CGF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/contact|title=Contact Information|website=Commonwealth Games Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth House also hosts the headquarters of the [[Royal Commonwealth Society]] and the [[Commonwealth Local Government Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thercs.org/contact/|title=Contact {{!}} Royal Commonwealth Society|website=thercs.org|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clgf.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/|title=Contact us - CLGF|website=www.clgf.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth Games Movement is made of three major elements:

* [[List of international sport federations|International Federations]] (IFs) are the [[Sport governing body|governing bodies]] that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Basketball Federation ([[FIBA]]) is the international governing body for basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/contact/federations.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation - Sports Contacts|website=thecgf.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[:Category:Commonwealth Games Associations|Commonwealth Games Associations]] (CGAs) represent and regulate the Commonwealth Games Movement within each country. For example, the [[Commonwealth Games England]] (CGE) is the CGA of England. There are currently 70 CGAs recognised by the CGF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecgf.com/contact/cga.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation - CGA Contacts|website=thecgf.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organising Committees for the Commonwealth Games (OCCWGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organisation of each Commonwealth Games. OCCWGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the CGF.
English is the official language of the Commonwealth. The other language used at each Commonwealth Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these two (or more) languages, or the main depending on whether the host country is an English speaking country.

== Queen's Baton Relay ==

{{Main|Queen's Baton Relay}}

[[File:Bilston St.-Garrick St. - geograph.org.uk - 536739.jpg|thumb|The 2002 [[Queen's Baton Relay#Manchester 2002|Queen's Jubilee Baton Relay]] ]]

The Queen's Baton Relay, is a relay around the world held prior to the beginning of the Commonwealth Games. The Baton carries a message from the [[Head of the Commonwealth]], currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. The Relay traditionally begins at [[Buckingham Palace]] in [[London]] as a part of the city's [[Commonwealth Day]] festivities. The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner. At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games. The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the [[Olympic Torch Relay]].&lt;ref name="RelayTradition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qbr.melbourne2006.com.au/?s=tradition|title=Queen's Baton Relay: The tradition continues...|publisher=Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Corporation|accessdate=15 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211012817/http://qbr.melbourne2006.com.au/?s=tradition|archive-date=11 February 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Relay was introduced at the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. Up until, and including, the [[1994 Commonwealth Games|1994 Games]], the Relay only went through [[England]] and the host nation. The Relay for the [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998 Games]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] was the first to travel to other nations of the Commonwealth. The [[Queen's Baton Relay#Gold Coast 2018|Gold Coast 2018 Queen’s Baton Relay]] was the longest in Commonwealth Games history. Covering 230,000&amp;nbsp;km over 388 days, the Baton made its way through the six Commonwealth regions of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and Oceania. For the first time, the Queen's Baton was presented at the [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] during its [[2017 Commonwealth Youth Games|sixth edition]] in 2017 which were held in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1043876/design-and-route-for-gold-coast-2018-queens-baton-relay-revealed|title=Design and route for Gold Coast 2018 Queen’s Baton Relay revealed|date=2016-11-20|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceremonies ==

=== Opening ===

[[File:Comm Games 2006 finale.JPG|thumb|Opening ceremony of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] at [[Melbourne]]]]

Various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation, flag of the last hosting nation and the next hosting nation are also hosted during the opening ceremony. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Delhi Games reportedly cost $70&amp;nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/randomaccess/the-cwg-opening-show-reality-rs-350-crore/|title=The CWG opening show reality: Rs 350 crore|work=Times of India Blog|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. The last hosting nation is traditionally the first nation to enter. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetical or continental wise with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the [[Queen's Baton Relay|Queen's Baton]] is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final baton carrier, often a successful Commonwealth athlete from the host nation, who hands it over to the [[Head of the Commonwealth]] or their representative.

=== Closing ===

[[File:Commonwealth_Games_closing_ceremony_picture.jpeg|thumb|left|Closing ceremony of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] at [[Delhi]]]]

The closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. The president of the organizing committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed. The CGF president also speaks about the conduct of the games. The mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers the CGF flag to the president of the CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture. Many great artists and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games.

At the closing ceremony of every Commonwealth Games the CGF President makes an award and presents a trophy to one athlete who has competed with particular distinction and honour both in terms of athletic performance and overall contribution to his or her team. Athletes are nominated by their Commonwealth Games Association at the end of the final day of competition and the winner is selected by a panel comprising the CGF President and representatives from each of the six Commonwealth Regions. The ‘[[David Dixon Award]]’ as it is called was introduced in [[2002 Commonwealth Games|Manchester 2002]], after the late David Dixon, former Honorary Secretary of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation|CGF]], in honour of his monumental contribution to Commonwealth sport for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/search/oath.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation - Oath &amp; Award|website=thecgf.com|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medal presentation ===

A medal ceremony is held after each event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. After the medals are given out by a CGF member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medallist's country plays. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.

===Commonwealth nations yet to send teams===

Very few Commonwealth dependencies and nations have yet to take part:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpsu.org.uk/fileadmin/Gov_and_Demo/Widening_vs_Deepening.doc|title="The future of the modern Commonwealth: Widening vs. deepening?".

{{Div col}}
* [[Ascension Island]] and [[Tristan da Cunha]], former dependencies of [[Saint Helena]] and current parts of the British Overseas Territory of [[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]], have never formed their own teams independent from the Saint Helena team.
* Other states, territories and [[Autonomous region|territorial autonomies]] with native populations within the Commonwealth that may be eligible include [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] ([[States and territories of Australia|territories]] of Australia), [[Nevis]] (a federal entity of the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]), [[Rodrigues]] ([[Outer islands of Mauritius|outer islands]] of [[Mauritius]]), and [[Zanzibar]] (a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania).
* [[Cornwall]], represented by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid for participation in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application was rejected by the CGF, who stated that the [[constitutional status of Cornwall]] was not an issue that should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal challenge to the decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to follow their own criteria for participation. The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignkernow.com |title=Campaign Kernow |publisher=Campaign Kernow |date= |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] currently has no permanent population although there is a sizeable [[Chagossian|population]] who were ''born'' in the BIOT but currently live in [[Mauritius]] and the United Kingdom and so would be eligible to compete on birth criteria.
* [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] has made applications to the CGF to send teams.
* It is also conceivable that any future members of the Commonwealth such as [[Commonwealth of Nations#Applicants|applicants]] (for example [[South Sudan]], [[Sudan]] and [[Yemen]]) may participate in future games. The [[Colony of Aden]] and [[Federation of South Arabia]], precursors to modern Yemen, participated before in [[1962 Commonwealth Games|1962]] and in [[1966 Commonwealth Games|1966]]. Sudan was an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian protectorate]] until independence in 1956.
* The [[Pitcairn Islands]]' tiny population (currently 50 to 60 people) would appear to prevent this British overseas territory from competing.
* [[Tokelau]] was [[Tokelau at the Commonwealth Games|expected to take part]] in the [[2010 Commonwealth Games|2010]] Games in Delhi but did not do so.
* The lack of a permanent population would seem to prevent the British overseas territories of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] and [[British Antarctic Territory]], the New Zealand territory of [[Ross Dependency]] and the Australian external territories of [[Australian Antarctic Territory]], [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]], [[Coral Sea Islands]] and [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] from competing.

=== Host city contract ===

The [[1934 British Empire Games]], originally awarded in 1930 to [[Johannesburg]] was moved to [[London]] after South Africa's pre-apartheid government refused to allow nonwhite participants.&lt;ref name="Gorman2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b5DlxTDEIaYC&amp;pg=PA170|title=The Emergence of International Society in the 1920s|last=Gorman|first=Daniel|date=2012-07-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107021136|page=170|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2022 Commonwealth Games]] were originally awarded to [[Durban]] on 2 September 2015, at the [[Commonwealth Games Federation|CGF]] General Assembly in [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/34125467|title=Commonwealth Games: Durban confirmed as 2022 host city|date=2015-09-02|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in February 2017 that Durban may be unable to host the games due to financial constraints. On 13 March 2017, the CGF stripped Durban of their rights to host and reopened the bidding process for the 2022 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/39256432|title=Commonwealth Games: Durban, South Africa will not host Games in 2022|date=2017-03-13|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities from Australia, Canada, England and Malaysia expressed interest to host the games.

=== Boycotts ===

[[Nigeria]] boycotted the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]] at [[Edmonton]] in protest of [[New Zealand]]'s sporting contacts with [[apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]]. [[Uganda]] also stayed away, in protest of alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name="MacintoshHawes1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edmonton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecgf.com/games/intro.asp?yr=1978|title=Commonwealth Games Federation - 1978 Commonwealth Games - Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thecgf.com|access-date=2017-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414194244/http://thecgf.com/games/intro.asp?yr=1978|archive-date=14 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1986_Commonwealth_Games_(Edinburgh)_boycotting_countries_(red).png|thumb|upright=1.35|Countries boycotting the 1986 Games are shaded red]]
During the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] at [[Edinburgh]], a majority of the Commonwealth nations staged a boycott, so that the Games appeared to be a whites-only event. Thirty two of the eligible fifty nine countries—largely African, Asian and Caribbean states—stayed away because of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government's policy of keeping Britain's sporting links with [[apartheid South Africa]] in preference to participating in the general sporting boycott of that country. Consequently, Edinburgh 1986 witnessed the lowest number of athletes since Auckland 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/commonwealth-games/2014/16048-scottish-independence-referendum-will-increase-interest-in-glasgow-2014-it-is-claimed|title=Scottish independence referendum will increase interest in Glasgow 2014, it is claimed &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014|date=29 February 2012|publisher=insidethegames.biz|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycotting nations were [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bermuda]], [[Belize]], [[Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[The Gambia|Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guyana]], [[Grenada]], [[India]], [[Jamaica]], [[Kenya]], [[Malaysia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia|St. Lucia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Tanzania]], [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-20/news/mn-17233_1_commonwealth-games|title=8 More Nations Join Boycott of Commonwealth Games; Total Now 23|last=Reuters|first=From|date=1986-07-20|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda was a particularly late withdrawal, as its athletes appeared in the opening ceremony and in the opening day of competition before the Bermuda Olympic Association decided to formally withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Graham (2014-04-25).

=== Budget ===

The estimated cost of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Delhi]] were US$11 billion, according to ''[[Business Today (India)|Business Today]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/25/delhi-commonwealth-games-organiser-arrested|title=Delhi Commonwealth Games organiser arrested in corruption investigation|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2011-04-25|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial total budget estimated by the [[Indian Olympic Association]] in 2003 was US$250 million. In 2010, however, the official total budget soon escalated to an estimated US$1.8 billion, a figure which excluded non-sports-related infrastructure development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/108072/Sport/payoffs-&amp;-bribes-cast-a-shadow-on-cwg|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710055421/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/108072/Sport/payoffs-&amp;-bribes-cast-a-shadow-on-cwg|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 July 2012|title=Payoffs &amp; bribes cast a shadow on CWG: Sport : India Today|author1=Ravi Shankar|author2=Mihir Srivastava|date=7 August 2010|work=India Today|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Commonwealth Games are reportedly the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever.&lt;ref&gt;[[2006 Commonwealth Games|Melbourne 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable competitors==

Lawn bowler [[Willie Wood (bowler)|Willie Wood]] from [[Scotland]] was the first competitor to have competed in seven Commonwealth Games, from 1974 to 2002, a record equalled in 2014 by [[Isle of Man]] cyclist Andrew Roche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/26985985 |title=Glasgow 2014: Mark Cavendish relishes idea of racing with mates |date=10 May 2014 |accessdate=10 May 2014 |newspaper=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have both been surpassed by David Calvert of Northern Ireland who in 2018 attended his 11th games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commonwealth Games: TeamNI announced for Gold Coast 2018|url=https://www.portadowntimes.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games-teamni-announced-for-gold-coast-2018-1-8314625|accessdate=4 January 2018|work=[[Portadown Times]]|date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greg Yelavich]], a sports shooter from New Zealand, has won 12 medals in seven games from 1986 to 2010.

Lawn Bowler [[Robert Weale]] has represented Wales in 8 Commonwealth Games, 1986–2014, winning 2 gold, 3 silver and 1 bronze.

[[Nauru]]an weightlifter [[Marcus Stephen]] won twelve medals at the Games between 1990 and 2002, of which seven gold, and was elected [[President of Nauru]] in 2007. His performance has helped place Nauru (the smallest independent state in the Commonwealth, at 21&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and with a population of fewer than 9,400 in 2011) in nineteenth place on the [[all-time Commonwealth Games medal table]].

[[Ian Thorpe]], Australian swimmer (now retired), has won 10 Commonwealth Games gold medals and 1 silver medal. At the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], he won 4 gold medals. At the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Manchester]], he won 6 gold medals and 1 silver medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/search/legend.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation - Inspiring Athletes - Commonwealth Legend|website=thecgf.com|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''counter turn''' is a kind of one-foot turn in [[figure skating]].  Unlike [[3 turn|three turns]] and [[bracket turn|brackets]], where the entry and exit edges follow the same curve, in a counter the entry and exit are on opposite curves.  When executing a counter, the skater turns outward to the curve of the entry edge, and exits on a curve in the same sense as the turn.  Another way to look at it is that a counter is similar to the entry of a bracket turn combined with the exit of a three turn.  (The opposite combination is called a [[rocker turn]].) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sk8stuff.com/f_recog/recog_turns_1_foot.htm|title=Recognizing the 1-foot Turns|website=sk8stuff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While counters are sometimes used to perform a simple change of direction, they more commonly appear in step sequences and in compulsory dances in [[ice dancing]].  For example, in the Westminster Waltz, the lady performs a rocker while the man performs a counter turn. Counters also appear on the [[USFSA]]'s Novice-level [[moves in the field]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sk8stuff.com/f_rules/mif_test_elements_high.htm|title=MIF Test Elements (Interm-Senior)|website=sk8stuff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dells Raceway Park''' (DRP), formerly known as the '''Dells Motor Speedway''', is a [[car racing]] [[Race track|raceway]] located in the town of [[Lyndon, Juneau County, Wisconsin|Lyndon]], in [[Juneau County, Wisconsin|Juneau County]], north of [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]] just off of [[U.S. Route 12]]/[[Wisconsin Highway 16]]. It is a 1/3 mile asphalt track that is used for [[stock car racing]].&lt;ref name="Grubba" /&gt; The track has hosted races featuring the [[ARTGO]] Challenge Series, the [[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Midwest Series]], the [[ASA Midwest Tour]], the [[Mid-American Stock Car Series]], the Wisconsin Challenge Series, and the Must See Racing.com Xtreme Sprint Car Series.  The track, which opened in 1958, sits on {{convert|38|acre|m2}} of land.

The track closed during the middle of the 2006 season over a bank fraud case, but the track
was purchased during the following off-season by a group of three investors that included NASCAR driver and Dells area native [[Frank Kreyer]]. It reopened in 2007.&lt;ref name=portage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiscnews.com/pdr/sports/community/130029 |title=LOCAL AUTO RACING: 'New' DRP set to go |accessdate=2007-05-17 |last=Frandsen |first=Nate |work=[[Portage Daily Register]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Johnson, one of the original track owners, like to call the track "Home of the Biggies".&lt;ref name="Grubba"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Golden Age of Wisconsin Auto Racing |last=Grubba |first=Dale |year=2000 |publisher=Badger Books |location=[[Oregon, Wisconsin]] |isbn=1-878569-67-8 |page=173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The track has a reputation of being "what a short track should be."&lt;ref name="Grubba" /&gt; [[Dick Trickle]] described driving the track, "You drop low in the corners and then drift high on the straights. You try to make the track into the roundest oval possible."&lt;ref name="Grubba" /&gt;

==Track shutdown in 2006==
Bryan Severson, the owner of 5 County Towing in Reedsburg, bought the track from then owner Luke Herring in 2002.  During the 2006 season, the track was having financial difficulties with paying the drivers, and by mid-July Severson shut down the track after his arrest on federal charges of bank fraud.  Further investigation found that in 2002 and 2003, Severson had received bank loans from Mark Hardyman, the president of the First National Bank of Blanchardville, and used his towing business and Dells Raceway Park as collateral. To cover up the loans from the bank's board of directors, Severson had written several worthless checks worth millions of dollars.  The bank eventually did collapse in 2003. Severson was sentenced in February 2008 to nearly 12 years in federal prison after being convicted of 28 felony counts.  Severson was ordered to repay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation about $6.4 million that he was responsible for in the intended loss to the bank, less about $700,000 the FDIC received from another bank that bought some of Severson's loans which used the track as collateral.

==Lyle Nabbefeldt Memorial and special events==
The only fatality in the track's 50 plus year history occurred on May 26, 1973 when Wisconsin Rapids driver Lyle Nabbefeldt lost control of his car entering turn one during time trials, crashed into the outside wall and was killed instantly.  The Lyle Nabbefeldt Memorial began in 1974 as a tribute to the driver, and it became the Dells' annual marquee event until its last running in the late 1990s.  The first running of the event was a 100-lap feature, but the feature format was changed the next year to running two 55-lap features with an overall champion being declared.  The change was made to reflect the number 55s that Nabbefeldt ran throughout his racing career.  Another unique part of the Nabbefeldt Memorial was the winner's trophy, known as the Nabbefeldt Traveling Trophy.  The overall champion of the Nabbefeldt Memorial was allowed to keep the trophy until the following year's running of the race.  If any one driver was able to win the Nabbefeldt Memorial three years in a row, that driver would take permanent possession of the trophy and a new one would be introduced.  Dick Trickle won the event two years in a row on two occasions, but Rick Wateski is the only driver to have won the event three years in a row (1991/1992/1993).  Wayne Lensing, the current owner of Dells Raceway Park, announced that The Nabbefeldt Memorial was being revived for 2015, as part of a series of CWRA Challenge Series races.

The track also announced two new marquee Super Late Model events in 2015. The first event was the Icebreaker 100, an event held in April before other tracks opened. The second event was the Falloween 150, which was held in late October after all other late model events in the state of Wisconsin had concluded.

'''''EA Sports Active [[Training camp (National Football League)|NFL Training Camp]]''''' is an [[American football]]-based [[exergaming|fitness]] video game developed by [[EA Canada]] and published by [[EA Sports]] for the [[Nintendo]] [[Wii]]. The game was released on the same day as ''[[EA Sports Active 2]]''. The game has the [[National Football League]] license, which allows players to work out with any team and player of their choice, and was developed with the collaboration of various NFL strength and conditioning coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/ea/nfltrainingcamp?module=HP_spotlight |title=EA Sports NFL Training Camp |publisher=NFL.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is compatible with the [[Wii Balance Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mojo |url=http://www.nflshop.com/product/index.jsp?productId=10860090 |title=EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp Video Game for Wii |publisher=NFLShop.com |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[EA Sports Active|past]] [[EA Sports Active 2|two]] games, ''NFL Training Camp'' has "Total Body Tracking", which uses a heart monitor to measure the player's heart rate during play, along with a wireless motion tracker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.ea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=530677 |title=Touchdown!

==Gameplay==
In ''NFL Training Camp'', players perform  various drills that are commonly performed in the [[NFL Scouting Combine]], such as the [[40-yard dash]]. At the end of every drill, a graph appears to inform the player of how many calories he/she has burned throughout the course of the drill, as well as the median of the player's heart rate. Players are rewarded with points and achievements for their performance.&lt;ref name=GameSpot /&gt; In the game, the player can participate in the ''NFL Combine 60-Day Challenge'', which lets players work for four days per week for 60 days in the [http://www.nfl.com/combine/workouts drills] performed in the Combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stack |first=Kyle |url=https://www.wired.com/playbook/2010/11/total-body-tracking/ |title=EA Brings NFL Training Camp Into Your Home &amp;#124; Playbook |publisher=Wired.com |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Points and achievements that are earned by the player can be compared to other people who have played on the console, as well as people on the player's friend list. The game also has set up public groups for players to join, and players can contribute their stats to their team.&lt;ref name=GameSpot /&gt;

==Reception==
{{Video game reviews
| GSpot = 8.2/10
| rev1 = Operation Sports
| rev1Score = 7.5/10
}}
Operation Sports gave the game a 7.5/10, praising the drills, workouts, and equipment, but criticized the feedback and motion problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operationsports.com/reviews/581/ea-sports-active-nfl-training-camp/ |title=EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp Review (Wii) |publisher=Operation Sports |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fila, Inc.''' is an Italian sporting goods company founded in 1911 in Biella (Italy) and based in Seoul.

Fila was founded in 1911 in Italy. Since a purchase in 2007 by Fila Korea, the company is now owned and operated from [[South Korea]]. Headed by chairman and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Gene Yoon|Yoon-Soo Yoon]], Fila has offices in 11 countries globally.

== History ==
Fila was created in [[Biella]], [[Piedmont]], [[Italy]], by Giansevero Fila in 1911.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fila.com/customer-service/about-fila/history-of-fila.html |title=History |publisher=Fila |accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originally started by making clothing for the people of the Italian [[Alps]], now manufacturing sportswear for men, women, children and athletes.

The company's primary product was originally underwear, before moving into sportswear in the 1970s, initially with the endorsement of tennis player [[Björn Borg]]. The brand became more popular after moving into sportswear.

The original Italian ownership shop Holding di Partecipazioni sold the company to US [[hedge fund]] [[Cerberus Capital Management]] in 2003, after the company over-committed itself to expensive athletic endorsements, at a time when margins were under pressure. Cerberus owned Fila through holding company Sports Brands International, which owned and operated all Fila businesses around the world with the exception of Fila Korea, which was a separate company operating the brand under licence.

In January 2007, the global Fila brand and all its international subsidiaries were acquired by Fila Korea from SBI, which made it the largest South Korean sportswear company. Fila Korea currently holds all of the rights to the worldwide use of footwear and clothing brands of the parent firm.

In 2009, [[ANTA Sports]] acquired the rights to use the brand in China (the company "Full Prospect"), from [[Belle International]], Fila Korea still owned 15% shares of the joint venture company "Full Prospect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/20090812/LTN20090812546.pdf|title=DISCLOSEABLE TRANSACTIONS PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF FULL PROSPECT LIMITED AND FILA MARKETING (HONG KONG) LIMITED|date=12 August 2009|accessdate=29 March 2011|work=ANTA|publisher=Hong Kong Stock Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Fila Korea Ltd. acquired global golf equipment maker [[Acushnet Company]], becoming the new owner of leading golf brands such as [[Titleist]] for $1.23 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fila Korea buys Titleist for global expansion | date = 2011-05-21 | url = http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2011/05/21/0200000000AEN20110521001200320.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Denny | last = Thomas |author2=Robert MacMillan | title = Fila Korea buys Titleist golf company for $1.2 billion | date = 2011-05-20 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/20/us-fila-fortunebrands-idUSTRE74J2O520110520 | work = Reuter | accessdate = 2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Four Days in October''''' is a [[baseball]] [[documentary]] produced by [[ESPN]] and [[Major League Baseball|MLB Productions]].  It is episode 24 in the first season of the ESPN ''[[30 for 30]]'' series.

It chronicles the last four games of the [[2004 American League Championship Series|2004 American League Championship Series (ALCS)]] between the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] and the [[2004 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]. The series became famous when the Red Sox—who lost the first three games of the series to the Yankees—became the first team in [[Major League Baseball]] history&lt;ref group=note&gt;They were the third team in North American modern major professional sports to accomplish the feat, the other two instances being in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]—the [[1942–43 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Maple Leafs]] and the [[1974–75 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]]. Since then two other NHL teams—the [[2009–10 Philadelphia Flyers season|2010 Flyers]] and the [[2013–14 Los Angeles Kings season|2014 Kings]]—also overcame a 3-game deficit in a best of 7 series.&lt;/ref&gt; to win a best of seven playoff series after falling behind 0–3.

The documentary begins with few highlights of the [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry]] over the years and then some highlights from [[2004 American League Championship Series#Game 3|Game 3]], which was won by the Yankees 19–8 at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]]. The show's narrative begins with [[2004 American League Championship Series#Game 4|Game 4]]. The Yankees stood three outs away from sweeping the Red Sox at Fenway Park and advancing to their 40th World Series appearance. The series turned when the Red Sox rallied to tie the game in the 9th [[inning]]. They would win it on a [[home run]] by [[David Ortiz]] to keep the series alive. The ninth inning rally proved to be the turning point of the series, as the Red Sox would win the next four games, clinching the series at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;After 2008, the Yankees moved to a new ballpark also called Yankee Stadium. The ballpark used in [[2004 Major League Baseball season|2004]] was demolished in [[2010 Major League Baseball season|2010]] after the Yankees moved to a [[Yankee Stadium|new Yankee Stadium]] in [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later, the Red Sox won all four games against the [[National League]] (NL) [[2004 National League Championship Series|champion]] [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] to win their first [[World Series]] championship [[Curse of the Bambino|in 86 years]], ending the 2004 postseason on an eight-game winning streak.

While most of the commentary from the players in the documentary was done in the usual interview style that is customary of documentaries, [[Lenny Clarke]] and [[Bill Simmons]] were put in a pub setting, providing a conversation as fans, discussing their own experiences and feelings during the series.

'''Garra Blanca''' (literally white claw, but in this sense "garra" means force, so the translation is ''white force'') is the title given to a [[Barra brava]] that was created in [[Chile]] by the supporters of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] based [[association football|football]] club [[Colo-Colo]]. It is one of the three largest and most important barras bravas in the country, the other beings [[C.F. Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]]'s ''[[Los de Abajo]]'' (''those from below'') and [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|S.C.Universidad Catolica]] "Los Cruzados" ("The Cruzaders").

== History ==
In early 1986 a youth movement gave rise among the various supporters of Colo-Colo. Amid political repression during the [[military regime]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]], marginalized members of Chilean society decided to unite and form a voice of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} http://garra-blanca.cl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.todoalbo.cl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028101347/http://www.todoalbo.cl/ |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years the group has been associated with widescale violence. Fighting with security personnel, the Chilean national police, and other team barra bravas is a common occurrence. Garra Blanca leaders are reported to have an unofficial relationship with Blanco y Negro, the corporate entity that is in charge of Colo-Colo. The board of directors deny such an alliance and have only stated that the barra brava is recognized for stadium safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=276821 Ruiz-Tagle golpeó la mesa: "Blanco y Negro no tiene relación con la barra" | Emol.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George William Hall''' (March 29, 1849 &amp;ndash; June 11, 1923) was a professional [[baseball]] player who played in the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Players|National Association]] and later the [[National League]]. Born in [[Stepney]], England, Hall later immigrated to the U.S. He made his professional debut on May 5, 1871.&lt;ref name="retrosheet"&gt;{{cite web| title = George Hall's statistics | work = retrosheet.org | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/H/Phallg101.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

Hall began his professional career with the [[Washington Olympics]] of the National Association in {{Baseball year|1871}}, [[batting average|hitting]] .294 in 32 games. He moved onto the [[Baltimore Canaries]] for the {{Baseball year|1872}} and {{Baseball year|1873}} seasons, hitting .336 and .345 respectively.&lt;ref name="retrosheet"/&gt; Playing mostly [[Center fielder|center field]] up to this point, he moved around from center to [[right field]] the following year when he played for the {{Baseball year|1874}} Champions, the [[History of the Atlanta Braves#Boston years|Boston Red Stockings]].&lt;ref name="retrosheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1874standings"&gt;{{cite web| title = 1874 National Association Standings | work = retrosheet.org | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1874/Y_1874.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After just one season with the Red Stockings, he moved on to play for the [[Philadelphia Athletics (1860–76)|Philadelphia Athletics]] where he had another good season at the plate, hitting .299, and four [[home run]]s, which was good for second place behind [[Jim O'Rourke (baseball)|Jim O'Rourke]]'s six.&lt;ref name="1875leaders"&gt;{{cite web | title = 1875 National Association Leaders | work = baseball-reference.com | url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NA_1875_t.shtml | accessdate = 2007-12-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215012651/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NA_1875_t.shtml | archivedate = 2007-12-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National League==
[[File:George hall.jpg|thumb|200px|left]]
After the 1875 season, the National Association folded, which left room for a new league to begin.  In {{Baseball year|1876}}, the [[National League]] came into existence, the first official "Major League". Hall's team, the Athletics, followed that movement with very little success, finishing seventh out of eight teams.&lt;ref name="1876standings"&gt;{{cite web | title = 1876 National League Standings | work = baseball-reference.com | url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL_1876.shtml | accessdate = 2007-12-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212103916/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL_1876.shtml | archivedate = 2007-12-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the bright spots that year for the Athletics was the hitting prowess of their star hitter, Hall. He led the team in almost all major hitting categories including a .366 batting average, 51 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]], and a league leading five home runs.&lt;ref name="retrosheet"/&gt; On June 17, 1876, he became the first Major League baseball player to hit two home runs in one game.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Hall Chronology |work=baseballlibrary.com |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=George_Hall_1849&amp;page=chronology |accessdate=2007-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120120/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=George_Hall_1849&amp;page=chronology |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those five home runs stood as the single season home run record until [[Charley Jones]] hit nine in {{Baseball year|1879}}.

For the {{Baseball year|1877}} baseball season, Philadelphia had been expelled from the league for refusing to go on a western road trip, late in the 1876 season, for financial reasons, so Hall moved on to play for the [[Louisville Grays]]. Again, he had an excellent season, hitting .323, scoring 51 runs, and hitting 8 [[triple (baseball)|triples]]. Surprisingly, after appearing in the league leaders for home runs the last two seasons, he did not hit one in 1877.&lt;ref name="retrosheet"/&gt;

===Possible first cycle===
Some baseball researchers attribute Hall as being the first major league player to [[hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]].&lt;ref name=huber&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/june-14-1876-george-hall-gets-five-hits-it-cycle |title=June 14, 1876: George Hall gets five hits, but is it a cycle? |first=Mike |last=Huber |website=[[Society for American Baseball Research|SABR]] |accessdate=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/cycles_chron.htm |title=Cycles Chronologically |website=[[Retrosheet]] |accessdate=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds (1876–80)|Cincinnati Red Stockings]] on June 14, 1876, Hall had five hits.&lt;ref name=huber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18457466/base_ball/ |title=Base Ball |newspaper=[[The Boston Post]] |page=2 |date=June 15, 1876 |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary newspaper accounts agree that four of the hits were a home run, a single, and two triples; there is disagreement as to if the remaining hit was a double (which would complete the cycle) or another triple.&lt;ref name=huber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18457510/cincinnati_vs_athletic/ |title=Cincinnati vs. Athletic |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=5 |date=June 15, 1876 |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |via=newspapers.com |quote="Hall made a home run and three three-base hits."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first undisputed major league cycle is attributed to [[Curry Foley]] of the [[Buffalo Bisons (NL)|Buffalo Bisons]] of the National League in 1882.&lt;ref name=huber/&gt;

==Gambling scandal and banishment==
On October 26, 1877, Louisville club vice president Charles Chase confronted Hall and fellow Gray [[Jim Devlin]] with charges that they threw some road games in August and September. Both admitted only to throwing non-league games, one of which was an exhibition game in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], on August 30, and another in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], on September 3. The admissions also implicated teammates [[Al Nichols]] and [[Bill Craver]]. Hall claimed that he and Devlin helped in losses to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] on September 6 and to the [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] [[Indianapolis Blues]] on September 24‚ but he argued that since the Reds were about to be suspended and the games nullified‚ it amounted to an exhibition game.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; As a result of the [[1877 Louisville Grays scandal|scandal]], all four players were [[List of people banned from Major League Baseball|banned for life from Major League Baseball]].

Hall died in [[Ridgewood, Queens|Ridgewood, New York]], at the age of 74.  He was buried at [[Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn|Evergreen Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="retrosheet"/&gt;

The '''Grand Slam of Eventing''', sponsored by [[Rolex]], consists of three of the top [[Concours Complet International|CCI****]] equestrian [[eventing]] competitions in the world. [[Pippa Funnell]] in 2003 and [[Michael Jung (equestrian)|Michael Jung]] in 2016, are the only riders to have achieved the Grand Slam since its inception in 1999. To win the Grand Slam, a rider must consecutively win all three events, although they are permitted to ride different horses in each competition. This is especially important, since the Badminton Horse Trials is only one week after Kentucky, and the horse would not have sufficient time to recover between the two competitions, especially since they would have to be flown overseas in that time.

The three events that make up the Grand Slam are:
*Land Rover [[Kentucky Three-Day Event]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], United States
*Mitsubishi Motors [[Badminton Horse Trials]] in [[Gloucestershire, England]]
*Land Rover [[Burghley Horse Trials]] near [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], England

Winners receive an extra ${{formatnum:350000}}, in addition to their winnings from each event.

'''Heelys''', formerly known as Heeling Sports Limited, is a brand of [[roller shoe]] (marketed by [[Heelys, Inc.]]) that have one or more removable [[wheel]]s embedded in each [[Sole (shoe)|sole]], similar to [[inline skates]], allowing the wearer to walk, run, or, by shifting their weight to their heels, roll. Braking can be achieved by lowering the back of the foot so that sole contacts the ground.&lt;ref name="Vioreanu et al"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vioreanu|first=Mihai|last2=Sheehan|first2=Eoin|last3=Glynn|first3=Aaron|last4=Casidy|first4=Noelle|last5=Stephens|first5=Michael|last6=McCormack|first6=Damian|date=2007-06-01|title=Heelys and Street Gliders Injuries: A New Type of Pediatric Injury|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/6/e1294|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=119|issue=6|pages=e1294–e1298|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2882|issn=0031-4005|pmid=17545360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Adams patented Heelys in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://schoenenmetwieltjes.net/|title=Heelys shoes|last=Xan|first=Kiami|date=2 May 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2017|quote=Heelys in 1999 patented by Roger Adams and is to this day immensely popular today.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters are located in [[Carrollton, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4354874/ | title = Childhood passion grows into pop culture craze | first = Michael E. | last = Ross | publisher = [[msnbc.com]] | date = 2004-04-27 | accessdate = 2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injuries==
The journal of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] published a study&lt;ref name="Vioreanu et al" /&gt; of injuries resulting from the use of Heelys (and Street Gliders, a similar product that is strapped onto regular shoes). The study counted only significant injuries that required assessment by an orthopedic surgeon, ignoring minor injuries that were treated solely in the emergency department. The 10-week study (conducted during summer school holiday), found:

* An injury rate of approximately 51 injuries per 100,000 children (for injuries requiring orthopedic attention; the rate for less-serious injuries is unknown, but presumably much higher). For comparison, in 1997 the United States, nonfatal dog bites required 151 emergency department visits per 100,000 population (including adults).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safetypolicy.org/hp2010/15-30.htm|title=IPW: Healthy People 2010 Injury Prevention Objectives|last=Lawrence|first=David|website=www.safetypolicy.org|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 34% of the injuries were suffered by children using Heelys (or Street Gliders) for the very first time. 70% had used the products five or fewer times.
* The injuries comprised 8% of the workload for the pediatric orthopedic department.
* 12% of the injured children were familiar with the instructions for use of the products.
In February 2007, the [[Yeovil|Yeovil Town Council]] was the first English council to ban their use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-434676/Hilly-town-decides-Heelys-just-dangerous.html Hilly town decides Heelys are just too dangerous], [[Daily Mail]]. Retrieved July 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protective equipment==

The manufacturer says, "We highly recommend [the use of protective gear] when the wheels are in the shoes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shop.heelys.com/t/ShopFAQ|title=Heelys Shop. FAQs|website=shop.heelys.com|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most users do not wear protective gear because the shoes are worn for everyday use&lt;ref name="Vioreanu et al" /&gt; (unlike more specialized sporting equipment such as [[inline skates]]).

==Tricks==

Advanced Heelys users can perform tricks such as spins, backwards skating and skating on one foot.

There are four categories of tricks used in heeling: ground tricks, grinding tricks, stalling tricks and vert tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heelys.com/tricktionary-categories.aspx |title=Tricktionary |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425120410/http://www.heelys.com/tricktionary-categories.aspx |archivedate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ground tricks – the main category of tricks used in heeling.
* Grinds – these tricks can only be performed if the model has a nylon pad in the shoe, it involves jumping on a surface, landing on the nylon pad and sliding across the surface.
* Stalls – generally involves jumping onto a raised object and pausing before jumping off and heeling once more.
* Vert – any type of tricks performed on a [[vert ramp]].
* Flips - usually performed on a trampoline or off a high surface that has a soft surface under. Jump up and tuck just as a normal flip (try landing on wheels after feet).

==In popular culture==
* [[Arizona Robbins]] from ABC’s [[Grey's Anatomy]] frequently wore a pair of Heelys.
* [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] wore a pair of Heelys in the music video for [[U Don't Have to Call]].

'''Houston Driving Park''' also known as '''Harrisburg Park''' was a [[horse racing]] [[race track|track]] located in [[Houston|Houston's]] [[Magnolia Park, Houston|Magnolia Park]] neighborhood along Harrisburg Boulevard.  It was opened in 1902.

==Planning and construction==
In March 1902,  members of the Houston Driving Park Association and the Houston Country Club surveyed an area in Magnolia Park for the grounds of a new race track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A           Race Course. |publisher=‘’[[Galveston Daily News]]’’ |date=March 16, 2014 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity of 600,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Matinee Races |publisher=‘’[[Houston Post]]’’ |date=November 27, 1902 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; grandstands were erected and the park had opened by November 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harness Races Today |publisher=‘’[[Houston Post]]’’ |date=November 21, 1902 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Houston Lambs tenancy==
In June 1904, the Houston Driving Park Association began work to temporarily transform the race park into a ballpark for temporary use by the [[Houston Buffaloes|Houston Lambs]] (later known as the Houston Buffaloes) of the [[South Texas League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Ball Park |publisher=‘’[[Galveston Daily News]]’’ |date=June 19, 1904 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being evicted from [[Herald Park]], the ball club eventually played several games at the Houston Driving Park beginning with a game against the [[Galveston Pirates (baseball)|Galveston Sandcrabs]] on July 29, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At New Park |publisher=''[[Houston Post]]'' |date=July 30, 1904 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club received a new ballpark when [[West End Park (Houston)|West End Park]] opened the following season.

'''''Just Dance 2019''''' is a dance rhythm game developed by [[Ubisoft]]. It was unveiled on June 11, 2018, during its [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018|E3]] press conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-dance-2019-confirmed-at-e3-2018/1100-6459696/|title=Just Dance 2019 Confirmed at E3 2018|publisher=GameSpot|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on October 23, 2018 on [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Xbox 360]] in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-just-dance-2019-announced|title=E3 2018: JUST DANCE 2019 ANNOUNCED...AND IT'S STILL COMING TO THE WII|publisher=IGN|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamingunion.net/features/2018/e3-2018-highlights-ubisoft-press-conference|title=E3 2018 HIGHLIGHTS: UBISOFT PRESS CONFERENCE|publisher=Gaming Union|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also released on October 26, 2018 in Europe and Australia.&lt;ref name="ubisoft"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ubisoft - Just Dance 2019 |url=https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/just-dance-2019/ |website=Ubisoft |publisher=Ubisoft Entertainment |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A demo for the game was released on November 12, 2018 on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gonintendo.com/stories/322495-just-dance-2019-demo-now-available-on-switch|title=Just Dance 2019 demo now available on Switch|work=GoNintendo|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{furtherinformation|Just Dance (video game series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Just Dance series}}

As with the previous installments of the franchise, players must mimic the on-screen dancer's choreography to a chosen song using either motion controllers or the game's associated smartphone [[mobile app|app]] (which, however, is incompatible with versions of the game on Nintendo consoles, in favour of exclusively supporting [[Joy-Con]] or [[Wii Remote]]). The game's user interface received a significant redesign, with a focus on recommendations and curated playlists, and removing other modes to focus on core gameplay.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2019|title=Review: Just Dance 2019 - More Songs Than Ever Before, But A Few Bum Notes As Well|last=Life|first=Nintendo|date=2018-10-29|work=Nintendo Life|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''Nintendo Life'' gave ''Just Dance 2019'' a 7 out of 10, noting that its stripped-down experience was "a strange shift to behold, suggesting that the game is trying to adapt to a new [[Spotify]]-using, social media-loving, older teen audience, or maybe growing up alongside those who have supported it from the beginning", and also acknowledged Ubisoft's continued emphasis on pushing its subscription-based offerings for the franchise, as well as performance issues and the removal of ''Just Dance'' Controller app support on the Nintendo Switch version.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Kalevan Pallo (KalPa)''' is a professional [[ice hockey]] team which competes in the Finnish [[Liiga]]. They play in [[Kuopio]], [[Finland]] at the [[Niiralan monttu|Data Group Areena]].

==Team history==
Established in 1929 as ''Sortavalan Palloseura'' in [[Sortavala]], the club relocated to [[Kuopio]] in 1945 after its original hometown had been annexed by the [[Soviet Union]]. During its Sortavala years, the club was not active in ice hockey, but competed in [[association football]], [[bandy]], and [[pesäpallo]] instead. Ice hockey was introduced in 1947, and in 1956 KalPa officially replaced the more traditional Kuopio club [[KuPS]] in that sport thus specializing in hockey – minor league football was still continued until 1974 as a farm team of sorts for KuPS.

The full name of the company that runs the representative team today is ''KalPa Hockey Oy''. The majority of the company is owned by [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players [[Sami Kapanen]] and [[Kimmo Timonen]]. Kapanen is the majority owner, controlling 50.5% of the franchise. Timonen owns 8%, while Timonen's former teammate [[Scott Hartnell]] owns 5%. Hartnell purchased a minority share of the team after getting financial advice from Kimmo Timonen during a road trip to Boston.

During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], Timonen, Kapanen, and fellow NHL player [[Adam Hall]] were playing for KalPa. After winning the [[Mestis]] championship, KalPa returned to [[SM-liiga]] for the 2005–06 season, after being relegated six years earlier in 1999.

KalPa has won three medals: silvers in the 1990–91 and 2016–17 seasons and a bronze in the 2008–09 season.

The '''Kentucky International Convention Center''' (KICC), formerly called the '''Commonwealth Convention Center''', is a large multi-use facility in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], [[United States]]. It, along with the [[Kentucky Exposition Center]], hosts conventions for the Louisville area. It was built on the site of the [[Tyler Block]] and opened in 1977. The facility reopened in August 2018 after a two-year closure for a major expansion and renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/32765488/traffic-changes-coming-with-convention-center-construction |title=Traffic changes coming with convention center construction in downtown Louisville |publisher=[[WDRB]] |location=Louisville, KY |date=August 15, 2016 |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/38816601/kentucky-international-convention-center-to-re-open-on-monday |title=Kentucky International Convention Center to reopen on Monday |publisher=WDRB |location=Louisville, KY |date=August 5, 2018 |accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the convention center does not have a permanent [[arena]], it still has hosted various sporting events, including the 2002 [[Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]] and the [[NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament]] from 1995 to 2000. It also hosted select [[Louisville Cardinals women's basketball|University of Louisville women's basketball]] games from the 1989–90 season through 1992–93, and again in the 1994–95, 2000–01, and [[2008–09 Louisville Cardinals women's basketball team|2008–09]] seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guide.provations.com/louisville/womensbb2010#pg161 |title=Records: Home/Attendance |work=2010–11 Louisville Cardinals Women's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=University of Louisville Sports information |format=PDF |page=159 |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the exhibit halls was temporarily turned into an arena, with seats for about 7,000.

This facility is not to be confused with the [[Louisville Gardens]] which was called the Convention Center or the Louisville Convention Center in the 1960s and 1970s until the Kentucky International Convention Center was being built in 1975 when the Louisville Gardens received its current name.

'''Koho''' is a brand of [[ice hockey equipment]] that originated from [[Finland]]. Currently, Koho equipment is manufactured by [[The Hockey Company]] (parent company of [[CCM (The Hockey Company)|CCM]], now owned by [[Adidas]]).  Koho is especially known for its goaltending equipment. The main endorsees, instrumental to marketing the brand throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, included [[Arturs Irbe]], [[Patrick Roy]], [[Félix Potvin]], [[Jocelyn Thibault]], [[Tommy Salo]], [[Mathieu Garon]], [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère]] and [[Roberto Luongo]]. Although Koho had the support of high-profile endorsees such as [[Jaromír Jágr]], the player equipment lines were comparatively unsuccessful. The brand name is currently owned by [[MonkeySports]], which operates GoalieMonkey.com and Hockeymonkey.com. They are the exclusive retailer of the brand. 

==History==
Beginning in the early 1990s, Koho offered a line of goaltending equipment called Evolution. It was designed with former NHL goalie Bob Suave who at the time, worked for Koho. Arturs Irbe of the San Jose Sharks was well known for wearing this line of gear for many years. Later versions of Koho goal equipment were designed by goalie equipment guru [[Michel Lefebvre]], who started with the 530 series, which were based on the pad which was sold previously under the Lefebvre brand. Lefebrve, contracted now to develop pads to be sold exclusively through the Koho brand, designed the 560, 570, 580 and 590 series. Beginning with the 560 series, Koho pads were designed exclusively by Lefebvre, and the equipment line was designed for the butterfly style of play. The 590 was the last pad that Patrick Roy wore during the [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03 season]]. 

During the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], the original plan was to have Roberto Luongo premiere the Koho 600 pad. However, as a result of the unexpected purchase of The Hockey Company by Reebok, Luongo appeared in the World Cup wearing 590s. When The Hockey Company was purchased by Reebok, the Koho name was momentarily dropped and replaced by Reebok, with the intent of eventually phasing out the Koho name from its main product line. The Hockey Company did so previously with the Heaton brand, and would eventually do the same with the CCM goalie brand. Koho was then delegated to a price-point street hockey goalie equipment set, featuring the graphic of the 570. However, on Reebok's first goalie equipment lines, including the RBK Premier and RBK Premier 2, a small tag with the Koho by Lefebvre logo remained, as the names Koho and Lefebvre still had (and continue to have) residual market value. 

Initially, Rbk was used for the pro and intermediate pro lines of equipment, while Reebok was reserved for all other lines (senior, junior and youth). When Reebok discontinued the use of Rbk in 2008, the Rbk branding was dropped from the hockey equipment as well.  

When the NHL resumed play in the 2005–06 season following the lockout, only one goaltender, [[Maxime Ouellet]] of the [[Vancouver Canucks]], was using Koho equipment. Because the Koho name had been dropped by The Hockey Company, which consequently had not paid the NHL the appropriate licensing fees, the Koho name was not permitted to appear in a game or in any league or team media or promotional materials. Nonetheless, the Koho name remained on Ouellet's pads, which was an oversight by the league.

At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, [[Jonas Hiller]] of the [[Anaheim Ducks]] appeared in pre-season games in 580 leg pads, which were white and blue, matching the colors of his previous team, [[HC Davos]]. The Koho name had actually already been removed from Hiller's pads prior to the 2006 [[IIHF]] [[World Championships]]. By the start of the regular season, Hiller was wearing 580s in colors matching the Ducks' uniform colors. However, about halfway through the season, the logos were removed from his pads. 

In 2008, GoalieMonkey.com managed to bring back the Koho name to the retail market at least, producing a set with the name Koho 700. The set included pads, blocker, glove, chest protector and a composite goal stick. None of these products were actually designed by Lefebvre, however. They were a pad designed for the hybrid goaltender, but nevertheless feel very similar to the Lefebvre Koho lines, minus the traditional shin rolls, which were never a feature of Lefebvre's design. 

Meanwhile, Jonas Hiller began the 2008–09 season with 580s with no Koho logos. About halfway through the season, however, Hiller switched to a nearly identical pair of leg pads, this time featuring the Koho logos. This indicated that Monkey Sports, Inc. had successfully negotiated the licensing rights with the NHL, marking Koho's official return to the NHL. In 2009, rumors circulated that a new Koho pad, dubbed the "900" series, would be produced, in conjunction with Michel Lefebvre. At the start of the 2009–10 season, Hiller began play in his trademark 580s, along with a blocker and catching glove with custom Koho graphics, thus giving credence to earlier rumors of a new Koho pad. It was later revealed there was a new pad to match his blocker and catching glove but since Hiller had no time to break them in after receiving them after training camp, he stuck with his signature 580s. Hiller debuted the Koho 588 pad in the beginning of the 2010–11 season.

[[File:Terrasailing on the beach.jpg|right|thumb|Terrasailing on the beach]]
[[File:Aleksy 1.jpg|right|thumb|A turfdog land windsurfer.]]
'''Land windsurfing''', also known as “Terrasailing”, “street sailing”, “land sailing” and “dirt windsurfing”, is a sport similar to traditional [[windsurfing]] that is performed on land rather than water. A four wheeled deck, similar to a [[mountain board]] or [[skateboard]] deck, is commonly used in conjunction with a mast and sail in order to project the board across land.

==Equipment==
Several companies offer specially designed land boards which allow for easy coupling between the board and mast base of the sail. These boards are drilled with a special hole at the front of the deck that permits the application of the mast base to the board. Land boards equipped with all-terrain tires can be used on multiple ground types such as sand, grass, asphalt, and dirt. Most land boards require a minimum of a 5&amp;nbsp;mph wind speed in order to be propelled.  Wind speed requirements may vary depending on what ground type is being traversed. 

==Competitions==
Land windsurfing is an all-season sport and is often used by traditional windsurfers for training during winter months when waters become frigid. Advanced land windsurfing riders are able to perform technical freestyle tricks similarly seen in other [[extreme sports]]{{cn|reason=why is this regarded as extreme? source?|date=August 2018}} such as windsurfing, skateboarding and [[snowboarding]].
Land windsurfing marathons have been undertaken across the [[Sahara]] in 1979 by [[Arnaud de Rosnay]] and [[Nullarbor Plain]] in 1985 by [[Gavin Le Sueur]]

[[File:LandskronaIP 1923.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Landskrona IP around the inauguration in 1924]]
'''Landskrona IP''' (short for "''Landskrona Idrottsplats''", "Landskrona Sports Ground"), locally known as "I.P." the second home of [[Landskrona BoIS]] football club. The venue is owned by [[Landskrona|Landskrona Town]] but its only tenant is "BoIS", as the club is labeled locally. The arena was inaugurated in the summer of 1924, replacing the old Landskrona sports ground [[Banan (sports ground)|Banan]].

The stadium is almost only used for football, and after the strange demolition of the western stand in 2011, it holds approximately 10,000 attenders (of which 3500 are covered seats) The terraced stands on the north and east side has never had any roofs. Aside from Landskrona BoIS' home games, has one Swedish friendly cap been played at the arena, as well as some matches in the UEFA 1974 Youth tournament. Perhaps better known, is the fact that the arena hosted all of the [[Faroe Islands]] home qualifications games for the [[Euro 1992|UEFA Euro 1992]].

The stadium is located about 3–4&amp;nbsp;km from the town's center.

==History of the stadium==
===The Royal 1924 inauguration and its first decades ===
The venue was formally inaugurated by  [[Gustav VI Adolf|Crown Price Gustav Adolf]] who became King of Sweden 26 years later&lt;ref&gt;There ought to be an inline reference in the article [[Gustav VI Adolf]], but isn't... But he succeeded Gustav V in October 1950&lt;/ref&gt;
, in the summer of 1924.&lt;ref&gt;http://hd.se/landskrona/2011/02/14/nodhjalpsarbete-byggde-landskrona/{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "När folk väl intagit sina platser var det dags för dagens hedersgäster att anlända. Kronprins Gustaf Adolf och kronprinsessan Louise anlände i bil och hälsades välkomna av tillförordnade borgmästaren Johan Bjerstedt. Kronprisparet skrev sina namn på kalkstensplattor och visades sedan runt på området som redan då innehöll tennisbanor och näckrosdamm."&lt;/ref&gt; Landskrona IP replaced the old sports ground [[Banan (sports ground)|Banan]], where the pitch was in the middle of a simple cycling track.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arkivet-landskrona.se/mbilder/mbild08.htm{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the old sports ground from 1893,&lt;ref&gt;Please see article [[Banan (sports ground)]] for references&lt;/ref&gt; was "IP" located just east of the magnificent [[beech forest]] ''Karlslund'', some 3–4&amp;nbsp;km north of the town's centre. Almost at the countryside of 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Google Maps, search for "Landskrona, Sweden", look in the northern parts&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allsvenskan]], the Swedish top football league, began in 1924–25, with [[Landskrona BoIS]] as one of its twelve original clubs. The club had initially failed to qualify for the new national league. But much thanks to this new stadium which by 1924 standards was considered as modern and suitable for football, was '''BoIS''' ''given'' a place in the new league, which first was meant for ''Fässberg'', a club from a [[Gothenburg]] suburb which not even had a dressing room or bath/showers for the away team.&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), pages 88-94 , Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue was also suitable for primitive bicycle racing and perhaps also for [[Track and field]]. But the clay tracks which surrounded the pitch was shorter than the 400 meter Track and field standard. The southern grandstand had seats only, but the stand was originally only partly covered. At the northern side and behind the eastern curve terraces was constructed of earthwork stones and some concrete. Parts of the eastern curve simple was earthwork with grass on. In the western curve was no stands of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;See the aerial photo of the venue around its inauguration in 1924&lt;/ref&gt; 
During the spring of 1939 was the entire seating grandstand covered, but this meant nothing for the total attendance capacity, which remained to be around 10.000.&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History),Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958 to 1970, the Era of BoIS' Allsvenskan qualifications===
[[File:Landskrona IP in 1950s.JPG|thumb|left|Photo of the north terraces stand during the late 1950s. Below the stand, at the running tracks, several bench rows have been provided. The upper part of the stand was divided in two sections until 1972. The changing rooms and showers for players and the referees was located behind this stand. A kind of mobile fenced corridor prevented the crowd to reach the players]]
Sometime between the BoIS 1952-53 ditching down to the third tier of Swedish football,&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, page 187-196&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1958 qualification match for Allsvenskan against [[Örgryte IS]],&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, page 216-235&lt;/ref&gt; was the northern terraced stand enlarged by a slightly steeper stainless steel &amp; wood section, on top of the concrete and earthworks, which next to doubled the crowd capacity of that stand.&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), by studying pictures from this 547 pages of work, can it be safe to say that the enlargement of the northern terraces at least existed during the autumn of 1958,  Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landskrona BoIS was a top club most years from the late 1950s to 1970, but failed to reach Allsvenskan in the qualification games in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, page 216-235&lt;/ref&gt; 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, same pages as for 1958&lt;/ref&gt; 1962&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, pages 236-246&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, pages 255-262&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1970 did the club finally return to the finest Swedish football assembly through a successful qualification.&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, pages 263-272&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period from the mid 1950s and 15–20 years ahead, did much happen in the world of football. During this time, did Landskrona IP not only see the current attendance record, but attendances close to, or above 10.000 became regular. Between 1958 and 1977 did Landskrona IP welcome crowds of around 10.000 or more, at some 20-25 occasions, and in ''at least'' nine of those occasions were the attendance also above 15.000.&lt;ref&gt;Please see below the headline "Attendances and attendances records", where inline sources are also given&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A football team's history),Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}, 547 pages (A4 or folio size),- gives no specific list of attendances only, however in writing are lots of attendances mentioned, for the mentioned period pages 236-246 &amp; 255-305. Digging at https://www.allsvenskan.se/tabell/arkiv-1977/
(for in this case year 1977, arkiv-1977) reveal attendances of 9000+ at several, in Åke Jönsson's book unmentioned attendances. Like BoIS-IFK Göteborg in 1977 (9000+), BoIS-Hammarby 1971 (10000+), in all safe to say 20-25 occasions with attendances close to or above 10.000&lt;/ref&gt;  
It was also during the late 1950s in which the all-time attendance record was set. During a qualification game for [[Allsvenskan]] in 1959, as 18 535 spectators turned up for the event.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish, last row of the "Allmän information &amp; statistik" headline " - "publikrekord på Idrottsplatsen är 18 535 åskådare och sattes i kvalmatchen mot Degerfors 1959." at http://www.landskronabois.com/klubben/historia/&lt;/ref&gt; Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, crowds of 15,000 were not uncommon, and occurred even when Landskrona BoIS played in Sweden's second-tier league.

In the mid 1960s the four floodlight pillars were first erected. But some of them fell during a hurricane just a year or two later. When they were re-erected, they became secured by a system of steel cables.

===The new Grandstand, 1973===
[[File:Landskrona IP.JPG|thumb|The 1973 Grandstand, here with extended roof and seats instead of the original wooden benches with backrests]]

After the last Allsvenskan home game in 1972 was the southern grandstand seater demolished, and at the opening home game of the 1973 season was a new modern concrete Grandstand with 4000 seats opened instead.&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}, page 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mobil.svenskafans.com/fotboll/15526.aspx#.WRCTBLiB2Hs&lt;/ref&gt; The new stand had approximately 2200 covered seats and 1800 seats without any cover. For extraordinary interesting matches, temporary benches were usually placed at the clay tracks, this allowed a total of close to 6000 sitting attenders.

The 1973 building of the new grandstand is the most expensive and significant improvement of Landskrona IP ever.

Until 1989, the arena had clay tracks for athletics (and originally also for cycle races, though it has never been anything like a velodrome). The stadium was rather useless for athletics, as the tracks were both narrow and notably shorter than the optimal 400 meters, and the throwing events were held behind the stadium, if any athletic competition ever was held at IP. The running tracks were mainly used by nearby schools. (While the pitch naturally was off-limits for all but football players)

===The 1990 &amp; 1991 reconstruction===
[[File:LandskronaIP seater from 1973.jpg|thumb|LandskronaIP seater from 1973, got an extended roof in 1995. The entire stand has a slightly oval shape]]
In 1990 the owner, [[Landskrona|Landskrona Town]], removed the tracks after requests by Landskrona BoIS. And a few hundred meters away, a good facilities for athletics was constructed. The 1973 seater stand now turned out to be a bit longer than the pitch and quite a few seats was removed for this reason and due to bad sight.

Behind both short sides of the stadium lower wooden terraces were mounted behind the short sides. And in the following year, 1990, the northern long side terrace stand, whose lower part was built of a combination of earthwork, stone and concrete and its upper part of wood, was replaced by a concrete terrace stand (which is possible to transform into an all-seater stand, although this never has been done at Landskrona IP, but the same construction was used at [[Olympia (Helsingborg)|Olympia]], in neighbouring city [[Helsingborg]] 1985-2000, and i a minor extent also between 2001 and 2015, and there has the terraces at several occasions been transformed into all-seater stands).

The reconstruction was an improvement, seen from most angles. But it really was an insufficient action, partly due to the very low terraces behind the goals but mainly due to the complete lack of roofs and other weather shields at the three terraced sides. And from now on was the maximum capacity reduced to around 11.000.

In the following year, 1991, was the northern terraces replaced with a new concrete terrace stand of equal height as the old one, but it had fewer steps. The demolition of the old northern stand also meant the last parts of the original stands from 1924, now was forever gone. A wooden building behind that stand survived for many years however, but as of May 2017 are the only artifacts remaining from 1924 two flagpoles and the arch which constituted the entrance. It no longer does, but is still there, and most of the spectators who pay ground attendance fee do still walk through the arch.

===Third Millennium===
[[File:The Old Entrance Arch at Landskrona I.P.jpg|thumb|right|The old entrance Arch at Landskrona IP. Many ground fee attenders do still walk through the Arch, but the new entrance is to the right, just a bit behind the Arch. It's the last remaining larger artifact from the 1924 inauguration. Until 1972 were the seat tickets sold in the two (closed) hatches]]
Before the 1998 season had Landskrona municipality in mind to build a roof on top of the northern long side terraces, however the new board with ''Kenneth Håkansson'' as chairman, argued that the money was needed elsewhere. The knowledge of this decision among the supporters was next to none at the time. 
Generally has the football attenders in Sweden never been listened to, but with knowledge of the local climate is it very hard to comprehend this decision. As an example was a possible beating of the 1959 attendance record, mentioned i the local newspapers before the Landskrona BoIS vs [[Malmö FF]] meetings in 1975, 1976 and 1977. In 1975 came 17.696 &lt;ref&gt;http://allsvenskamff.blogspot.se/search/label/1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobil.svenskafans.com/fotboll]/15526.aspx#.WRCTBLiB2Hs&lt;/ref&gt; in excellent weather (less than 900 away from a new record), but due to some rain did only 13.758 turn up for the 1976 meeting&lt;ref&gt;http://allsvenskamff.blogspot.se/search/label/1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobil.svenskafans.com/fotboll]/15526.aspx#.WRCTBLiB2Hs&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 fell rain all afternoon as well as during most of the match. And the attendance only reached 10.849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobil.svenskafans.com/fotboll]/15526.aspx#.WRCTBLiB2Hs&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone knows the significance of a good environment for the crowds (such as roofs and wind shields), but even when ''the owner'' of the venue, (Landskrona Town, as mentioned earlier), wanted to improve the spectator facilities, did the 1998-2014 leadership disagree. And since 1998 has many thousands of attenders "rained away" at Landskrona IP.

Just before Landskrona BoIS' 2002 return to Allsvenskan, was two concrete terraces (without roofs, "naturally") taken in use at the eastern side, together with two temporary rented larger steel &amp; wood constructions behind the opposite goal. But these were initially intended for the season premiere only, and was removed afterwards. Also, a few more seats vanished, as the original benches were substituted with individual seats.  
The 2002 season opening was the first Allsvenskan match at Landskrona IP since 1994. The guesting team was no other than '''HIF''' or more formal, [[Helsingborgs IF]], the together with '''MFF''' or [[Malmö FF]] the angriest rivals possible for '''BoIS''', at 6.April.2002 in front of 11.909, which ended with the astonish result of 6-2 for BoIS ! &lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 396&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2002 season premiere was the temporary stands behind the western goal removed. After '''the police''' simply had to close the gates to the absolutely packed stadium against [[AIK]] that same year (at 8.July.2002 after 10.181 spectators had entered the venue),&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}, page 401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allsvenskan.se/tabell/arkiv-2002/&lt;/ref&gt; did the mobile stands return to Landskrona IP. After that match did the board apologise to the sponsors, whose advertising had been drawn down by the police, in order for more of the paying attenders, to be able to see something. But the board never apologised to the paying attenders, who couldn't see much. This was a hinch of how the still rather new chairman of the board made his priorities.
In the spring of 2003 did Landskrona BoIS themselves pay for a permanent western concrete terrace. (All other stands are owned by Landskrona Town).

However, before the 2011 season the club replaced the western stand with a building. And as of May 2017, the venue still lacks cover of the northern and eastern terraces, and there is no attendance possible behind the western side.&lt;ref&gt;Picture at [https://www.google.se/search?q=landskrona+ip&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=cl1A_jK6WPpZ4M%253BAAAAAAAAAAABAM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fsv.wikipedia.org%25252Fwiki%25252FLandskrona_IP&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=cl1A_jK6WPpZ4M%252CAAAAAAAAAAABAM%252C_&amp;usg=__-NIdlAYkGCNUfLsBdlv75SPD814%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzrMbWzNzTAhXiFZoKHaDiAGcQuqIBCHkwDg&amp;biw=1691&amp;bih=947#imgrc=i54AWsJb4J2oAM:], the stand which between 2003 and 2010 was located behind the western goal can be seen here [https://www.google.se/search?q=landskrona+ip&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=cl1A_jK6WPpZ4M%253BAAAAAAAAAAABAM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fsv.wikipedia.org%25252Fwiki%25252FLandskrona_IP&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=cl1A_jK6WPpZ4M%252CAAAAAAAAAAABAM%252C_&amp;usg=__-NIdlAYkGCNUfLsBdlv75SPD814%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzrMbWzNzTAhXiFZoKHaDiAGcQuqIBCHkwDg&amp;biw=1691&amp;bih=947#imgdii=9Z5jNmIvmAxtiM:&amp;imgrc=i54AWsJb4J2oAM:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presented ideas of rebuilding the stadium - or to build a brand new one===

By 2005, Landskrona BoIS presented a reconstruction of all uncovered terraces and replacing the northern stand with an all-seater stand. Total capacity would be 12.000. But as Landskrona BoIS got relegated from Allsvenskan down to Superettan, the idea vanished.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svenskafans.com/fotboll/112947.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The former chairman (1998-2014), ''Kenneth Håkansson'' had plans for a very fashionable and luxury, but indeed tiny, new stadium which included a tall hotel in Landskrona's harbour area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landskronadirekt.com/2014/09/02/ekonomi-stoppade-dromarena-i-centrum/&lt;/ref&gt; But as that initially secret idea reached the members and supporters of the club, did it not receive much positive criticism. Soon afterwards did the main private financier jump off the project. The intended venue was in most minds far too small (only meant for 6000) and far too expensive as well as being located at a very windy location. Also, Kenneth Håkansson, who initially did very well for the club, began to estimate the need for ''the future attendance capacity'', solely based on the very latest statistics, instead upon historical facts. Or at least, it did certainly appear to be so.&lt;ref&gt;Compare page 1 of this PDF [http://np.netpublicator.com/np/n06191509/LP20110203.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} with [https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/bois-vill-ha-ny-arena?regionalmeny=1] and with [http://www.landskronadirekt.com/2014/09/02/ekonomi-stoppade-dromarena-i-centrum/], arena capacities for 12000, 10000 and 6000 are all mentioned - also see chapter "Attendance and attendance records" further down in this article&lt;/ref&gt;

===The alleged need of artificial turf===

Just before the 2011 season, the western concrete terrace (built in as late as in 2003, and which at least gave shadow for its spectators during games played in hot summer days) was removed and a temporary building has prevented spectators from watching the game from that view ever since.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hd.se/2011-02-18/laktare-far-ge-plats-for-restaurang&lt;/ref&gt; During the autumn of 2013, the board and previous chairman of the club announce, "Due to the need of ground heating, the natural grass also needs to be replaced with [[artificial turf]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hd.se/2013-09-18/landskrona-ip-far-konstgras&lt;/ref&gt; which indeed seemed strange as stadiums with artificial turf are not called for in the [[Scania]]n climate. An alleged investigation, made by Landskrona BoIS former leading, meant that this was a necessity for the 2014 season, which caused a storm of protests from supporters of the club as well as others.&lt;ref&gt;September 2013 {{cite web|url=http://hd.se/landskrona/2013/09/24/supporteruppror-mot-konstgras-pa/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317015423/http://hd.se/landskrona/2013/09/24/supporteruppror-mot-konstgras-pa/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;October 2013http://hd.se/landskrona/2013/10/13/bois-medlemmar-protesterar/&lt;/ref&gt; And in November 2013 the municipality council instead decided to invest in ground heating, but rejected the idea of artificial turf.&lt;ref&gt;Entire part http://www.landskronadirekt.com/arkivet/nyheter/1343.htm#131021_4 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220427/http://www.landskronadirekt.com/arkivet/nyheter/1343.htm |date=2014-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the "investigation" was presented, it soon was revealed that the heating costs for natural grass were included, but excluded for the "artificial turf alternative". Further, some of the outgoing figures was based "on a few phone-calls".

''And how the annual the costs of a grass pitch for football could be almost as expensive as keeping the 36 greens of Landskrona Golf Club open the entire year, including some 3-5 annual snowfalls, nobody from the former club leading could explain''.

Eventually the leading local politicians did agree with the large number of supporters (as well as others), and did not gave their permission for an artificial turf, as the former Club board had requested. On 14 April 2014, the second ever natural grass pitch at the football stadium at Landskrona IP was inaugurated, with ground heating beneath.

==International games at the venue==

=== Sweden vs Estonia in 1929 ===
Sweden has once played a home cap at Landskrona IP, against Estonia on 7 July 1929; the result was 4-1, and several [[Landskrona BoIS]] players were on the pitch. This was however during the time when the former ''committee of national-team selected players''&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; mostly was regional (for this match the committee was composed mainly of journalists from the Malmö newspaper [[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]]) &lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History),Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;*/&lt;/math&gt;The precise ''name'' of these committees are not formally known even in Swedish."''Uttagningskommitén''" is used in the source.

=== 1974 UEFA Youth tournament ===
This tournament for boys up to the age of 17 was hosted by southern Sweden (all games played in [[Scania]] or [[Blekinge]]). Two games were played at Landskrona IP. The Group D game, between Sweden and Portugal (which ended in a 1:0 Swedish victory) and one of the semi-finals was played at Landskrona IP. In the latter the former Yugoslavia defeated Greece 1:0.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/ec-u18-74.html&lt;/ref&gt; All 4000 seats were sold and equally split in two halves. But the approximately 12,000 ground attendance terraces were open for local residents only, but very few of them arrived at "IP" this rainy day, 29.May.1974. The Yugoslavian goal came late in the match, and the posse of police dogs was put in action.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish morning newspaper "Nordvästra Skånes Tidningar", 30 May 1974, page 1 and sport pages&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faroe Islands Euro 1992 qualification home ===
During the qualification for the [[Euro 1992]], [[Faroe Islands]] participated for the first time in international football. A problem for them was that no [[UEFA]]-approved grass pitch arena existed at this North Atlantic country.
For unknown reasons Faroe Islands then chose Landskrona IP as their temporary home ground. Their first opponents were Austria, a team who were expected to win against this small nation, who were new to international football, but Faroe Islands won their first ever competition game 1:0 "home" at Landskrona IP, on 12 September 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1992/matches/round=218/match=2963/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a fast decision, to build a usable home ground in [[Thorshavn]] within weeks. However UEFA decided that it would not be fair for the other national teams to have to play at the new stadium at Faroe Islands, hence another three international competition games were played at Landskrona IP, against  [[Denmark]], [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1992/matches/round=218/match=2963/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendances and attendance records==
[[File:Landskrona vs. AIK 1962.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Landskrona BoIS playing a qualification game for Allsvenskan in 1962 at home against AIK. Attendance 16.010.&lt;ref name="aik.se"&gt;http://www.aik.se/fotboll/statistik/matches.php?seasonid=148&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the goal, the old eastern terraces]]
Allsvenskan began in August 1924, some of the early attendance records at Landskrona IP were

* '''1.000''' (approximately) at 10.August.1924, Landskrona BoIS - [[IFK Göteborg]] in [[Allsvenskan]] &lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History),Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; The very first league game at Landskrona IP. 
* '''1.800''' (approximately ?) at 17.August.1924,&lt;ref&gt;Date - http://www.worldfootball.net/all_matches/swe-allsvenskan-1924-1925/&lt;/ref&gt; Landskrona BoIS - [[Helsingborg IF]] in Allsvenskan &lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}, page 96, date not mentioned&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''2.315''' at 28.September.1924, Landskrona BoIS - [[AIK]] in Allsvenskan &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aik.se/fotboll/statistik/matches.php?id=153&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''3.600''' at 10.August.1925, Landskrona BoIS - Helsingborg IF in Allsvenskan &lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History),Swedish {{ISBN|978-91-639-2503-0}}, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''5.500''' at 22.August.1926, Landskrona BoIS - Helsingborg IF in Allsvenskan&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 99&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''6.859''' at 30.October.1927, Landskrona BoIS - Helsingborg IF in Allsvenskan&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 107&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''10.124''' at 26.May.1929, Landskrona BoIS - Helsingborg IF in Allsvenskan&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later this year as the [[Wall Street Crash]] occurred, which possibly could have affected the rising interest for football. In any case did the 1929 attendance record last for almost thirty years. A period of poor results for Landskrona BoIS began during the 1940s and continued during the early 1950s. And Landskrona BoIS even was relegated to the third tier of the Swedish football system during the 1952-53 season&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 512&lt;/ref&gt; This "third tier season" became however something of a taking charge for the future season. And as Landskrona BoIS had returned to the second tier, after a single season in the third one, and became a top club in the second tier during the 1956-57 season, did the attendances rise notably. And even further so in the following 1957-58 season, as BoIS won their league and now would play [[Örgryte IS]] in a home-away qualification for Allsvenskan.  
In the home qualification match was the old attendance record now wiped away..

* '''15.114''' at 19.October.1958, Landskrona BoIS - [[Örgryte IS]] , (unsuccessful) qualification for Allsvenskan&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 225&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''18.535''' at 18.October.1959, Landsrona BoIS - [[Degerfors IF]] , (unsuccessful) qualification for Allsvenskan&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 232&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allsvenskan qualification match against Degerfors in 1959 still is '''the current attendance record at Landskrona IP''', however for League-football (or any other event than football, for that matter) are the attendance records as follows:

* '''9.320''' unmentioned date 1960, Landskrona BoIS - [[IFK Kristianstad]]
* '''9.705''' unmentioned date 1960, Landskrona BoIS - Högalid, which of these two games that was played first is not mentioned, but at least the attendance vs Högalid in 1960 attendance record for ''second tier league football at Landskrona IP''&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 236&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''15.015''' at 29.August.1970 Landskrona BoIS - Helsingborg IF, Second tier league &lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 266&lt;/ref&gt; (1970 was also the first, and so far the only season, which Landskrona IP have seen more than 15.000 spectators to attended the venue ''more than once'' in the same season. As also the successful qualification game against [[Sandvikens IF]] had '''15.685''' attenders at 10.October.1970&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 267&lt;/ref&gt;) The 1968 unsuccessful qualification game vs [[Jönköping Södra IF]] drew '''15.116''' in mid-October 1968&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 261, exact date cannot be found&lt;/ref&gt;

As Landskrona BoIS made a comeback in Allsvenskan for the 1971 season, after 21 seasons in lower tiers, the attendance record for the highest league, still was those 10.124 from 1929. But there was little doubts for the 1929 Allsvenskan record to remain. And..

* '''15.036''' at 12.September.1971, Landskrona BoIS - [[Malmö FF]] finally broke that Allsvenskan attendance record 42 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Malmö FF's statistical site, http://www.mff.se/sv-SE/aktuellt/media/nyhetsarkiv/2004/2004-05-11_1312&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''15.514''' at 6.June.1973, Landskrona BoIS - Malmö FF &lt;ref&gt;Malmö FF's statistical site, http://www.mff.se/sv-SE/aktuellt/media/nyhetsarkiv/2004/2004-05-11_1312&lt;/ref&gt;    
* '''17.696''' at 12.June.1975, Landskrona BoIS - Malmö FF &lt;ref&gt;Malmö FF's statistical site, http://www.mff.se/sv-SE/aktuellt/media/nyhetsarkiv/2004/2004-05-11_1312&lt;/ref&gt; Which is the second largest crowd ever, so far, at the venue. (The third largest was yet another unsuccessful qualification, against [[AIK]] in front of '''16.010''' at 21.October.1962 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.se/search?q=landskrona+ip&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=cl1A_jK6WPpZ4M%253BAAAAAAAAAAABAM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fsv.wikipedia.org%25252Fwiki%25252FLandskrona_IP&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=cl1A_jK6WPpZ4M%252CAAAAAAAAAAABAM%252C_&amp;usg=__-NIdlAYkGCNUfLsBdlv75SPD814%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzrMbWzNzTAhXiFZoKHaDiAGcQuqIBCHkwDg&amp;biw=1691&amp;bih=947#imgrc=jXkHHSV98phcgM: Date]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 240, exact date can't be found&lt;/ref&gt;)
* '''9.686'''  at 5.July.1972, Landskrona BoIS - [[IFK Norrköping]], a successful re-match of the 1972 Swedish Cup final,&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), pages 283-291&lt;/ref&gt; is presumably the highest attendance at Landskrona IP for a ''cup-game'' (The cup has mostly been a problem in Sweden, and the first 1972-final at Norrköping saw only 2111 spectators, which ended in a draw)

Record attendances after the 1990 &amp; 1991 reconstructions.

* '''10.376''' at 24.May.1992, Landskrona BoIS - Helsingborg IF &lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 362&lt;/ref&gt;(second tier, but was however HIF's [[Henrik Larsson]]'s first appearance at Landskrona IP)
* '''11.902''' at 6.April.2002, Landskrona BoIS - Helsingborg IF (result 6-2 for BoIS, Opening match of the 2002-season, BoIS was newcomers and HIF was expected to win easily)&lt;ref&gt;Åke Jönsson, "Ett fotbollslags historia 1915-2015" (A Football Team's History), page 396&lt;/ref&gt;

During the seasons in the Third Millennium have Landskrona BoIS had the following average attendances at Landskrona IP:

==Other facilities==
Apart from the stadium, the facility offers several other football pitches (the so-called B-pitch even has stands of terrace type for approx 6000 attenders and is the home pitch for the small football club ''BK Landora''), six [[tennis]] courts (currently only clay, but a grass court has previously existed), a modern athletic field, an indoor ice rink and an indoor arena for [[handball]], [[basketball]], [[table tennis]] and [[wrestling]] etc. Below the stadium's south stand, also an indoor 25-metre swimming pool and a so-called "adventure bath" are located. Everything is owned by Landskrona municipality and available for the public (for fees and within certain limitations). The stadium pitch and the B-pitch has natural grass. There are also two pitches with artificial turf and minor floodlights and another four grass pitches. A Greyhound racing pitch, equipped with floodlights also exists, but is currently no longer in use. A drill-house for horse jumping with associated stables and some fields are also located within the larger area. At a neighbouring upper secondary school, another indoor sports hall are available for indoor activeties. And for the special type of 7-men football, that in Sweden is known as ''Korpfotboll'', four smaller grass pitches are available. Since these pitches, during the season (late April until mid September) is heavily used, the pitches are moved around at a larger field. If necessary, the entire field for "Korpfotboll", can accommodate four full-size football pitches. (During July this have happened during summuer youth tournaments)

The floodlight system at the stadium produces a lighting of 823 [[lux]]&lt;ref&gt;Swedish,"belysning" means "lighting",  https://svenskfotboll.se/superettan/information/?scr=venue&amp;faid=8608&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of four {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} pillars and additional lights at the roof of the south stand. Some of the floodlight pillars fell down during a storm in the mid-1960s, a few years after they were built. Since then, the steel construction pillars have been reinforced by a system of long steel wires, at two levels (at approx. half their height and at the top) between each other in a rectangular pattern, and are anchored in huge blocks of concrete. They are currently (late summer 2013) the highest floodlight pillars used for football in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

{{Nihongo|'''''The Battery'''''|バッテリー|''Batterī''}} is a 2007 Japanese film directed by [[Yōjirō Takita]], which is based on the [[Battery (novel series)|novel series with the same title]]. There is a 2008 Japanese drama series, ''Battery'', based on the same novel. In baseball, the term ''[[battery (baseball)|battery]]'' refers collectively to the pitcher and the catcher.

==Story==
Takumi Harada ([[Kento Hayashi]]) and his family moved to [[Okayama Prefecture]] during spring break before his entry to Junior High School. On the baseball field, Takumi has enormous confidence in his ability as a pitcher, but socially he is a [[loner]] and appears unapproachable to others. In the scene where he encounters Goh's mother, it is also revealed that he has little respect for elders as well.

His mother Makiko ([[Yūki Amami]]) is so protective of his younger brother, Seiha ([[Akihiro Yarita]]) that she acts coldly only to Takumi. His grandfather Yozo ([[Bunta Sugawara]]) was once a famous high school baseball coach who led his team to the national high school baseball convention at Koshien Stadium. Even his own caring family is not sure at times how to deal with the solitary side of Takumi. His father Hiroshi ([[Goro Kishitani]]) is a working father and is an amateur player in Baseball.

Takumi meets a new classmate, Goh Nagakura ([[Kenta Yamada]]), who is captivated by Takumi's pitching and is eager to team with him as his catcher. They practice with some friends from the team, including Seiha who disobeys their mother's persuasions to not play baseball. The two join the Nitta East Junior High School baseball team, only to learn that the coach is a [[control freak]]. Takumi's classmate ([[Mayu Yajima]]) becomes attracted to his personality as he tells her to stand by her beliefs.

Tension began to rise as Takumi defies and clashes with the coach. However, it is resolved when Takumi's three classmates beat him and his coach sides with him in the encounter with the Headmaster ([[Ittoku Kishibe]]). Due to this, the three bullies are taken off the team but the team is also disbanded temporarily, meaning that they cannot join any competitions. In spite of this, the coach did not heed the Headmaster's warning but instead made an unofficial match against Yokote Junior High School. Due to the unprecedented skill of their batter, Takumi and Goh also began to clash as well, and eventually Seiha falls ill.

Takumi's mother pushes Takumi away claiming that involving Seiha with baseball was the cause of his illness. However, the father suggested that Takumi should continue to play baseball. Takumi meets with Goh and the two reconcile, and both regain their talents in pitching and catching.

In the day of the big rematch, Takumi arrives late and therefore Nitta Junior High School used a substitute pitcher. Takumi visits his brother Seiha in the hospital and it is revealed that Seiha gathers strength when he hears Takumi is ready to play baseball. Seiha begs his brother to win the game, and Takumi bikes to the baseball field. He and Goh strike out their opponents and win the game.

Toyota Field was originally owned and operated by S.O.A.R. Inc., a non-profit organization founded by San Antonio philanthropist Gordon Hartman. During S.O.A.R. Inc.'s operation of the facility, all proceeds went to [[Morgan's Wonderland]], which is across the street from the stadium. Hartman also started Soccer For A Cause, a community-wide effort to bring pro soccer to San Antonio in order to help fund the operation of Morgan’s Wonderland. This led to Hartman’s acquisition of the [[San Antonio Scorpions]] in 2010, with the team starting play in the [[2012 North American Soccer League season|2012 season]].

Construction of Toyota Field ran from February 2012 through April 2013. On April 13, 2013, the Scorpions started play at Toyota Field in a [[North American Soccer League|NASL]] match against the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies]] with a 0-2 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Antonio Scorpions vs. Tampa Bay Rowdies - 14 April 2013 - Soccerway|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2013/04/14/united-states/nasl/san-antonio-scorpions-fc/fc-tampa-bay-rowdies/1433955/|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team had played at nearby [[Heroes Stadium]] during construction.

Toyota Field was host of [[Soccer Bowl 2014]], where the Scorpions claimed their first and only NASL championship over the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers]], 2-1.

===Acquisition by City, County ===
In November 2015, the [[City of San Antonio]] and [[Bexar County]] jointly acquired the stadium for $18 million. [[Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment]] (SS&amp;E) paid an additional $3 million to Hartman, bringing the total purchase price of the facility to $21 million. SS&amp;E received an initial 20-year lease to operate the facility with a new professional soccer team, with penalty fees of up to $5 million should the organization not bring a [[Major League Soccer]] franchise after the first six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City, County to purchase Toyota Field|url=http://www.sanantonio.gov/Commpa/News/TabId/317/ArtMID/1970/ArticleID/5531/City-County-to-purchase-Toyota-Field.aspx|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota Field will be host to San Antonio's [[United Soccer League|USL]] franchise, starting play in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbisoccer.com/2015/12/san-antonio-unveils-usl-plans-as-scorpions-close-up-shop|title=San Antonio unveils USL plans as Scorpions close up shop|author=|date=22 December 2015|website=sbisoccer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Toyota Field was designed by San Antonio architecture firm, Pro Sports Developments (PSD), which is the sports entertainment division of Luna Architecture and Design.  The stadium was designed as a soccer-specific stadium, to strategically expand to upwards of 18,000 seats in 3 total phases and to accommodate [[University Interscholastic League|UIL]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], MLS and [[FIFA]] standard international soccer events. The design also accommodates [[rugby football|rugby]], [[lacrosse]], [[American football]], [[boxing]] and concerts. The stadium currently exists as Phase 1 in the stadium expansion phases.

==Phase I==
The stadium currently has a capacity of 8,296 seats, including 16 private suites, 864 midfield club seats, a field level beer garden for over 200 fans with tiered table and chair seating as close as 15 feet behind the south goal. A suite level observation terrace for over 100 fans overlooks the entire field, plus a fan zone behind the north-end seating allows fans to gather and get autographs before and after a game. The stadium capacity could reach approximately 9,000 spectators with standing-room only accommodations.

The architectural design by PSD reflects the industrial heritage of the historic Longhorn Quarry which the stadium now resides in. The stadium contains ribbed metal and perforated metal facades with exposed structural elements throughout the facility, accentuating the steel and creating a contemporary industrial feel. The metal façades and the metal roof canopy that extends over the west side suite balconies and stadium seating, together amplify the crowd noise. The permanent west side roof canopy combined with lower bowl stadium seating that starts only 17 feet from the soccer touchlines gives Toyota Field an intimate feel, a quality the designers say will continue with the future expansion phases as planned.

==Future Expansion==
On September 2, 2014, the Scorpions announced a planned expansion, which envisions the addition of 10,000 seats to the existing 8,000, with 9,000 of the new seats on a new upper tier that would create a bowl-like configuration around the playing field. 18 suites accommodating up to 24 fans apiece would be added to the east side of the stadium, bringing the total number of suites to 32.  Plans also call for three new clubs – the East Club with 130 balcony seats on the east suite level, the West Club with 40 observation-terrace seats on the existing west suite level and a Members Club at the southeast corner of the stadium. Club patrons and suite holders would be allowed to use a new entrance directly across from existing reserved parking.

Other proposed enhancements include concessions, restrooms and merchandise outlets on each stadium level to efficiently meet the level of fan demand at halftime; field lighting for Division 1 network broadcasting; and a team store accessible from inside and outside the stadium.

==Field==
The soccer field playing surface was designed and built by sports field contractor Texas Multi-Chem, of [[Kerrville, Texas]]. The field's natural grass surface is TifSport hybrid Bermuda and the root zone consists of an 8" layer of USGA sand and Dakota peat. The field also contains an internal drainage system to help avoid rain outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avoid Rainouts With Internal Drainage Systems|url=http://www.texasmultichem.com/blog/avoid-rainouts-with-internal-drainage-systems.html|publisher=(Texas Multi-Chem|location=Kerrville, TX|date=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==

=== Soccer ===

The Scorpions played their first game at Toyota Field on April 13, 2013 against the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies]], losing 2-0.

On May 21, 2013, Toyota Field hosted its first [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] match between the Scorpions versus [[FC Tucson]] of the [[Premier Development League|PDL]].

On July 6, 2013, Toyota Field hosted its first international friendly match between the Scorpions versus [[Tigres UANL]] of [[Liga MX]].

On October 13, 2013, Toyota Field hosted [[Santos Laguna]] versus [[Club Tijuana]], both of Liga MX, in a friendly match.

On December 6–7, 2013, Toyota Field hosted the [[NCAA Division III Men’s Soccer Championship]] and the [[NCAA Division III Women’s Soccer Championship]].

'''Veterans Memorial Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]. The original Veterans Memorial Stadium facility was built in 1948.  It was demolished in 2008 and a new structure opened in 2009. It seats 10,000, with around 6,200 seats in the main grandstand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wkbt.com/Global/story.asp?S=10330917&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is primarily used for [[American football|football]] and [[track and field]]. It is the home field of the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]] Eagles. The 10-lane, 400 meter track complex has hosted several [[NCAA]] championships and hosts the [[Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association]] state high school track and field championships each June. The stadium complex also houses the Veterans Hall of Honor meeting room.

==2009 expansion==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:vetexpan.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Planned expansion of Veterans Memorial Complex]] --&gt;
Veterans Memorial Complex was expanded to increase stadium seating to around 10,000, improve Harring Field and the surrounding track, and provide additional athletic fields for soccer and intramural sports. Officials wanted to attract and retain large events such as the WIAA state track meet, while having the necessary fields and associated structures to support both UW–La Crosse athletic and recreational activities as well as community events and programs.  In the past, the [[New Orleans Saints]] had used La Crosse's facilities for the team's summer training camp. The university is said to be interested in attracting another [[NFL]] team to the campus.

The expansion, which had an estimated cost of about $14.5 million, began with demolition of the previous stadium in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2008/05/25/news/00lead.txt With wrecking ball on the horizon, UW–L's stadium is entering its twilight : La Crosse Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2008/06/28/news/z02demolition28.txt Stadium demolition nearly finished : La Crosse Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2008/05/25/news/01myers.txt Spectators have gotten their money’s worth : La Crosse Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wkbt.com/Global/story.asp?S=8481510 WKBT La Crosse, WI-NewsChannel 8, La Crosse Weather, La Crosse News, La Crosse SportsIt's Good-Bye to a La Crosse Landmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The field and track itself was completed in September 2008, while the entire project was finished in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2007/12/20/news/00lead.txt La Crosse Tribune - 7.0 : Gow: UW–L Stadium details needed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2008/01/08/news/00lead.txt La Crosse Tribune - 7.0 : UW–L officials propose stadium plan completion in two phases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals of expansion===
{{tone|date=February 2013}}
Prior to the beginning of the project, the university outlined various goals of the expansion. 
====Stadium====
*Provide [[seating capacity]] of 10,000 split between the main stadium structure and a “visitors side” seating section.
*Develop facilities within the stadium for ticketing, and public restrooms.
*Develop space below the stadium seating for a student [[fitness center]].
*Install new lighting in stadium.
*Develop facilities within the stadium for concessions, press box, [[chancellor]]’s box, corporate viewing boxes filming platform, etc.
*Develop space below stadium seating for functions such as athletic training, classrooms, locker rooms, climate controlled storage, etc.
====Track====
*Construct a new, 9-lane (48”) lighted track with rubberized surface that meets all [[NCAA]] and [[Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association|WIAA]] guidelines for competition track facilities. Utilize a “broken-back” style track layout to achieve faster competition track and to afford ample infield space for field events.
*Incorporate long jump, triple jump, and pole vault within the field on the east (“visitors”) side of the football field. In corporate high jump into the south D-zone.
*Centrally locate the hammer throw, discus and javelin near the stadium complex area with permanent runways and throwing pads and cages.

====Harring Field====
*Install new synthetic playing surface within the stadium. This will allow unlimited use of the field and it will also reduce the required number of football practice fields.
*Develop one natural turf football practice field immediately adjacent to the stadium to accommodate coordinated, simultaneous practice on both the synthetic and the natural turf fields.

====Soccer====
*Provide a minimally crowned, irrigated and lighted 225’x360’ natural turf competition field oriented north-south.
*Provide an irrigated and lighted natural turf half-size practice field adjacent to the competition field.
*Provide spectator seating with an approximate capacity of 300 seats.
*Install permanent press facilities, scorers table, score board and public address system. Also provide team benches opposite of the spectator seating.

====Student Recreation====
*Develop permanent, lighted student recreation fields on north end of Memorial Fields complex.

====Tennis====
*Provide spectator seating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">The [[Wisconsin State Golf Association]] (WSGA) established a '''Wisconsin Golf Hall of Fame''' in 1964 to honor distinguished amateurs for their significant contributions to the game of [[golf]] in Wisconsin.  The five charter members of this elite group, all "legends" who made their "mark" in Wisconsin amateur golf circles, were E.P. "Ned" Allis, Dick Cavanagh, Lynford Lardner, Billy Sixty, Sr., and Wilford Wehrle.

In 1975, the WSGA Hall of Fame Committee changed the induction policies to allow professionals, women and public links players to be considered for the [[Hall of Fame]].  The first female to be inducted was [[Joyce Ziske Malison]].  In 1980, Archie Dadian of Whitnall Park GC became the first public links player to be elected to the Hall of Fame.

At present, [[commemorative plaque|plaques]] of all inductees, which outline their achievements along with an engraved likeness, are on display at Golf House of Wisconsin&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [http://www.wsga.org/interior.aspx?id=800&amp;ekmensel=c580fa7b_78_0_800_7 Golf House of Wisconsin Museum] official webpage. Wisconsin State Golf Association. Retrieved 2010-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]]. 

The WSGA Hall of Fame Committee is composed of WSGA directors, golf professionals, women representatives, public links players and media delegates, who meet annually to review candidates.  Candidate consideration is extended to individuals with outstanding golf records, and to those who have made exceptional contributions to the game of golf.  All candidates must be at least 40 years of age and must receive at least 75% of the committee's votes.
