'''Ancestry.com LLC''' is a [[privately held company|privately held]] [[Dot-com company|online]] company based in [[Lehi, Utah]]. The largest [[for-profit]] [[genealogy]] company in the world, it operates a network of genealogical, historical record and [[genetic genealogy]] websites.

As of November 2018, the company claimed to provide access to approximately 10 billion historical records, to have 3 million paying subscribers and to have sold 14 million DNA kits to customers.

==History==

===Ancestry.com===
On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernstandard.com/about.htm |title=About Western Standard Publishing |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616100540/http://www.westernstandard.com/about.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; publisher of ''[[Ancestry Magazine|Ancestry]]'' magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was [[Joseph A. Cannon|Joe Cannon]], one of the principal owners of [[Geneva Steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Genealogy business booms as boomers seek out roots|publisher = Deseret News|date = April 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Paul Brent Allen|Paul B. Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;not to be confused with Microsoft cofounder [[Paul Allen|Paul G. Allen]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dan Taggart, two [[Brigham Young University]] graduates, founded Infobases and began offering [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) publications on [[floppy disk]]s. In 1988, Allen had worked at [[Folio Corporation]], founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law [[Brad Pelo]].

Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765532/Backing-into-a-lucrative-business.html|title=Backing into a lucrative business|last=Walker|first=Joseph|date=June 11, 2000|work=Deseret News|access-date=February 26, 2017&lt;!--added to archive.org and archive.is--&gt;&lt;!--February 26, 2017--&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Let a mouse guide your scripture search|publisher = Deseret News|date = April 3, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was offered in an online version in August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = LDS Materials Available Online|publisher = Deseret News|date = August 3, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/539321/ancestry-moves-further-into-consumer-genetics/|title=Ancestry Moves Further into Consumer Genetics|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, [[Brad Pelo]] was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to [[Open Market]] for $45&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Western Standard sells interest in business magazine to Utah County man|publisher = Deseret News|date = June 4, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public evidence of the change in ownership of ''Ancestry'' magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.

More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased [[Bookcraft, Inc.]], a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Infobases acquires LDS publishing house|publisher = Deseret News|date = July 1, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Happily joined|publisher = Deseret News|date = April 5, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. [[Alan Ashton (executive)|Alan Ashton]], a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of [[WordPerfect]], was its chairman of the board.

Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.&lt;ref name="infobase"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.infobaseventures.com/our_companies.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528152733/http://www.infobaseventures.com/our_companies.html | title=Infobase Ventures Portfolio Companies | publisher=Infobase Ventures| archivedate=May 28, 2007 | accessdate=April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, [[Deseret Book]]. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deseret Book parent announces plans to acquire Bookcraft|publisher=Deseret News|date=February 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Acquisition of Bookcraft finalized|publisher=Deseret News|date=April 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trends.masie.com/archives/1999/03/110_updates_on.html |title=MyFamily.com begins offering free sites |date=March 11, 1999 |accessdate=December 26, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116165038/http://trends.masie.com/archives/1999/03/110_updates_on.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.&lt;ref name="infobase"/&gt; The company raised more than US$90&amp;nbsp;million in venture capital from investors&lt;ref name="infobase"/&gt; and changed its name on November 17, 1999, from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Ancestry.com, Inc. Changes Corporate Name to MyFamily.com, Inc.|publisher = Ancestry.com|date = November 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were about US$62&amp;nbsp;million for 2002 and US$99&amp;nbsp;million for 2003.&lt;ref name="pallencompanies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulallen.net/my-companies/ |title=My Companies: A Chronological View of My Entrepreneurial Endeavors |author=Paul Allen |publisher=paulallen.net |date=May 20, 2006 |accessdate=April 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418104914/http://www.paulallen.net/my-companies/ |archivedate=April 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancestry dot com headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Former Ancestry.com headquarters in [[Provo, Utah]]]]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in [[Orem, Utah]], opened a new [[call center]], which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595055685,00.html |title=MyFamily growing in Utah |work=[[Deseret News]] |date=April 13, 2004 |accessdate=April 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421101121/http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0%2C1249%2C595055685%2C00.html |archivedate=April 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heritage Makers]] was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/09-21-2005/0004112253&amp;EDATE= |title=MyFamily.com, Inc.

While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS [[Family History Center (LDS Church)|Family History Centers]], that service was terminated on March 17, 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.

In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to [[Turner Publishing Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Milliot, [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/454076-Turner_Publishing_Buys_Ancestry_Publishing_Assets.php "Turner Publishing Buys Ancestry Publishing Assets,"] ''Publishers Weekly'', March 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on [[NASDAQ]] (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Bank of America]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Jefferies &amp; Company]], [[Piper Jaffray]], and [[BMO Capital Markets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2009/11/05/ancestry-com-explores-an-ipo/|website=BloggingStocks.com |title=Ancestry.com explores an IPO|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in [[San Francisco, California]], staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services.  In 2011, Ancestry launched an [[Android (OS)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1157578/ancestrydotcom.html|title=Ancestry.com updates app with iPad optimization|website=Macworld|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidtapp.com/ancestry-app/|title=Ancestry app is the perfect companion for researching family tree history |date=March 5, 2012|website=AndroidTapp|language=en-US|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the [[Social Security Death Index]] search behind a [[paywall]] and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of [[identity theft]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from [[GeneTree]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2012/05/ancestrycom-buys-genetree-and-launches.html Ancestry.com buys GeneTree and launches new service] Accessed January 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in [[Dublin, Ireland]].

==== AncestryDNA ====
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer [[genealogical DNA test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/10/21/23andme-reboots-service-anne-wojcicki/74281804/|title=23andme relaunches its expanded DNA spit tests after FDA-mandated pause|website=USA TODAY|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it calls an "ethnicity estimate". Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal [[YDNA|Y-chromosome DNA]] and maternal [[mitochondrial DNA]] tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geneabloggers.com/ancestrycom-pulls-plug-sites/|title=Ancestry.com Pulls the Plug on Several Sites|accessdate=July 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715104546/http://geneabloggers.com/ancestrycom-pulls-plug-sites/|archive-date=July 15, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company describes the technical process of testing in a scientific [[white paper]]. In November 2018 the company claimed that, to date they had sold more than 14 million DNA kits to customers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610233/2017-was-the-year-consumer-dna-testing-blew-up/|title=2017 was the year consumer DNA testing blew up|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|date=February 12, 2018|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=February 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestry DNA is commonly used for [[donor conceived person|donor conceived persons]] to find their biological siblings and in some cases their [[sperm donor|sperm]] or [[egg donor]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/sperm-donor-dna-testing-1.4500517&lt;/ref&gt;

The testing itself is performed by [[Quest Diagnostics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darkdaily.com/ancestrydna-collaborates-with-quest-diagnostics-to-provide-home-dna-testing-to-healthcare-consumers-721/|title=AncestryDNA Uses Quest Diagnostics to Sequence DNA {{!}} Dark Daily|website=www.darkdaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FindAGrave===
{{Main|Find a Grave}}
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of [[Find a Grave]]. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had "been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history". Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestryinsider.org/2014/03/ancestrycom-releases-find-grave-app.html|title=The Ancestry Insider: Ancestry.com Releases Find-A-Grave App|website=www.ancestryinsider.org|access-date=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RootsWeb===
RootsWeb, acquired by Ancestry in June 2000, is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Users can upload [[GEDCOM]] files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites.

On December 20, 2017, a file containing 300,000 RootsWeb user names, passwords, and email addresses was exposed to the internet.  The 300,000 records were from RootsWeb surname list service with 55,000 of those records were also Ancestry.com login credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/exposed-file-from-ancestrys-rootswebcom-contains-data-on-300000-users/d/d-id/1330710|title=Exposed File From Ancestry's RootsWeb.com Contains Data on 300,000 Users|work=Dark Reading|access-date=December 28, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers.com===
In 2012, Ancestry spun off its digitized online newspaper components into a standalone service Newspapers.com with newspaper.com only pricing as well as a bundled Ancestry.com pricing.

Before the Newspapers.com launch, Ancestry.com acquired the following newspaper-oriented components, including scanning and digital technologies and posting on the web:
*[[Iarchives]] (and its footnote.com service) acquired in 2010 for 1.022 million Common Stock shares.  The purchase brought in assets including processes for digitalizing documents on [[microfilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39775422/ns/business-press_releases/t/ancestrycom-inc-completes-acquisition-iarchives/ |title=Ancestry.com Inc.

The website's principal competitor is [[newspaperarchive.com]] which claims it has online newspapers dating from 1607 worldwide and its index in June 2018 includes 9,829 newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/ |title=NewspaperArchive® &amp;#124; Genealogy &amp; Family History Records |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date= |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both websites having similar models for increasing their databases: striking deals with libraries, publishers and historical organizations to scan the publications for free to include in their database. Participants note that the process of free scanning is easier, cheaper and quicker to get their publications online rather than working through the government operated [[National Digital Newspaper Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Jim Epstein |date= May 18, 2014 |url= http://reason.com/blog/2014/05/18/a-retiree-digitizes-27-million-old-newsp |title=A Retiree Digitizes 27 Million Old Newspaper Pages in His Living Room (and Libraries Fight to Catch Up) - Hit &amp; Run |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anton Polenec''' (7 October 1910 – 30 October 2000) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[zoologist]] and specialist [[Arachnology|arachnologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdloka.si/slo/main.asp?id=29783B7F Škofja Loka Museum Society site]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polenec was born in [[Puštal]] near [[Škofja Loka]] in 1910. He studied at the [[University of Ljubljana]] and later taught zoology and was head of the [[Natural History Museum of Slovenia]] from 1955 to 1980. He studied and described over 500 species of [[spider]]s including a new genus ''[[List of Linyphiidae species (A–H)#Centrophantes|Centrophantes]]''. The spider genus ''[[List of Uloboridae species#Polenecia|Polenecia]]'' is named after Polenec.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorenjci.si/osebe/polenec-anton/499/ Web Biographical Lexicon of Famous People from Upper Carniola]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from scientific contributions he also wrote numerous [[popular science]] books for young readers and won the [[Levstik Award]] twice, in 1950 for his book ''Iz življenja žuželk'' (The Lives of Insects) and in 1952 for ''Iz življenja pajkov'' (The Life of Spiders).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mladinska.com/knjige/knjizne_nagrade/levstikove__nagrade The Levstik Award on the Mladinska Knjiga Publishing House site]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Belt transects''' are used in [[biology]] to estimate the distribution of [[organism]]s in relation to a certain area, such as the [[coast|seashore]] or a meadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David Arnold |last=Hill |author2=Matthew Fasham |author3=Graham Tucker |author4=Michael Shewry |author5=Philip Shaw |title=Handbook of biodiversity methods: survey, evaluation and monitoring |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2005 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jspmhkyex4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA219,M1 219–222] |isbn=0-521-82368-4 |oclc=61439712}}&lt;/ref&gt; It records all the [[species]] found between two lines and how far they are for a certain place or area and how many of them there are. An interrupted belt transect records all the species found in [[quadrat]]s (square frames) placed at certain intervals along a line.

The belt transect method is similar to the [[Line-intercept sampling|line transect]] method but gives information on abundance as well as presence, or absence of species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/what_method.htm Ecological Sampling Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geographyfieldwork.com/urban_sampling.htm Urban Sampling Methods] - Barcelona Field Study Center&lt;/ref&gt; It may be considered as a widening of the line transect to form a continuous belt, or series of quadrats.

In this method, the transect line is laid out across the area to be surveyed and a quadrat is placed on the first marked point on the line. These marked points should be a set amount of space apart. The plants and/or animals inside the quadrat are then identified and their abundance estimated. Animals can be counted within the quadrat, or collected, while it is usual to estimate the percentage cover of plant species. Cover is the area of the quadrat occupied by the above-ground parts of a species when viewed from above. The canopies of the plants inside the quadrat will often overlap each other, so the total percentage cover of plants in a single quadrat will frequently add up to more than 100%. 

Quadrats are sampled all the way down the transect line, at each marked point on the line, or at some other predetermined interval (or even randomly) if time is short. It is important that the same person should do the estimations of cover in each quadrat, because the estimation is likely to vary from person to person. If different people estimate percentage cover in different quadrats, then an element of personal variation is introduced which will lead to less accurate results. Sampling should always be as least destructive as possible and trampling the surrounding area should be avoided when carrying out a survey. Not only is there a risk of damaging the area, but there is also a risk of reducing the population or percentage cover of the species being surveyed.

The term ''black-oil'' refers to the fluid model, in which water is modeled explicitly together with two hydrocarbon components, one (pseudo) oil phase and one (pseudo-)gas phase.

This is in contrast with a compositional formulation, in which each hydrocarbon component (arbitrary number) is handled separately

The equations of an extended black-oil model are
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\phi\left(\frac{S_o}{B_o}+\frac{R_VS_g}{B_g}\right)\right]
+\nabla\cdot\left(
\frac{1}{B_o}\vec u_o+\frac{R_V}{B_g}\vec u_g\right)= 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec u_o,\vec u_w,\vec u_g&lt;/math&gt; are 
[[Relative permeability|Darcy]] velocities of the liquid phase, water phase and vapor phase in the reservoir.
The oil and gas at the surface ([[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]) could be produced from both liquid and vapor phases existing at high pressure and temperature of reservoir conditions. This is characterized by the following quantities:

The '''British National Vegetation Classification''' or '''NVC''' is a system of classifying [[nature|natural]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] types in [[Great Britain]] according to the [[vegetation]] they contain.

A large scientific meeting of [[ecologist]]s, [[botanist]]s, and other related professionals in the [[United Kingdom]] resulted in the publication of a compendium of five books: ''[[British Plant Communities]]'', edited by [[John S. Rodwell]], which detail the incidence of plant species in twelve major habitat types in the British [[natural environment]].&lt;ref name="Rodwell"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[British Plant Communities]] |isbn=0521797160|editor-first=John S. |editor-last=Rodwell |editor-link=John S. Rodwell|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1998–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the first systematic and comprehensive account of the [[vegetation]] types of the country. They cover all natural, semi-natural and major artificial habitats in Great Britain (not [[Northern Ireland]]) and represent fifteen years of research by leading plant [[ecology|ecologists]].

From the data collated from the books, commercial [[software]] products have been developed to help to classify vegetation identified into one of the many habitat types found in Great Britain – these include ''MATCH'', ''TABLEFIT'' and ''MAVIS''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/jncc335.pdf |title=National Vegetation Classification – Ten years’ experience using the woodland section |editor-first=E |editor-last=Goldberg |publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee|JNCC]] |date=April 2001}} citing:

== Terminology used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification ==

The following is a list of terms used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification, together with their meanings:

=== Communities, subcommunities and variants ===

*A '''community''' is the fundamental unit of categorisation for vegetation.
*A '''subcommunity''' is a distinct recognisable subdivision of a community.
*A '''variant''' is a further subdivision of a subcommunity.

=== Constant species ===

*A '''constant species''' in a community is a species that is always present in any given stand of vegetation belonging to that community.

For a list of the constant species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see [[List of constant species in the British National Vegetation Classification]].

=== Rare species ===

*A '''rare species''' is a species which is associated with a particular community and is rare nationally.

:The sources used by the authors of ''[[British Plant Communities]]'' for assessing rarity were as follows. 
:a) for [[vascular plant]]s, two sources were used:
::*Perring, F. H. and S. M. Walters (1962) ''[[Atlas of the British Flora]]'' - a species was regarded as rare if it was given an "A" rating in this work (these were plants which Perring &amp; Walters judged to be sufficiently rare to merit a special search in order to ensure all records were included in the atlas).
::*Any species included on lists compiled by the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] of plants found in less than 100 [[hectad]]s.

:b) for [[bryophyte]]s, the source used was Corley, M. F. V. and M. O. Hill (1981) ''Distribution of bryophytes in the British Isles''. This lists the species and the [[vice-county|vice-counties]] in which they are recorded; presence in under 20 vice-counties was the criterion used for selection as rare.

:c) for [[lichen]]s, no source was available, and the authors used their own selection of species.

For a list of these rare species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see [[List of rare species in the British National Vegetation Classification]].

== Communities by category ==

In total there are 286 communities in the British National Vegetation Classification. They are grouped into the following major categories:

* [[Woodland and scrub communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Woodland and scrub communities]] (25 communities, prefixed with the letter "W" &amp;mdash; 19 classed as woodland, four as scrub and two as 'underscrub')
* [[Mires in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Mires]] (38 communities, prefixed "M")
* [[Heaths in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Heaths]] (22 communities, prefixed "H")
* [[Mesotrophic grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Mesotrophic grasslands]] (13 communities, prefixed "MG")
* [[Calcicolous grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Calcicolous grasslands]] (14 communities, prefixed "CG")
* [[Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities]] (21 communities, prefixed "U")
* [[Aquatic communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Aquatic communities]] (24 communities, prefixed "A")
* [[Swamps and tall-herb fens in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Swamps and tall-herb fens]] (28 communities, prefixed "S")
* [[Salt-marsh communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Salt-marsh communities]] (28 communities, prefixed "SM")
* [[Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities]] (19 communities, prefixed "SD" &amp;mdash; one shingle, two strandline and 16 sand-dune communities)
* [[Maritime cliff communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Maritime cliff communities]] (12 communities, prefixed "MC")
* [[Vegetation of open habitats in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Vegetation of open habitats]] (42 communities, prefixed "OV")

{{Beyond the Standard Model|expanded=Evidence}}
In [[particle physics]], '''CP violation''' is a violation of '''CP-symmetry''' (or '''charge conjugation parity symmetry'''): the combination of [[C-symmetry]] ([[charge (physics)|charge]] conjugation symmetry) and [[Parity (physics)|P-symmetry]] (parity symmetry). CP-symmetry states that the laws of physics should be the same if a particle is interchanged with its antiparticle (C symmetry) while its spatial coordinates are inverted ("mirror" or P symmetry). The discovery of CP violation in 1964 in the decays of neutral [[kaon]]s resulted in the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1980 for its discoverers [[James Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]].

It plays an important role both in the attempts of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] to explain the dominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present [[Universe]], and in the study of [[weak interaction]]s in particle physics.

==CP-symmetry==
''CP-symmetry'', often called just ''CP'', is the product of two [[symmetry in physics|symmetries]]: C for charge conjugation, which transforms a particle into its [[antiparticle]], and P for parity, which creates the mirror image of a physical system. The [[strong interaction]] and [[electromagnetic interaction]] seem to be invariant under the combined CP transformation operation, but this symmetry is slightly violated during certain types of [[weak decay]]. Historically, CP-symmetry was proposed to restore order after the discovery of [[Parity (physics)#Parity violation|parity violation]] in the 1950s.

The idea behind parity symmetry is that the equations of particle physics are invariant under mirror inversion. This leads to the prediction that the mirror image of a reaction (such as a [[chemical reaction]] or [[radioactive decay]]) occurs at the same rate as the original reaction. Parity symmetry appears to be valid for all reactions involving [[electromagnetism]] and [[strong interaction]]s. Until 1956, parity conservation was believed to be one of the fundamental geometric conservation laws (along with [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]]). However, in 1956 a careful critical review of the existing experimental data by theoretical physicists [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen-Ning Yang]] revealed that while parity conservation had been verified in decays by the strong or electromagnetic interactions, it was untested in the weak interaction. They proposed several possible direct experimental tests. The first test based on [[beta decay]] of [[cobalt-60]] nuclei was carried out in 1956 by a group led by [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], and demonstrated conclusively that weak interactions violate the P symmetry or, as the analogy goes, some reactions did not occur as often as their mirror image.

Overall, the symmetry of a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] system can be restored if another symmetry ''S'' can be found such that the combined symmetry ''PS'' remains unbroken.  This rather subtle point about the structure of [[Hilbert space]] was realized shortly after the discovery of ''P'' violation, and it was proposed that charge conjugation was the desired symmetry to restore order.

Simply speaking, charge conjugation is a symmetry between particles and antiparticles, and so CP-symmetry was proposed in 1957 by [[Lev Landau]] as the true symmetry between matter and antimatter.
In other words, a process in which all particles are exchanged with their [[antiparticle]]s was assumed to be equivalent to the mirror image of the original process.

===CP violation in the Standard Model===

"Direct" CP violation is allowed in the Standard Model if a complex phase appears in the [[CKM matrix]] describing [[quark]] mixing, or the [[PMNS matrix]] describing [[neutrino]] mixing. A necessary condition for the appearance of the complex phase is the presence of at least three generations of quarks. If fewer generations are present, the complex phase parameter [[CKM matrix#Counting|can be absorbed]] into redefinitions of the quark fields. A popular rephasing invariant whose vanishing signals absence of CP violation and occurs in most CP violating amplitudes is the ''Jarlskog invariant'', &lt;math&gt;  J = c_{12}c_{13}^2 c_{23}s_{12}s_{13}s_{23}\sin \delta \approx 3~10^{-5}.&lt;/math&gt;

The reason why such a complex phase causes CP violation is not immediately obvious, but can be seen as follows. Consider any given particles (or sets of particles) &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and their antiparticles &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{b}&lt;/math&gt;. Now consider the processes &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding antiparticle process &lt;math&gt;\bar{a} \rightarrow \bar{b}&lt;/math&gt;, and denote their amplitudes &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{M}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Before CP violation, these terms must be the ''same'' complex number. We can separate the magnitude and phase by writing &lt;math&gt;M=|M|e^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;. If a phase term is introduced from (e.g.) the CKM matrix, denote it &lt;math&gt;e^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\bar{M}&lt;/math&gt; contains the conjugate matrix to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, so it picks up a phase term &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\phi}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now the formula becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;M=|M|e^{i\theta}e^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{M}=|M|e^{i\theta}e^{-i\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
Physically measurable reaction rates are proportional to &lt;math&gt;|M|^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, thus so far nothing is different. However, consider that there are ''two different routes'': &lt;math&gt;a \overset{1}{\longrightarrow} b&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;a \overset{2}{\longrightarrow} b&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently, two unrelated intermediate states: &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow 1\rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow 2\rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt;. Now we have:
:&lt;math&gt;M = |M_{1}|e^{i\theta_{1}}e^{i\phi_{1}} + |M_{2}|e^{i\theta_{2}}e^{i\phi_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{M} = |M_{1}|e^{i\theta_{1}}e^{-i\phi_{1}} + |M_{2}|e^{i\theta_{2}}e^{-i\phi_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
Some further calculation gives:
:&lt;math&gt;|M|^{2}-|\bar{M}|^{2}=-4|M_{1}||M_{2}|\sin(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2})\sin(\phi_{1}-\phi_{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we see that a complex phase gives rise to processes that proceed at different rates for particles and antiparticles, and CP is violated.

From the theoretical end, the CKM matrix is defined as V&lt;sub&gt;CKM&lt;/sub&gt; =U&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;．U&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;﹢&lt;/sup&gt;, where U&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; are unitary transformation matrices which diagonalize the fermion mass matrices M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

Thus, there are two necessary conditions for getting a complex CKM matrix:
#At least one of U&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is complex, or the CKM matrix will be purely real.
#Even both of them are complex, U&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; mustn’t be the same, i.e., U&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;≠U&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; , or CKM matrix will be an identity matrix which is also  purely real.

==Experimental status==

===Indirect CP violation===
In 1964, [[James Cronin]], [[Val Fitch]] and coworkers provided clear evidence from [[kaon]] decay that CP-symmetry could be broken.&lt;ref name=FCE&gt;[http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2008/ph204/coleman1/ The Fitch-Cronin Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt; This work&lt;ref name=FC1964&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence for the 2&amp;pi; Decay of the K{{su|b=2|p=0}} Meson System |journal=Physical Review Letters |year=1964|volume=13|issue=4 |pages=138 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.138|bibcode = 1964PhRvL..13..138C |last=Christenson |first=J. H. |last2=Cronin |first2=J. W. |last3=Fitch |first3=V. L. |last4=Turlay |first4=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; won them the 1980 Nobel Prize. This discovery showed that weak interactions violate not only the charge-conjugation symmetry '''C''' between particles and antiparticles and the '''P''' or parity, but also their combination. The discovery shocked particle physics and opened the door to questions still at the core of particle physics and of cosmology today. The lack of an exact CP-symmetry, but also the fact that it is so nearly a symmetry, created a great puzzle.

Only a weaker version of the symmetry could be preserved by physical phenomena, which was [[CPT symmetry]]. Besides C and P, there is a third operation, time reversal '''T''', which corresponds to reversal of motion.  Invariance under time reversal implies that whenever a motion is allowed by the laws of physics, the reversed motion is also an allowed one and occurs at the same rate forwards and backwards. The combination of CPT is thought to constitute an exact symmetry of all types of fundamental interactions.  Because of the CPT symmetry, a violation of the CP-symmetry is equivalent to a violation of the T symmetry. CP violation implied nonconservation of T, provided that the long-held CPT theorem was valid. In this theorem, regarded as one of the basic principles of [[quantum field theory]], charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal are applied together.

===Direct CP violation===
[[File:Kaon-box-diagram.svg|thumb|right|Kaon oscillation box diagram]]
[[File:Kaon-box-diagram-alt.svg|thumb|right|The two box diagrams above are the [[Feynman diagram]]s providing the leading contributions to the amplitude of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Kaon0}}-{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Antikaon0}} oscillation]]

The kind of CP violation discovered in 1964 was linked to the fact that neutral [[kaon]]s can transform into their [[antiparticle]]s (in which each [[quark]] is replaced with the other's antiquark) and vice versa, but such transformation does not occur with exactly the same probability in both directions; this is called ''indirect'' CP violation.
Despite many searches, no other manifestation of CP violation was discovered until the 1990s, when the [[NA31 experiment]] at [[CERN]] suggested evidence for CP violation in the decay process of the very same neutral kaons (''direct'' CP violation). The observation was somewhat controversial, and final proof for it came in 1999 from the [[KTeV experiment]] at [[Fermilab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alavi-Harati |first=A. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=KTeV Collaboration|title=Observation of Direct CP Violation in K&lt;sub&gt;S,L&lt;/sub&gt;→&amp;pi;&amp;pi; Decays|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|year=1999|volume=83|pages=22|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.22|arxiv = hep-ex/9905060 |bibcode = 1999PhRvL..83...22A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[NA48 experiment]] at [[CERN]].&lt;ref name="NA48"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of CP violation processes in [[B meson]] decays have now been discovered. Before these "[[B-factory]]" experiments, there was a logical possibility that all CP violation was confined to kaon physics. However, this raised the question of why CP violation did ''not'' extend to the strong force, and furthermore, why this was not predicted by the unextended [[Standard Model]], despite the model's accuracy for "normal" phenomena.

In 2011, a hint of CP violation in decays of neutral [[D meson]]s was reported by the [[LHCb]] experiment at [[CERN]] using 0.6&amp;nbsp;fb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of Run 1 data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Carbone |first=A. |title=A search for time-integrated CP violation in D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;→h&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decays|year=2012|eprint=1210.8257|class=hep-ex }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same measurement using the full 3.0&amp;nbsp;fb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Run 1 sample was consistent with CP symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=LHCb Collaboration|title=Measurement of CP asymmetry in D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;→K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;→π&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;π&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decays|journal=JHEP|date=2014|volume=7|issue=7|page=41|doi=10.1007/JHEP07(2014)041|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP07%282014%29041|arxiv = 1405.2797 |bibcode = 2014JHEP...07..041A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong CP problem==
{{main|Strong CP problem}}
{{unsolved|physics|Why is the strong nuclear interaction force CP-invariant?}}

There is no experimentally known violation of the CP-symmetry in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. As there is no known reason for it to be conserved in QCD specifically, this is a "fine tuning" problem known as the [[strong CP problem]].

QCD does not violate the CP-symmetry as easily as the [[electroweak theory]]; unlike the electroweak theory in which the gauge fields couple to [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] currents constructed from the [[fermion]]ic fields, the gluons couple to vector currents. Experiments do not indicate any CP violation in the QCD sector. For example, a generic CP violation in the strongly interacting sector would create the [[electric dipole moment]] of the [[neutron]] which would be comparable to 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Elementary charge|e]]·m while the experimental upper bound is roughly one trillionth that size.

This is a problem because at the end, there are natural terms in the QCD [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] that are able to break the CP-symmetry.

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}-\frac{n_f g^2\theta}{32\pi^2}
F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}+\bar \psi(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m
e^{i\theta'\gamma_5})\psi&lt;/math&gt;

For a nonzero choice of the θ angle and the [[chiral phase]] of the [[quark mass]] θ&amp;prime; one expects the CP-symmetry to be violated. One usually assumes that the chiral quark mass phase can be converted to a contribution to the total effective &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\tilde\theta}&lt;/math&gt; angle, but it remains to be explained why this angle is extremely small instead of being of order one; the particular value of the θ angle that must be very close to zero (in this case) is an example of a [[fine-tuning|fine-tuning problem]] in physics, and is typically solved by [[physics beyond the Standard Model]].

There are several proposed solutions to solve the strong CP problem. The most well-known is [[Peccei–Quinn theory]], involving new [[scalar particle]]s called [[axion]]s. A newer, more radical approach not requiring the axion is a theory involving [[multiple time dimensions|two time dimensions]] first proposed in 1998 by Bars, Deliduman, and Andreev.&lt;ref&gt;

==CP violation and the matter–antimatter imbalance==
{{main|Baryogenesis}}
{{See also|T-symmetry|Arrow of time|Lorentz transformation}}
{{unsolved|physics|Why does the universe have so much more matter than antimatter?}}

The universe is made chiefly of [[matter]], rather than consisting of equal parts of matter and [[antimatter]] as might be expected. It can be demonstrated that, to create an imbalance in matter and antimatter from an initial condition of balance, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied, one of which is the existence of CP violation during the extreme conditions of the first seconds after the [[Big Bang]]. Explanations which do not involve CP violation are less plausible, since they rely on the assumption that the matter–antimatter imbalance was present at the beginning, or on other admittedly exotic assumptions.

The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter if CP-symmetry was preserved; as such, there should have been total cancellation of both—[[protons]] should have cancelled with [[antiproton]]s, [[electrons]] with [[positron]]s, [[neutrons]] with [[antineutron]]s, and so on.  This would have resulted in a sea of radiation in the universe with no matter. Since this is not the case, after the Big Bang, physical laws must have acted differently for matter and antimatter, i.e. violating CP-symmetry.

The [[Standard Model]] contains at least three sources of CP violation. The first of these, involving the [[Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix]] in the [[quark]] sector, has been observed experimentally and can only account for a small portion of the CP violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry. The strong interaction should also violate CP, in principle, but the failure to observe the [[Neutron electric dipole moment|electric dipole moment of the neutron]] in experiments suggests that any CP violation in the strong sector is also too small to account for the necessary CP violation in the early universe. The third source of CP violation is the [[Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix]] in the [[lepton]] sector. The current long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, [[T2K experiment|T2K]] and [[NOνA]], may be able to find evidence of CP violation over a small fraction of possible values of the CP violating Dirac phase while the proposed next-generation experiments, [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] and [[LBNE|DUNE]], will be sensitive enough to definitively observe CP violation over a relatively large fraction of possible values of the Dirac phase. Further into the future, a [[neutrino factory]] could be sensitive to nearly all possible values of the CP violating Dirac phase. If neutrinos are [[Majorana fermion]]s, the [[Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix|PMNS matrix]] could have two additional CP violating Majorana phases, leading to a fourth source of CP violation within the Standard Model. The experimental evidence for Majorana neutrinos would be the observation of [[Neutrinoless double beta decay#Neutrinoless double beta decay|neutrinoless double-beta decay]]. The best limits come from the [[GERmanium Detector Array|GERDA]] experiment. CP violation in the lepton sector generates a matter-antimatter asymmetry through a process called [[Leptogenesis (physics)|leptogenesis]]. This could become the preferred explanation in the Standard Model for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe once CP violation is experimentally confirmed in the lepton sector.

If CP violation in the lepton sector is experimentally determined to be too small to account for matter-antimatter asymmetry, some new [[physics beyond the Standard Model]] would be required to explain additional sources of CP violation. Adding new particles and/or interactions to the Standard Model generally introduces new sources of CP violation since CP is not a symmetry of nature.

Sakharov proposed a way to restore CP-symmetry using T-symmetry, extending spacetime ''before'' the Big Bang. He described complete ''CPT reflections'' of events on each side of what he called the "initial singularity". Because of this, phenomena with an opposite [[arrow of time]] at ''t'' &lt; 0 would undergo an opposite CP violation, so the CP-symmetry would be preserved as a whole. The anomalous excess of matter over antimatter after the Big Bang in the orthochronous (or positive) sector, becomes an excess of antimatter before the Big Bang (antichronous or negative sector) as both charge conjugation, parity and arrow of time are reversed due to CPT reflections of all phenomena occurring over the initial singularity:

{{quote
 |text=We can visualize that neutral spinless maximons (or photons) are produced at ''t'' &lt; 0 from contracting matter having an excess of antiquarks, that they pass "one through the other" at the instant ''t'' = 0 when the density is infinite, and decay with an excess of quarks when ''t'' &gt; 0, realizing total CPT symmetry of the universe. All the phenomena at ''t'' &lt; 0 are assumed in this hypothesis to be CPT reflections of the phenomena at ''t'' &gt; 0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9824">The '''Capital Jury Project'''  (CJP) is a consortium of university-based research studies on the decision-making of [[jurors]] in [[death penalty]] cases in the [[United States]]. It was founded in 1991 and is supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF). The goal of the CJP is to determine whether jurors' [[Capital punishment|sentencing decisions]] conform to the [[United States Constitution|constitution]] and do not reflect  the [[arbitrary|arbitrary decisions]]  the [[United States Supreme Court]] found when it ruled the death penalty [[unconstitutional]] in  ''[[Furman v.

In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[McCleskey v. Kemp]]'' that statistics showed that [[Black people|blacks]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were more likely to be sentenced to [[death]] than [[white people|whites]],  but concluded that the evidence of specific [[racial discrimination]]  in McCleskey's case was lacking so McCleskey's [[death sentence]] was not [[unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=|month=|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/mccleskey.html|title=McCleskey v.

==Protocol==
The CJP is a continuing [[research]] program. Its findings  are based on a standard protocol of   in-depth [[interview]]s with past [[juror]]s in [[capital punishment|capital punishment trials]]. The interviews seek to identify the jury [[decision-making]] throughout a trial and  identify  the ways in which jurors make their  sentencing decisions. The CJP has recently been expanded  to examine  the role played by jurors’ [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in making death penalty decisions.&lt;ref Name="cjp"/&gt;

This work represents a significant advance over prior studies of jury behavior, most of which have been conducted on samples of students who simulated jury behavior in mock trials.&lt;ref name="jaapl"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Data collection]] for CJP is being gathered in the [[U.S. state|states]] that have the most variation in death penalty sentencing. [[Alabama]], [[California]], [[Florida]], Georgia, [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Missouri]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]] and [[Virginia]] were chosen for in-depth juror interviews. As of October, 2007, 1198 jurors from 353 capital trials in 14 [[U.S. state|states]] have been interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Findings==
Weighing factors in a death penalty case and making a decision "[[Legal burden of proof|beyond a reasonable doubt]]" is a complex task with many complicating factors and weighted with moral responsibility. [[Trial]]s are conducted using [[legal terms]] that the jury may not understand. Jurors may be uncertain about their alternatives in making decisions.&lt;ref name="capitalpun"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Jury Instructions: Jurors’ Understandings and Misunderstandings
|publisher=
|accessdate=2007-10-18 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expert witnesses===
The first important paper on the findings of the CJP so far  documents that  jurors  do not rely on [[expert testimony]] to evaluate the [[defendant]]'s [[Risk|dangerousness]] but are influenced by expert testimony regarding the defendant's [[mental illness]] and mental instability. Jurors accept that mental health professionals have expertise on issues of mental illness and tend to accept expert testimony on the subject. However, expert testimony on the potential dangerousness of the defendant was not related to jury opinion. On these issue it appears that jurors rely on common sense since there is no evidence that experts of any kind can predict dangerousness and jurors disregard expert testimony accordingly.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt;

===Race===
The findings also show that [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is a significant factor. If the defendant is [[White people|white]], the jury is more likely to evaluate him as mentally unstable than if he were [[Black people|black]]. Also, the jury was more likely to see the defendant as dangerous if the victim were white.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt;  Some admit overtly to [[racial prejudice]] and some voice seemingly unwitting racially prejudiced beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Death penalty decision-making detailed in prof’s new book
|publisher=
|accessdate=2007-10-18 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted below, the race of the victim plays a substantial role in whether the jury finds [[mitigating factor]]s that would allow a lesser sentence than the death penalty.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt;

===Mitigating factors===
One review of the CJP data showed that jurors who were asked a hypothetical question regarding how much certain [[mitigating factor]]s would influence their sentencing decisions were true, 56.2 percent of the jurors would consider a lesser sentence than death if a history of [[mental illness]] was presented as a [[mitigating factor]] and 73.6 percent would do so if evidence of mental retardation were presented. However, another review of the data showed the race of the victim  had a substantial effect on jury failure to find mitigating factors. If the victim were white there was more failure to find mitigating factors.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt;

===Jury instructions===
There is evidence from the study that jurors are confused or misled by the judge's [[jury instructions|instructions to the jury]].&lt;ref name="publicradio"/&gt; Jurors often appear to make decisions from [[personal experience]] and [[Ethics|personal moral guidelines]] instead. Findings from jurors interviewed show that 50% of the jurors admit to making death penalty decisions before the death [[penalty phase]] of the trial has begun, and 45%   did not understand that they could consider any [[mitigating factor|mitigating evidence]] during the penalty phase, not just the factors listed in the judge's instructions.&lt;ref name="capitalpun"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In fact, one [[researcher]] says that the pattern emerging from the CJP data is that jurors have serious misconceptions about the death penalty process, leading to confusion that produces a [[bias]] in favor of the death penalty, and concludes that the CJP research indicates that the jury decision making process is so flawed that it violated constitutional principles.&lt;ref name="design"&gt;{{cite book

The '''Chem-E-Car Competition''' is an annual college competition for students majoring in [[Chemical Engineering]]. 

According to the competition's official rules, students must design small-scale [[automobile]]s that operate by [[chemical reaction|chemical]] means, along with a poster describing their research. During the competition, they must drive their car a fixed distance (judged on how close the car is to the finish line) down a wedge-shaped course in order to demonstrate its capabilities. In addition to driving a specified distance, they must also hold a payload of 0-500 mL of water. The exact distance (15-30 meters) and payload is revealed to the participants one hour before the competition. The size of designed cars cannot exceed certain specifications and cars must operate using "[[environmentally friendly|green]]" methods, which do not release any pollution or waste in the form of a visible liquid or gas, such as [[exhaust gas|exhaust]]. The dimensions of the car are to be within 20x30x40 cm.{{dubious|date=October 2013}} This competition is hosted in the United States by the AIChE ([[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]]), and winners of the competitions receive various awards, depending on how they placed.&lt;ref name="AIChE"&gt;[http://www.aiche.org/sites/default/files/docs/pages/chem_e_car_official_rules_2014_final-final.docx Chem-E-Car Official Rules 2014], American Institute of Chemical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The competition has various rules:&lt;ref name="AIChE" /&gt;
* The only energy source for the propulsion of the car is a chemical reaction. No liquid discharge is allowed. No obnoxious odor discharge is allowed.
* No commercial batteries are allowed as the power source.
* The stopping mechanism has to be controlled by a chemical reaction. No brakes, mechanical or electronic timing devices are allowed.
* All components of the car must fit into a box of dimensions no larger than 40&amp;nbsp;cm x 30&amp;nbsp;cm x 20&amp;nbsp;cm (shoebox-sized). The car may be disassembled to meet this requirement.
* The cost of the contents of the "shoe box" and the chemicals must not exceed $2,000. The vehicle cost includes the donated cost of any equipment. The time donated by university machine shops and other personnel will not be included in the total price of the car. It is expected that every university has equal access to these resources. The cost of pressure testing is also not included in the capital cost of the car.

==Poster==
Each car is required to have a poster board explaining how the car runs (power source), some of its specific features, and how it's environmentally friendly. Judges score these posters on four different things: the description of the chemical reaction and power source (20%), the creativity of the design and its unique features (20%), environment and safety features (40%), and the overall quality of the poster, along with the team's presentation (20%). Only posters judged with a score of 70% or above may move on to the performance competition. &lt;ref name="AIChE" /&gt;

==Example reactions==
Some ideas for chemical reactions have been using pressurized air (creating oxygen through a chemical reaction and allowing it to build pressure) or using electricity created by the dissolving of metals in certain acids (basic battery). One pedantic idea by Cooper Union was to use a [[fuel cell]]&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Paul.[https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/04/fuel-cell-powered-chem-e-car-tears-its-way-through-the-halls-of/ "Fuel cell-powered Chem-E-Car tears its way through the halls of Cooper Union."].&lt;/ref&gt; (a cell that converts fuel to electricity via an electrochemical reaction) to power their car. 

Winners in this competition aren't determined by whether their car is faster or more powerful, but how accurate their chemical reaction to stop their vehicle is. This is quite difficult, especially when the load the car must carry and distance it has to travel are unknown until the day of the competition. So teams must find a method that is flexible enough to fit a range of payloads and distances, and reliable enough so it doesn't fail with real world variables ([[temperature]], [[humidity]], track roughness, changes in elevation, etc.). Winners in the past have had a variety of ways of dealing with this problem, such as an [[iodine clock reaction]].&lt;ref name="Iodine Clock"&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/11/cheme-car-zapdos-wins-national-competition ChemE car Zapdos takes first place at nationals], Cornell Chronicle, Cornell University.&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction works by using two clear [[solution]]s (many variations) that change color after a time delay (the exact time can be found experimentally). When applied to the car, the team used a simple [[image sensor]] that could tell when the solutions changed color, at which point the cars power would shut off by cutting the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7M_9M1Ap88 "Chem E Car Video"]&lt;/ref&gt; While the process itself is somewhat simple, accounting for the unknown variables like the payload and distance is quite difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3165">The '''contagion heuristic''' is a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|psychological heuristic]] leading people to avoid contact with people or objects viewed as "contaminated" by previous contact with someone or something viewed as bad—or, less often, to seek contact with objects that have been in contact with people or things considered good. For example, we tend to view food that has touched the ground as contaminated by the ground, and therefore unfit to eat, or we view a person who has touched a diseased person as likely to carry the disease (regardless of the actual contagiousness of the disease).

The contagion heuristic includes "[[magical thinking]]", such as viewing a sweater worn by [[Adolf Hitler]] as bearing his negative essence and capable of transmitting it to another wearer. The perception of essence-transfer extends to [[ritual]]s to purify items viewed as spiritually contaminated, such as having [[Mother Teresa]] wear Hitler's sweater to counteract his essence.&lt;ref&gt;''Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgement'' by [[Daniel Kahneman]], p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inattention.''' Inattention is like the Freudian defense mechanism of denial, except that it may be much more passive. We simply do not think much about the interpersonal history of most objects we deal with. When we receive change in the store, we do not think of the long string of humans, no doubt some unsavory, who handled it previously; likewise for the interpersonal history of a public bathroom doorknob or a seat on a train. The domains of inattention vary across individuals and across cultures. For example, the contamination produced by the bottoms of shoes bringing outside filth into the home is salient for most Japanese, but not attended to by most Americans. 

'''Ritual rules.''' Typically in religious systems, problems of contagion may be handled by establishing rituals to decontaminate and setting limits on the range of contamination. Such rules seem most prevalent in Judaism and Hinduism. 
A particularly clear example of a ritual boundary is the 1/60th rule of Kashrut, relating to contamination of kosher foods by non-kosher entities (Nemeroff &amp; Rozin, 1992). According to this rule, if contamination occurs by accident and the contaminant is less than 1/60th of the total volume of the contaminated entity, the food remains kosher.&lt;ref&gt;Heuristics and Biases - The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment Edited by THOMAS GILOVICH, Cornell University DALE GRIFFIN, Stanford University DANIEL KAHNEMAN, Princeton University (page 213)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Control theory''' in [[sociology]] is the idea that two control systems—inner controls and outer controls—work against our tendencies to deviate. Control theory can either be classified as [[centralized]] or [[decentralized]] or neither.  Decentralized control is considered [[Market (economics)|market]] control.  Centralized control is considered [[bureaucratic]] control.  Some types of control such as [[clan]] control are considered to be a mixture of both decentralized and centralized control.

Decentralized control or market control is typically maintained through factors such as [[price]], [[competition]], or [[market share]]. Centralized control such as bureaucratic control is typically maintained through [[Administration of business|administrative]] or [[hierarchical]] techniques such as creating standards or policies.  An example of mixed control is clan control which has characteristics of both centralized and decentralized control.  Mixed control or clan control is typically maintained by keeping a set of [[value (ethics)|value]]s and beliefs or norms and traditions.

Containment theory, as developed by [[Walter Reckless]] in 1973, states that behavior is caused not by outside stimuli, but by what a person wants most at any given time.  According to the control theory, weaker containing social systems result in more [[deviant]] behavior.

Control theory stresses how weak bonds between the [[individual]]s and [[society]] free people to deviate or go against the norms, or the people who have weak ties would engage in [[crime]]s so they could benefit, or gain something that is to their own interest. This is where strong bonds make deviance more costly. Deviant acts appear attractive to individuals but social bonds stop most people from committing the acts. Deviance is a result from extensive exposure to certain social situations where individuals develop behaviors that attract them to avoid [[conform]]ing to social norms. Social bonds are used in control theory to help individuals from going after these attractive deviations.

According to [[Travis Hirschi]], humans are selfish beings, who make decisions based on which choice will give the greatest benefit.  A good example of control theory would be that people go to [[Employment|work]]. Most people do not want to go to work, but they do, because they get paid, to obtain food, water, shelter, and clothing.

Hirschi (1969) identifies four elements of social bonds: attachment, commitment, involvement, and belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirschi, Travis |title=Causes of Delinquency |isbn=978-0-520-01901-0|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spectrophotometer.jpg|thumb|right|DU Spectrophotometer, National Technical Laboratories, 1947]]

The '''DU spectrophotometer''' or '''Beckman DU''', introduced in 1941, was the first commercially viable [[scientific instrument]] for measuring the amount of [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] absorbed by a substance. This model of [[spectrophotometer]] enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its [[absorption spectrum]], the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. [[Arnold Orville Beckman|Arnold O. Beckman]]'s [[National Technical Laboratories]] (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.

Sometimes referred to as a UV–Vis spectrophotometer because it measured both the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] spectra, the DU spectrophotometer is credited as being a truly revolutionary technology. It yielded more accurate results than previous methods for determining the [[chemical composition]] of a complex substance, and substantially reduced the time needed for an accurate analysis from weeks or hours to minutes. The Beckman DU was essential to several critical secret research projects during [[World War II]], including the development of [[penicillin]] and [[synthetic rubber]].

==Background==
Before the development of the DU spectrophotometer, analysis of a test sample to determine its components was a long, costly, and often inaccurate process. A classical [[Wet chemistry|wet laboratory]] contained a wide variety of complicated apparatus.&lt;ref name="Dulski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dulski|first1=Thomas R.|title=A manual for the chemical analysis of metals|date=1996|publisher=ASTM|location=West Conshohocken, PA|isbn=978-0-8031-2066-2|chapter=The Wet Lab|pages=11–14|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ViOMjoLKB1gC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test samples were run through a series of awkward and time-consuming [[Qualitative research|qualitative processes]] to separate out and identify their components. Determining [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] concentrations of those components in the sample involved further steps. Processes could involve techniques for [[chemical reactions]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitations]], [[filtration]]s and [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolutions]].&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{cite book

Spectroscopic methods for observing the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]] were known as early as the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Peter J. T.|last2=Travis|first2=Anthony S.|chapter=The role of physical instrumentation in structural organic chemistry in the twentieth century|editor-last1=Morris|editor-first1=Peter J.

Scientists had observed that light traveling through a [[Optical medium|medium]] would be absorbed at different wavelengths, depending on the matter-composition of the medium involved. A white light source would emit light at multiple wavelengths over a range of frequencies. A prism could be used to separate a light source into specific wavelengths. Shining the light through a sample of a material would cause some wavelengths of light to be absorbed, while others would be unaffected and continue to be transmitted. Wavelengths in the resulting [[absorption spectrum]] would differ depending upon the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] composition if the material involved.&lt;ref name="MMSU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Experiment 10|url=http://www.pa.msu.edu/courses/2013spring/PHY252/Lab10.pdf|website=MMSU Physics and Astronomy Department|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Daniel C.|last2=Bertolucci|first2=Michael D.|title=Symmetry and spectroscopy : an introduction to vibrational and electronic spectroscopy|date=1989|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-66144-5|edition=Reprint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3W6oSaRlMsC&amp;pg=PA66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollas|first1=J. Michael|title=Modern spectroscopy|date=2004|publisher=J. Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-84416-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectroscopic methods were predominantly used by [[physicists]] and [[astrophysicists]]. Spectroscopic techniques were rarely taught in chemistry classes and were unfamiliar to most practicing chemists. Beginning around 1904, Frank Twyman of the London instrument making firm Adam Hilger, Ltd. tried to develop spectroscopic instruments for chemists, but his customer base was consistently made up of physicists rather than chemists.
&lt;ref name="Bigg"/&gt;{{rp|113–118}} By the 1930s he had developed a [[niche market]] in [[metallurgy]], where his instruments were well adapted to the types of problems that chemists were solving.&lt;ref name="Bigg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bigg|first1=Charlotte|chapter=Adam Hilger, Ltd and the Development of Spectrochemical Analysis|editor-last1=Morris|editor-first1=Peter J. T.|title=From classical to modern chemistry : the instrumental revolution|date=2002|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-85404-479-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AAf8sk_v2SEC&amp;pg=PA113|pages=111–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|124}}

By the 1940s, both academic and industrial chemists were becoming increasingly interested in problems involving the composition and detection of [[Biomolecule|biological molecules]]. Biological molecules, including [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]], absorb light energy in both the [[ultraviolet]] and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] range.&lt;ref name=Smutzer/&gt; The spectrum of visible light was not broad enough to enable scientists to examine substances such as [[vitamin A]].&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"/&gt; Accurate characterization of complex samples, particularly of biological materials, would require the accurate reading of absorption frequencies in the ultraviolet and [[infrared]] (IR) sections of the spectrum in addition to visible light. Existing instruments such as the [[Central Scientific Company|Cenco]] "Spectrophotelometer" and the Coleman Model DM Spectrophotometer could not be effectively used to examine wavelengths in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt;

The array of equipment needed to measure light energy reaching beyond the visible spectrum towards the ultraviolet could cost a laboratory as much as $3,000, a huge amount in 1940.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|149}} Repeated readings of a sample were taken to produce [[photographic plates]] showing the absorption spectrum of a material at different wavelengths. An experienced human could compare these to the known images to identify a match. Then information from the plates had to be combined to create a graph showing the spectrum as a whole. Ultimately, the accuracy of such approaches was dependent on accurate, consistent development of the photographic plates, and on human [[visual acuity]] and practice in reading the wavelengths.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|150–151}}

==Development==
The DU was developed at National Technical Laboratories (later [[Beckman Instruments]]) under the direction of [[Arnold Orville Beckman]], an American chemist and inventor.&lt;ref name="Gallwas"&gt;{{cite journal

Coleman Instruments had recently coupled a [[pH meter]] with an optical [[phototube]] unit to examine the visual spectrum (the Coleman Model DM).&lt;ref name=Smutzer/&gt; Beckman had already developed a successful pH meter for measuring acidity of solutions, his company's breakthrough product. Seeing the potential to build upon their existing expertise, Beckman made it a goal to create an easy-to-use integrated instrument which would both register and report specific wavelengths extending into the ultraviolet range. Rather than depending on development of photographic plates, or a human observer's visual ability to detect wavelengths in the absorption spectrum, phototubes would be used to register and report the specific wavelengths that were detected.

The first prototype Beckman spectrophotometer, the Model A, was created at National Technologies Laboratories in 1940. It used a [[tungsten]] light source with a glass [[Fery prism]] as a [[monochromator]].&lt;ref name="Belser"&gt;{{cite web

Tungsten lamps were useful in the visible light range but gave poor coverage in the ultraviolet range. However, they had the advantage of being readily available because they were used as automobile [[headlamps]].&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}} An external amplifier from the Beckman pH meter and a [[vacuum tube]] photocell were used to detect wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

===Model B (prototype) ===
[[File:Quartz-tcq01a.jpg|thumb|right|Optical quality quartz crystals]]
It was quickly realized that a glass [[dispersive prism]] was not suitable for use in the ultraviolet spectrum.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 [[Nanometre|millimicrons]] rather than dispersing it.&lt;ref name="Bisen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bisen|first1=Prakash S.|last2=Sharma|first2=Anjana|title=Introduction to instrumentation in life sciences|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4665-1240-5|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1HOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Model B, a [[quartz]] prism was substituted for the earlier glass.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

A tangent bar mechanism was used to adjust the monochromator. The mechanism was highly sensitive and required a skilled operator.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Only two Model B prototypes were made. One was sold: in February 1941, to the [[University of California]] Chemistry department in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}

The Model B prototype should be distinguished from a later production model of spectrophotometer that was also referred to as the Model "B". The production Model "B" was introduced in 1949 as a less-expensive, simple-to-use alternative to the Beckman DU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheSpectrophotometers That Would Not Die|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/599/2/Spectrophotometers.pdf|website=Caltech|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a glass Fery prism as a chromator and operated in a narrower range, roughly from 320 millimicrons to 950 millimicrons, and 5 to 20 [[Angstrom|Å]].&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glover|first1=J.|editor-last1=Paech|editor-first1=K.|editor-last2=Tracey|editor-first2=M.

===Model C (prototype) ===
Three Model C instruments were then built, improving the instrument's wavelength resolution. The Model B's rotary cell compartment was replaced with a linear sample chamber. The tangent bar mechanism was replaced by a scroll drive mechanism,&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} which could be more precisely controlled to reset the quartz prism and select the desired wavelength.&lt;ref name="Smutzer"/&gt; With this new mechanism, results could be more easily and reliably obtained, without requiring a highly skilled operator. This set the pattern for all of Beckman's later quartz prism instruments.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Although only three Model B prototypes were built, all were sold, one to [[Caltech]] and the other two to companies in the food industry.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}

===Model D (limited production) ===
[[File:Cary+Beckman 1941 original of Fig 6 Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer 2012-002 b17f20 001 crop.jpg | thumb|right | Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer, Cary &amp; Beckman, 1941&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|687}}]]

The A, B, and C prototype models all coupled an external Beckman pH meter to the optical component to obtain readouts. In developing the Model D, Beckman took the [[direct-coupled amplifier]] circuit from the pH meter and combined the optical and electronic components in a single housing, making it more economical.&lt;ref name="Smutzer"/&gt;

Moving from a prototype to production of the Model D involved challenges. 
Beckman originally approached [[Bausch and Lomb]] about making quartz prisms for the spectrophotometer. When they turned down the opportunity, National Technical Laboratories designed its own optical system, including both a control mechanism and a quartz prism. Large, high optical quality quartz suitable for creating prisms was difficult to obtain. It came from Brazil, and was in demand for wartime [[Crystal oscillator|radio oscillators]]. Beckman had to obtain a wartime priority listing for the spectrophotometer to get access to suitable quartz supplies.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Beckman had previously attempted to find a source of reliable [[Deuterium arc lamp|hydrogen lamps]], seeking better sensitivity to wavelengths in the ultraviolet range than was possible with tungsten. As described in July 1941, the Beckman spectrophotomter could use a "hot cathode hydrogen discharge tube" or a tungsten light source interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|684–685}} However, Beckman was still unsatisfied with the available hydrogen lamps. National Technical Laboratories designed its own hydrogen lamp, an [[anode]] enclosed in a thin blown-glass window.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}} By December 1941, the in-house design was being used in production of the Model D.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|154–155}}

The instrument's design also required a more sensitive phototube than was commercially available at that time. Beckman was able to obtain small batches of an experimental phototube from [[RCA]] for the first Model D instruments.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

The Model D spectrophotometer, using the experimental RCA phototube, was shown at [[MIT]]'s Summer Conference on Spectroscopy in July 1941. The paper that Cary and Beckman presented there was published in the ''Journal of the Optical Society of America''. In it, Cary and Beckman compared designs for a modified [[Collimated light|self-collimating]] quartz Fery prism, a mirror-collimated quartz [[Littrow prism]], and various gratings.&lt;ref name="Cary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cary|first1=H. H.|last2=Beckman|first2=Arnold O.|title=A Quartz Photoelectric Spectrophotometer|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|date=1941|volume=31|issue=11|pages=682–689 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.31.000682|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/josa/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-31-11-682}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|683}} The Littrow prism was a half-prism, which had a mirrored face.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;{{rp|31–34}} Use of a tungsten light source with the [[quartz]] Littrow prism as a monochromator was reported to minimize light scattering within the instrument.&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|686}}

The Model D was the first model to enter actual production. A small number of Model D instruments were sold, beginning in July 1941, before it was superseded by the DU.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

===Model DU===
[[File:Cary+Beckman 1941 original of Fig 7 disassembled Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer 2012-002 b17f20 003 crop.jpg | thumb|right | Disassembled absorption cell and photo-tube compartment, Cary &amp; Beckman, 1941&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|687}}]]

When RCA could not meet Beckman's demand for experimental phototubes, National Technical Laboratories again had to design its own components in-house.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|18}} They developed a pair of phototubes, sensitive to the red and blue areas of the spectrum, capable of amplifying the signals they received.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"/&gt;{{rp|230}} With the incorporation of Beckman's UV-sensitive phototubes, the Model D became the Model DU UV–Vis spectrophotometer.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|18}} Its designation as a "UV–Vis" spectrophotometer indicates its ability to measure light in both the visible and ultraviolet spectra.&lt;ref name=Buie/&gt;

The DU was the first commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|148}} &lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;{{rp|10}} As he had done with the pH meter, Beckman had replaced an array of complicated equipment with a single, easy-to-use instrument. One of the first fully integrated instruments&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|11}} or "[[black box]]es" used in modern chemical laboratories,&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visible Proofs: Forensic Views of the Body|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/spectral_image_5.html|website=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it sold for $723 in 1941.&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt;

It is generally assumed that the "DU" in the name was a combination of "D" for the Model D on which it was based, and "U" for the ultraviolet spectrum. However, it has been suggested that "DU" may also reference Beckman's fraternity at the University of Illinois, [[Delta Upsilon Fraternity House (Champaign, Illinois)|Delta Upsilon]], whose members were called "DU"s.&lt;ref name="ISL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beckman Model DU Quartz Spectrophotometer|url=http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/Arnold_inventions/Spectrophotometer/Spectrophotometer.html|website=Illinois Simulator Laboratory|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A publication in the scholarly literature compared the optical quality of the DU to the [[Cary 14 Spectrophotometer]], another leading UV–Vis spectrophotometer of the time.&lt;ref name="JOS1953"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brode|first1=Wallace R.|last2=Gould|first2=John H.|last3=Whitney|first3=James E.|last4=Wyman|first4=George M.|title=A Comparative Survey of Spectrophotometers in the 210–760 mμ Region|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|date=October 1953|volume=43|issue=10|pages=862–865|bibcode=1953JOSA...43..862B|doi=10.1364/JOSA.43.000862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;
From 1941 until 1976, when it was discontinued, the Model DU spectrophotometer was built upon what was essentially the same design.&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt; It was a single beam instrument.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Trace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dulski|first1=Thomas R.|title=Trace elemental analysis of metals : methods and techniques|date=1999|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-1985-2|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk7lTgTMEIEC&amp;pg=PA195|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The DU spectrophotometers used a quartz prism to separate light from a lamp into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. This allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance to obtain a standardized "fingerprint" characteristic of a compound.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|151}} &lt;ref name="Jarnutowski"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarnutowski|first1=R.|last2=Ferraro|first2=J.

{{quote|"Light from the tungsten lamp is focused by the condensing mirror and directed in a beam to the diagonal slit entrance mirror. The entrance mirror deflects the light through the entrance slit and into the monochromator to the collimating mirror. Light falling on the collimating mirror is rendered parallel and reflected to the quartz prism where it undergoes refraction. The back surface of the prism is aluminized so that light refracted at the first surface is reflected back through the prism, undergoing further refraction as it emerges from the prism. The desired wavelength of light is selected by rotating the Wavelength Selector which adjusts the position of the prism. The spectrum is directed back to the collimating mirror which centers the chosen wavelength on the exit slit and sample. Light passing through the sample strikes the phototube, causing a current gain. The current gain is amplified and registered on the null meter." Model DU Optical System&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}} }}

Although the default light source for the instrument was tungsten, a hydrogen or [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury lamp]] could be substituted depending on the optimal range of measurement for which the instrument was to be used.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"&gt;{{cite book|title=Beckman Instruments Instruction Manual : The Beckman Model DU Spectrophotometer and Accessories|date=1954|publisher=Beckman Instruments, Inc.|location=Fullerton, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|3}} The tungsten lamp was suitable for transmittance of wavelengths between 320 and 1000 millimicrons; the hydrogen lamp for 220 to 320 millimicrons, and the mercury lamp for checking the calibration of the spectrophotometer.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

As advertised in the 1941 News Edition of the American Chemical Society, the Beckman Spectrophotometer used an [[Autocollimation|autocollimating]] quartz crystal prism for a monochromator, capable of covering a range from the ultraviolet (200 millimicrons) to the infrared (2000 millimicrons), with a nominal bandwidth of 2 millimicrons or less for most of its spectral range. The slit mechanism was continuously adjustable from .01 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm and claimed to have less than 1/10% of stray light over most of the spectral range. It featured an easy-to-read wavelength scale, simultaneously reporting % Transmission and Density information.&lt;ref name="Advertisement"/&gt;

The sample holder held up to 4 cells.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Advertisement"/&gt; Cells could be moved into the light path via an external control, allowing the user to take multiple readings without opening the cell compartment.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}} As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a sample were made in comparison to a [[Blank (solution)|blank]], or [[Standard solution|standard]], "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent."&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|24}} The standard could be a cell filled with a [[solvent]] such as [[distilled water]]&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|24}} or a prepared solvent of a known concentration.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=James W.|title=Atomic spectroscopy|date=1996|publisher=Dekker|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-9742-3|pages=30–33|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNqp0RO7DXcC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30–31}} At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, [[transmittance]], to be obtained. For quantitative measurements transmittance is converted to [[absorbance]] which is proportional to the solute concentration according to [[Beer's law]]. This makes possible the quantitative determination of the amount of a substance in solution.&lt;ref name="Drees"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Bishop|editor-first1=Michael L.|editor-last2=Fody|editor-first2=Edward P. | editor-first3=Larry E. |editor-last3=Schoeff|last2=Wu|first2=Alan H.

The user could also switch between phototubes without removing the sample holder. A 1941 advertisement indicates that three types of phototubes were available, with maximum sensitivity to red, blue and ultraviolet light ranges.&lt;ref name="Advertisement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Announcing an Important New Beckman Development THE BECKMAN Spectrophotometer|work=News Edition of the American Chemical Society|page=NA|agency=American Chemical Society|date=September 25, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1954 DU spectrophotometer differs in that it claims to be useful from 200 to 1000 millimicrons,&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|2}} and does not mention the ultraviolet phototube.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The wavelength selector, however, still ranged from 200 to 2000 millimicrons.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|4}} and an "Ultraviolet accessory set" was available.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|25}} This shift away from using the DU for infrared measurement is understandable, since by 1954 Beckman Instruments was marketing a separate infrared spectrophotometer. Beckman developed the IR-1 infrared spectrophotometer during World War II, and redesigned it as the IR-4 between 1953 and 1956.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|165}}&lt;ref name="Pillsbury"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

The DU enabled researchers to perform easier analysis of substances by quickly taking measurements at more than one wavelength to produce an absorption spectrum describing the complete substance. For example, the standard method of analysis of the [[vitamin A]] content of [[shark liver oil]], before the introduction of the DU spectrophotometer, involved feeding the oil to rats for 21 days, then cutting off the rats' tails and examining their bone structure. With the DU's UV technology, vitamin A content of shark liver oil could be determined directly in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="Pillsbury"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

The Scripps Research Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology credit the DU with improving both accuracy and speed of chemical analysis. MIT states: "This device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis, by allowing researchers to perform a 99.9% accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes, as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only 25% accuracy."&lt;ref name="Scripps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;

Organic chemist and philosopher of science [[Theodore L. Brown]] states that it "revolutionized the measurement of light signals from samples".&lt;ref name=Brown2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Theodore L.|title=Bridging divides : the origins of the Beckman Institute at Illinois|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Urbana|isbn=978-0-252-03484-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Nobel laureate [[Bruce Merrifield]] is quoted as calling the DU spectrophotometer "probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of [[bioscience]]."&lt;ref name=Simoni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simoni|first1=Robert D.|last2=Hill|first2=Robert L.|last3=Vaughan|first3=Martha|last4=Tabor|first4=Herbert|title=A Classic Instrument: The Beckman DU Spectrophotometer and Its Inventor, Arnold O.

For the Beckman company, the DU was one of three foundational inventions – the [[pH meter]], the DU spectrophotometer, and the [[helipot potentiometer]] – that established the company on a secure financial basis and enabled it to expand.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=https://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/wsr/company/about-us/our-history/index.htm|website=Beckman Coulter|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamins===
Development of the spectrophotometer had direct relevance to World War II and the American war effort. The role of vitamins in health was of significant concern, as scientists wanted to identify [[Vitamin A]]-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy. Previous methods of assessing Vitamin A levels involved feeding rats a food for several weeks and then performing a biopsy to estimate ingested Vitamin A levels. In contrast, examining a food sample with a DU spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name=LabNews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Andrew|title=Leading the way in chemical instrumentation|journal=Laboratory News|date=September 21, 2007|url=http://www.labnews.co.uk/features/leading-the-way-in-chemical-instrumentation/|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DU spectrophotometer could be used to study both vitamin A and its precursor [[carotenoids]],&lt;ref name="Avampato"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avampato|first1=J.E.|last2=Eaton|first2=H.D.|title=Comparison of Methods for the Estimation of Vitamin A in Calf Plasma|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|date=August 1953|volume=36|issue=8|pages=783–793|doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(53)91563-X|url=http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(53)91563-X/abstract|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rapidly became the preferred method of spectrophotometric analysis.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"&gt;{{cite journal

===Penicillin===
The DU spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name=Smutzer&gt;{{cite news|last=Smutzer|first=Gregory|title=Spectrophotometers: An Absorbing Tale|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=The Scientist|date=October 15, 2001|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/13639/title/Spectrophotometers--An-Absorbing-Tale/|quote="The DU spectrophotometer was extensively used in the mass production of penicillin."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrocarbons===
The DU spectrophotometer was also used for critical analysis of [[hydrocarbons]]. A number of hydrocarbons were of interest to the war effort. [[Toluene]], a hydrocarbon in [[crude oil]], was used in production of [[TNT]] for military use.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|158–159}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|19}} [[Benzene]] and [[butadienes]] were used in the production of [[synthetic rubber]].&lt;ref name="Henglein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henglein|first1=F.

===Enzyme assays and DNA research===
[[Gerty Cori]] and her husband [[Carl Ferdinand Cori]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1947 in recognition of their work on [[enzymes]]. They made several discoveries critical to understanding [[carbohydrate metabolism]], including the isolation and discovery of the [[Cori ester]], [[glucose 1-phosphate]], and the understanding of the [[Cori cycle]]. They determined that the enzyme [[phosphorylase]] catalyzes formation of glucose 1-phosphate, which is the beginning and ending step in the conversions of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]] and [[blood glucose]] to glycogen. Gerty Cori was also the first to show that a defect in an enzyme can be the cause of a human genetic disease.&lt;ref name=Smeltzer&gt;{{cite book|last=Smeltzer|first=Ronald K.|title=Extraordinary Women in Science &amp; Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement|year=2013|publisher=The Grolier Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beckman DU spectrophotometer was used in the Cori laboratory to calculate enzyme concentrations, including phosphorylase.&lt;ref name="Cori"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cori|first1=Carl F.|last2=Illingworth|first2=Barbara|title=The prosthetic group of phosphorylase|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=July 15, 1957|volume=43|issue=7|pages=547–552|pmc=528497|bibcode = 1957PNAS...43..547C |doi = 10.1073/pnas.43.7.547|pmid=16590054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another researcher who spent six months in 1947 at the Cori laboratory, "the most vibrant place in biochemistry" at that time, was [[Arthur Kornberg]].&lt;ref name="Teachers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kornberg|first1=Arthur|title=Remembering Our Teachers|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=January 5, 2001|volume=276|pages=3–11|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/276/1/3|accessdate=17 March 2016|pmid=11134064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kornberg was already familiar with the DU spectrophotometer, which he had used at [[Severo Ochoa]]'s laboratory at [[New York University]].

Kornberg used it to purify [[aconitase]], an enzyme in the [[citric acid cycle]].&lt;ref name="Teachers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exton"/&gt;

He further demonstrated that the relative amounts of guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine varied between species. In 1952, Chargaff met [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D.

==Later models==

The Beckman team eventually developed additional models, as well as a number of accessories or attachments which could be used to modify the DU for different types of work. One of the first accessories was a flame attachment with a more powerful photo multiplier to enable the user to examine flames such as [[potassium]], [[sodium]] and [[cesium]] (1947).&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Kenneth|editor-last=Berl|editor-first=Walter G.|title=Physical Methods in Chemical Analysis|date=1956|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4832-5563-7|chapter=Flame photometry|pages=219–290|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSsXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|230}}

In the 1950s, Beckman Instruments developed the DR and the DK, both of which were double-beam ultraviolet spectrophotometers. The DK was named for [[Wilbur I. Kaye]], who developed it by modifying the DU to expand its range into the near-infrared.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; He did the initial work while at Tennessee [[Eastman Kodak]], and later was hired by Beckman Instruments.&lt;ref name=Kaye&gt;{{cite book|first1= Arnold |last1=Thackray |last2= Gallwas|first2= Gerald E.|title=Wilbur I.

The DK-1 used a non-linear scroll, and the DK-2 used a linear scroll to automatically record the spectra.&lt;ref name=Kaye/&gt;{{rp|21}}

The DR incorporated a "robot operator" which would reset the knobs on the DU to complete a sequence of measurements at different wavelengths, just like a human operator would to generate results for a full spectrum. It used a linear shuttle with four positions, and a superstructure to change the knobs. It had a moving chart recorder to plot results, with red, green and black dots.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; The price of recording spectrophotometers was substantially higher than non-recording machines.&lt;ref name="Krige"&gt;{{cite book

'''Deep ocean water''' (DOW) is the name for cold, salty [[water]] found deep below the surface of [[Ocean|Earth's oceans]].  Ocean water differs in [[temperature]] and [[salinity]]. Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ocean Stratification|url=http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/o_strat.html|website=The Climate System|publisher=Columbia Univ.|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in polar regions, the upper layers of ocean water are cold and fresh.&lt;ref name=Meltdown&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hidden Meltdown of Greenland|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2015/28aug_greenland/|website=Nasa Science/Science News|publisher=NASA|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deep ocean water makes up about 90% of the volume of the oceans. Deep ocean water has a very uniform temperature, around 0-3{{nbsp}}°C, and a salinity of about 3.5% or as [[Oceanography|oceanographers]] state as 35 ppt (parts per thousand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Water/temp.html|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] |accessdate=2012-09-05 |title=Temperature of Ocean Water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In specialized locations such as the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii [[NELHA]] ocean water is pumped to the surface from approximately 900 metres (3000 feet) deep for applications in research, commercial and pre-commercial activities.  DOW is typically used to describe ocean water at sub-thermal depths sufficient to provide a measurable difference in water temperature.

When deep ocean water is brought to the surface, it can be used for a variety of things. Its most useful property is its temperature. At the surface of the Earth, most water and air is well above 3&amp;nbsp;°C. The difference in temperature is indicative of a difference in [[energy]]. Where there is an energy [[gradient]], skillful application of engineering can harness that energy for productive use by humans. Assuming the source of deep ocean water is environmentally friendly and replenished by natural mechanisms, it forms a more innovative basis for cleaner energy than current fossil-fuel-derived energy.

The simplest use of cold water is for [[air conditioning]]: using the cold water itself to cool air saves the energy that would be used by the compressors for traditional [[refrigeration]]. Another use could be to replace expensive [[desalination]] plants. When cold water passes through a pipe surrounded by humid air, condensation results. The condensate is pure [[water]], suitable for humans to drink or for crop [[irrigation]]. Via a technology called [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]], the temperature difference can be turned into electricity.

==Cold-bed agriculture==

During condensation or Ocean thermal energy conservation operations, the water does not reach [[ambient temperature]], because a certain temperature gradient is required to make these processes viable. The water leaving those operations is therefore still colder than the surroundings, and a further benefit can be extracted by passing this water through underground pipes, thereby cooling agricultural soil. This reduces evaporation, and even causes water to condense from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energinat - DOW Technologies - Cold Agriculture|url=http://www.energinat.com/dow_cold.shtml|website=www.energinat.com|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows agricultural production where crops would normally not be able to grow. This technique is sometimes referred to as "cold agriculture"&lt;ref&gt;[http://nelha.hawaii.gov/event/west-hawaii-tech-pau-hana-4/ West Hawaii Tech Pau Hana]&lt;/ref&gt; or "cold-bed agriculture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is OTEC|url=http://www.otecnews.org/what-is-otec/|website=OTEC News|publisher=the OTEC foundation|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Sueño de Arquímedes''' was a Spanish science podcast and radio program which was broadcast by [[Radio Nacional de España|Radio Nacional de España (RNE)]] from September 2006 until June, 2007. The program was created by [[Ángel Rodríguez Lozano]]. A total of 35 programs are still available for download. In addition to El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano also hosted [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]], which was broadcast weekly without interruption from April 1995 until June 2007. The name of the program means "the dream of [[Archimedes]]", and alludes to Archimedes' statement that given a [[lever]] and a fixed point, he could move the world. To Ángel Rodríguez Lozano, the dream was moving the world by popularizing and sharing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ ¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano.] First published 30 June 2007.''"Arquímedes, lo que propuso fue que con una palanca podía mover el mundo. Para mi, El sueño de Arquímedes era simplemente mover el mundo divulgando y repartiendo conocimiento."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Before the startup of El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano had been hosting Vanguardia de la Ciencia for more than a decade. When RNE
asked if he would host a second popular science program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano realised that the scheduled timing, Sundays between 3 and 4 p.m, meant that it would be sandwiched between sports broadcasts. Therefore, he would have to capture the attention of listeners who were not looking for this type of program. The intention was therefore to make the program even more accessible than Vanguardia de la Ciencia, with shorter interviews and more music. Ángel Rodríguez Lozano stated that it had been a marvellous experience, and that the response had been tremendous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ |title=¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano |publisher=Dimetu.com |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program included science news, interviews, and biographies of great scientists, written by [http://www.rtve.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605dceedec15a322702dd41da976ac96c4395def1e9f8e232e7869bb1c304bb715731b852947013e5ad675ccaeddfc4875cdea9bcd15f8880681 Carmen Buergo]. In the final, humorous section of the program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano paid a visit to the archetypical [[mad scientist]]
[http://www.ciencia.rne.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605d5391d7ca78deb60dc51e84fc79f34cf020766f1ed143c396b5d1b644b9b60d9d0e1aa0b6615df94332359e92d8b381cbb51cf1d8bab454cc Alejandro Laguna], who supposedly lived and worked in a hidden laboratory in the basements of Radio Nacional de España, seven floors below ground level. Alejandro would demonstrate one of his latest inventions, which usually defied the laws of physics, and Ángel played the role of a rather gullible spectator. Alejandro then explained the physics of the corresponding real-world device. Finally, the demonstration of his invention usually had some highly unpleasant consequence for Ángel.

==Termination of El Sueño de Arquímedes==

In June 2007, El Sueño de Arquímedes and Vanguardia de la Ciencia were abruptly terminated. In the correspondence section of one of the last programs of Vangurardia de la Ciencia, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano explained, in response to a letter from an outraged listener, that the decision to terminate the program was made due to a re-structuration of RNE, and that he was but one of 4,150 employees who had to leave.&lt;ref&gt;
Correspondence section at the end of the program [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]] of 9 June 2007. {{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209052256/http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}

'''Enterovirus C''' is a species of enterovirus. Its best known subtype is [[poliovirus]], the cause of [[poliomyelitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses |title=ICTV 2009 Master Species List Version 10 |date=August 2011 |url=http://talk.ictvonline.org/files/ictv_documents/m/msl/1231.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three [[serotype]]s of poliovirus, PV1, PV2, and PV3. Other subtypes of Enterovirus C include EV-C95, EV-C96, EV-C99, EV-C102, EV-C104, EV-C105, EV-C109, EV-C116, EV-C117, and EV-C118. Several of these can cause the [[polio-like condition]] AFP ([[acute flaccid paralysis]]).

'''Experix''' is an [[open-source]] [[command interpreter]] designed for operating laboratory equipment, especially [[data acquisition]] devices, and processing, displaying and storing the data from them.  It is usable now, only under [[Linux]] on the [[x86]] architecture, but still under development, and users are welcome to participate in extending and improving it.

Experix is radically different from most
commercial data acquisition programs, for example [[LabVIEW]], which model a measurement and control application as a network of operational units represented graphically as boxes with connections that stand for data flow.  In these systems an application is created by manipulating these symbols on the screen, and then it is used by clicking buttons and filling dialog boxes in a GUI environment.

Experix, in contrast, represents the application as a series of operations generally taking place one after another.  It processes a command line in a sequential way, and numbers, operators, functions and commands in the command line consume and create objects on a [[stack (abstract data type)|stack]].  These objects include [[integer]]s and [[floating-point]] numbers in several sizes, complex and polar numbers, multi-dimensional arrays made from any of the numerical types, several kinds of strings, and pointers to functions, commands and variables (which can be numbers, arrays and strings). A function, command or operator requires certain types of objects on the stack and puts objects on the stack, and may also change values in stack objects and variables, draw graphs, order operations in device drivers, and read and write files.

Experix is released under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/experix&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax ==
A command line can have practically arbitrary length, and is a series of tokens.  For example,&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;nowiki&gt;.01 1000 ]+ \c .sin * graph/yK function1=&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
would create an array of 1000 double-precision values representing the function j*0.01*sin(j*.01) for j from 0 to 999; draw a graph of that using black points on a yellow background; and copy that array into a variable called function1.  This sample of command tokens will give an idea of the range of capabilities that experix has.
*'''123e4'''&lt;br&gt;puts the '''double-precision number''' 1.23*10^6 on the stack
*'''#x5a1'''&lt;br&gt;puts the '''integer''' 0x5a1 on the stack
*'''+'''&lt;br&gt;'''adds''' the object in stack level 1 to the object in level 2; what that means exactly depends on what those objects are: add two numbers, or add a number to each member of an array, or add corresponding members of two arrays
*'''.cos'''&lt;br&gt;replaces the number in stack level 1, or each member of the array in stack level 1, with '''cosine'''(that number)
*''';c'''&lt;br&gt;puts the '''speed of light''' on the stack 
*''':BS'''&lt;br&gt;'''sets the bit''' designated by stack level 1 (integer) in the integer in stack level 2; does arrays too
*'''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;br&gt;'''makes an array''' from numbers on the stack
*'''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;+'''&lt;br&gt;'''makes a ramp array''' using the increment value in level 2 and number of elements in level 1  
*'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;='''&lt;br&gt;sets the value of an '''array element'''
*'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;s'''&lt;br&gt;extracts a '''subspace of an array''' as specified by stack arguments
*'''%v'''&lt;br&gt;gets the '''smaller value''' of two stack objects
*'''\/D'''&lt;br&gt;(that's backslash,slash,D) decodes the '''option characters''' which follow the name of a command in a command string
*'''?\/'''&lt;br&gt;'''displays the help file''' about the command-option operators
*'''??fft'''&lt;br&gt;starts a virtual terminal session with a '''text editor''' loaded with the '''help file''' about the '''Fourier transform function'''
*'''&amp;path'''&lt;br&gt;'''runs the commands''' from the file specified by "path"
*'''$9:'''&lt;br&gt;command string '''label''' number 9
*'''&gt;=$9'''&lt;br&gt;if the value in stack level 1 is greater than that in level 2, '''command execution branches''' to label $9:
*'''&gt;D'''&lt;br&gt;makes a '''deferred command'''
*'''&lt;D'''&lt;br&gt;runs a '''deferred command'''
*''',3s'''&lt;br&gt;sets command string '''local variable''' number 3
*'''|'''&lt;br&gt;'''concatenates''' two strings or arrays
*''')'''&lt;br&gt;makes a '''complex number''' from two numbers or a '''complex array''' from two arrays
*'''.&gt;3Y'''&lt;br&gt;makes an '''unsigned 1-byte number or array''' with values from stack level 3, which may be in any numerical type
*'''\d'''&lt;br&gt;'''drops''' stack level 1
*'''\;3u'''&lt;br&gt;gets the number of '''data units''' in the object in stack level 3
*'''&gt;0A'''&lt;br&gt;makes a '''[[truth value]]''': 1 (true) if all members of the array in stack level 1 are greater than 0; 0 (false) otherwise
*'''def'''&lt;br&gt;'''creates''' variables and commands
*'''graph'''&lt;br&gt;draws '''graphs'''
*'''exec'''&lt;br&gt;runs '''programs''' and collects the '''standard output''' and '''standard error''' in files that can be displayed or edited by special help operators
*'''file'''&lt;br&gt;transfers data between '''files''' and stack objects
*'''xcd'''&lt;br&gt;performs operations on '''experix device files'''

Experix provides '''hardware operations''' by way of a command-line interface to [[device driver]]s.  An '''experix driver''' has a 'read' entry point which functions more like an [[ioctl]].  It copies the integer array that experix has prepared, finds in it an operation code and supporting information, performs the operation and returns results to the array.  The driver maintains a control page which experix maps with read-only permission, and a number of data pages which are mapped with read-write permission.  The '''xcd''' function performs this memory mapping and creates command variables that represent the data pages.  These variables can then be used in command strings to perform data display and analysis.

A data acquisition device driver has an [[interrupt handler]] which uses data from the output pages and stores data in the input pages.  At designated index values it sends the '''new data signal''' to experix.  The xcd function is used to bind the signal to an experix command string.  Then that command is executed whenever the new data signal comes.  A device handler command might update variables, perform analysis functions, draw graphs and issue warnings.  It runs '''atomically''', which means it uses a separate stack and runs uninterrupted between two tokens in whatever user command happens to be in progress.

==Documentation==
Documentation is extensive.  The keywords.doc file describes functions and data structures in the program.  Commands, functions and operators are described in ''help files'', which are accessed in experix by the ''help operators''.  Help files are ordinary text files with terminal escape sequences to provide '''color highlights'''.  System commands such as [[cat]] and [[grep]] will show these files with their colorization, and the editor that experix uses for the two-question-mark help operator is ''nano'' (from the [[GNU]] project) with the escape sequence extension.  The source files for nano that were changed to provide this extension are available on the experix website.  Experix users are encouraged to correct and improve help files as they work.

== Limitations ==

Currently, experix is only available for Linux and, due to assembly language code, only on the x86 architecture.

At present the only graphics support for experix is with '''svgalib'''.  This is an open-source project available at [http://www.svgalib.org http://www.svgalib.org].  It is possible to have an experix graphics session in one virtual terminal and text or X sessions in others, and switch between them with the '''&lt;alt-F#&gt;''' keys.  Graphics operations are done by a '''server''' process, and experix sends commands and data to this process through a fifo.  It has an execution thread that uses '''readline''' (an open-source library from the GNU project) to obtain command lines and place them in the execution queue.  Another thread translates the '''standard output''' (i.e. the echo
from readline) into graphics server commands.  Experix can also run in a text screen or X-term without using svgalib at all.

There is some assembly code and other matters to attend to before it can run on architectures other than x86.

The range of device drivers and applications available now is extremely limited.

It runs as '''root''', which is a considerable '''security hazard''' on a networked computer.  It should be possible to run experix without root privileges, but this has not yet been done.

The '''Gemini Guidance Computer''' (sometimes '''Gemini Spacecraft On-Board Computer''' (OBC)) was a [[digital computer|digital]], [[serial computer]] designed for [[Project Gemini]], America's second manned space project.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt; The computer, which facilitated the control of mission maneuvers, was designed by the [[IBM Federal Systems Division]].&lt;ref name="ibm"&gt;8. J. C. Hundley and R. A. Watson, "A Digital Computer in Orbital Flight,"  TR 63-825-892, IBM Federal Systems Division, Owego, New York, October 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
The Gemini Guidance Computer was responsible for the following functions:&lt;ref name="ibm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;McDonnell Corporation, NASA Project Gemini Familiarization Manual, 1965, vol. 2, pp. 8.7,8.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ascent - serves as a backup [[guidance system]]. The switchover is manually controlled by the astronauts
* Orbital flight - provides a navigation capability to the astronauts to determine the time of retrofire and to select the landing site for safe reentry in the case of an emergency. (on extended missions ground data may become unavailable when ground data network rotates out of the [[orbital plane]].)
* Rendezvous - serves as primary reference by providing guidance information to the astronauts. The orbit parameters are determined by the ground tracking which are then sent to the spacecraft; the guidance computer was responsible for processing the information along with sensed spacecraft attitude. The information was presented to the astronauts in terms of spacecraft coordinates.
* Reentry - feeds commands directly to the reentry control system for automatic reentry or provides the guidance information to the astronauts for manual reentry.

== Specs ==
* The computer was architecturally similar to the [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer]], in particular in the instruction set;&lt;ref name="Gemini_2011"/&gt; however its circuit integration was less advanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frantone.com/designwritings/design_writings_LVDC.html LVDC board reverse engineering project]&lt;/ref&gt; The GGC weighed 58.98 pounds (26.75&amp;nbsp;kg) and was powered by 28V [[direct current|DC]]. During a short power outage it could be powered by the Auxiliary Computer Power Unit (ACPU)
* [[39-bit]] words memory, each composed of three [[13-bit syllable]]s&lt;ref name="Gemini_2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gemini Spacecraft Computer (OBC): Layout of Memory Words |date=2016 |orig-year=2011 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Gemini.htp |access-date=2016-05-28 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528114015/http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Gemini.htp |archive-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ferrite core]] memory of 4096 words&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch1-2.html ''Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience''], chapter one&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two's complement integer arithmetic
* 7.143 kilohertz clock (140 μs per instruction); all instructions took a single cycle except for multiplication and division

== History of genetic counseling ==
Sheldon Clark Reed coined the term genetic counseling in 1947 and published the book ''Counseling in Medical Genetics'' in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/sheldon-clark-reed-1910-2003|title=Sheldon Clark Reed (1910-2003)|work=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the early genetic counseling clinics were run by non-medical scientists or by those who were not experienced clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Reed SC|date=December 1974|title=A short history of genetic counseling|journal=Social Biology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=332–9|doi=10.1080/19485565.1974.9988131|pmid=4619717}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth in knowledge of genetic disorders and the appearance of medical genetics as a distinct specialty in the 1960s, genetic counseling progressively became medicalized, representing one of the key components of clinical genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysgeneticcounselors.org/history.php|title=NYS Genetic Counseling Information Resource|website=www.nysgeneticcounselors.org|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not, though, until later that the importance of a firm psychological basis was recognized and became an essential part of genetic counseling, the writings of Seymour Kessler making a particular contribution to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Seymour|date=May 1984|title=Book Review: A Genetic Counseling CasebookA Genetic Counseling Casebook.

Genetic counselors work in a wide variety of patient-facing and non patient-facing settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/page/whoaregeneticcounselors|title=National Society of Genetic Counselors : NSGC Professional Status Survey|website=www.nsgc.org|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical genetic counselors may provide general care, or specialize in one or more areas. Examples include:

* Prenatal and Preconception – for women and their partners who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant
* Pediatric – for children with genetic, or suspected genetic, conditions and their family members
* Cancer – for patients with cancer and/or their family members
* Cardiovascular – for patients with diseases of the heart or circulatory system and/or their family members
* Neurology – for patients with diseases of the brain and nervous system and/or their family members.
* Assisted reproductive technology/ infertility – for couples struggling with fertility or who are carriers of genetic diseases
* Psychiatric – for patients living with mental illness and/or their family members

Outside the clinic, genetic counselors work in areas such as laboratories, research, education, public health settings, and corporate environments. Examples of roles include:

* Laboratory – Utilization management, provider and patient support, variant classification, and reporting
* Research – Coordinating research studies, patient recruitment, data collection and interpretation, manuscript preparation and grant writing
* Education – Professors, Directors of genetic counseling training programs
* Public Health – Newborn screening programs, population screening programs
* Non-profit – Patient support and advocacy organizations
* Corporate – Dedicated services for employees and their families

=== Education ===
A genetic counselor is an expert with a [[Master of Science]] degree in genetic counseling. Programs in North America are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC). There are currently 41 accredited programs in the United States, four accredited programs in Canada, and four programs with the intent to become accredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gceducation.org/Pages/Accredited-Programs.aspx|title=Accredited Programs|website=gceducation.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students enter the field from a variety of disciplines, including [[biology]]/biological sciences and social sciences such as [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/page/becomeageneticcounselor|title=National Society of Genetic Counselors : Interested in Becoming a Genetic Counselor|website=www.nsgc.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate school coursework includes topics such as human genetics, embyrology, ethics, research, and counseling theory and techniques. Clinical training including supervised rotations in prenatal, pediatric, adult, cancer, and other subspecialty clinics, as well as non-patient facing rotations in laboratories. Research training typically culminates in a capstone or thesis project.

=== Certification ===
In the United States genetic counselors are certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. In Canada, genetic counselors are certified by the Canadian Association of Genetic Counsellors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cagc-accg.ca/?page=117&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from an American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC) accredited program who have met specific criteria are eligible to take the examination which is offered twice per year by the ABGC. Although not every company requires its counselors to possess a certification, the certification shows that the practitioner has met the standards "necessary to provide competent genetic counseling services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abgc.net/Certification/qualify_exam.asp|title=How do I qualify for the exam?|last=|first=|date=|website=American Board of Genetic Counseling|publisher=American Board of Genetic Counseling, Inc.|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State licensure  ===
As of October 2018, 25 states have passed genetic counselor licensure bills that require genetic counselors to meet a certain set of standards to practice. These states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Almost every other state in the US is in the process of obtaining genetic counseling licensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/p/cm/ld/fid=19|title=States Issuing Licenses for Genetic Counselors|website=National Society of Genetic Counselors|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although genetic counseling has existed for over four decades, the first licenses for genetic counselors were not issued until 2002. Utah was the first state to do so. The [[American Society of Human Genetics]] (ASHG) has since encouraged more states to license genetic counselors before they are allowed to practice. ASHG argues that requiring practitioners to go through the necessary training and testing to obtain a license will ensure quality genetic services as well as allow for reimbursement for counselors’ services. Laws requiring licensure ensure that "professionals who call themselves genetic counselors are able to properly explain complicated test results that could confuse patients and families making important health decisions".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Genetic counselor licensure proponents call for more states to adopt licensing laws: Benefits of licensure extend to geneticists, counselors, and patients | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics. Part A | volume = 170A | issue = 1 | pages = 8–9 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26768329 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.37507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reimbursement and recognition ===
Insurance companies usually do not reimburse for unlicensed genetic counselors’ services. Patients who may benefit from genetic counseling may not be able to afford the service due to the expensive out-of-pocket cost. In addition, licensure allows genetic counselors to be searchable in most insurance companies’ databases which gives genetic counselors increased opportunities for earning revenue and clients the opportunity to see "the level of coverage insurers provide for their services".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Counseling session structure==
The goals of genetic counseling are to increase understanding of [[genetic diseases]], discuss disease management options, and explain the risks and benefits of testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Genetic Alliance Site | access-date = 29 October 2010 | url = http://www.geneticalliance.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling sessions focus on giving vital, unbiased information and non-directive assistance in the patient's decision-making process. Seymour Kessler, in 1979, first categorized sessions in five phases: an intake phase, an initial contact phase, the encounter phase, the summary phase, and a follow-up phase.&lt;ref name="pmid19798554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson JM, Gillam LH, Sahhar MA, Metcalfe SA | title = "Testing times, challenging choices": an Australian study of prenatal genetic counseling | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–37 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19798554 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-009-9248-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intake and follow-up phases occur outside of the actual counseling session. The initial contact phase is when the counselor and families meet and build rapport. The encounter phase includes dialogue between the counselor and the client about the nature of screening and diagnostic tests. The summary phase provides all the options and decisions available for the next step. If patients wish to go ahead with testing, an appointment is organized and the genetic counselor acts as the person to communicate the results. Result delivery can happen both in person or via phone. Often counselors will call out results to avoid patients having to come back in as results can take weeks to be processed. If further counseling is needed in a more personal setting, or it is determined that additional family members should be tested, a secondary appointment can be made.

==Reasons for testing and sub-specialties==
===Detecting conditions===
[[Diagnostic testing]] occurs when an individual is showing signs or symptoms associated with a specific condition. Genetic testing can be used to arrive at a definitive diagnosis in order to provide better prognosis as well as medical management and/or treatment options. Testing can reveal conditions that—while debilitating without treatment—can be mild or asymptomatic with early treatment (such as [[phenylketonuria]]). Genetic tests are available for a number of genetic conditions, including but not limited to: [[Down syndrome]], [[Sickle cell disease]], [[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay-Sachs disease]], [[Muscular dystrophy]]. Establishing a genetic diagnosis alerts any other at-risk individuals in the family to consider testing, if appropriate.

Any reproductive risks (e.g. a chance to have a child with the same diagnosis) can also be explored after a diagnosis. Many disorders cannot occur unless both the mother and father pass on their genes, such as [[cystic fibrosis]]; this is known as [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance. Other [[autosomal dominant]] diseases can be inherited from one parent, such as [[Huntington disease]] and [[DiGeorge syndrome]]. Yet other genetic disorders are caused by an error or mutation occurring during the cell division process (e.g. [[aneuploidy]]) and are not hereditary.

[[Screening (medicine)|Screening tests]] are often used prior to diagnostic testing, designed to separate people according to a fixed characteristic or property, with the intention of detecting early evidence of disease. For example, if a screening test during a pregnancy (such as [[Prenatal testing|maternal blood screening]] or [[ultrasound]]) reveals a risk of a health issue or genetic condition, patients are encouraged to receive genetic counseling to learn additional information regarding the suspected condition and about their options with discussion of management, therapy and treatments available for the conditions, including those after delivery, and those during pregnancy, such as the option to terminate the pregnancy. Patients may decline additional screening and testing, elect to proceed to diagnostic testing, or pursue further screening tests to refine the risk during the pregnancy.

[[Predictive testing|Presymptomatic or predictive testing]] occurs when an individual knows of a specific diagnosis (typically adult onset) in their family and has other affected relatives, but they themselves do not manifest any clinical findings at the time when they seek testing. The decision about whether or not to proceed with presymptomatic testing should entail a thoughtful approach and consideration of various medical, reproductive, social, insurance, and financial factors, with no “right” or “wrong” answer. Availability of treatment and medical management options for each specific diagnosis, as well as the genetics and inheritance pattern of the particular condition should be reviewed as inherited conditions can have reduced [[penetrance]].

Insurance and legal issues should also be discussed during genetic counseling. There are laws in the United States such as [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act|GINA]] ([https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr493/text Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act]) and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]] that provide certain protections against discrimination for individuals with genetic diagnoses.

=== Adult genetics ===
Adult or general genetics clinics serve patients who are diagnosed with genetic conditions that begin to show signs or symptoms in adulthood. Many genetic conditions have varying ages of onset, ranging from an infantile form to an adult form. Genetic counseling can facilitate the decision making process by providing the patient/family with education about the genetic condition as well as the medical management options available to individuals at risk of developing the condition. Adult-onset disorders may overlap multiple specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilchrist DM | title = Medical genetics: 3. An approach to the adult with a genetic disorder | journal = CMAJ | volume = 167 | issue = 9 | pages = 1021–9 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12403743 | pmc = 134180 | url = http://www.cmaj.ca/content/167/9/1021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ART/Infertility genetics ===
Genetic counseling is an integral part of the process for patients utilizing [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|preimplantation genetic testing]] (PGT), formerly called preimplantation genetic diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg-Strassler D,  Cabey R, Armenti EM, Jordan A | journal = Fertility and Sterility | date = September 2016 | volume = 106 | issue = 3 Supplement | page = e370| title = Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) genetic counseling; but why? The patient experience|issn = 0015-0282|doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.07.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of PGT and all require [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) using [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing|title=Preimplantation genetic testing | work = UpToDate }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGT-M, for monogenic disorders, involves testing embryos for a specific condition before it is implanted into the mother. This technique is currently being done for disorders with childhood onset, such as Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs and Muscular Dystrophy, as well as adult-onset conditions, including Huntington’s Disease, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, and Lynch Syndrome. PGT-SR, for structural rearrangements, involves testing embryos to establish a pregnancy unaffected by a structural chromosomal abnormality (translocation). PGT-A, for aneuploidy, was formerly called preimplantation genetic screening, and involved testing embryos to identify any de novo aneuploidy.

Genetic counseling can also involve medical evaluation and clinical work-up for couples with infertility and/or recurrent pregnancy loss, as these histories can be associated with parental chromosome aberrations (such as [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]] or [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]]) and other genetic conditions.

=== Cardiovascular genetics ===
A rapidly expanding field in genetic counseling is cardiovascular genetics. More than 1 in 200 people have an inherited [[cardiovascular disease]]. Hereditary cardiac conditions range from common diseases, such as high cholesterol and coronary artery disease, to rare diseases like [[Long QT syndrome|Long QT Syndrome]], [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], aortic and [[vascular disease]]s.  Genetic counselors who specialize in cardiovascular disease have developed skills specific to the management of and counseling for cardiovascular disorders. Cardiovascular genetic counselors are also integral in local and national efforts to prevent sudden cardiac death (the leading cause of sudden death in young people) by identifying patients with known or suspected heritable cardiovascular diseases and promoting cascade family screening or testing of at-risk relatives.

Common referral reasons include:

* Cardiomyopathy, including, [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] and familial idiopathic [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]
* Arrhythmia, including [[Long QT syndrome]] and [[Brugada syndrome]]
* Vascular disease, including [[Marfan syndrome]] and aortic aneurysm and/or dissection (&lt;50 years old)
* Other heritable heart defects (e.g. conotruncal defects, left ventricular outflow tract defects)
* [[Familial hypercholesterolemia]]
* Family history of unexplained sudden death

Guidelines on cardiovascular genetics are published by multiple professional societies.&lt;ref name="pmid24011539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Priori SG, Wilde AA, Horie M, Cho Y, Behr ER, Berul C, Blom N, Brugada J, Chiang CE, Huikuri H, Kannankeril P, Krahn A, Leenhardt A, Moss A, Schwartz PJ, Shimizu W, Tomaselli G, Tracy C | display-authors = 6 | title = HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes: document endorsed by HRS, EHRA, and APHRS in May 2013 and by ACCF, AHA, PACES, and AEPC in June 2013 | journal = Heart Rhythm | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 1932–63 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24011539 | doi = 10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.05.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29567486"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershberger RE, Givertz MM, Ho CY, Judge DP, Kantor PF, McBride KL, Morales A, Taylor MR, Vatta M, Ware SM | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetic Evaluation of Cardiomyopathy-A Heart Failure Society of America Practice Guideline | journal = Journal of Cardiac Failure | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 281–302 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29567486 | doi = 10.1016/j.cardfail.2018.03.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22068434"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gersh BJ, Maron BJ, Bonow RO, Dearani JA, Fifer MA, Link MS, Naidu SS, Nishimura RA, Ommen SR, Rakowski H, Seidman CE, Towbin JA, Udelson JE, Yancy CW | display-authors = 6 | title = 2011 ACCF/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines | journal = Circulation | volume = 124 | issue = 24 | pages = e783–831 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22068434 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0b013e318223e2bd }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25173338"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott PM, Anastasakis A, Borger MA, Borggrefe M, Cecchi F, Charron P, Hagege AA, Lafont A, Limongelli G, Mahrholdt H, McKenna WJ, Mogensen J, Nihoyannopoulos P, Nistri S, Pieper PG, Pieske B, Rapezzi C, Rutten FH, Tillmanns C, Watkins H | display-authors = 6 | title = 2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the Task Force for the Diagnosis and Management of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 39 | pages = 2733–79 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25173338 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehu284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21600525"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg AC, Hopkins PN, Toth PP, Ballantyne CM, Rader DJ, Robinson JG, Daniels SR, Gidding SS, de Ferranti SD, Ito MK, McGowan MP, Moriarty PM, Cromwell WC, Ross JL, Ziajka PE | display-authors = 6 | title = Familial hypercholesterolemia: screening, diagnosis and management of pediatric and adult patients: clinical guidance from the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia | journal = Journal of Clinical Lipidology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = S1–8 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21600525 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacl.2011.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26510694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gidding SS, Champagne MA, de Ferranti SD, Defesche J, Ito MK, Knowles JW, McCrindle B, Raal F, Rader D, Santos RD, Lopes-Virella M, Watts GF, Wierzbicki AS | display-authors = 6 | title = The Agenda for Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association | journal = Circulation | volume = 132 | issue = 22 | pages = 2167–92 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26510694 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hereditary cancer genetics ===
Cancer genetic counselors see individuals with a personal diagnosis and/or family history of cancer or symptoms of an inherited cancer syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Counseling About Cancer|last=Schneider|first=Katherine | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-1118119914|location=New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic counselors take a family history and assess for hereditary risk, or risk that can be passed down from generation to generation. If indicated, they can coordinate genetic testing, typically via blood or saliva sample, to evaluate for hereditary cancer risk.  Personalized medical management and cancer screening recommendations can be provided based on results of genetic testing and/or the family history of cancer. While most cancers are sporadic (not inherited), some are more likely to have a hereditary factor, particularly when occurring at young ages or when clustering in families. These include common cancers such as breast, ovarian, colon and uterine cancers, as well as rare tumor types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/genetic-testing-fact-sheet|title=Genetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer Syndromes|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2016-03-25|date=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; General referral indications can include, but are not limited to:

===Neurogenetics===
Genetic counselors specializing in neurogenetics are involved in the care of individuals who have or are at risk to develop conditions affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or peripheral nervous system (the nerves that leave the spinal cord and go to other places in the body, such as the feet and hands, skeletal  muscles, and internal organs). Effects of these conditions can lead to various impairments some examples of which include cognitive decline, intellectual disability, seizures, uncontrolled movements (e.g. ataxia, chorea), muscle weakness, paralysis, or atrophy. Examples of neurogenetic disorders include:

*Brain malformation syndromes, including [[lissencephaly]] and [[polymicrogyria]]
*Brain tumor predisposition syndromes, including [[Neurofibromatosis]] 1 and 2&lt;ref name="pmid17636453"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Radtke HB, Sebold CD, Allison C, Haidle JL, Schneider G | title = Neurofibromatosis type 1 in genetic counseling practice: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 387–407 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17636453 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-007-9101-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prenatal genetic counseling may help with the decision-making process by walking patients through examples of what some people might do in similar situations, and their rationale for choosing that option. Decisions made by patients are affected by factors including timing, accuracy of information provided by tests, and risk and benefits of the tests. This discussion enables patients to place the information and circumstances into the context of their own lives, and in the context of their own values.&lt;ref name="pmid20235896"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stefansdottir V, Skirton H, Jonasson K, Hardardottir H, Jonsson JJ|date=July 2010|title=Effects of knowledge, education, and experience on acceptance of first trimester screening for chromosomal anomalies|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|volume=89|issue=7|pages=931–8|doi=10.3109/00016341003686073|pmid=20235896}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may choose to undergo noninvasive screening (e.g. [[ultrasound]], [[triple screen]], [[cell-free fetal DNA]] screening) or invasive diagnostic testing ([[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]]). Invasive diagnostic tests possess a small risk of [[miscarriage]] (1-2%) but provide more definitive results. Testing is offered to provide a definitive answer regarding the presence of a certain genetic condition or chromosomal abnormality.

=== Psychiatric genetics  ===
Psychiatric genetic counseling is a sub-specialty within genetic counseling focused on helping people living with a [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorder]] and/or their family members understand both the genetic and environmental factors that contributed to their illness and address associated emotions such as guilt or self-blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Talk with Families About Genetics and Psychiatric Illness|last=Peay|first=Holly|last2=Austin|first2=Jehannine | name-list-format = vanc |publisher= Norton |location= New York, London |year=2011|isbn=978-0-393-70549-2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic counselors also discuss strategies to promote recovery and protect [[mental health]] and address any questions on chances for recurrence in other family members. While currently there is no single gene solely responsible for causing a psychiatric disorder, there is strong evidence from family, [[twin studies]], and [[Genome-wide Association Studies|genome-wide-association studies]] that both multiple genes and environment interact together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giegling I, Hosak L, Mössner R, Serretti A, Bellivier F, Claes S, Collier DA, Corrales A, DeLisi LE, Gallo C, Gill M, Kennedy JL, Leboyer M, Maier W, Marquez M, Massat I, Mors O, Muglia P, Nöthen MM, Ospina-Duque J, Owen MJ, Propping P, Shi Y, St Clair D, Thibaut F, Cichon S, Mendlewicz J, O'Donovan MC, Rujescu D | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetics of schizophrenia: A consensus paper of the WFSBP Task Force on Genetics | journal = The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 492–505 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28112043 | doi = 10.1080/15622975.2016.1268715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other areas of genetic counseling, patients at all different stages of life (pediatric, adult, prenatal)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inglis A, Morris E, Austin J | title = Prenatal genetic counselling for psychiatric disorders | journal = Prenatal Diagnosis | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–13 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27466037 | pmc = 5247258 | doi = 10.1002/pd.4878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan J, Virani A, Austin JC | title = Ethical issues associated with genetic counseling in the context of adolescent psychiatry | journal = Applied &amp; Translational Genomics | volume = 5 | pages = 23–9 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26937355 | pmc = 4745399 | doi = 10.1016/j.atg.2015.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can have psychiatric genetic counseling.

Psychiatric genetic counselors can help "dispel mistaken notions about psychiatric disorders, calm needless anxiety, and help those at risk to draw up a rational plan of action based on the best available information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsuang MT | title = Genetic counseling for psychiatric patients and their families | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 135 | issue = 12 | pages = 1465–75 | date = December 1978 | pmid = 717559 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.135.12.1465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychosocial aspects of genetic counseling ==
There are different approaches to genetic counseling. Some counselors favor a more purely psycho-educational approach while others incorporate more psycho-therapeutic techniques. Genetic counseling is psycho-educational as patients "learn how genetics contributes to their health risks and then process what this means and how it feels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Biesecker|first=Barbara B | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-08-16 |pages=1–5 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0005616.pub3 | isbn=978-0-470-01590-2 |title=ELS |chapter=Genetic Counselling: Psychological Issues }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapeutic ===
"Whether the process of genetic counseling is a form of [[psychotherapy]] is up for debate". The relationship between the client and counselor is similar as are the goals of the sessions. As a psychotherapist aims to help his client improve his wellbeing, a genetic counselor also helps his client to address a "situational health threat that similarly threatens client wellbeing". Due to the lack of studies which compare genetic counseling to the practice of psychotherapy, it is hard to say with certainty whether genetic counseling can be "conceptualized as a short-term, applied, specific type of psychotherapy". However, there few existing studies suggest that genetic counseling falls "significantly short of psychotherapeutic counseling" because genetic counseling sessions primarily consist of the distribution of information without much emphasis placed on explaining any long-term impacts to the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biesecker B, Austin J, Caleshu C | title = Response to A Different Vantage Point Commentary: Psychotherapeutic Genetic Counseling, Is it? | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 334–336 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27804046 | pmc = 5383505 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-016-0025-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic counselors as support===
Genetic counselors provide supportive counseling to families, serve as patient advocates and refer individuals and families to community or state support services. They serve as educators and resource people for other health care professionals and for the general public. Many engage in research activities related to the field of medical genetics and genetic counseling. When communicating increased risk, counselors anticipate the likely distress and prepare patients for the results. Counselors help clients cope with and adapt to the emotional, psychological, medical, social, and economic consequences of the test results.

Each individual considers their family needs, social setting, cultural background, and religious beliefs when interpreting their risk.&lt;ref name="pmid19711880"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan SM | title = Prenatal genetic testing | journal = Pediatric Annals | volume = 38 | issue = 8 | pages = 426–30 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19711880 | doi = 10.3928/00904481-20090723-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clients must evaluate their reasoning to continue with testing at all. Counselors are present to put all the possibilities in perspective and encourage clients to take time to think about their decision. When a risk is found, counselors frequently reassure parents that they were not responsible for the result. An informed choice without pressure or coercion is made when all relevant information has been given and understood.

After counseling for other hereditary conditions, the patient may be presented with the option of having genetic testing. In some circumstances no genetic testing is indicated, other times it may be useful to begin the testing process with an affected family member. The genetic counselor also reviews the advantages and disadvantages of genetic testing with the patient.

===Attitudes toward genetic counseling and genetic testing===
Many studies have examined the attitudes of the lay public toward genetic counseling and genetic testing. Barriers to obtaining genetic counseling include lack of understanding of genetics by both patients and healthcare providers, concerns about cost and insurance, and fears of stigma and/or discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallagher TM, Bucciarelli M, Kavalukas SL, Baker MJ, Saunders BD | title = Attitudes toward genetic counseling and testing in patients with inherited endocrinopathies | journal = Endocrine Practice | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 1039–1044 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28613942 | doi = 10.4158/EP171875.OR }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haga SB, Barry WT, Mills R, Ginsburg GS, Svetkey L, Sullivan J, Willard HF | display-authors = 6 | title = Public knowledge of and attitudes toward genetics and genetic testing | journal = Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–35 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23406207 | pmc = 3609633 | doi = 10.1089/gtmb.2012.0350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scuffham TM, McInerny-Leo A, Ng SK, Mellick G | title = Knowledge and attitudes towards genetic testing in those affected with Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Community Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–77 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24018619 | pmc = 3955457 | doi = 10.1007/s12687-013-0168-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No simple correlation has been found between the change in technology to the changes in values and beliefs towards genetic testing.&lt;ref name="pmid22476359"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer E, Couper MP, Raghunathan TE, Van Hoewyk J, Antonucci TC | title = Trends in U.S. Attitudes Toward Genetic Testing, 1990-2004 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 446–458 | date = Fall 2008 | pmid = 22476359 | pmc = 3045776 | doi = 10.1093/poq/nfn033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International==
In 2018, there are nearly 7000 genetic counselors practicing worldwide, across at least 28 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abacan|first=MaryAnn|last2=Alsubaie|first2=Lamia|last3=Barlow-Stewart|first3=Kristine|last4=Caanen|first4=Beppy|last5=Cordier|first5=Christophe|last6=Courtney|first6=Eliza|last7=Davoine|first7=Emeline|last8=Edwards|first8=Janice|last9=Elackatt|first9=Niby J.|date=2018-10-05|title=The Global State of the Genetic Counseling Profession|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-018-0252-x|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41431-018-0252-x|issn=1018-4813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Genetic counseling in China (mainland) has been primarily provided by pediatricians or obstetricians for prenatal or birth defect diagnoses. Most genetic tests can only be performed in academic institutions as research tests or in commercial direct-to-consumer companies for non-clinical use.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao X, Wang P, Tao X, Zhong N | title = Genetic services and testing in China | journal = Journal of Community Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 379–90 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23595912 | pmc = 3739851 | doi = 10.1007/s12687-013-0144-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, genetic counseling is steered by the '''Chinese Board of Genetic Counseling (CBGC)''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbgc.org.cn/en/|title=中国遗传学会遗传咨询分会|author=|date=|website=www.cbgc.org.cn|access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a not-for-profit organization. CBGC is composed of senior experts engaged in genetic education and research. CBGC is committed to establishing standardized procedures of genetic counseling, training qualified genetic counselors, improving health for all, and reducing the incidence of birth defects. CBGC was established in 2015 and is the major professional organization for genetic counselors in mainland China, providing training through short term online and in-person lectures, educational conferences, and certification for trainees.    

Genetics education in China began in the 1980s when selected medical schools began offering genetics courses that focused predominantly on molecular genetics and had limited clinical content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li J, Xu T, Yashar BM | title = Genetics educational needs in China: physicians' experience and knowledge of genetic testing | journal = Genetics in Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 757–60 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25503494 | doi = 10.1038/gim.2014.182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, there are no official master’s level graduate programs in genetic counseling or clinical genetics in China, and there is great variability in the duration and content of genetics curricula among medical schools and professional organizations.

The [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Health]] has not yet recognized genetic counselors as an independent health care occupation. There are no official statistics for the number of health care professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, and lab technicians) who are providing genetic counseling services in China.

=== South Africa ===
Genetic Counselling is a developing field in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kromberg JG, Wessels TM, Krause A | title = Roles of genetic counselors in South Africa | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 753–61 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23723047 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-013-9606-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are about 20 registered genetic counsellors practicing in the country. In South Africa, genetic counsellors work within academic institutions, in the private health sector and more recently, private genetic laboratories. A few qualified genetic counsellors have been employed outside of the country or in other professions, owing to funding limitations that have impacted employment opportunities, particularly in the academic/public health sector.

The first Genetic Counselling Programme in South Africa started in 1989 at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in Johannesburg, in the Gauteng province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wits.ac.za/course-finder/postgraduate/health/genetic-counselling/|title=Genetic Counselling - Wits University|last=Johannesburg|first=The University of the Witwatersrand,|website=www.wits.ac.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second programme started in 2004 at the [[University of Cape Town]] in the Western Cape province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humangenetics.uct.ac.za/hg/teaching/msc/courses|title=Genetic Counselling Courses             {{!}} Division of Human Genetics|website=www.humangenetics.uct.ac.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the only two programmes offering Masters level genetic counselling training in South Africa. Currently these courses are running at full capacity.  This is a two year degree and includes a research component. The majority of students enter the Masters programme with a science background but those with a psychology background are also be considered.

The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpcsa.co.za|title=Home Page - HPCSA|website=www.hpcsa.co.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires two years of internship. Often the first year forms part of the Masters degree in Genetic Counselling and a further 12 month internship thereafter. Genetic Counsellors are required by law to register with the HPCSA in order to practice as genetic counsellors. At the end of the training period, registrants submit a portfolio to  HPCSA for assessment. If successful, the intern will be registered with the HPCSA and will be able to practice as a Genetic Counsellor in South Africa.

There is a professional organisation for Genetic Counsellors in South Africa, '''Genetic Counselling South Africa (GC-SA),''' which provides information and guidance to the HPCSA and others regarding professional issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sashg.org/about/focus-groups/genetic-counselling-south-africa/|title=Genetic Counselling South Africa – SASHG|website=sashg.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCSA is a focus group of the South African Society of Human Genetics (SASHG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sashg.org|title=SASHG – Southern African Society for Human Genetics (SASHG)|website=sashg.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The majority of Genetic Counsellors in the UK work in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/genetics/services/|title=Genetic testing and counselling|website=nhs.uk|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of the 33 Regional Clinical Genetics Services (some re-named Genomic Medicine Centres in England), Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Others work in specialist roles in the NHS, education, policy or research. A minority work in the private sector.

The '''Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors (AGNC)''' is the UK's professional organisation representing genetic counsellors, genetic nurses and non-medical, patient-facing staff working within the discipline of Clinical Genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agnc.org.uk|title=Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors|website=www.agnc.org.uk | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently (March 2018) 330 AGNC members within the UK. The AGNC is one of the constituent groups of the British Society for Genetic Medicine (BSGM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsgm.org.uk|title=British Society for Genetic Medicine|website=www.bsgm.org.uk | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 2 year MSc in Genetic Counselling program established in the UK was from the [[University of Manchester]] 1992, followed by [[Cardiff University]] in Wales in 2000. 2016 saw major changes in the way genetic counsellors are trained in England. A 3-year training programme funded by Health Education England, the Scientist Training Programme (STP) uses a combination of work-based training in Genomic Medicine Centres and a part time MSc in Genetics (Genomic Counselling) from the University of Manchester. Recruitment is performed nationally through the National School of Healthcare Science (NSHCS). A 3-year part time MSc in Genetic and Genomic Counselling is also now delivered by Cardiff University, through blended learning, with most of the teaching delivered online, alongside some short face-to-face teaching blocks in Wales. A 2-year MSc Genetic and Genomic Counselling program began at the [[University of Glasgow]] in Scotland in 2016. Prerequisites for acceptance on all the programmes include a degree in a relevant science or a nursing or midwifery qualification, and experience in a caring role.  All genetic counselling training programmes are accredited by the UK Genetic Counsellor Registration Board (GCRB) and the European Board of Medical Genetics (EBMG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eshg.org/index.php?id=113&amp;L=0|title=European Society of Human Genetics: Training in Genetics|website=www.eshg.org|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic counsellors in the UK are regulated through the Genetic Counsellor Registration Board (GCRB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcrb.org.uk|title=Home - Genetic Counsellor Registration Board|website=Genetic Counsellor Registration Board | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although currently GCRB registration is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ormond KE, Laurino MY, Barlow-Stewart K, Wessels TM, Macaulay S, Austin J, Middleton A | title = Genetic counseling globally: Where are we now? | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics | volume = 178 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–107 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29575600 | pmc = 5947883 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.c.31607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCRB registry was accredited in 2016 by the Professional Standards Authority under its Accredited Registers programme. Over 200 genetic counsellors are currently registered through the GCRB. Genetic Counsellors trained through the STP programme are expected to be eligible to apply for statutory regulation through the Health Care Professions Council and it is planned that soon there will be equivalence arrangements with the GCRB to ensure statutory regulation for GCRB registered genetic counsellors.

[[File:Chinese Gunpowder Formula.JPG|thumb|300px|Earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' of 1044 AD.]]
[[Gunpowder]] is the first physical [[explosive]]. Before its discovery, many [[Early thermal weapons|incendiary and burning devices]] had been used, including [[Greek fire]]. The discovery of gunpowder is attributed to experimentation in [[Chinese alchemy]] by [[Taoist]]s in the pursuit of immortality, and is popularly listed as one of the "[[Four Great Inventions]]" of [[China]]. It was discovered during the late [[Tang dynasty]] (9th century) but [[Wujing Zongyao|the earliest record]] of a written formula appeared in the [[Song dynasty]] (11th century). Knowledge of gunpowder spread rapidly throughout the [[Old World]] possibly as a result of the [[Mongol conquests]] during the 13th century, with written formula for it appearing in the 1267 ''[[Opus Majus]]'' treatise by [[Roger Bacon]] and a 1280 treatise by [[Hasan al-Rammah]]. It was employed in warfare to some effect from at least the 12th century in weapons such as [[fire arrow]]s, [[bombs]], and the [[fire lance]] before the appearance of the [[gun]]. While the fire lance was eventually supplanted by the gun, other gunpowder weapons such as rockets and fire arrows continued to see use in China, Korea, India, and eventually Europe. Bombs too never ceased to develop and continued to progress into the modern day as [[grenades]], [[Land mine|mine]]s, and other explosive implements. Gunpowder has also been used for non-military purposes such as [[firework]]s for entertainment, or in explosives for [[mining]] and [[tunnel]]ing.

The evolution of [[guns]] led to the development of [[artillery]] during the 15th century, pioneered by states such as the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. [[Firearms]] came to dominate [[early modern warfare]] in [[Military history of Europe|Europe]] by the 17th century. The gradual improvement of [[cannon]]s firing heavier rounds for a greater impact against fortifications led to the invention of the [[star fort]] and the [[bastion]] in the [[Western world]], where traditional [[city walls]] and [[castle]]s were no longer suitable for defense. The use of gunpowder technology also spread throughout [[Gunpowder Empires|the Islamic world]] and to [[Military history of India|India]], [[Military history of Korea|Korea]], and [[Military history of Japan|Japan]]. The so-called [[Gunpowder Empires]] of the [[early modern period]] consisted of the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Safavid Empire]], and [[Ottoman Empire]]. The use of gunpowder in warfare during the course of the 19th century diminished due to the invention of [[smokeless powder]]. Gunpowder is often referred to today as "[[black powder]]" to distinguish it from the propellant used in contemporary firearms.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=18}}

{{further information|Science and technology of the Song dynasty}}

Although it is not known precisely by whom gunpowder was discovered, most historians agree that gunpowder's origins were in China due to the amount of archaeological evidence and historical documents that exist predating others by centuries.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}} The very earliest possible reference to gunpowder appeared in 142 AD during the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] when the [[Chinese alchemy|alchemist]] [[Wei Boyang]] wrote about a substance with the properties of gunpowder. He described a mixture of three powders that would "fly and dance" violently in his ''[[Cantong qi]]'', otherwise known as the ''Book of the Kinship of Three'', a [[Taoist]] text on the subject of alchemy.&lt;ref name="WB1"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Gunpowder|url=https://epicfireworks.com/history-of-gunpowder|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wei Boyang"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Oscar|title=American Firearms Gun History|url=http://www.americanfirearms.org/gun-history/|website=www.americanfirearms.org|publisher=www.americanfirearms.org|accessdate=30 October 2015|ref=AFI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is impossible to know if he was actually referring to gunpowder, no other explosive known to scientists is composed of three powders.&lt;ref name =WB1 /&gt; While it was almost certainly not their intention to create a weapon of war, Taoist alchemists continued to play a major role of gunpowder development due to their experiments with [[sulfur]] and [[saltpeter]] involved in searching for eternal life and ways to transmute one material into another.&lt;ref name=WB1 /&gt;{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} Historian Peter Lorge notes that despite the early association of gunpowder with Taoism, this may be a quirk of historiography and a result of the better preservation of texts associated with Taoism, rather than being a subject limited to only Taoists.{{sfn|2008|p=32}} The Taoist quest for the elixir of life attracted many powerful patrons, one of whom was [[Emperor Wu of Han]]. One of the resulting alchemical experiments involved heating 10% sulfur and 75% saltpeter to transform them.&lt;ref name=WB1 /&gt;

The next reference to gunpowder occurred in the year 300 during the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]].&lt;ref name="Wei Boyang"/&gt; A Taoist philosopher by the name of [[Ge Hong]] wrote down the ingredients of gunpowder in his surviving works, collectively known as the ''[[Baopuzi]]'' ("The Master Who Embraces Simplicity"). The "Inner Chapters" on Taoism contains records of his experiments with heated saltpeter, pine resin, and charcoal among other carbon materials, resulting in explosion, which most historians acknowledge as an early form of gunpowder.&lt;ref name="explosive"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Explosive Quest for Immortality|url=http://scribol.com/anthropology-and-history/history/the-explosive-quest-for-immortality/|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 492, Taoist alchemists noted that saltpeter, one of the most important ingredients in gunpowder, burns with a purple flame, allowing for practical efforts at purifying the substance.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=97}}

The first confirmed reference to what can be considered gunpowder in China occurred more than three hundred years later during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the ''Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue'' (太上聖祖金丹秘訣) in 808, and then about 50 years later in a Taoist text known as the ''Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe'' (真元妙道要略).{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} The first formula was a combination of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb. The Taoist text warned against an assortment of dangerous formulas, one of which corresponds with gunpowder: "Some have heated together sulfur, realgar (arsenic disulphide),
and saltpeter with honey; smoke [and flames] result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house burned down."{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} Alchemists called this discovery fire medicine ("huoyao" 火藥), and the term has continued to refer to gunpowder in China into the present day, a reminder of its heritage as a side result in the search for longevity increasing drugs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=30}}

The earliest surviving chemical formula of gunpowder dates to 1044 in the form of the military manual ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'', also known in English as the ''Complete Essentials for the Military Classics'', which contains a collection of factoids on Chinese weaponry.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=118-124}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=138}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'' served as a repository of antiquated or fanciful weaponry, and this applied to gunpowder as well, suggesting that it had already been weaponized long before the invention of what would today be considered conventional firearms. These types of gunpowder weapons styles an assortment of odd names such as "flying incendiary club for subjugating demons," "caltrop fire ball," "ten-thousand fire flying sand magic bomb," "big bees nest," "burning heaven fierce fire unstoppable bomb," "fire bricks" which released "flying swallows," "flying rats," "fire birds," and "fire oxen". Eventually they gave way and coalesced into a smaller number of dominant weapon types, notably gunpowder arrows, bombs, and guns. This was most likely because some weapons were deemed too onerous or ineffective to deploy.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=16}}

===Fire arrows===

{{further information|Fire arrow}}

At this point the formula contained too little saltpeter (about 50%) to be explosive, but the mixture was highly flammable, and contemporary weapons reflected this in their deployment as mainly shock and incendiary weapons. One of the first, if not the first of these weapons was the [[fire arrow]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}} The first possible reference to the use of fire arrows was by the [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Southern Wu]] in 904 during the siege of [[Nanchang|Yuzhang]]. An officer under [[Yang Xingmi]] by the name of Zheng Fan (鄭璠) ordered his troops to "shoot off a machine to let fire and burn the Longsha Gate," after which he and his troops dashed over the fire into the city and captured it, and he was promoted to Prime Minister Inspectorate for his efforts and the burns his body endured.&lt;ref&gt;天佑初，王茂章征安仁义于润州，洎城陷，中十余创，以功迁左先锋都尉。从攻豫章，（郑）璠以所部发机「飞火」，烧龙沙门，率壮士突火先登入城，焦灼被体，以功授检校司徒。(Rough Translation: During the beginning of Tianyou Era (904-907), Zheng Fan followed Wang Maozhang under a campaign of Runzhou, which was guarded by rebel An Renyi, he was severely injured by the time it was captured, as the result he was promoted as the Junior General of Left Vanguard. At the campaign of Yuchang, he ordered his troops to propel the "flying fire" on the besieged city, after the city-gate of Longsha was burnt, he led his troops dashed over the fire and entered the city, his body was scorched, as the result he was promoted as the Prime Minister of Inspectorate.) Records of Nine Kingdoms ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A later account of this event corroborated with the report and explained that "by let fire (飛火) is meant things like firebombs and fire arrows."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}} Arrows carrying gunpowder were possibly the most applicable form of gunpowder weaponry at the time. Early gunpowder may have only produced an effective flame when exposed to oxygen, thus the rush of air around the arrow in flight would have provided a suitable catalyst for the reaction.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}}

The first fire arrows were arrows strapped with gunpowder incendiaries, but in 969 two Song generals, Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng (馮繼升), invented a variant fire arrow which utilized gunpowder tubes as propellants.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} Afterwards fire arrows started transitioning to rocket propelled weapons rather than being fired from a bow.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} These fire arrows were shown to the emperor in 970 when the head of a weapons manufacturing bureau sent Feng Jisheng to demonstrate the gunpowder arrow design, for which he was heavily rewarded. In 1000 a soldier by the name of Tang Fu (唐福) also demonstrated his own designs of gunpowder arrows, gunpowder pots (a proto-bomb which spews fire), and gunpowder caltrops, for which he was richly rewarded as well.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} The imperial court took great interest in the progress of gunpowder developments and actively encouraged as well as disseminated military technology. For example, in 1002 a local militia man named Shi Pu (石普) showed his own versions of fireballs and gunpowder arrows to imperial officials. They were so astounded that the emperor and court decreed that a team would be assembled to print the plans and instructions for the new designs to promulgate throughout the realm.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} The Song court's policy of rewarding military innovators was reported to have "brought about a great number of cases of people presenting technology and techniques" (器械法式) according to the official ''[[History of Song]]''.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} Production of gunpowder and fire arrows heavily increased in the 11th century as the court centralized the production process, constructing large gunpowder production facilities, hiring artisans, carpenters, and tanners for the military production complex in the capital of [[Kaifeng]]. One surviving source circa 1023 lists all the artisans working in Kaifeng while another notes that in 1083 the imperial court sent 100,000 gunpowder arrows to one garrison and 250,000 to another.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} Evidence of gunpowder in the [[Liao dynasty]] and [[Western Xia]] is much sparser than in Song, but some evidence such as the Song decree of 1073 that all subjects were henceforth forbidden from trading sulfur and saltpeter across the Liao border, suggests that the Liao were aware of gunpowder developments to the south and coveted gunpowder ingredients of their own.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}}

===Jin-Song Wars===

As depicted in the ''[[Huolongjing]]'', a 14th-century military treatise.]]

The [[Jurchen people]] of [[Manchuria]] united under [[Wanyan Aguda]] and established the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] in 1115.  Allying with the Song, they rose rapidly to the forefront of East Asian powers and defeated the Liao dynasty in a shockingly short span of time, destroying the 150 year balance of power between the Song, Liao, and Western Xia. Remnants of the Liao fled to the west and became known as the [[Qara Khitai]], or Western Liao to the Chinese. In the east, the fragile Song-Jin alliance dissolved once the Jin saw how badly the Song army had performed against Liao forces. Realizing the weakness of Song, the Jin grew tired of waiting and captured all five of the Liao capitals themselves. They proceeded to make war on Song, initiating the [[Jin-Song Wars]]. For the first time, two major powers would have access to equally formidable gunpowder weapons.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} Initially the Jin expected their campaign in the south to proceed smoothly given how poorly the Song had fared against the Liao. However they were met with stout resistance upon besieging Kaifeng in 1126 and faced the usual array of gunpowder arrows and fire bombs, but also a new weapon called the "thunderclap bomb" (霹靂炮), which one witness wrote, "At night the thunderclap bombs were used, hitting the lines of the enemy well, and throwing them into great confusion. Many fled, screaming in fright."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}}

Jin troops withdrew with a ransom of Song silk and treasure but returned several months later with their own gunpowder bombs manufactured by captured Song artisans.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} According to historian Wang Zhaochun, the account of this battle provided the "earliest truly detailed descriptions of the use of gunpowder weapons in warfare."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} Records show that the Jin utilized gunpowder arrows and trebuchets to hurl gunpowder bombs while the Song responded with gunpowder arrows, fire bombs, thunderclap bombs, and a new addition called the "molten metal bomb" (金汁炮).{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}} As the Jin account describes, when they attacked the city's Xuanhua Gate, their "fire bombs fell like rain, and their arrows were so numerous as to be uncountable."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}} The Jin captured Kaifeng despite the appearance of the molten metal bomb and secured another 20,000 fire arrows for their arsenal.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}}

The molten metal bomb appeared again in 1129 when Song general Li Yanxian (李彥仙) clashed with Jin forces while defending a strategic pass. The Jin assault lasted day and night without respite, using siege carts, fire carts, and sky bridges, but each assault was met with Song soldiers who "resisted at each occasion, and also used molten metal bombs. Wherever the gunpowder touched, everything would disintegrate without a trace."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}

The Song relocated their capital to [[Hangzhou]] and the Jin followed. The fighting that ensued would see the first proto-gun, the [[fire lance]], in action. Despite the low explosive potential of 11th-century gunpowder, it was possibly already being utilized in early projectile weapons such as the fire lance. There is some minor evidence of this based on an artistic depiction of it in the form of [[:File:FireLanceAndGrenade10thCenturyDunhuang.jpg|a silk banner painting]] slightly predating the ''Wujing Zongyao'' showing a demon pointing what appears to be a fire lance at the Buddha, trying to disturb his meditation.&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chase|first=Kenneth|title=Firearms: A Global History to 1700|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521822742|pages=32–33|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Chinese scholars reject the appearance of the fire lance prior to the Jin-Song wars, a Song text from 1000 and the ''Wujing Zongyao'' do make brief mentions of the fire lance.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}} The fire lance, as implied by the name, is essentially a long spear or pole affixed with a tube of gunpowder, and as it saw more usage, the tube's length became longer and pellets were added to the composition.

The earliest confirmed employment of the fire lance in warfare was by Song dynasty forces against the Jin in 1132 during the [[siege of De'an]] (modern [[Anlu]], [[Hubei Province]]),{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=222}}{{sf|Chase|2003|p=31}}{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33-34}} where they were used to great effect against wooden [[siege towers]] called "sky bridges": "As the sky bridges became stuck fast, more than ten feet from the walls and unable to get any closer, [the defenders] were ready. From below and above the defensive structures they emerged and attacked with fire lances, striking lances, and hooked sickles, each in turn. The people [i.e., the porters] at the base of the sky bridges were repulsed. Pulling their bamboo ropes, they [the porters] ended up drawing the sky bridge back in an anxious and urgent rush, going about fifty paces before stopping."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}} The surviving porters then tried once again to wheel the sky bridges into place but Song soldiers emerged from the walls in force and made a direct attack on the sky bridge soldiers while defenders on the walls threw bricks and shot arrows in conjunction with trebuchets hurling bombs and rocks. The sky bridges were also set fire to with incendiary bundles of grass and firewood. Li Heng, the Jin commander, decided to lift the siege and Jin forces were driven back with severe casualties.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}}

The siege of De'an marks an important transition and landmark in the history of gunpowder weapons as the fire medicine of the fire lances were described using a new word: "fire bomb medicine" (火炮藥), rather than simply "fire medicine." This could imply the use of a new more potent formula, or simply an acknowledgement of the specialized military application of gunpowder.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}} Peter Lorge suggests that this "bomb powder" may have been corned, making it distinct from normal gunpowder.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=19}} Evidence of gunpowder firecrackers also points to their appearance at roughly around the same time fire medicine was making its transition in the literary imagination.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}} Fire lances continued to be used as anti-personnel weapons into the Ming dynasty, and were even attached to battle carts on one situation in 1163. Song commander Wei Sheng constructed several hundred of these carts known as "at-your-desire-war-carts" (如意戰車), which contained fire lances protruding from protective covering on the sides. They were used to defend mobile trebuchets that hurled fire bombs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}}

Gunpowder technology also spread to naval warfare and in 1129 Song decreed that all warships were to be fitted with trebuchets for hurling gunpowder bombs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}} Older gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows were also utilized. In 1159 a Song fleet of 120 ships caught a Jin fleet at anchor near Shijiu Island (石臼島) off the shore of [[Shandong]] peninsula. The Song commander "ordered that gunpowder arrows be shot from all sides, and wherever they struck, flames and smoke rose up in swirls, setting fire to several hundred vessels."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}} Song forces took another victory in 1161 when Song paddle boats ambushed a Jin transport fleet, launched thunderclap bombs, and drowned the Jin force in the [[Yangtze]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}}

According to a minor military official by the name of Zhao Wannian (趙萬年), thunderclap bombs were used again to great effect by the Song during the Jin siege of Xiangyang in 1206-1207. Both sides had gunpowder weapons, but the Jin troops only used gunpowder arrows for destroying the city's moored vessels. The Song used fire arrows, fire bombs, and thunderclap bombs. Fire arrows and bombs were used to destroy Jin trebuchets. The thunderclap bombs were used on Jin soldiers themselves, causing foot soldiers and horsemen to panic and retreat. "We beat our drums and yelled from atop the city wall, and simultaneously fired our thunderclap missiles out from the city walls. The enemy cavalry was terrified and ran away."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=40}} The Jin were forced to retreat and make camp by the riverside. In a rare occurrence, the Song made a successful offensive on Jin forces and conducted a night assault using boats. They were loaded with gunpowder arrows, thunderclap bombs, a thousand crossbowmen, five hundred infantry, and a hundred drummers. Jin troops were surprised in their encampment while asleep by loud drumming, followed by an onslaught of crossbow bolts, and then thunderclap bombs, which caused a panic of such magnitude that they were unable to even saddle themselves and trampled over each other trying to get away. Two to three thousand Jin troops were slaughtered along with eight to nine hundred horses.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=40}}

Then everything changed when the Jin dynasty attacked, with even better bombs: the iron bomb. Traditionally the inspiration for the development of the iron bomb is ascribed to the tale of a fox hunter named Iron Li. According to the story, around the year 1189 Iron Li developed a new method for hunting foxes which used a ceramic explosive to scare foxes into his nets. The explosive consisted of a ceramic bottle with a mouth, stuffed with gunpowder, and attached with a fuse. Explosive and net were placed at strategic points of places such as watering holes frequented by foxes, and when they got near enough, Iron Li would light the fuse, causing the ceramic bottle to explode and scaring the frightened foxes right into his nets. While a fanciful tale, it's not exactly certain why this would cause the development of the iron bomb, given the explosive was made using ceramics, and other materials such as bamboo or even leather would have done the same job, assuming they made a loud enough noise.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=41}} Nonetheless, the iron bomb made its first appearance in 1221 at the siege of [[Qi Prefecture (Hubei)|Qizhou]] (in modern [[Hubei province]]), and this time it would be the Jin who possessed the technological advantage. The Song command Zhao Yurong (趙與褣) survived and was able to relay his account for posterity.

Qizhou was a major fortress city situated near the Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand "great leather bombs" (皮大炮), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, they were unable to match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, "The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb [catapult shot], whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [our own] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [of the face] was left."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}} Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: "The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [帳] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, to the point that they struck even on top of [my] sleeping quarters and [I] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}} Zhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, "In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}} Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the "bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was no way to tell who was who."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}}

The [[Mongols]] and their rise in world history as well as conflicts with both the Jin and Song played a key role in the evolution of gunpowder technology.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=44}} Mongol aptitude in incorporating foreign experts extended to the Chinese, who provided artisans that followed Mongol armies willingly and unwillingly far into the west and even east, to Japan. Unfortunately textual evidence for this is scant as the Mongols left few documents. This lack of primary source documents has caused some historians and scholars such as Kate Raphael to doubt the Mongol's role in disseminating gunpowder throughout Eurasia. On the opposite side stand historians such as Tonio Andrade and Stephen Haw, who believe that the Mongol Empire not only used gunpowder weapons but deserves the moniker "the first gunpowder empire."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=327}}

====Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty====

The first concerted Mongol invasion of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons along with other more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Jin scholar Liu Qi (劉祈) recounts in his memoir, "the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [the enemy] advanced."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (''huo jian'' 火箭) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, "From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (震天雷). Whenever the [Mongol] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} A more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the ''[[History of Jin]]'': "The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li [thirty miles], burning an expanse of land more than half a mu [所爇圍半畝之上, a mu is a sixth of an acre], and the fire can even penetrate iron armor."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: "When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Furthermore, he wrote, "When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}}

Heaven-shaking-thunder bombs, also known as thunder crash bombs, were utilized prior to the siege in 1231 when a Jin general made use of them in destroying a Mongol warship, but during the siege the Mongols responded by protecting themselves with elaborate screens of thick cowhide. This was effective enough for workers to get right up to the walls to undermine their foundations and excavate protective niches. Jin defenders countered by tying iron cords and attaching them to heaven-shaking-thunder bombs, which were lowered down the walls until they reached the place where the miners worked. The protective leather screens were unable to withstand the explosion, and were penetrated, killing the excavators.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} Another weapon the Jin employed was an improved version of the fire lance called the flying fire lance. The ''History of Jin'' provides a detailed description: "To make the lance, use chi-huang paper, sixteen layers of it for the tube, and make it a bit longer than two feet. Stuff it with willow charcoal, iron fragments, magnet ends, sulfur, white arsenic [probably an error that should mean saltpeter], and other ingredients, and put a fuse to the end. Each troop has hanging on him a little iron pot to keep fire [probably hot coals], and when it's time to do battle, the flames shoot out the front of the lance more than ten feet, and when the gunpowder is depleted, the tube isn't destroyed."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} While Mongol soldiers typically held a view of disdain toward most Jin weapons, apparently they greatly feared the flying fire lance and heaven-shaking-thunder bomb.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Kaifeng managed to hold out for a year before the Jin emperor fled and the city capitulated. In some cases Jin troops still fought with some success, scoring isolated victories such as when a Jin commander led 450 fire lancers against a Mongol encampment, which was "completely routed, and three thousand five hundred were drowned."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} Even after the Jin emperor committed suicide in 1234, one loyalist gathered all the metal he could find in the city he was defending, even gold and silver, and made explosives to lob against the Mongols, but the momentum of the Mongol Empire could not be stopped.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p46-47}} By 1234, both the Western Xia and Jin dynasty had been conquered.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}

====Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty====

The Mongol war machine moved south and in 1237 attacked the Song city of Anfeng (modern [[Shouxian]], [[Anhui Province]]) "using gunpowder bombs [huo pao] to burn the [defensive] towers."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} These bombs were apparently quite large. "Several hundred men hurled one bomb, and if it hit the tower it would immediately smash it to pieces."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} The Song defenders under commander Du Gao (杜杲) rebuilt the towers and retaliated with their own bombs, which they called the "Elipao," after a famous local pear, probably in reference to the shape of the weapon.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} Perhaps as another point of military interest, the account of this battle also mentions that the Anfeng defenders were equipped with a type of small arrow to shoot through eye slits of Mongol armor, as normal arrows were too thick to penetrate.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}

By the mid 13th century, gunpowder weapons had become central to the Song war effort. In 1257 the Song official Li Zengbo was dispatched to inspect frontier city arsenals. Li considered an ideal city arsenal to include several hundred thousand iron bombshells, and also its own production facility to produce at least a couple thousand a month. The results of his tour of the border were severely disappointing and in one arsenal he found "no more than 85 iron bomb-shells, large and small, 95 fire-arrows, and 105 fire-lances. This is not sufficient for a mere hundred men, let alone a thousand, to use against an attack by the ... barbarians. The government supposedly wants to make preparations for the defense of its fortified cities, and to furnish them with military supplies against the enemy (yet this is all they give us). What chilling indifference!"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47-48}} Fortunately for the Song, [[Möngke Khan]] died in 1259 and the war would not continue until 1269 under the leadership of [[Kublai Khan]], but when it did the Mongols came in full force.

Blocking the Mongols' passage south of the Yangtze were the twin fortress cities of Xiangyang and Fancheng. What resulted was one of the longest sieges the world had ever known, lasting from 1268 to 1273. For the first three years the Song defenders had been able to receive supplies and reinforcements by water, but in 1271 the Mongols set up a full blockade with a formidable navy of their own, isolating the two cities. This didn't prevent the Song from running the supply route anyway, and two men with the surname Zhang did exactly that. The Two Zhangs commanded a hundred paddle wheel boats, travelling by night under the light of lantern fire, but were discovered early on by a Mongol commander. When the Song fleet arrived near the cities, they found the Mongol fleet to have spread themselves out along the entire width of the Yangtze with "vessels spread out, filling the entire surface of the river, and there was no gap for them to enter."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=48}} Another defensive measure the Mongols had taken was the construction of a chain, which stretched across the water.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=48}} The two fleets engaged in combat and the Song opened fire with fire-lances, fire-bombs, and crossbows. A large number of men died trying to cut through chains, pull up stakes, and hurl bombs, while Song marines fought hand to hand using large axes, and according to the Mongol record, "on their ships they were up to the ankles in blood."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} With the rise of dawn, the Song vessels made it to the city walls and the citizens "leapt up a hundred times in joy."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} In 1273 the Mongols enlisted the expertise of two Muslim engineers, one from Persia and one from Syria, who helped in the construction of counterweight trebuchets. These new siege weapons had the capability of throwing larger missiles further than the previous traction trebuchets. One account records, "when the machinery went off the noise shook heaven and earth; every thing that [the missile] hit was broken and destroyed."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} The fortress city of Xiangyang fell in 1273.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}

The next major battle to feature gunpowder weapons was during a campaign led by the Mongol general Bayan, who commanded an army of around two hundred thousand, consisting of mostly Chinese soldiers. It was probably the largest army the Mongols had ever utilized. Such an army was still unable to successfully storm Song city walls, as seen in the 1274 Siege of Shayang. Thus Bayan waited for the wind to change to a northerly course before ordering his artillerists to begin bombarding the city with molten metal bombs, which caused such a fire that "the buildings were burned up and the smoke and flames rose up to heaven."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} Shayang was captured and its inhabitants massacred.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}

Gunpowder bombs were used again in the 1275 Siege of Changzhou in the latter stages of the Mongol-Song Wars. Upon arriving at the city, Bayan gave the inhabitants an ultimatum: "if you ... resist us ... we shall drain your carcasses of blood and use them for pillows."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} This didn't work and the city resisted anyway, so the Mongol army bombarded them with fire bombs before storming the walls, after which followed an immense slaughter claiming the lives of a quarter million.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} The war lasted for only another four years during which some remnants of the Song held up last desperate defenses. In 1277, 250 defenders under Lou Qianxia conducted a suicide bombing and set off a huge iron bomb when it became clear defeat was imminent. Of this, the ''History of Song'' writes, "the noise was like a tremendous thunderclap, shaking the walls and ground, and the smoke filled up the heavens outside. Many of the troops [outside] were startled to death. When the fire was extinguished they went in to see. There were just ashes, not a trace left."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50-51}}{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=250, 244, 149}} So came an end to the Mongol-Song Wars, which saw the deployment of all the gunpowder weapons available to both sides at the time, which for the most part meant gunpowder arrows, bombs, and lances, but in retrospect, another development would overshadow them all, the birth of the gun.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}

In 1280, a large store of gunpowder at [[Weiyang District, Yangzhou|Weiyang]] in [[Yangzhou]] accidentally caught fire, producing such a massive explosion that a team of inspectors at the site a week later deduced that some 100 guards had been killed instantly, with wooden beams and pillars blown sky high and landing at a distance of over 10 [[li (unit)|li]] (~2&amp;nbsp;mi. or ~3&amp;nbsp;km) away from the explosion, creating a crater more than ten feet deep.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 209 210" &gt;[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210.&lt;/ref&gt; One resident described the noise of the explosion as if it "was like a volcano erupting, a tsunami crashing. The entire population was terrified."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}} According to surviving reports, the incident was caused by inexperienced gunpowder makers hired to replace the previous ones, and had been careless while grinding sulfur. A spark caused by the grinding process came into contact with some fire lances which immediately started spewing flames and jetting around "like frightened snakes."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}} The gunpowder makers did nothing as they found the sight highly amusing, that is until one fire lance burst into a cache of bombs, causing the entire complex to explode. The validity of this report is somewhat questionable, assuming everyone within the immediate vicinity was killed.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}}

By the time of [[Jiao Yu]] and his ''[[Huolongjing]]'' (a book that describes military applications of gunpowder in great detail) in the mid 14th century, the explosive potential of gunpowder was perfected, as the level of nitrate in gunpowder formulas had risen from a range of 12% to 91%,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 345"&gt;[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&amp;nbsp;345.&lt;/ref&gt; with at least 6 different formulas in use that are considered to have maximum explosive potential for gunpowder.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 345" /&gt; By that time, the Chinese had discovered how to create explosive [[round shot]] by packing their hollow shells with this nitrate-enhanced gunpowder.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 264" &gt;[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&amp;nbsp;264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hand cannon===
{{main article|Hand cannon}}

To clarify for the purposes of this section and any other references to "firearms" or "guns" in this article, what is meant is a gunpowder weapon which uses "the explosive force of the gunpowder to propel a projectile from a tube: cannons, muskets, and pistols are typical examples."{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=1}}

The early fire lance, considered to be the ancestor of firearms, is not considered a true gun because it did not include projectiles. Later on, shrapnel such as ceramics and bits of iron were added, but these didn't occlude the barrel, and were only swept along with the discharge rather than make use of [[windage]]. These projectiles were called "co-viatives."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} The commonplace nature of the fire lance, if not in quantity, was apparent by the mid 13th century, and in 1257 an arsenal in Jiankang Prefecture reported the manufacture of 333 "fire emitting tubes" (突火筒). In 1259 a type of "fire-emitting lance" (突火槍) made an appearance and according to the ''History of Song'': "It is made from a large bamboo tube, and inside is stuffed a pellet wad (子窠). Once the fire goes off it completely spews the rear pellet wad forth, and the sound is like a bomb that can be heard for five hundred or more paces."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=246}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPQuETESw84C&amp;pg=PA304 |title=Chinese ideas about nature and society: studies in honour of Derk Bodde |first=Derk |last=Bodde |editor=Charles Le Blanc, Susan Blader|accessdate=28 November 2011 |year=1987 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=962-209-188-1 |page=304 |quote=The other was the 'flame-spouting lance' (t'u huo ch'iang).

Fire lances transformed from the "bamboo- (or wood- or paper-) barreled firearm to the metal-barreled firearm"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}} to better withstand the explosive pressure of gunpowder. From there it branched off into several different gunpowder weapons known as "eruptors" in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, with different functions such as the "filling-the-sky erupting tube" which spewed out poisonous gas and porcelain shards, the "orifice-penetrating flying sand magic mist tube" (鑽穴飛砂神霧筒) which spewed forth sand and poisonous chemicals into orifices, and the more conventional "phalanx-charging fire gourd" which shot out lead pellets.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}} The character for lance, or spear (槍), has continued to refer to both the melee weapon and the firearm into modern China, perhaps as a reminder of its original form as simply a tube of gunpowder tied to a spear.

Traditionally the first appearance of the hand cannon is dated to the late 13th century, just after the [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Patrick|1961|p=6}} However a sculpture depicting a figure carrying a gourd shaped hand cannon was discovered among the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] in 1985 by Robin Yates. The sculptures were completed roughly 250&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Chongqing]] by 1128, after the fall of Kaifeng to the Jin dynasty. If the dating is correct this would push back the appearance of the cannon in China by a hundred years more than previously thought.{{sfn|Lu|1988}} The bulbous nature of the cannon is congruous with the earliest hand cannons discovered in China and Europe.

Archaeological samples of the gun, specifically the [[hand cannon]] ([[huochong]]), have been dated starting from the 13th century. The oldest extant gun whose dating is unequivocal is the [[Xanadu Gun]], so called because it was discovered in the ruins of [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], the Mongol summer palace in Inner Mongolia. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7&amp;nbsp;cm in length and weighs 6.2&amp;nbsp;kg. Its dating is based on archaeological context and a straightforward inscription whose era name and year corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1298. Not only does the inscription contain the era name and date, it also includes a serial number and manufacturing information which suggests that gun production had already become systematized, or at least become a somewhat standardized affair by the time of its fabrication. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns with the possible exception of the Western Xia gun, it is small, weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=52-53}} Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating likely predate it.

One candidate is the [[Heilongjiang hand cannon]], discovered in 1970, and named after the province of its discovery, Heilongjiang, in northeastern China.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Kenneth Warren (2003). Firearms: A Global History to 1700. Cambridge University Press, p. 32, {{ISBN|978-0-521-82274-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986), ''Science &amp; Civilisation in China, V:7: The Gunpowder Epic'', Cambridge University Press, p. 293, {{ISBN|0-521-30358-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is small and light like the Xanadu gun, weighing only 3.5 kilograms, 34&amp;nbsp;cm (Needham says 35&amp;nbsp;cm), and a bore of approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=53}} Based on contextual evidence, historians believe it was used by Yuan forces against a rebellion by Mongol prince [[Nayan (Mongol Prince)|Nayan]] in 1287. The [[History of Yuan]] states that a Jurchen commander known as Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannons into battle against Nayan.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=293-4}}

Even older, the Ningxia gun was found in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region by collector Meng Jianmin (孟建民). This Yuan dynasty firearm is 34.6&amp;nbsp;cm long, the muzzle 2.6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, and weighs 1.55 kilograms. The firearm contains a transcription reading, "Made by bronzesmith Li Liujing in the year Zhiyuan 8 (直元), ningzi number 2565" (銅匠作頭李六徑，直元捌年造，寧字二仟伍百陸拾伍號).{{sf|Andrade|2016|p=329}} Similar to the Xanadu Gun, it bears a serial number 2565, which suggests it may have been part of a series of guns manufactured. While the era name and date corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1271 CE, putting it earlier than both the Heilongjiang Hand Gun as well as the Xanadu Gun, but one of the characters used in the era name is irregular, causing some doubt among scholars on the exact date of production.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=329}}

Another specimen, the [[Wuwei Bronze Cannon]], was discovered in 1980 and may possibly be the oldest as well as largest cannon of the 13th century: a 100 centimeter 108 kilogram bronze cannon discovered in a cellar in [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu Province]] containing no inscription, but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227. The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter, which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters, and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered, meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=53-54}} Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=330}} While large in size, the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns, and is unevenly cast. A similar weapon was discovered not far from the discovery site in 1997, but much smaller in size at only 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=54}} Chen Bingying disputes this however, and argues there were no guns before 1259, while Dang Shoushan believes the Western Xia guns point to the appearance of guns by 1220, and Stephen Haw goes even further by stating that guns were developed as early as 1200.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=329}} Sinologist [[Joseph Needham]] and renaissance siege expert Thomas Arnold provide a more conservative estimate of around 1280 for the appearance of the "true" cannon.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=10}}{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=18}} Whether or not any of these are correct, it seems likely that the gun was born sometime during the 13th century.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=54}}

Although the oldest extant guns appear in the Yuan dynasty, the historian Tonio Andrade notes that there is a surprising scarcity of reliable evidence of [[Military history of Iran|guns in Iran]] or [[Central Asia]] prior to the late 14th century. He argues that, in the Middle East, no guns are mentioned prior to the 1360s, while [[Russian historiography|Russian records]] do not contain reliable mentions of firearms until 1382, after the gun's arrival in western Europe, despite their closer proximity and interactions with the Mongol empires.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75}} 

There is some evidence that does point to the possible appearance of guns in [[Andalusia]] as early as the 1330s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75}} Thomas Allsen says that "in the Latin West the first uncontestable evidence of firearms is from 1326, surprisingly somewhat earlier than in the lands that lie between China ... and western Europe.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75}} This has caused some doubt among historians on the gun transmission theory, and even whether or not there was a transmission at all.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|pp=75, 334}} One dissident opinion comes from Stephen Morillo, Jeremy Black, and Paul Lococo's ''War in World History'' which argues that "the sources are not entirely clear about Chinese use of gunpowder in guns. There are references to bamboo and iron cannons, or perhaps proto-cannons, but these seem to have been small, unreliable, handheld weapons in this period. The Chinese do seem to have invented guns independently of the Europeans, at least in principle; but, in terms of effective cannon, the edge goes to Europe."{{sfn|Morillo|2008|p=259}} 

There was also a stream of thought in Europe that emerged as early as the 15th century, that attributed the invention of both gunpowder and the gun to a certain [[Berthold Schwartz]]. However it's not exactly certain who Berthold was or if he ever existed as there are no contemporary records of him. Some consider him a mythical figure, used as a stand-in "for all the curious and ingenious experiments related to the new and dangerous mixture of saltpetre, sulfur (brimstone) and carbon."{{sfn|Liang|2006}} [[William Camden]] declared in 1605:

{{quotation|Some have sayled a long course as farre as China, the farthest part of the world, to fetch the invention of guns from thence, but we know the Spanicsh proverb 'long waies, long lies'. One writeth, I know not upon whose credit, that Roger Bacon, commonly called Friar Bacon, knew how to make an engine which with saltpetre and Brimstone, should prove notable for Batterie, but he, tendering the safety of mankind, would not discover it. The best approved authors agree that guns were invented in Germanie, by Berthold Swarte, a Monke skilful in Gebers Cookery or Alchimy, who tempering Brimstone and saltpetre in a mortar, perceived the force by casting up the stone which covered it, when a sparke fell upon it....{{sfn|Liang|2006}}|William Camden}}

There is another independent invention theory supporting an Islamic origin of the gun, citing the Mamluk deployment of hand cannons in 1260 and a passage by Ibn Khaldun on the Marinid Siege of Sijilmassa in 1274: "[ The Sultan] installed siege engines … and gunpowder engines …, which project small balls of iron. These balls are ejected from a chamber … placed in front of a kindling fire of gunpowder; this happens by a strange property which attributes all actions to the power of the Creator."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=334}} The passage, dated to 1382, and its interpretation has been rejected as anachronistic by most historians, who urge caution regarding claims of Islamic firearms use in the 1204-1324 period as late medieval Arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, naft, as they did for an earlier incendiary, naphtha.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=108-109}}{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=15}} Needham believes Ibn Khaldun was speaking of fire lances rather than hand cannon.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=47}}

Historian [[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]], based on his analysis of 14th-century Arabic manuscripts which he argues to be copies of earlier texts, claims that [[hand cannon]]s were used at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260.&lt;ref name="Gunpowder Composition"/&gt; However Hassan's claims have been refuted by other historians such as David Ayalon, Iqtidar Alam Khan, Joseph Needham, Tonio Andrade, and Gabor Ágoston. Khan argues that it was the [[Mongols]] who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world,{{sfn|Khan|1996|p=41-5}} and believes cannons only reached [[Mamluk Egypt]] in the 1370s.{{sfn|Khan|2004|p=3}} According to Needham, the term ''midfa'', dated to textual sources from 1342 to 1352, did not refer to true hand-guns or bombards, and contemporary accounts of a metal-barrel cannon in the Islamic world do not occur until 1365{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=44}} Similarly, Andrade dates the textual appearance of cannon in middle eastern sources to the 1360s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75}}  Gabor Ágoston and David Ayalon believe the Mamluks had certainly used siege cannon by the 1360s, but earlier uses of cannon in the [[Islamic World]] are vague with a possible appearance in the [[Emirate of Granada]] by the 1320s, however evidence is inconclusive.{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=15}}

Historian Tonio Andrade supports the gun transmission theory, noting that while records of gunpowder weapons and their evolution into the gun exist in China, "there are no records of any such developments in Europe,"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75}} and that the arrival of the gun in Europe was such that it "appears fully formed around 1326."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75}} This is not strictly true, as Kelly DeVries points out that compilers of early gunpowder recipes in Europe understood that should the instrument carrying gunpowder be enclosed on one end, the gunpowder reaction inside would produce "flying fire."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=334}} Andrade goes on to analyze the nature and etymology of gunpowder in Europe and comes to the conclusion that it is intrinsically in favor of the transmission theory rather than an independent invention. There are the older and more numerous formulas of gunpowder using a variety of different proportions of key ingredients - saltpeter, sulphur, and charcoal - which he believes is proof of its evolution and experimentation in China, where gunpowder was first applied to warfare as an incendiary, then explosive, and finally as a propellant. In contrast gunpowder formulas in Europe appear both later and offer very little divergence from the already ideal proportions for the purpose of creating an explosive and propellant powder.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75-75}} Another facet of the gunpowder transmission theory is the appearance of gunpowder in Europe ready made for military usage, and is generally referred to as ''gun''powder rather than a civilian term such as the Chinese "fire-drug," which suggests an originally non-military usage, whereas in Europe it was almost immediately and exclusively used for its military qualities.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}} Muslim terms of saltpeter may also point toward a gunpowder transmission, if not the gun itself, as an Andalusian botanist referred to it as "Chinese snow," while in Persia it was called "Chinese salt."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}} Perhaps even further in the Sinocentric gun transmission camp is Joseph Needham who claims that "all the long preparations and tentative experiments were made in China, and everything came to Islam and the West fully fledged, whether it was the fire-lance or the explosive bomb, the rocket or the metal-barrel hand-gun and bombard."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75}} However, theories of European as well as Islamic origins for the gun still persist today in tandem with the transmission theory.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=334}}

There are problems on both extremes of the gun transmission debate. Its proponents emphasize the older history of gunpowder evolution as attested by historical records and archaeological samples in China, its less obviously militarily focused name as "fire medicine," the Mongol role as a catalyst in disseminating gunpowder technology, and criticizes the scant or absent evidence of prior experimentation with gunpowder in Europe for non-military purposes before the arrival of the gun.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75-76}} However, there are still several blanks in the history of a gun transmission theory and the questions they raise which its proponents have been unable to answer. The rapid spread of guns across Eurasia, only 50 years from China to Europe, with non-existent evidence of its route from one extreme of the continent to the other, remains a mystery. Other Chinese inventions such as the compass, paper, and printing took centuries to reach Europe, with events such as the [[Battle of Talas]] as perhaps a possible takeoff point for discussion. No such event exists on record for either gunpowder or the gun. There is simply no clear route of transmission,{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}} and while the Mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, Timothy May points out that "there is no concrete evidence that the Mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of China."&lt;ref name="networks.h-net.org"/&gt; According to Kate Raphael, the list of Chinese specialists recruited by [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Hulagu]] provided by the [[History of Yuan]] includes only carpenters and blacksmiths, but no gunpowder workers.{{sfn|Raphael|2011|p=107-108}} A conclusion most military historians in the transmission camp have come to is that the rapid diffusion of gunpowder and the gun is probably best explained by its clear military applications.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}}

{{quotation|Although the spread of gunpowder is directly related to the rise of the Mongols and the Pax Mongolica, it is unclear whether the Mongols themselves contributed to the spread. Some historians have claimed the Mongols used gunpowder weapons, essentially bombs hurled by catapults, in the Middle East and perhaps Eastern Europe; unfortunately there is no definite documentary or archaeological evidence to confirm it. Considering the Mongols rarely met a weapon they did not like, we can be certain that if they found a way to transport it safely it would have been incorporated into their arsenal outside China. Nonetheless, it remains speculation... However... the Mongols used it in their wars against the Jin, the Song and in their invasions of Japan.{{sfn|May|2012|p=146-148}}|Timothy May}}

On the other side of the debate, opponents of the theory criticize the vagueness of Chinese records on the specific usage of gunpowder in weaponry, the existence of gunpowder or possibly lack thereof in incendiary weapons as described by Chinese documents, the weakness of Chinese firearms, the non-existent route of diffusion or evidence of guns between Europe and China before 1326, and emphasize the independent evolution of superior guns in Europe.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75-76}} This too becomes problematic as already discussed above. Notably there is an acute dearth of any significant evidence of evolution or experimentation with gunpowder or gunpowder weapons leading up to the gun in 1326, which can be found in China.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=58}} Gunpowder appeared in Europe primed for military usage as an explosive and propellant, bypassing a process which took centuries of Chinese experimentation with gunpowder weaponry to reach, making a nearly instantaneous and seamless transition into gun warfare, as its name suggests. Furthermore, early European gunpowder recipes shared identical defects with Chinese recipes such as the inclusion of the poisons sal ammoniac and arsenic, which provide no benefit to gunpowder.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=21}} Bert S. Hall explains this phenomenon in his ''Weapons and Warfare in Renaissance Europe: Gunpowder, Technology, and Tactics'' by drawing upon the gunpowder transmission theory, explaining that "gunpowder came [to Europe], not as an ancient mystery, but as a well-developed modern technology, in a manner very much like twentieth-century 'technology-transfer' projects."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}} In a similar vein Peter Lorge supposes that the Europeans experienced gunpowder "free from preconceived notions of what could be done," in contrast to China, "where a wide range of formulas and a broad variety of weapons demonstrated the full range of possibilities and limitations of the technologies involved."{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=17}} There is also the vestige of Chinese influence, and not European, on Muslim terminology of some gunpowder related items such as saltpeter, which has been described as either Chinese snow or salt, fireworks which were called Chinese flowers, and rockets which were called Chinese arrows.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75-76}} Moreover, Europeans in particular experienced great difficulty in obtaining saltpeter, a primary ingredient of gunpowder which was relatively scarce in Europe compared to China, and had to be obtained from "distant lands or extracted at high cost from soil rich in dung and urine."{{sfn|Cressy|2013|p=14}} Thomas Arnold believes that the similarities between early European cannons and contemporary Chinese models suggests a direct transmission of cannon making knowledge from China rather than a home grown development.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=24}} Whatever the truth may be, the first unambiguous references to guns appeared in Europe in the 1320s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}}

The Mongol army incorporated Chinese siege units in 1214 and they constituted part of the body which invaded [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|Khwarezmia]] in 1219. Chinese siege units saw action in Transoxania in 1220 and in the north Caucasus during the 1239–1240 [[Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia]]. Furthermore, the ''[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]]'' records that [[Hulagu Khan]] procured one thousand families of Chinese siege experts in 1253, five years prior to the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]].{{sfn|Khan|2004|p=19}} Some historians speculate that the Chinese may have used siege weapons to hurl gunpowder bombs during their time in the Mongol army.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=58}} A common theory among historians is that the Mongol invasion brought Chinese gunpowder weapons to Central Asia and other parts of the world.{{sfn|Adle|2003|p=474}}

The Muslim world acquired knowledge of gunpowder some time after 1240, but before 1280, by which time [[Hasan al-Rammah]] had written, in Arabic, recipes for gunpowder, instructions for the purification of saltpeter, and descriptions of gunpowder incendiaries. Gunpowder arrived in the Middle East, possibly through India, from China. This is implied by al-Rammah's usage of "terms that suggested he derived his knowledge from Chinese sources" and his refers to saltpeter as "Chinese snow" {{lang-ar|ثلج الصين}} {{transl|ar|DIN|thalj al-ṣīn}}, fireworks as "Chinese flowers" and rockets as "Chinese arrows".{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=22}} However, because al-Rammah attributes his material to "his father and forefathers", al-Hassan argues that gunpowder became prevalent in Syria and Egypt by "the end of the twelfth century or the beginning of the thirteenth".

A common theory of how gunpowder came to Europe is that it made its way along the [[Silk Road]] through the Middle East. Another is that it was brought to Europe during the Mongol invasion in the first half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Norris|2003|p=11}}{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=58}} Some sources claim that Chinese firearms and gunpowder weapons may have been deployed by Mongols against European forces at the [[Battle of Mohi]] in 1241.{{sfn|McNeill|1992|p=492}}{{sfn|Cowley|1993|p=86}} It may also have been due to [[Europeans in Medieval China|subsequent diplomatic and military contacts]] (see [[Franco-Mongol alliance]]). Professor Kenneth Warren Chase credits the Mongols for introducing into Europe gunpowder and its associated weaponry.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=58}}

The earliest European references to gunpowder are found in [[Roger Bacon]]'s ''[[Opus Majus]]'' from 1267.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=58}}{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=25}} Coincidentally Roger Bacon was known to have been a close friend of [[William of Rubruck]], who served as an ambassador to the Mongols from 1253-1255. William returned to Europe in 1257 and accounts of his journey were generally received with lackluster response and saw little circulation. However his friend Roger Bacon took particular interest in his experience. Historians such as Joseph Needham and Kenneth Chase have noted this and pointed out William of Rubruck as a possible intermediary in the transmission of gunpowder.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=58}}{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=186}} Roger Bacon's description of gunpowder usage also suggests it was commonly found in various parts of the world prior to its appearance in Europe:

{{quotation|By the flash and combustion of fires, and by the horror of sounds, wonders can be wrought, and at any distance that we wish – so that a man can hardly protect himself or endure it. There is a child's toy of sound and fire made in various parts of the world with powder of saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal of hazel wood. This powder is enclosed in an instrument of parchment the size of a finger, and since this can make such a noise that it seriously distresses the ears of men …  If the instrument was made of solid material the violence of the explosion would be much greater.{{sfn|McLahlan|2010|p=7-8}}{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=48-49}}|Roger Bacon}}

The oldest written recipes for gunpowder in Europe were recorded under the name Marcus Graecus or Mark the Greek between 1280 and 1300.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=23}}

Historian Kenneth Warren Chase has suggested that a medieval Armenian manuscript from 1307 which mentions powerful weapons that had been built by the Chinese is a reference to the Chinese invention of gunpowder. The Armenian monk Hetoum says this about China:{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=59}}

{{quotation|''The men of this countrey ar no stronge warryours nor valyant in armes, but they be moche subtyll and ingenyous; by mean wherof, often tymes they haue disconfyted and ouercome their ennymes by their engyns, and they haue dyuers sortes and maners of armours and engyns of warre whiche other nacions haue not.''}}

There is a record of a gun in Europe dating to 1322 being discovered in the nineteenth century but the artifact has since been lost.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=334}} The earliest known European depiction of a gun appeared in 1326 in a manuscript by [[Walter de Milemete]], although not necessarily drawn by him, known as ''De Nobilitatibus, sapientii et prudentiis regum'' (Concerning the Majesty, Wisdom, and Prudence of Kings), which displays a gun with a large arrow emerging from it and its user lowering a long stick to ignite the gun through the touchole{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=29}}{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}} In the same year, another similar illustration showed a darker gun being set off by a group of knights, which also featured in another work of de Milemete's, ''De secretis secretorum Aristotelis''.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|pp=76, 335}} On 11 February of that same year, the [[Signoria]] of [[Florence]] appointed two officers to obtain ''canones de mettallo'' and ammunition for the town's defense.{{sfn|Crosby|2002|p=120}} In the following year a document from the Turin area recorded a certain amount was paid "for the making of a certain instrument or device made by Friar Marcello for the projection of pellets of lead."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}} A reference from 1331 describes an attack mounted by two Germanic knights on [[Cividale del Friuli]], using gunpowder weapons of some sort.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=29}}{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}} The 1320s seem to have been the takeoff point for guns in Europe according to most modern military historians. Scholars suggest that the lack of gunpowder weapons in a well-traveled Venetian's catalogue for a new crusade in 1321 implies that guns were unknown in Europe up until this point, further solidifying the 1320 mark, however more evidence in this area may be forthcoming in the future.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}}

From the 1320s guns spread rapidly across Europe. The French raiding party that sacked and burned [[Southampton]] in 1338 brought with them a [[ribaudequin]] and 48 bolts (but only 3 pounds of gunpowder).&lt;ref name=kelly29&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kelly|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1341 the town of Lille had a "tonnoire master," and a tonnoire was an arrow-hurling gun. In 1345, two iron cannons were present in Toulouse. In 1346 Aix-la-Chapelle too possessed iron cannons which shot arrows (busa ferrea ad sagittandum tonitrum).{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=77-78}} The [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346 was one of the first in Europe where cannons were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kelly|2004|pp=19–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani describes the deployment of firearms thus, "The English king arranged his archers, of whom he had many, on the carts, and some below and with guns [bombarde] that threw out small iron pellets [pallottole] with fire, to frighten the French horsemen and cause them to desert."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=83}} Another incident in the summer of 1346 involved a man by the name of Peter de Bruges who demonstrated to the consuls of Tournai the power of an arrow shooting gun, which went off making "a terrible and tremendous noise," and the arrow flew over the town, landing in a monastery plaza, unceremoniously killing a man by headshot.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=78}} De Bruges ran in fear of prosecution but the consuls judged the incident an accident of no fault of his own.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=78}} Two years later the town of Deventer had in its possession three cannons, or ''dunrebussen'', and Frankfurt had cannons that shot arrows (''büzenpzle''), while the city of Rouen reported a "pot that shot iron arrows with fire" (pot de fer à traire garros à feu).{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=78}} In 1350 [[Petrarch]] wrote that the presence of cannons on the battlefield was 'as common and familiar as other kinds of arms'.&lt;ref name="norris 19"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Norris|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the transmission and growing use of guns in Europe also came an infamous reputation. At least three Europeans in the 14th century described guns as either abnormal or inhuman. For instance, in 1344 Petrarch writes, "I wonder that thou hast not also brazen globes, which are cast forth by the force of flame with a horrible sound of thunder. Was not the wrath of an immortal god thundering from heaven sufficient, that the small being man— oh cruelty joined to pride— must even thunder on earth? Human rage has endeavored to imitate the thunder which cannot be imitated … and that which is wont to be sent from the clouds is now thrown from an infernal instrument."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=78}} furthermore he compares guns to the plague, "This plague was only recently so rare as to be looked on as a miracle; now … it has become as common as any other kind of weapon."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=78}} Englishman John Mirfield describes the gun as "that devilish instrument of war colloquially termed gunne,"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=78}} and Francesco di Giorgio Martini thought likewise of the discovery of guns and gunpowder, attributing it "not to human but to devilish agency."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=78}} In the history of early European guns, Christian authorities made vehement remarks against the use of gunpowder weapons, calling them blasphemous and part of the 'Black Arts'. By the mid-14th century, however, even the army of the [[Papal States]] would be armed with artillery and gunpowder weapons.&lt;ref name="norris 12"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Norris|2003|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest archaeological examples of guns in Europe, there are two pieces from [[Sweden]], the Loshult gun, and lesser known Mörkö gun. Possibly Europe's oldest extant firearm, the Loshult gun is a cast-bronze gun in the shape of a vase discovered in 1861 and named after the Swedish parish where the farmer dug it up. It is generally dated to around the mid 14th century and measures 31&amp;nbsp;cm overall, at a weight of 9 kilograms; the bore at the muzzle is 36&amp;nbsp;mm narrowing down to 31&amp;nbsp;mm on its way to the rear. A replica made by scholars has performed well shooting both arrows and other projectiles such as lead balls, grapeshot, and pieces of flint. The arrows and lead balls proved capable of penetrating late medieval plate armor as well as hitting a stationary target 200 meters away. However scholars believe the gun was primarily used for short range engagements because of the deep ruts and scratches in the barrel, which suggests that it carried shrapnel, an inaccurate but deadly projectile. It is now preserved in the Statens Historiska Museet Stockholm, inv.-no. 2891.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=79-80}} The Mörkö gun was found by a fisherman in the Baltic Sea at the coast of Södermansland near Nynäs before 1828 and dates to around the same period as the Loshult gun, ca. 1390.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://gunneyg.info/Morko/html/MorkoWideBand.htm |title=Teh Morko Cold Case File |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]] the oldest gun is the Tannenberg handgonne discovered in 1849 at the bottom of a water well of the 1399 destroyed Tannenberg castle in Hessen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/blackpowder/handgonne.html |title=Handgonne Faustbüchse |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found with a lead ball still loaded, and its wooden staff nearby, which started decaying after being exposed to air. The gun was aimed using the wooden staff, which fit into the back socket of the gun.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=80}} References to ''gunnis cum telar'' (guns with handles) were recorded in 1350 and by 1411 it was recorded that [[John II of France|John the Good]], Duke of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], had 4000 [[handgun]]s stored in his armory.&lt;ref name="norris 8"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Norris|2003|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the late 14th century European and Ottoman guns began to deviate in purpose and design from guns in China, changing from small anti-personnel and incendiary devices to the larger artillery pieces most people imagine today when using the word "cannon."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=86}} If the 1320s can be considered the arrival of the gun on the European scene, then the end of the 14th century may very well be the departure point from the trajectory of gun development in China. In the last quarter of the 14th century, European guns grew larger and began to blast down fortifications.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=86}}

[[Gunpowder]] technology is believed to have arrived in [[History of India|India]] by the mid-14th century, but could have been introduced much earlier by the [[Mongols]], who had conquered both China and some borderlands of India, perhaps as early as the mid-13th century.

Naval gunpowder weapons also appeared and were rapidly adopted by Korean ships for conflicts against Japanese pirates in 1380 and 1383. By 1410, 160 Korean ships were reported to have equipped artillery of some sort. Mortars firing thunder-crash bombs are known to have been used, and four types of cannons are mentioned: chonja (heaven), chija (earth), hyonja (black), and hwangja (yellow), but their specifications are unknown. These cannons typically shot wooden arrows tipped with iron, the longest of which were nine feet long, but stone and iron balls were sometimes used as well.{{sfn|Turnbull|2003|p=20-21}}

The 15th through 18th centuries saw widespread improvement in gunpowder technology. Military developments in Europe and the aggressive application of technological advances in this period is usually referred to as [[early modern warfare]], when Europe gained a global advantage in deep-water warfare and fortress architecture.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=5}} Eventually military science in Europe led to a marked technological departure from the rest of the world known as the [[Great Divergence]], a term coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]. Gunpowder remained of central importance until it was replaced by more advanced explosives beginning in the 1860s.

===Early Ming firearms===
{{main|Gunpowder weapons in the Ming dynasty}}

Gun development and proliferation in China continued under the Ming dynasty. The success of its founder [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], who declared his reign to be the era of Hongwu, or "Great Martiality," has often been attributed to his effective use of guns. Early Ming military codes stipulated that ideally 10 percent of all soldiers should be gunners. By 1380 the Ming dynasty boasted around 130,000 gunners out of its 1.3 to 1.8 million strong army. Under the Hongwu Emperor's successors, the percentage climbed higher and by the 1440s it reached 20 percent. In 1466 the ideal composition was 30 percent. The Hongwu Emperor created a Bureau of Armaments (軍器局) which was tasked with producing every three years 3000 handheld bronze guns, 3000 signal cannons, and ammunition as well as accoutrements such as ramrods. His Armory Bureau (兵仗局) was responsible for producing types of guns known as "great generals," "secondary generals," "tertiary generals," and "gate-seizing generals." Other firearms such as "miraculous [fire] lances," "miraculous guns," and "horse-beheading guns" were also produced. It is unclear what proportion or how many of each type were actually manufactured.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=55-56}} However most early Ming guns weighed only two to three kilograms while guns considered "large" at the time weighed around only seventy-five kilograms. A gun known as the "Great Bowl-Mouth Tube" (大碗口筒) dated to 1372 weighs only 15.75 kilograms and was 36.5 centimeters long, its muzzle 11 centimeters in diameter. Other excavated guns of this type range from 8.35 to 26.5 kilograms. While they were usually mounted on ships or gates they were also relatively small compared to the cannons of the 16th to 17th centuries associated with naval warfare. Ming sources suggest guns such as these shot stones and iron balls, but were primarily used against men rather than for causing structural damage to ships or walls. Accuracy was low and they were limited to a range of only 50 paces or so.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=59-60}}

Despite the relatively small size of Ming guns, some elements of gunpowder weapon design followed world trends.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} The growing length to muzzle bore ratio matched the rate at which European guns were developing up until the 1450s. The practice of corning gunpowder had been developed by 1370 for the purpose of increasing explosive power in land mines,{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} and was arguably used in guns as well according to one record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, which was probably only possible at the time with the usage of corned powder.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=16}} Around the same year Ming guns transitioned from using stone shots to iron ammunition, which has greater density and increased firearm power.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=105}}

Guns as well as other gunpowder weapons were used in abundance during the famous [[Battle of Lake Poyang]] which lasted from 30 August to 4 October 1363. There were at least a hundred vessels and approximately 500,000 combatants altogether involved, although traditional numbers have gone even higher. Poyang Lake was situated on a strategic location  connecting the Yangtze with other river basins and in the early 1360s Zhu Yuanzhang held key garrisons on the lake, which he administered from [[Nanjing]] 560 kilometers downriver. Upstream was the state of Han (大漢; Pinyin: ''Dahan'', "Great Han") under [[Chen Youliang]], who set out to wrest control of the lake from Zhu Yuanzhang. Chen's force consisted of "tower ships" designed for depositing soldiers on riverside city walls rather than waterborne combat, and the purpose of these ships was to capture the city of Nanchang, which guarded Lake Poyang from the south. This proved futile as the city defenders simply moved the walls back, and Chen was forced to personally lead an assault on the city gates, which was met with a counterattack with huochong (early Ming guns), and they were driven back. After this failure, Chen set up a blockade, determined to starve out the defenders, but a small fishing boat managed to slip out and reached Nanjing in time to warn Zhu Yuanzhang.{{sf|Andrade|2016|p=59}}

Zhu's fleet arrived at Poyang Lake on 29 August faced with Chen's larger force and was outnumbered three to two. According to one Ming source, Zhu's force arrived armed with "fire bombs, fire guns, fire arrows, fire seeds [probably grenades], large and small fire lances, large and small 'commander' fire-tubes, large and small iron bombs, rockets."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=60}} This shows that older gunpowder weapons co-existed alongside guns, and proto-guns such as fire lances were not supplanted until after early Ming. A new weapon called the "No Alternative" was also mentioned. The No Alternative was "made from a circular reed mat about five inches around and seven feet long that was pasted over with red paper and bound together with silk and hemp— stuffed inside it was gunpowder twisted in with bullets and all kinds of [subsidiary] gunpowder weapons."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=60}} It was hung from a pole on the foremast, and when an enemy ship came into close range, the fuse was lit, and the weapon would supposedly fall onto the enemy ship, at which point things inside shot out "and burned everything to bits, with no hope of salvation."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=60}} Zhu's fleet engaged Chen's under orders to "get close to the enemy's ships and first set off gunpowder weapons (發火器), then bows and crossbows, and finally attack their ships with short range weapons."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=61}} Fire bombs were hurled using naval trebuchets and the Ming succeeded in "burning twenty or more enemy vessels and killing or drowning many enemy troops."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=62}} Ming eventually came out victorious by ramming and burning the enemy fleet with fire ships. While guns were used during the battle, ultimately they were not pivotal to success, and the battle was won using incendiary weapons.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=63}}

In 1358 at the Siege of Shaoxing the defenders "used ... fire tubes to attack the enemy's advance guard" against Ming.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=66}} The siege was won by the defenders, whose "fire tubes went off all at once, and the [attacker's] great army could not stand against them and had to withdraw."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=67}} Ming began fielding cannons in greater proportions during the Siege of Suzhou in 1366, but they were relatively small and were used primarily for killing human beings rather than creating a breech in the city's defensive fortifications. [[Suzhou]]'s fortifications were previously rebuilt in 1352 and contemporary documents of the city wall record a width of eleven meters at the base, five meters at the top, seven meters high, and seventeen kilometers all around. The walls were constructed using tamped earth covered with brick and sloped from bottom to top. Ming commander Xu Da ordered the army to set up a blockade. Watchtowers 13 meters high were constructed, which the ''Ming Veritable Records'' notes "were placed bows and guns."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=66}} Each of the 48 Ming divisions (衛) were equipped with 50 large and small "general tubes" (大小將軍筒) for a total of 2400 guns, and besieged the city. Large ones weighed only 80 kilograms or less and the majority were small ones which weighed a couple kilograms at most. The largest possibly a meter long with a muzzle diameter of 21 centimeters, but these would have been rare exceptions in the early Ming arsenal.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=66}} The lack of larger siege weapons in China unlike the rest of the world where cannons grew larger and more potent has been attributed to the immense thickness of traditional Chinese walls, which Tonio Andrade suggests provided no incentive for creating larger cannons, since even industrial artillery had trouble overcoming them.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=66}} Chinese walls during the Ming period continued the traditional building practices and nearly every prefectural and provincial capital was fortified with walls between 10 and 20 meters thick at the base and 5 to 10 meters wide at the top.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=97}}

Each division was also equipped with five [[Xiangyang]] [[Trebuchet]]s and five "Seven-Component Trebuchets" (七梢炮), which were used to destroy wooden structure on the walls, but were unable to breech the walls themselves despite the fact that "the noise of the guns and the paos went day and night and didn't stop."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=69}} In a rare occurrence of Chinese history, the city defenses were eventually breached, but this happened through the gates, which were covered by an outwork, outer gate, and finally consisted of an inner gate. Rather than bombarding the entrance, the breach was made by traditional manual mining and battering. This was only possible because the defenders were already starving by mid-autumn of 1367 and unable to put up a proper resistance, succumbing to the onslaught of a frontal assault.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=70-72}} The battle continued inside the city where [[Zhang Shicheng]]'s remaining 20 thousand troops engaged in street to street combat until he fled from his palace. His wives and concubines burned themselves to death. Zhang then tried to commit suicide, but was captured and taken back to Nanjing as "a guest."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=72}}

Despite the increasing quantity of guns fielded in battles and sieges, Ming cannons remained relatively small and limited to anti-personnel purposes.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=72}} The peak of Chinese cannon development is exemplified by the muzzle loading wrought iron "great general cannon" (大將軍炮) which weighed up to 360 kilograms and could fire a 4.8 kilogram lead ball. Its heavier variant, the "great divine cannon" (大神銃), could weigh up to 600 kilograms and was capable of firing several iron balls and upward of a hundred iron shots at once. The great general and divine cannons were the last indigenous Chinese cannon designs prior to the incorporation of European models in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://greatmingmilitary.blogspot.com/2015/07/da-jiang-jun-pao.html |title=Da Jiang Jun Pao (大將軍砲) |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|History of artillery}}
{{further information|Culverin|Italian Wars}}

The development of large [[artillery]] pieces and larger guns began with [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]. Originally a minor power, it grew to become one of the most powerful states in 14th-century Europe, and a great innovator in siege warfare. The Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Bold]] (1363-1404), based his power on the effective use of big guns and promoted research and development in all aspects of gunpowder weaponry technology. Philip established manufacturers and employed more cannon casters than any European power before him, however he wasn't the first to build large guns. The first appeared in 1375 when a dozen or so smiths in [[Caen]] developed a 900 kilogram cannon which took six weeks to create. Whereas most European guns before 1370 weighed about 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;lbs (9–14&amp;nbsp;kg), the French siege of [[Château de Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte]] in 1375 during the [[Hundred Years War]] saw the use of guns weighing over a [[ton]] (900&amp;nbsp;kg), firing stone balls weighing over 100&amp;nbsp;lbs (45&amp;nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=34}} Philip used large guns to help [[Kingdom of France|the French]] capture the fortress of [[Odruik]] in 1377, which was held by [[Kingdom of England|the English]] at the time. These guns fired projectiles far larger than any that had been used before, and among the 140 cannons Philip brought to Odruik, 109 were large, with seven guns that could shoot projectiles as heavy as 90 kilograms. The cannons smashed the city walls, some going right through them, and Odruik surrendered, inaugurating a new era of artillery warfare. Burgundy's territories rapidly expanded using their new gun designs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=88-89}}

Europe entered an arms race to build ever larger artillery pieces. Burgundy's guns continued to develop, and in the same year that Odruik fell, Philip's smith constructed a gun capable of shooting balls weighing 200 kilograms. In 1382 an "incredibly huge bombard"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=89}} was aimed at [[Oudenaarde]], its muzzle 60 inches around and 20 inches in diameter. One observer described it thus, "One could hear it for five leagues in the daytime, and ten leagues at night, and it made such a huge noise that … it seemed as though all the demons of hell were present."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=89-90}} By the early 15th century both French and English armies were equipped with larger pieces known as [[bombard (weapon)|bombard]]s, weighing up to 5 tons (4,535&amp;nbsp;kg) and firing balls weighing up to 300&amp;nbsp;lbs (136&amp;nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=34}} In 1404 a cannon was created with the inscription, "I am named Katrin. Beware of what I hold. I punish injustice."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=90}} In 1411 the cast iron cannon Faule Mette was created, and it was capable of shooting stone balls weighing 400 kilograms, but didn't very often.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=90}} The artillery trains used by [[Henry V of England]] in the 1415 [[Siege of Harfleur]] and 1419 [[Siege of Rouen]] proved effective in breaching French fortifications, while artillery contributed to the victories of French forces under [[Joan of Arc]] in the [[Loire Campaign (1429)]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=34-35}} It wasn't just the English blasting their way through France either. Burgundy started by battering down the walls of Vellexon in 1409 and in 1411 they took Ham with only three shots from their bombard Griette.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=90}} France eventually came around under the reforms of [[Charles V of France|King Charles V]] (1422-1461), whose leadership made France the premier artillery force in Europe, and won the Hundred Years' War. Gun developments in France would prove extremely effective during the Italian wars of the 1490s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=92}} In 1431 a wrought-iron cannon was forged, weighing over 12,000 kilograms and could fire projectiles of 300 kilograms. It was called the Dulle Griet.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=90}} These weapons were transformational for European warfare. A hundred years earlier the Frenchman Pierre Dubois wrote that a "castle can hardly be taken within a year, and even if it does fall, it means more expenses for the king's purse and for his subjects than the conquest is worth,"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=90}} but by the 15th century European walls fell with the utmost regularity.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was also developing their own artillery pieces. [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] (1432-1481) was determined to procure large cannons for the purpose of conquering [[Constantinople]] and paid handsomely as well as allowed creative autonomy for cannon makers. One of the cannon makers that responded to his call was a Hungarian named [[Orban|Urban]], who left [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] after being denied a raise by the [[Byzantine emperor]]. Urban labored for four months to create a six meter long cannon, which required hundreds of pounds of gunpowder to fire, and its stone projectiles weighed between 550 and 800 kilograms. The gun's projectiles were reported to have flown for a mile before landing, and shook the entire ground when fired, the roar blasting four miles away. It had to be transported by 30 wagons pulled by 60 oxen, with the assistance of 200 handlers. An additional 50 carpenters and 200 laborers helped in the transport by leveling terrain and building bridges.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=93}} During the actual [[Siege of Constantinople (1453)|siege of Constantinople]] the gun proved to be somewhat underwhelming. The aiming process was laborious and after each shot it required hot oil ointment for cooling. Its rate of fire was once every three hours, and may have even suffered damage from cracks early on, never to be repaired.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=94}}

Fortunately for the Ottomans it wasn't Mehmed's only cannon. Dozens of other large cannons alongside 500 smaller cannons bombarded [[Walls of Constantinople|Constantinople's walls]] in their weakest sections for 55 days. A Greek contemporary, Kritoboulos, describes the scene thus, "The stone, borne with tremendous force and velocity, hit the wall, which it immediately shook and knocked down, and was itself broken into many fragments and scattered, hurling the pieces everywhere and killing those who happened by be near by. Sometimes it demolished a whole section, and sometimes a half-section, and sometimes a larger or smaller section of a tower or turret or battlement. And there was no part of the wall strong enough or resistant enough or thick enough to be able to withstand it, or to wholly resist such force and such a blow of the stone cannon-ball."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=94}} Mehmed's smaller artillery pieces also proved effective. Constantinople's defenders wielded their own formidable guns and "fired … five or ten bullets at a time, each about the size of a … walnut, and having a great power of penetration. If one of these hit an armed man it would go right through his shield and his body and go on to hit anyone else who happened to be in his way, and even a third, until the force of the powder diminished; so one shot might hit two or three men."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=94}} Despite the fierce defense, the city's fortifications were ultimately overwhelmed in a final assault and the sultan won the siege.

====Chinese wall theory====

{{further information|Chinese city wall}}

While China was the birthplace of gunpowder the guns there remained relatively small and light, weighing less than 80 kilograms or less for the large ones, and only a couple kilograms at most for the small ones during the early Ming era. Guns themselves had proliferated throughout China and become a common sight during sieges, so the question has arisen then why large guns were not first developed in China. According to Tonio Andrade, this wasn't a matter of metallurgy, which was sophisticated in China, and the Ming dynasty did construct large guns in the 1370s, but never followed up afterwards. Nor was it the lack of warfare, which other historians have suggested to be the case, but does not stand up to scrutiny as walls were a constant factor of war which stood in the way of many Chinese armies since time immemorial into the twentieth century. The answer Andrade provides is simply that Chinese walls were much less vulnerable to bombardment.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=96}} Andrade argues that traditional Chinese walls were built differently from medieval European walls in ways which made them more resistant to cannon fire.

Chinese walls were bigger than medieval European walls. In the mid-twentieth century a European expert in fortification commented on their immensity: "in China … the principal towns are surrounded to the present day by walls so substantial, lofty, and formidable that the medieval fortifications of Europe are puny in comparison."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=96}} Chinese walls were thick. Ming prefectural and provincial capital walls were ten to twenty meters thick at the base and five to ten meters at the top. 

In Europe the height of wall construction was reached under the [[Roman Empire]], whose walls often reached ten meters in height, the same as many Chinese city walls, but were only 1.5 to 2.5 meters thick. Rome's Servian Walls reached 3.6 and 4 meters in thickness and 6 to 10 meters in height. Other fortifications also reached these specifications across the empire, but all these paled in comparison to contemporary Chinese walls, which could reach a thickness of 20 meters at the base in extreme cases. Even the walls of Constantinople which have been described as "the most famous and complicated system of defence in the civilized world,"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=92}} could not match up to a major Chinese city wall.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=97}} Had both the outer and inner walls of Constantinople been combined, they would have only reached roughly a bit more than a third the width of a major wall in China.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=97}} According to [[Philo]] the width of a wall had to be 4.5 meters thick to be able to withstand artillery.{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=363}} European walls of the 1200s and 1300s could reach the Roman equivalents but rarely exceeded them in length, width, and height, remaining around two meters thick. It is apt to note that when referring to a very thick wall in medieval Europe, what is usually meant is a wall of 2.5 meters in width, which would have been considered thin in a Chinese context.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=98}} There are some exceptions such as the [[Hillfort of Otzenhausen]], a Celtic ringfort with a thickness of forty meters in some parts, but Celtic fort-building practices died out in the early medieval period.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=339}} Andrade goes on to note that the walls of the ''marketplace'' of Chang'an were thicker than the walls of major European capitals.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=98}} 

Aside from their immense size, Chinese walls were also structurally different from the ones built in medieval Europe. Whereas European walls were mostly constructed of stone interspersed with gravel or rubble filling and bonded by limestone mortar, Chinese walls had tamped earthen cores which absorbed the energy of artillery shots.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=99}} Walls were constructed using wooden frameworks which were filled with layers of earth tamped down to a highly compact state, and once that was completed the frameworks were removed for use in the next wall section. Starting from the Song dynasty these walls were improved with an outer layer of bricks or stone to prevent corrosion, and during the Ming, earthworks were interspersed with stone and rubble.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=99}} Most Chinese walls were also sloped rather than vertical to better deflect projectile energy.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=100}}

The Chinese Wall Theory essentially rests on a cost benefit hypothesis, where the Ming recognized the highly resistant nature of their walls to structural damage, and could not imagine any affordable development of the guns available to them at the time to be capable of breaching said walls. Even as late as the 1490s a Florentine diplomat considered the French claim that "their artillery is capable of creating a breach in a wall of eight feet in thickness"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=101}} to be ridiculous and the French "braggarts by nature."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=101}} In fact ''twentieth'' century explosive shells had some difficulty creating a breach in tamped earthen walls.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=43}} 

{{quotation|We fought our way to Nanking and joined in the attack on the enemy capital in December. It was our unit which stormed the Chunghua Gate. We attacked continuously for about a week, battering the brick and earth walls with artillery, but they never collapsed. The night of December 11, men in my unit breached the wall. The morning came with most of our unit still behind us, but we were beyond the wall. Behind the gate great heaps of sandbags were piled up. We 'cleared them away, removed the lock, and opened the gates, with a great creaking noise. We'd done it! We'd opened the fortress! All the enemy ran away, so we didn't take any fire. The residents too were gone. When we passed beyond the fortress wall we thought ''we'' had occupied this city.{{sfn|Cook|2000|p=32}}|Nohara Teishin}}

Andrade goes on to question whether or not Europeans would have developed large artillery pieces in the first place had they faced the more formidable Chinese style walls, coming to the conclusion that such exorbitant investments in weapons unable to serve their primary purpose would not have been ideal.{{sfn|Andrade|103}} Yet Chinese walls do not fully explain the divergence in gun development as European guns grew not only bigger, but more effective as well. By 1490 the European gun had achieved the basic form it would take for the next three centuries, during which it would dominate the fields of warfare.{{sfn|Andrade|103}} The Classic Gun had arrived, and in the 1510s and 1520s when the Chinese encountered European firearms, they fully recognized they were superior to their own.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=103}}

====Chase hypothesis====



Asianist Kenneth Chase offers another theory as to why gun development stagnated during the Ming dynasty. Chase argues that guns were not particularly useful against China's traditional enemies: horse nomads.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} Guns were supposedly problematic to deploy against nomads because of their size and slow speed, drawing out supply chains, and creating logistical challenges. Theoretically, the more mobile nomads took the initiative in sallying, retreating, and engaging at will. Chinese armies therefore relied less heavily on guns in warfare than Europeans, who fought large infantry battles and sieges which favored guns, or so Chase argues.

However, the Chase hypothesis has been refuted based on observations made by Tonio Andrade, who notes that the Asian nomad argument becomes problematic when viewed through a Chinese perspective.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} For the Chinese themselves considered guns to be highly valuable against nomads. During the Ming-Mongol wars of the 1300s and early 1400s guns were utilized, notably in defending against a Mongol invasion in 1449, and guns were in high demand along the northern borders where gun emplacements were common.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} Several sources make it clear that Chinese military leaders found guns to be highly effective against nomads throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. The military scholar Weng Wanda goes as far as to claim that only with firearms could one hope to succeed against the fast moving Mongols, and purchased special guns for both the Great Wall defenses and offensive troops who fought in the steppes. Andrade also points out that Chase downplays the amount of warfare going on outside of the northern frontier, specifically southern China where huge infantry battles and sieges such as in Europe were the norm. In 1368 the Ming army invaded Sichuan, Mongolia, and Yunnan. Although little mention of firearm is used in accounts of the Mongolia campaign, Ming cannons readily routed the war elephants of Yunnan,{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=43}} and in the case of Sichuan, both sides employed equally potent firearms. When the Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang died, the civil war which ensued had Chinese armies fighting one another, again with equally powerful firearms. After the usurper Yongle's victory, the Ming embarked upon yet another five expeditions into Mongolia alongside an invasion of Dai Viet, many of their troops wielding firearms. In 1414 the Ming army clashed with an Oirat force near the Tula River and frightened them so much with their guns that the Oirats fled without their spare horses, only to be ambushed by concealed Chinese guns. According to a Chinese observer the Oirats avoided battle several days later, "fearing that the guns had arrived again."{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=45}} In Vietnam, as with Yunnan, the war elephants fared poorly and were defeated with a combination of arrows and firearms. Chinese firearms were used in defensive fortifications to some effect, but were ineffective at targeting individual targets such as Vietnamese guerillas presented themselves.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=48-49}}

Chase's argument has also been criticized by Stephen Morillo for its reliance on a simple cause and effect analysis.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=14}} Alternatively Morillo suggests that the major difference between Chinese and European weapon development was economic. Within Morillo's framework, European weapons were more competitive due to private manufacturing whereas Chinese weapons were manufactured according to government specifications. Although generally true, Peter Lorge points out that gun specifications were widespread in China, and ironically the true gun was first developed during the Song dynasty, when guns were the exclusive enterprise of the government, suggesting that the economics of production were less influential on gun development than assumed. In contrast, less innovation occurred during the Ming dynasty when most of production was shifted to the domain of private artisans.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=14}} Andrade concludes that although the Chase hypothesis should not be discarded outright, it does not offer a full explanation for the stagnation of firearm development in China.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=112}}

{{further information|Star fort|Bastion}}

The star fort, also known as the bastion fort, ''trace italienne'', or renaissance fortress, was a style of fortification that became popular in Europe during the 16th century. As a response to gunpowder artillery, European fortifications began displaying architectural principles such as lower and thicker walls in the mid-1400s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}} Cannon towers were built with artillery rooms where cannons could discharge fire from slits in the walls. However this proved problematic as the slow rate of fire, reverberating concussions, and noxious fumes produced greatly hindered defenders. Gun towers also limited the size and number of cannon placements because the rooms could only be built so big. Notable surviving artillery towers include a seven layer defensive structure built in 1480 at [[Fougères]] in [[Brittany]], and a four layer tower built in 1479 at Querfurth in Saxony.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=37}} Eventually defensive artillery towers gave way to the star fort's angle bastions. The bastion and star fort was developed in Italy, where the Florentine engineer [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] (1445-1516) compiled a comprehensive defensive plan using the geometric [[bastion]] and full ''trace italienne'' that became widespread in Europe.{{sfn|Nolan|2006|p=67}} The main distinguishing features of the star fort were its angle bastions, each placed to support their neighbor with lethal crossfire, covering all angles, making them extremely difficult to engage with and attack. Angle bastions consisted of two faces and two flanks. Artillery positions positioned at the flanks could fire parallel into the opposite bastion's line of fire, thus providing two lines of cover fire against an armed assault on the wall, and preventing mining parties from finding refuge. Meanwhile, artillery positioned on the bastion platform could fire frontally from the two faces, also providing overlapping fire with the opposite bastion.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=40}} Overlapping mutually supporting defensive fire was the greatest advantage enjoyed by the star fort. As a result, sieges lasted longer and became more difficult affairs. By the 1530s the bastion fort had become the dominant defensive structure in Italy.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=45}} Outside Europe, the star fort became an "engine of European expansion,"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}} and acted as a force multiplier so that small European garrisons could hold out against numerically superior forces. Wherever star forts were erected the natives experienced great, but not insurmountable difficulty, in uprooting European invaders.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}}

===Development of the Classic Gun===

[[File:16th Century Artillerie.jpg|thumb|16th-century Artillerie]]
[[File:French bastard culverin 1548 with arms of Henri II and Catherine de Medicis and crescent of Diane 85mm 300cm 1076kg.jpg|thumb|French bastard culverin dated to 1548, 85mm 300cm 1076kg.]]
[[File:Coulevrine Etudes-3 P.172 2-3.png|thumb|Two 15th-century culverins, one of forged iron, the other of cast bronze.]]

Gun development and design in Europe reached its "classic" form in the 1480s. The so-called Classic Gun is referred to thus for its longer, lighter, more efficient, and more accurate design compared to its predecessors only three decades prior. Indeed, cannons of the 1480s show little difference and surprising similarity with cannons three centuries later in the 1750s. This 300-year period during which the classic cannon dominated gives it its moniker.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=103-104}} The early classical European guns are exemplified by two cannons from 1488 now preserved in a plaza in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. The Neuchâtel guns are 224 centimeters long, with a bore of 6.2 centimeters and the other is slightly longer, 252 centimeters, with the same bore size. Classical guns such as these are differentiated from older firearms by an assortment of improvements. Their longer length-to-bore ratio imparts more energy into the shot, enabling the projectile to shoot further. Not only longer, they were also lighter as the barrel walls were made thinner to allow for faster dissipation of heat. Classical guns also no longer needed the help of a wooden plug to load since they offered a tighter fit between projectile and barrel, further increasing the accuracy of gunpowder warfare.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=104-106}} Classical guns were deadlier due to the combination of new weapon developments such as gunpowder corning and the iron shot, which had been gradually adopted in Europe during the 1400s. When these guns reached China in the 1510s, the Chinese were highly impressed by them, primarily for their longer and thinner barrels.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=107}}

The two primary theories for the appearance of the classic gun involve the development of gunpowder corning and a new method for casting guns. The corning hypothesis stipulates that the longer barrels came about as a reaction to the development of corned gunpowder. Around the late 14th century European powdermakers began adding liquid to the constituents of gunpowder, which reduced dust, and with it the risk of explosion during manufacture. The powder makers would then shape the resulting paste of moistened gunpowder—known as mill cake—into "corns" or granules to allow it to dry. Not only did "corned" powder keep better, because of its reduced surface area, but gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. The main advantage of corning is that the flame lights all the granules when the gunpowder is lit, spreading between them before significant gas expansion has occurred. Without corning, much of the powder away from the initial flame would be blown out of the barrel before it burnt. The size of the granules varied for different types of gun. Prior to corning, gunpowder would frequently demix into its constitutive components and was an unreliable substance for use in guns.&lt;ref&gt;Molerus, Otto. "History of Civilization in the Western Hemisphere from the Point of View of Particulate Technology, Part 2," Advanced Powder Technology 7 (1996): 161–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The same granulation process is used nowadays in the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that each [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] contains the same proportion of active ingredient. Before long, powdermakers standardized the process by forcing mill cake through sieves instead of corning powder by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kelly|2004|pp=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faster gunpowder reaction was suitable for smaller guns, since large ones had a tendency to crack, and the more controlled reaction allowed large guns to have longer, thinner walls.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=109}}

Although the logical follow through is sound, the corning hypothesis has been refuted for two reasons. One, the powder makers were probably more worried about spoilage than the effect of corned gunpowder on guns, and two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} In Europe corning arose as a response to the difficulty of obtaining pure saltpeter, specifically saltpeter consisting of potassium nitrate, rather than sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate, the latter two of which absorb water vapor more readily than potassium nitrate. Thus corning was an imperative to producing reliable weaponized gunpowder. Supposedly this was much less problematic in Asia, where pure saltpeter was more readily available and easily manufactured.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=109}} In China gunpowder corning had been practiced since the 1370s for the purpose of strengthening the explosive power of mines, since gunpowder corns provided more space required for a rapid combustion.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} Corned powder might also have been used in guns based on a record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, a distance probably only possible with the aid of corned powder at the time.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=16}}

The second theory comes from Kay Smith who points out that key to developing the classic gun may be a new method of gun casting, muzzle side up.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} Smith observes: "The surviving pieces of ordnance from earlier in the 15th century are big pieces with large bore sizes. They do not look like the long thin gun.… Essentially they are parallel-sided tubes with flat ends. The explanation is, probably, that they were cast muzzle down in the traditional bell-founding method whereas the long thin guns were cast muzzle up.… Perhaps this marks the real 'revolution' in artillery. Once the technique of casting muzzle up with the attendant advantages, and it is not clear what those are at present, had been mastered by cannon founders, the way was open for the development of the 'classic' form of artillery."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} However, Smith himself states that it is not clear what advantages this technique would have conferred, despite its widespread adoption.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}}

====Iron and bronze cannons====

Across the 15th and 16th centuries there were primarily two different types of manufactured cannons. The wrought iron cannon and the cast-bronze cannon. Wrought iron guns were structurally composed of two layers: an inner tube of iron staves held together in a tight fit by an outer case of iron hoops. Bronze cannons on the other hand were cast in one piece similar to bells. The technique used in casting bronze cannons was so similar to the bell that the two were often looked upon as a connected enterprise. Church bells in the age of Catholic authority were viewed as idolatrous and met their end as raw metal used for casting cannons.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=26}}

Both iron and bronze cannons had their advantages and disadvantages. Forged iron cannons were far cheaper, up to ten times so, than bronze cannons, but more unstable due to their piece built nature. Iron cannons tended to burst apart, sometimes killing or severely maiming their operators. Successive firings took their toll on iron cannons as individual pieces were shook loose. Bronze cannons simply cracked. Even without use, iron cannons were liable to rust away. Bronze cannons did not rust. Another less practical reason for the dominance of bronze cannons was their aesthetic appeal. Because cannons were so important as displays of power and prestige, rulers liked to commission bronze cannons, which could be sculpted into fanciful designs such as flute columns, lions' and serpents' mouths, containing artistic motifs or symbols. It was for these reasons that the cast-bronze cannon became the preferred type by the late 1400s. By the late 1500s only small breech-loading pieces were made of wrought iron. Iron cannons would regain ground in the late 1500s as improved casting techniques allowed cast-iron cannons to become more reliable, although still inferior to the safer bronze cannons.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=27}}

====Steel====
According to a metallographic study by Tetsuo Shoji on a Chinese cannon forged in 1377, cast steel technology was already available for Chinese cannon making in the early [[Ming dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290473183_Metallographic_Study_of_Hongwu_Cannon_Casted_in_the_Early_Ming_Dynasty|title=Metallographic Study of Hongwu Cannon Casted in the Early Ming Dynasty|access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Composite metal cannons====


[[File:Taku Composite Metal Cannons.jpg|thumb|Composite metal cannons encountered by the British at the [[Taku Forts]] in 1860.]]

Although few in number there were some exceptions to the bronze and iron paradigm. Composite metal cannons were produced in the Ming and Qing dynasties during the 17th century. In China, the Ming dynasty started producing smoothbore breech loading cast-bronze cannons after the European fashion no later than 1620. However, in addition to European expertise and design, the Chinese had an advantage in their long history of metal casting practices. Two decades after the Ming started manufacturing Dutch style cannons known to the Chinese as ''red barbarian cannons'' (紅夷炮 [[hongyipao]]), Ming foundries merged native casting technology with improved cannon designs to create a distinctive cannon known as the "Dingliao grand general." Through combining the advanced cast-iron technique of southern China and the iron-bronze composite barrels invented in northern China, the Dingliao grand general cannons exemplified the best of both iron and bronze cannon designs. Unlike traditional iron and bronze cannons, the Dingliao grand general'rs inner barrel was made of iron, while the exterior of brass.{{sfn|Anrade|2016|p=201}}&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise and Fall of Distinctive Composite-Metal Cannons Cast During the Ming-Qing Period|url=http://thjcs.web.nthu.edu.tw/files/14-1662-63632,r3836-1.php?Lang=zh-tw|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Huang Yi-long describes the process:

{{quotation|They ingeniously took advantage of the fact that the melting temperature of copper (which is around 1000C) was lower than the casting temperature of iron (1150 to 1200C), so that just a bit after the iron core had cooled, they could then, using a clay or wax casting mold, add molten bronze to the iron core. In this way, the shrinkage that attended the cooling of the external brass would [reinforce the iron, which would] enable the tube to be able to resist intense firing pressure.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=201}}}}

The resulting bronze-iron composite cannons were superior to iron or bronze cannons in many respects. They were lighter, stronger, longer lasting, and able to withstand more intensive explosive pressure. Chinese artisans also experimented with other variants such as cannons featuring wrought iron cores with cast iron exteriors. While inferior to their bronze-iron counterparts, these were considerably cheaper and more durable than standard iron cannons. Both types met with success and were considered "among the best in the world"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=202}} during the 17th century. The Chinese composite metal casting technique was effective enough that Portuguese imperial officials sought to employ Chinese gunsmiths for their cannon foundries in Goa, so that they could impart their methods for Portuguese weapons manufacturing.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=202}}

Soon after the Ming started producing the composite metal Dingliao grand generals in 1642, Beijing was captured by the Manchu Qing dynasty and along with it all of northern China. The Manchu elite did not concern themselves directly with guns and their production, preferring instead to delegate the task to Chinese craftsmen, who produced for the Qing a similar composite metal cannon known as the "Shenwei grand general." However, after the Qing gained hegemony over East Asia in the mid-1700s, the practice of casting composite metal cannons fell into disuse until the dynasty faced external threats once again in the Opium War of 1840, at which point smoothbore cannons were already starting to become obsolete as a result of rifled barrels.&lt;ref name=Huang /&gt;

The concept of composite metal cannons is not exclusive to China. Although the southern Chinese started making cannons with iron cores and bronze outer shells as early as the 1530s, they were followed soon after by the Gujarats, who experimented with it in 1545, the English at least by 1580, and Hollanders in 1629. However the effort required to produce these weapons prevented them from mass production.The Europeans essentially treated them as experimental products, resulting in very few surviving pieces today.&lt;ref&gt;http://nautarch.tamu.edu/Theses/pdf-files/Hoskins-MA2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise and Fall of Distinctive Composite-Metal Cannons Cast During the Ming-Qing Period|url=http://thjcs.web.nthu.edu.tw/files/14-1662-63632,r3836-1.php?Lang=zh-tw|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the currently known extant composite metal cannons, there are 2 English, 2 Dutch, 12 Gujarati, and 48 from the Ming-Qing period.&lt;ref name=Huang /&gt;

===Arquebus and Musket===

{{further information|Arquebus|Musket|Matchlock}}

The arquebus, derived from the German ''Hackenbüchse'', was a form of handgun that appeared in Germany during the late 15th century. Although the term ''arquebus'' was applied to many different forms of firearms from the 15th to 17th centuries, it was originally used to describe "a hand-gun with a hook-like projection or lug on its under surface, useful for steadying it against battlements or other objects when firing."{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=426}} These "hook guns" were in their earliest forms defensive weapons mounted on German city walls in the early 1400s, but by the late 1400s had transitioned into handheld firearms, with heavier variants known as "muskets" that were fired from resting Y-shaped supports appearing by the early 1500s. The musket was able to penetrate all forms of armor available at the time, making armor obsolete, and as a consequence the heavy musket as well. Although there is relatively little to no difference in design between arquebus and musket except in size and strength, it was the term ''musket'' which remained in use up into the 1800s.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=61}} It may not be completely inaccurate to suggest that the musket was in its fabrication simply a larger arquebus. At least on one occasion the musket and arquebus have been used interchangeably to refer to the same weapon,{{sfn|Adle|2003|p=475}} and even referred to as an "arquebus musket."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=165}} A Habsburg commander in the mid-1560s once referred to muskets as "double arquebuses."{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=92}} The definition of arquebus and similar firearms is therefore quite convoluted as the term has been applied to different sorts of firearms as well as acquiring several names like ''hackbut,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=422}} ''harquebus'', ''schiopo,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=427}} ''sclopus,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=117}} ''tüfenk'',{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=19}} ''tofak'',{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=58}} ''matchlock'', and ''firelock''.{{sfn|Lidin|2002|p=3}} Some say that the hackbut was a forerunner of the arquebus.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=425}}

The ''matchlock'' firing mechanism became a common term for the arquebus after it was added to the firearm. Prior to the appearance of the matchlock, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked under one arm, while the other arm maneuvered a hot pricker to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75}} The matchlock changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The lock mechanism held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75}} Connected to the lock lever was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when pulled, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=24}} While matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=25}} To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=25}} In 1584 the Ming general [[Qi Jiguang]] composed an 11 step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: "One, clean the gun. Two pour the powder. Three tamp the powder down. Four drop the pellet. Five drive the pellet down. Six put in paper (stopper). Seven drive the paper down. Eight open the flashpan cover. Nine pour in the flash powder. Ten close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=176-175}} Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from between 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=144}}

The arquebus is considered to be the first portable "shoulder" arms firearm.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=xxvii}} Arquebuses were used as early as 1472 by the Spanish and Portuguese at Zamora. Likewise, the Castilians used arquebuses as well in 1476.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=123}} In 1496 Philip Monch of the Palatinate composed an illustrated ''Buch der Strynt un(d) Buchsse(n)'' on guns and "harquebuses."{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=160}} The Mamluks in particular were conservatively against the incorporation of gunpowder weapons. When faced with cannons and arquebuses wielded by the Ottomans they criticized them thus, "God curse the man who invented them, and God curse the man who fires on Muslims with them."{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} Insults were also levied against the Ottomans for having "brought with you this contrivance artfully devised by the Christians of Europe when they were incapable of meeting the Muslim armies on the battlefield."{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} Similarly, [[musketeer]]s and musket-wielding infantrymen were despised in society by the [[feudal]] [[knight]]s, even until the time of [[Cervantes]] (1547–1616 AD).&lt;ref name="khan 6"/&gt; Eventually the Mamluks under [[Qaitbay]] were ordered in 1489 to train in the use of al-bunduq al-rasas (arquebuses). However, in 1514 an Ottoman army of 12,000 soldiers wielding arquebuses still managed to rout a much larger Mamluk force.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} The arquebus had become a common infantry weapon by the 16th century due to its relative cheapness - a helmet, breastplate and pike cost about three and a quarter ducats while an arquebus only a little over one ducat.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=422}}{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=44}} Another advantage of arquebuses over other equipment and weapons was its short training period. While a bow potentially took years to master, an effective arquebusier could be trained in just two weeks.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=74}} According to a 1571 report by Vincentio d'Alessandri, Persian arms including arquebuses "were superior and better tempered than those of any other nation."{{sfn|Adle|2003|p=475}}

In the early 1500s a larger arquebus known as the musket appeared. The heavy musket, while being rather awkward to handle, requiring a fork rest to fire properly, had the advantage of being able to penetrate the best armor within a range of 180 meters, regular armor at 365 meters, and an unarmed man at 548 meters. However, both the musket and arquebus were effectively limited to a range of only 90 to 185 meters regardless of armor since they were incredibly inaccurate.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75-78}} According to some sources, a smoothbore musket was completely incapable of hitting a man sized target past the 73 meter mark.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=74}} While rifled guns did exist at this time in the form of grooves cut into the interior of a barrel, these were considered specialist weapons and limited in number.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75-78}} In some aspects this made the smoothbore musket an inferior weapon compared to the bow. The average Mamluk archer for example was capable of hitting targets only 68 meters far away but could keep up a pace of six to eight shots per minute. In comparison, sixteenth-century matchlocks fired off one shot every several minutes, and much less when taking into consideration misfires and malfunctions which occurred up to half the time. This is not to say that firearms of the 16th century were inferior to the bow and arrow, for it could better penetrate armor and required less training, but the disadvantages of the musket were very real, and it would not be until the 1590s that archers were for the most part phased out of ''European'' warfare.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=74}} This was possibly a consequence of the increased effectiveness of musket warfare due to the rise of volley fire in Europe as first applied by the Dutch.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=75}} At this time gunners in European armies reached as high as 40 percent of infantry forces.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=167}}

As the virtues of the musket became apparent it was quickly adopted throughout Eurasia so that by 1560 even in China generals were giving praise to the new weapon. Qi Jiguang, a noted partisan of the musket, gave a eulogy on the effectiveness of the gun in 1560:

{{quotation|It is unlike any other of the many types of fire weapons. In strength it can pierce armor. In accuracy it can strike the center of targets, even to the point of hitting the eye of a coin [i.e., shooting right through a coin], and not just for exceptional shooters.… The arquebus [鳥銃] is such a powerful weapon and is so accurate that even bow and arrow cannot match it, and … nothing is so strong as to be able to defend against it.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}}|''Jixiao Xinshu''}}

Other [[East Asian]] powers such as [[Đại Việt]] also adopted the matchlock musket in quick order. Đại Việt in particular was considered by the Ming to have produced the most advanced matchlocks in the world during the 17th century, surpassing even Ottoman, Japanese, and European firearms. European observers of the [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War]] also corroborated with the Ming in the proficiency of matchlock making by the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese matchlock was said to have been able to pierce several layers of iron armour, kill two to five men in one shot, yet also fire quietly for a weapon of its caliber.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://greatmingmilitary.blogspot.com/2014/11/matchlock-of-ming-dynasty.html |title=Matchlock firearms of the Ming Dynasty |accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Volley fire}}

The volley fire, specifically the musketry volley technique, also known as the countermarch, is in its simplest form the idea of having soldiers shoot in turns.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=144}} Although volley fire is most often associated with [[firearm]]s, the concept of continuous and concerted rotating fire was practiced using crossbows since at least the Tang dynasty. Both the encyclopedic text written during the Tang dynasty known as the ''[[Tongdian]]'' and the official ''[[History of Song]]'' contain mentions of the volley fire technique and elaborate on its usage. They contained two widely known illustrations of the volley fire formation from both the Tang and Song dynasties respectively.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=149}} In 1131, crossbowmen employed the volley fire tactic to great effect under Song generals Wu Jie (吳玠) and his younger brother Wu Lin (吳璘) during the [[Jin-Song Wars]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=153-154}} In Europe volley fire was also used by [[History of archery|archers]], for example at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415.{{sfn|Villalon|2008|p=75}}

The earliest possible employment of volley fire for firearms occurred in late-14th-century China during a military conflict between Ming and [[Mong Mao]] forces. Volley fire was also possibly implemented with firearms in 1414 during the [[Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols]], and possibly again in another expedition in 1422. However the language used in these sources is unclear as to whether or not ''repeating'' fire was part of the technique implemented. For example, during the 1388 anti-insurrection war waged against the Mong Mao by the Ming general [[Mu Ying]], the Ming troops equipped with guns and fire arrows were arrayed in three lines. The general Mu Ying explained this was so that "when the elephants advance, the front line of guns and arrows will shoot all at once. If they do not retreat, the next line will continue this. If they still do not retreat, then the third line will continue this."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=157}} When the armored war elephants broke into a run, charging the Ming lines, the Ming forces stood their ground, "shooting arrows and stones, the noise shaking the mountains and vallies. The elephants shook with fear and ran."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=157}} According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', half the elephants were killed while 37 were captured, and of the 100,000 strong insurrection force, at least 30,000 were killed, and 10,000 were captured.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=158}} Andrade and other historians have interpreted this passage as evidence of volley fire, however he admits that it is ambiguous as to whether or not the Ming lines practiced repeated fire and reloading, so at best it can only be considered a limited form of volley fire.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=158}}

The ''Ming Shilu'' goes on to mention another possible instance of volley fire, this time during the Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols. In 1414 "the commander-in-chief (都督) Zhu Chong led Lü Guang and others directly to the fore, where they assaulted the enemy by firing firearms and guns continuously and in succession. Countless enemies were killed."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=158}} In this case the source makes no mention of taking turns or forming lines, but Andrade believes that since the Ming were facing horseback Mongol forces, it would have been impossible to keep continuous fire in the face of a cavalry charge had ordered ranks of gunners not been implemented.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=158}} The same rationality is applied to another passage on the 1422 expedition, where "the emperor ordered that all the generals train their troops outside each encampment by arranging their formations so that the gunnery units (神機銃) occupied the foremost positions and the cavalry units occupied the rear. He ordered officers to exercise and drill in their free time (暇閑操習). He admonished them as follows: "A formation that is dense is solid, while an advance force is sparse, and when they arrive at the gates of war and it's time to fight, then first use the guns to destroy their advance guard and then use cavalry to rush their solidity. In this way there is nothing to fear.""{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=158-159}} Some historians have extrapolated from this that the Ming forces were using volley fire with firearms since their opponents were cavalry units, and hence impossible to stop with slow firing hand cannons unless it was through continuous volley fire, much less with a thin advance guard of gunnery units. According to Wang Zhaochun, "the meaning of this is that when fighting, the gun troops line up in front of the entire formation, and between them there must be a certain amount of space, so that they can load bullets and powder and employ shooting by turns and in concert to destroy the enemy advance guard. Once the enemy has been thrown into chaos, the rear densely arrayed cavalry troops together come forth in great vigor, striking forth with irresistible force."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=159}} Even if Wang is correct, the evidence is still inconclusive.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=159}}

The volley tactic next appeared in early-16th-century Europe when the Ottoman Janissaries clashed with European forces at the [[Battle of Mohács]] on 29 August 1526.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=149}} The Janissaries equipped with 2000 ''tüfenks'' (usually translated as musket) "formed nine consecutive rows and they fired their weapons row by row,"{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=24}} in a "kneeling or standing position without the need for additional support or rest."{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=24}} Contrary to the popular belief that the Ottomans' success at Mohács was due to their artillery, a view which many later historians have supported, contemporary European and Ottoman sources on the battle attribute their success to the Janissaries' successful deployment of firearms.{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=24}} However the Janissaries' prowess declined early in the 17th century as troop standards dropped and the drill was abandoned. According to the author of ''The Laws of the Janissaries (Kavanin-i Yenigeriyan)'', by 1606 members of the Janissaries were faced with supply issues so that they "were no longer given powder for the drills and that the soldiers used the wick for their candles and not for their muskets."{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=24}}

By 1548 the Ming had started fielding arquebuses after procuring knowledge of the weapon from the pirate network at [[Shuangyu]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=171}} The military leader Qi Jiguang, who was at first ambivalent towards matchlocks, became one of the primary advocates for their incorporation into the Ming army later on in his life. After having suffered his first defeats at the hands of the [[wokou]], he realized the vital role of this new  weapon in combating piracy, for it out ranged their heaviest arrows. By 1560 he had invented a style of musket warfare similar to the Tang crossbow volley technique which he described the same year in his magnum opus, the ''[[Jixiao Xinshu]]'':

{{quotation|All the musketeers, when they get near the enemy are not allowed to fire early, and they're not allowed to just fire everything off in one go, [because] whenever the enemy then approaches close, there won't be enough time to load the guns (銃裝不及), and frequently this mismanagement costs the lives of many people. Thus, whenever the enemy gets to within a hundred paces' distance, they [the musketeers] are to wait until they hear a blast on the bamboo flute, at which they deploy themselves in front of the troops, with each platoon (哨) putting in front one team (隊). They [the musketeer team members] wait until they hear their own leader fire a shot, and only then are they allowed to give fire. Each time the trumpet gives a blast, they fire one time, spread out in battle array according to the drilling patterns. If the trumpet keeps blasting without stopping, then they are allowed to fire all together until their fire is exhausted, and it's not necessary [in this case] to divide into layers.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=173}}|''[[Jixiao Xinshu]]''}}

Qi Jiguang further elaborates on the five layered musket volley formation:

{{quotation|Once the enemy has approached to within 100-paces, listen for one's own commander (總) to fire once, and then each time a horn is blown the arquebusiers fire one layer. One after another, five horn tones, and five layers fire. Once this is done, listen for the tap of a drum, at which then one platoon (哨) [armed with traditional weapons] comes forward, proceeding to in front of the arquebusiers. They [the platoon members] then listen for a beat of the drum, and then the blowing of the swan-call horn, and they then give a war cry and go forth and give battle.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=173}}|''[[Jixiao Xinshu]]''}}

If melee weapons could not be brought into combat, such as during long range defense, Qi recommended waiting "until the face-the-enemy signal [is given], and then, whether from behind wooden stockades, or from moat banks, or from below abatis (拒馬), [they] open up on the enemy, firing by turns (更番射賊). Those who are empty reload; those who are full fire again. While the ones who have fired are loading, those who are full then fire again. In this way, all day long, the firing of guns will not be lacking, and there must be no firing to the point of exhaustion [of ammo] and no slipups with guns."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=174}} In 1571 Qi prescribed an ideal infantry regiment of 1080 arquebusiers out of 2700 men, or 40 percent of the infantry force. However it is not known how well this was actually implemented, and there is evidence that Qi was met with stiff resistance to the incorporation of newer gunpowder weapons in northern China while he was stationed there.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=178-179}} He writes that "in the north soldiers are stupid and impatient, to the point that they cannot see the strength of the musket, and they insist on holding tight to their fast lances (a type of fire lance), and although when comparing and vying on the practice field the musket can hit the bullseye ten times better than the fast-lance and five times better than the bow and arrow, they refuse to be convinced."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=178-179}}

The musket volley fire technique may have been used in Japan as well as early as 1575 at the [[Battle of Nagashino]] by [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s arquebusiers.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=169}} But this has been called into dispute in recent years by J.S.A. Elisonas and J.P. Lamers in their translation of ''The Chronicle of Oda Nobunaga'' by Ota Gyuichi. In Lamers' ''Japonius'' he says that "whether or not Nobunaga actually operated with three rotating ranks cannot be determined on the basis of reliable evidence."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=354}} They claim that the version of events describing volley fire was written several years after the battle, and an earlier account says to the contrary that guns were fired en masse.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=170}} However both Korean and Chinese sources note that Japanese gunners were making use of volley fire during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592–98.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=181}}

Frederick Lewis Taylor claims that a kneeling volley fire may have been employed by [[Prospero Colonna]]'s [[arquebusier]]s as early as the [[Battle of Bicocca]] (1522).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Frederick. (1921). The Art of War in Italy, 1494-1529. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However this has been called into question by Tonio Andrade who believes this is an over interpretation as well as mis-citation of a passage by [[Charles Oman]] suggesting that the Spanish arquebusiers kneeled to reload, when in fact Oman never made such a claim.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=350}} European gunners might have implemented the volley fire to some extent since at least 1579 when the Englishman [[Thomas Digges]] suggested that musketeers should, "after the old Romane manner make three or four several fronts, with convenient spaces for the first to retire and unite himselfe with the second, and both these if occasion so require, with the third; the shot [musketeers] having their convenient lanes continually during the fight to discharge their peces."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=147}} The Spanish too displayed some awareness of the volley technique and described it in a military manual dating to 1586: "Start with three files of five soldiers each, separated one from the other by fifteen paces, and they should comport themselves not with fury but with calm skillfulness [con reposo diestramente] such that when the first file has finished shooting they make space for the next (which is coming up to shoot) without turning face, countermarching [contrapassando] to the left but showing the enemy only the side of their bodies, which is the narrowest of the body, and [taking their place at the rear] about one to three steps behind, with five or six pellets in their mouths, and two lighted matchlock fuses … and they load [their pieces] promptly … and return to shoot when it's their turn again."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=146}}

Regardless, it is clear that the concept of volley fire had existed in Europe for quite some time during the 16th century, but it was in the Netherlands during the 1590s that the musketry volley really took off. The key to this development was [[William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg]] who in 1594 described the technique in a letter to his cousin:

{{quotation|I have discovered … a method of getting the musketeers and soldiers armed with arquebuses not only to keep firing very well but to do it effectively in battle order … in the following manner: as soon as the first rank has fired together, then by the drill [they have learned] they will march to the back. The second rank, either marching forward or standing still, [will next] fire together [and] then march to the back. After that, the third and following ranks will do the same. Thus before the last ranks have fired, the first will have reloaded.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=145}}|''Letter from Louis to Maurice''}}

For many Europeans this new way of conducting warfare seemed ridiculous, so that in the beginning they were openly mocked. But the Dutch army continued to drill the volley under both Louis and his cousin [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]], so that it became second nature.  One Dutch historian recounts the exercises in which regiments marched "man by man bringing the rearmost to the front and the frontmost to the rear.… The beginnings were very difficult, and many people felt, because it was all so unusual, that it was odd and ridiculous [lacherlich]. They were mocked by the enemy, but with time the great advantages of the practices became clear … and eventually they were copied by other nations."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=145-6}} Soon the reorganized Dutch army displayed the virtues of the countermarch volley and the practice spread across Europe. An important component to the successful deployment of volley fire was the drill, which according to [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], "only two civilisation have invented drill for their infantry: China and Europe. Moreover, both of them did so twice: in the fifth century BC in North China and in Greece, and again in the late sixteenth century. Exponents of the second phase— Qi Jiguang in Imperial China and Maurice of Nassau in the Dutch Republic—explicitly sought to revive classical precedents, and in the West, marching in step and standing on parade became a permanent part of military life."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=148}} Drill was difficult and the manner in which the volley fire should be executed had not been perfected in Louis' time. It is clear from Holland's historical sources that it took many trials and experiments for the process to be refined.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=147}}

Indeed, just using the musket itself was considered unorthodox and in some parts of the world there was even a push back against the incorporation of muskets. According to Qi Jiguang, this was because:

{{quotation|The musket was originally considered a powerful weapon, and in attacking the enemy is one that has been much relied upon. But how is it that so many officers and soldiers don't think it can be relied upon heavily? The answer lies in the fact that in drills and on the battlefield, when all the men fire at once, the smoke and fire settle over the field like miasmal clouds, and not a single eye can see, and not a single hand can signal. Not all [soldiers] hold their guns level, or they don't hold them to the side of their cheek, or they don't use the sights, or they let their hands droop and support it to hold it up, and one hand holds the gun and one hand uses the fuse to touch off the fire, thus failing to use the matchlock grip— what of them? It's just a case of being out of practice and uncourageous, hurrying but not being able to take out the fire fuse and place it in the matchlock grip, trying for speed and convenience. In this way, there is absolutely no way to be accurate, and so how could one value muskets? Especially given that the name of the weapon is "bird-gun," which comes from the way that it can hit a flying bird, hitting accurately many times. But in this way, fighting forth, the power doesn't go the way one intends, and one doesn't know which way it goes— so how can one hit the enemy, to say nothing of being able to hit a bird?{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=178-9}}|''[[Jixiao Xinshu]]''}}

In Korea the [[Joseon]] dynasty underwent a devastating war with newly unified Japan that lasted from 1592 to 1598. The shock of this encounter spurred the court to undergo a process of military strengthening. One of the core elements of military strengthening was to adopt the musket. According to reformers, "In recent times in China they did not have muskets; they first learned about them from the Wokou pirates in Zhejiang Province. Qi Jiguang trained troops in their use for several years until they [muskets] became one of the skills of the Chinese, who subsequently used them to defeat the Japanese."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=183}} By 1607 Korean musketeers had been trained in the fashion which Qi Jiguang prescribed, and a drill manual had been produced based on the Chinese leader's ''Jixiao Xinshu''. Of the volley fire, the manual says that "every musketeer squad should either divide into two musketeers per layer or one and deliver fire in five volleys or in ten."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=183}} Another Korean manual produced in 1649 describes a similar process: "When the enemy approaches to within a hundred paces, a signal gun is fired and a conch is blown, at which the soldiers stand. Then a gong is sounded, the conch stops blowing, and the heavenly swan [a double-reed horn] is sounded, at which the musketeers fire in concert, either all at once or in five volleys (齊放一次盡擧或分五擧)."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=183}} This training method proved to be quite formidable in the 1619 [[Battle of Sarhu]] when 10,000 Korean musketeers managed to kill many Manchus before their allies surrendered. While Korea went on to lose both wars against the Manchu invasions of [[First Manchu invasion of Korea|1627]] and [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|1636]], their musketeers were well respected by Manchu leaders. It was the first Qing emperor [[Hong Taiji]] who wrote: "The Koreans are incapable on horseback but do not transgress the principles of the military arts. They excel at infantry fighting, especially in musketeer tactics."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=186}}

==Gunpowder Empires==

[[File:The Adventures of Akbar artillery.jpg|thumb|An illustration by Byam Shaw from the book The Adventures of Akbar by Flora Annie Steel. It depicts artillerymen.]]

The [[Gunpowder Empires]] generally refer to the Islamic [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his112/Notes/Gunpowder.html |title=The Gunpowder Empires |last=Charles T. Evans |publisher=Northern Virginia Community College |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was first coined by [[Marshall Hodgson]] in the title of Book 5 ("The Second Flowering: The Empires of Gunpowder Times") of his highly influential three-volume work, ''The Venture of Islam'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;Marshall G. S. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974) ("Hodgson").&lt;/ref&gt; Hogdson applied the term "gunpowder empire" to three Islamic political entities he identified as separate from the unstable, geographically limited confederations of Turkic clans that prevailed in post-Mongol times. He called them "military patronage states of the Later Middle Period," which possessed three defining characteristics: first, a legitimization of independent dynastic law; second, the conception of the whole state as a single military force; third, the attempt to explain  all economic and high cultural resources as appanages of the chief military families.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, 2:405-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting these empires were their traditions which grew "out of Mongol notions of greatness," but "[s]uch notions could fully mature and create stable bureaucratic empires only after gunpowder weapons and their specialized technology attained a primary place in military life."&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, 3:16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]] further expanded on the concept of gunpowder empires by arguing that such states "were able to monopolize the new artillery, central authorities were able to unite larger territories into new, or newly consolidated, empires." &lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, “The Age of Gunpowder Empires, 1450-1800” in ''Islamic &amp; European Expansion: The Forging of a Global Order'' edited by Michael Adas (pp. 103-139) (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1993) (“McNeill”), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the McNeill political framework, gunpowder empires were notable for their monopolization of firearms, whereas although Europe pioneered the development of the new artillery in the fifteenth century, no state monopolized it. Gun-casting know-how had been concentrated in the Low Countries near the mouths of the Scheldt and Rhine rivers, which France and the Habsburgs divided up in territory among themselves, resulting in an arms standoff.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, pp. 110-11.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, such monopolies allowed states to create militarized empires in the Near East, Russia and India, and "in a considerably modified fashion" in China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Douglas E. Streusand criticized the Hodgson-McNeill Gunpowder-Empire hypothesis, calling it into disfavor as a neither "adequate [n]or accurate" explanation, although the term remains in use.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Streusand, ''Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Otomans, Safavids, and Mughals'' (Philadelphia: Westview Press, c. 2011) ("Streusand"), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main problem with the Hodgson-McNeill theory is that the acquisition of firearms does not seem to have preceded the initial acquisition of territory constituting the imperial critical mass of any of the three early modern Islamic empires, except in the case of the Mughals. Moreover, it seems that the commitment to military autocratic rule pre-dated the acquisition of gunpowder weapons in all three cases. Reasons other than (or in addition to) military technology have been offered for the nearly simultaneous rise of three centralized military empires in contiguous areas dominated by decentralized Turkic tribes. One explanation, called "Confessionalization" by historians of fifteenth-century Europe, invokes examination of how the relation of church and state "mediated through confessional statements and church ordinances" lead to the origins of absolutist polities. Douglas Streusand uses the Safavids as an example: The Safavids from the beginning imposed a new religious identity on their general population; they did not seek to develop a national or linguistic identity, but their policy had that effect.&lt;ref&gt;Streusand, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does it seem to be the case that the acquisition of gunpowder weapons and their integration into the military was influenced by considerations of whichever variety of Islam the particular empire promoted.{{sfn|Ágoston|2005|p=192}} Whether or not gunpowder was inherently linked to the existence of any of these three empires, it cannot be questioned that each of the three acquired artillery and firearms early in their history and made such weapons an integral part of their military tactics.
 
===India and the Mughal Empire===

[[File:Court of Akbar from Akbarnama.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration from the ''[[Akbarnama]]'' written by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] (1551–1602) depicts a gun in Akbar's court (bottom center).]]

In India, guns made of bronze were recovered from [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (1504) and [[Diu, India|Diu]] (1533).{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=226}} By the 17th century, Indians were manufacturing a diverse variety of firearms; large guns in particular, became visible in [[Tanjore]], [[Dacca]], [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] and [[Murshidabad]].{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=225}} [[Gujarāt]] supplied Europe saltpeter for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century.&lt;ref name=IndiaBritannica&gt;"India."

[[Fathullah Shirazi]] (c. 1582), who worked for [[Akbar the Great]] as a mechanical engineer, developed an early multi gun shot. As opposed to the [[polybolos]] and [[repeating crossbow]]s used earlier in [[ancient Greece]] and China, respectively, Shirazi's rapid-firing gun had multiple [[gun barrel]]s that fired [[hand cannon]]s loaded with gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Bag (2005), "Fathullah Shirazi: Cannon, Multi-barrel Gun and Yarghu", ''Indian Journal of History of Science'' '''40''' (3), pp. 431–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica (2008)]]'', Stephen Oliver Fought &amp; John F. Guilmartin, Jr. describe the gunpowder technology in 18th-century India, with reference to the [[rocket artillery]] used by the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] (as described in the ''[[Fathul Mujahidin]]'') and its influence on the [[Congreve rocket]]:&lt;ref name=r&amp;ms&gt;"rocket and missile system." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2008 Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hyder Ali]], prince of [[Mysore]], developed war bombs with an important change: the use of metal pipes to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometer). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, [[Tippu Sultan]], continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at [[Seringapatam]] in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The news of the successful use of rockets spread through Europe. In England [[Sir William Congreve]] began to experiment privately. First, he experimented with a number of black-powder formulas and set down standard specifications of composition. He also standardized construction details and used improved production techniques. Also, his designs made it possible to choose either an explosive (ball charge) or incendiary warhead.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder'', [[James Riddick Partington]] describes Indian rockets, mines and other means of gunpowder warfare:{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=226}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Indian war rockets were formidable weapons before such rockets were used in Europe. They had bam-boo rods, a rocket-body lashed to the rod, and iron points. They were directed at the target and fired by lighting the fuse, but the trajectory was rather erratic. The use of mines and counter-mines with explosive charges of gunpowder is mentioned for the times of [[Akbar]] and [[Jahangir|Jahāngir]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Civil engineering==

===Canals===
Gunpowder was used for hydraulic engineering in China by 1541. Gunpowder blasting followed by dredging of the detritus was a technique which Chen Mu employed to improve the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] at the waterway where it crossed the [[Yellow River]].{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=543}} In Europe gunpowder was utilized in the construction of the [[Canal du Midi]] in Southern France.&lt;ref name = brown-6&gt;Brown (1998), Chapter 6: ''Mining and Civil Engineering''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed in 1681 and linked the [[Mediterranean]] sea with the [[Atlantic]] with 240&amp;nbsp;km of [[canal]] and 100 locks. Another noteworthy consumer of black powder was the [[Erie canal]] in New York, which was 585&amp;nbsp;km long and took eight years to complete, starting in 1817.&lt;ref name =brown-6/&gt;

===Mining===
Before gunpowder was applied to civil engineering, there were two ways to break up large rocks, by hard labor or by heating with large fires followed by rapid quenching. The earliest record for the use of gunpowder in mines comes from Hungary in 1627.&lt;ref name = urbanski&gt;Urbanski (1967). Chapter III: ''Blackpowder''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced to Britain in 1638 by German miners, after which records are numerous.&lt;ref name=earl-2&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Earl|1978|loc=Chapter 2: The Development of Gunpowder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the invention of the [[safety fuse]] by [[William Bickford (1774–1834)|William Bickford]] in 1831, the practice was extremely dangerous.&lt;ref name = earl-1&gt;Earl, (1978). Chapter 1: Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =brown-6/&gt; Another reason for danger were the dense fumes given off and the risk of igniting flammable gas when used in coal mines.

===Tunnel construction===
Black powder was also extensively used in railway construction. At first railways followed the contours of the land, or crossed low ground by means of bridges and [[viaduct]]s, but later railways made extensive use of cuttings and tunnels. One 2400-ft stretch of the 5.4&amp;nbsp;mi [[Box Tunnel]] on the [[Great Western Railway]] line between London and [[Bristol]] consumed a [[ton]] of gunpowder per week for over two years.&lt;ref name = brown-6/&gt; The 12.9&amp;nbsp;km long [[Mont Cenis Tunnel]] was completed in 13 years starting in 1857 but, even with black powder, progress was only 25&amp;nbsp;cm a day until the invention of [[Jackhammer|pneumatic drills]] sped up the work.

The latter half of the 19th century saw the invention of [[nitroglycerin]], [[nitrocellulose]] and [[smokeless powder]]s which soon replaced black powder in many applications.

Shot and gunpowder for military purposes were made by skilled military tradesmen, who were later called ''firemakers'', who were also required to make fireworks for celebrations of victory or peace. During the [[Renaissance]] two European schools of pyrotechnic thought emerged, one in [[Italy]] and the other at [[Nürnberg]], Germany. The Italian school of pyrotechnics emphasized elaborate fireworks, the German school stressed scientific advancement. Both schools added significantly to the further development of pyrotechnics and, by the mid-17th century, fireworks were used for entertainment on an unprecedented scale in Europe—being popular even at resorts and public gardens.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576898_2/Fireworks.html Fireworks]," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007 1997–2007 Microsoft Corporation.

===Later improvements===

Gunpowder as a gun [[propellant]] suffered from several weaknesses inherent to its composition. It was subject to passivation by moisture and was awkward to load and ignite in a weapon. Sulfur oxides and moisture produced corrosion on metal gun components and the smoke gave away the position of the shooter. The development of cartridges and explosive primers were a major improvement in the use of gunpowders in the field.

From the earliest period, gunpowder has been composed of a nitrate salt, sulfur, and carbonaceous matter. The [[Nitrate]] component is the [[Oxidizing agent]], [[Sulfur]] is a low melting [[Reducing agent]] and serves to aid in the transfer of heat through the gunpowder mass, and [[Carbon]] is a reducing component producing hot, high pressure gas. The utility of gunpowder lies in its ability to accelerate a projectile by the explosive expansion of gas. The development of new explosive materials in the 19th century naturally led to improvements in the rate and magnitude of pressure rise as well as new means for ignition of the charge.

Nitroester&lt;ref&gt;The term ''nitroester'' is meant to delineate one of several possible organo-nitro functional groups. A nitroester is the result of the nitrification of an alcohol group, C-O-H, by [[Nitronium ion]], O=N=O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in an unstable C-O-N(O)-O linkage. The other relevant "nitro" composition developed in the 19th century was the nitroaromatic functionality with its Ar-N(O)-O linkage, where Ar stands for a [[Benzene]] ring. [[Trinitrotoluene]] and picric acid are examples of nitroaromatics.&lt;/ref&gt; compositions [[nitrocellulose]] and [[nitroglycerin]] were developed by [[Henri Braconnot]] in 1832 and [[Ascanio Sobrero]] in 1846, respectively. The development of [[smokeless powder]] stemmed from efforts by numerous workers to produce an improved gun propellant providing better resistance to moisture, greater muzzle velocity, and generally greater reliability. By the end of the 19th century, nitroester compositions [[Poudre B]], [[Ballistite]], and [[Cordite]] were the major smokeless propellants. Significantly, many nitroesters were capable of [[detonation]] without confinement. The classic gunpowder composition was only capable of [[Deflagration]] in the open.

The process of aromatic nitration to afford [[picric acid]] from the trinitration of [[phenol]] was performed in the early 19th century, though it is possible that [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]] may have reported it much earlier. Nitroesters would find use in gun propellant formulation. Nitroaromatics like picric acid eventually found use in explosive cannon shells owing to their ability to withstand the severe shock of firing.

==United States of America==

===Revolutionary War===

During the American Revolutionary War, a number of caves were mined for saltpeter to make gunpowder when supplies from Europe were embargoed. [[Abigail Adams]], reputedly also made gunpowder at her family farm in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crfcelebrateamerica.org/index.php/holiday-heroes/81-abigail-adams&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)]] produced some essays on making gunpowder that were printed in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;New York (State). Committee of Safety, 1775-1776. Essays upon the making of salt-petre and gunpowder. New York: Printed by Samuel London, 1776. 39 pages. Published by order of the Committee of Safety of the Colony of New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===

During the [[American Civil War]], [[British India]] was the main source for saltpeter for the manufacture of gunpowder for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union armies]]. This supply was threatened by the British government during the [[Trent Affair]], when Union naval forces stopped a British ship, the RMS Trent, and removed two Confederate diplomats. The British government responded in part by halting all exports of saltpeter to the United States, threatening their gunpowder manufacturing resources. Shortly thereafter, the situation was resolved and the Confederate diplomats were released.

The Union Navy blockaded the southern [[Confederate States]], which reduced the amount of gunpowder that could be imported from overseas. The Confederate [[Nitre and Mining Bureau]] was formed to produce gunpowder for the army and the navy from domestic resources. Nitre&lt;ref&gt;Wiktionary spells the word "niter"&lt;/ref&gt; is the English spelling of "[[Niter]]". While carbon and sulfur were readily available throughout the south, [[potassium nitrate]] was often produced from the [[Calcium nitrate]] found in cave dirt, tobacco barn floors and barn stalls other places. A number of caves were mined, and the men and boys who worked in the caves were called "[[peter monkey]]", somewhat in imitation of the naval term "[[powder monkey]]" that was used for the boys who brought up charges of gunpowder on gunboats.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, R. Lee. 2005. [http://www.armchairgeneral.com/confederate-boys-and-peter-monkeys.htm "Confederate Boys and Peter Monkeys."] Armchair General. January 2005. Adapted from a talk given to the [[Geological Society of America]] on March 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5823">'''Identity economics''' captures the idea that people make economic choices based on both monetary incentives and their identity: holding monetary incentives constant, people avoid actions that conflict with their concept of self. The fundamentals of identity economics was first formulated by [[nobel prize in economics|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist [[George Akerlof]] and [[Rachel Kranton]] in their article "Economics and Identity,"&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, G. and R. Kranton, "Economics and Identity," Quarterly Journal of Economics CVX (3), August 2000, pp. 715–753.&lt;/ref&gt; published in Quarterly Journal of Economics.

This article provides a framework for incorporating [[social identity|social identities]] into standard economics models, expanding the standard [[utility function]] to include both pecuniary payoffs and identity utility. The authors demonstrate the importance of identity in economics by showing how predictions of the classic [[principal–agent problem|principal-agent problem]] change when the identity of the agent is considered.

==Research==
Akerlof and Kranton provide an overview of their work in the book "Identity Economics," &lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, G. and R. Kranton, ''Identity Economics,'' Princeton University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010. In the book, they provide a layman's approach to Identity Economics and apply the concept to workplace organization, gender roles, and educational choice, summarizing several previous papers on the applications of Identity Economics.&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, G. and R. Kranton, "Identity and the Economics of Organizations," Journal of Economic Perspectives 19 (1), Winter 2005, pp. 9–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, G. and R. Kranton, "Identity and Schooling: Some Lessons for the Economics of Education," Journal of Economic Literature, 40 (4), December 2002, pp. 1167–1201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, G. and R. Kranton, "Identity, Supervision, and Work Groups," American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings 98 (2), May 2008, pp. 212–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

While this ''macro-economic'' theory deals exclusively with already well established categories of social identity, [[Laszlo Garai]] when applied the concept of social identity in [[economic psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;Garai, Laszlo: [http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Identity_Economics.htm Identity Economics]&lt;/ref&gt; takes into consideration identities ''[[wiki/In statu nascendi#in statu nascendi|in statu nascendi]]'' (i.e. in the course of being formed and developed).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Garai, Laszlo: [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791351 The Bureaucratic State Governed by an Illegal Movement]: Soviet-Type societies and Bolshevik-Type Parties. Political Psychology. 1991. 10:1. 165–179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;:[http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Interview%20with%20Laszlo%20Garai.htm '''Interview with Laszlo Garai'''] on the Activity Theory of Alexis Leontiev and his own Theory of Social Identity as referred to the meta-theory of Lev Vygotsky. ''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology,'' vol. 50, no. 1, January–February 2012, pp. 50–64.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory that is referred to the macro-processes based on a "large-scale production" later gets applied to the individual creativity's psychology: Garai derived it from the principal's and, resp., agent's "identity elaboration". A further special feature of Garai's theory on social identity is that it resolved the contradiction between the ''inter-individual phenomena'' studied by the social identity theories and the ''intra-individual mechanisms'' studied by the brain theories: L. Garai presented &lt;ref&gt;In his keynote paper on the International Conference dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Lev Vygotsky. Vygotskian implications: [http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Vymplic.htm On the meaning and its brain]. ''Proceedings'', No. 3. Pre-published: The brain and the mechanism of psychosocial phenomena. ''Journal of Russian and East-European Psychology''. 31:6. 71–91.&lt;/ref&gt; a theory on an ''inter-individual mechanism'' acting in the world of social identity. The theory that was referred in the beginning to the macro-processes based on a large-scale production later has been applied by Garai to the micro-processes of individual creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Identities of Attila Jozsef: [http://mek.oszk.hu/07300/07302/?from=rss A study in psychology of creativity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following papers have used social identity to examine a variety of subjects within economics. Moses Shayo uses the concept of social identity to explain why countries with similar economic characteristics might choose substantially different levels of redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Shayo, "A Model of Social Identity with an Application to Political Economy: Nation, Class and Redistribution," American Political Science Review 103(2), 147–174, May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper won the 2009 [[Michael Wallerstein]] Award, given to the best article published in the area of political economy. Daniel Benjamin, James Choi, and Joshua Strickland examine the effect of social identity, focusing on ethnic identity, on a wide range of economic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Daniel J., James J. Choi, and A. Joshua Strickland (2010), "Social identity and preferences," American Economic Review, 100(4), 1913–1928.&lt;/ref&gt; For a review of papers that study economics and identity, see articles by Claire Hill (2007) and John Davis (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Claire Hill, "The Law and Economics of Identity," Queen's Law Journal, Vol. 32, No. 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Davis (2004), "Identity and Commitment," Tinbergen Institute Discussion Paper,  TI 2004-055/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1046">In [[mathematics]], an '''information source''' is a sequence of [[random variable]]s ranging over a [[Alphabet (computer science)|finite alphabet]] &amp;Gamma;, having a [[stationary distribution]].

The '''uncertainty''', or '''[[entropy rate]]''', of an information source is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;H\{\mathbf{X}\} = \lim_{n\to\infty} H(X_n | X_0, X_1, \dots, X_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; X_0, X_1, \dots, X_n&lt;/math&gt;

is the sequence of random variables defining the information source, and

:&lt;math&gt;H(X_n | X_0, X_1, \dots, X_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;

is the conditional [[information entropy]] of the sequence of random variables.  Equivalently, one has

:&lt;math&gt;H\{\mathbf{X}\} = \lim_{n\to\infty} 
\frac{H(X_0, X_1, \dots, X_{n-1}, X_n)}{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Interpolation Theory''', also known as the '''Intercalation Theory''' or the '''Antithetic Theory''', is a theory that attempts to explain the origin of the [[alternation of generations]] in [[plants]].  The Interpolation Theory suggests that the [[sporophyte]] generation progenated from a [[haploid]], green [[algal]] [[thallus]] in which repeated [[mitotic]] cell divisions of a [[zygote]] produced an [[embryo]] retained on the [[thallus]] and gave rise to the [[diploid]] phase ([[sporophyte]]).  Ensuing [[evolution]] caused the [[sporophyte]] to become increasingly complex, both organographically and anatomically.

The Interpolation Theory was introduced by [[Ladislav Josef Čelakovský|Čelakovský]] (1874) as the Antithetic Theory.  Bower (1889) further developed this theory and renamed it the Interpolation Theory.  The theory was later supported by Overton (1893), Scott (1896), Strasburger (1897), Williams (1904), and others.

The gradual [[evolution]] of an independent, [[sporophyte]] phase was viewed by Bower as being closely related to the transition from aquatic to terrestrial plant life on Earth. 

Evidence supporting this theory can be found in the life cycle of modern [[Bryophytes]] in which the [[sporophyte]] is physiologically dependent on the [[gametophyte]].  Competing theories include the [[Transformation theory (biology)|Transformation theory]], which was introduced as the [[Homologous theory]] by Čelakovský, and also renamed by Bower.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">[[File:Kussner effect.svg|thumb|right|An airfoil flying into a gust region. The airfoil speed is denoted with ''V'' and is constant, the [[lift (force)|lift force]] on the airfoil is given by ''L'', and its [[pitching moment]] by ''M''. The gust has a transverse (vertical) velocity ''w'', which is assumed to be a constant in the gust region, left of the dashed line.]] 
In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Küssner effect''' describes the [[wikt:unsteady|unsteady]] [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] [[force]]s on an [[airfoil]] or [[hydrofoil]] caused by encountering a transverse [[Wind#Measurement|gust]]. This is directly related to the '''Küssner function''', used in describing the effect. Both the effect and function are named after [[Hans Georg Küssner]] (1900–1984), a German [[aerodynamics]] engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschel, Prem and Madelung (2004) p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Küssner derived an approximate model for an airfoil encountering a sudden step-like change in the transverse gust [[velocity]] — or, equivalently, as seen from a [[frame of reference]] moving with the airfoil: a sudden change in the [[angle of attack]]. The airfoil is modelled as a flat plate in a [[potential flow]], moving with constant horizontal velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Cebeci (2005) pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; For this case he derived the [[impulse response function]] — known as Küssner function&lt;ref&gt;Bisplinghoff, Ashley and Halfman (1996) pp. 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt; — needed to compute the unsteady [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[torque|moment]] exerted by the air on the airfoil.

'''Leuckart's law''' is an [[empirical law]] in [[zoology]] that states that the size of the eye of an animal is related to its maximum speed of movement; fast-moving animals have larger eyes, after allowing for the effects of [[body mass]]. The hypothesis dates from 1876,&lt;ref name=hugh/&gt; and in older literature is usually referred to as '''Leuckart's ratio'''.&lt;ref name=stew/&gt;

The principle was initially applied to birds; it has also been applied to mammals.&lt;ref name=heard/&gt;

==Criticism==
A study of 88 bird species, published in 2011, found no useful correlation between flight speed and eye size.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt;

'''Linguistic Intergroup Bias''' is a model of [[stereotype]] maintenance.

==Definition==
Coined by Anne Maass and her colleagues, linguistic intergroup bias is a model of stereotype maintenance (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010).  This model states that positive ingroup descriptions and negative outgroup descriptions are abstract and vague, while negative ingroup descriptions and positive outgroup descriptions are specific and observable. Abstract statements are vague and harder to prove wrong, while, concrete statements are specific, and easy to brush off as exceptions to the rule, therefore keeping stereotypes intact (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010).
Linguistic intergroup bias is more likely to occur when outgroup members are performing a group stereotype consistent action. This implies that the linguistic intergroup bias is a cognitive process that requires little motivation (Maass, et al. 1989).

==Research==
B. W. Gorham performed an experiment in which he presented an actual newscast to white individuals who took a pre-study survey about the amount of time they spent watching cable news TV, network news TV, regular television and news websites such as CNN.com. These subjects were then shown an actual news clip where a murder investigation is presented and the suspect had been described as either a black male or a white male.

There were significant differences in responses of participants who saw the white man portrayed as the suspect rather than the black man:  Participants said the white suspect  “probably hurt the victims”. However, when the black man was presented as the suspect, the participants said the suspect  “is probably violent” (Gorham, 2006).  Gorham found that participants were more likely to describe the (negative) incident with adjectives, the most abstract description, if the suspect was presented as black and therefore outgroup, while using more concrete terms to describe the white (ingroup) suspect.

Recent research has identified a related linguistic effect in which counterstereotypical individuals are liked significantly less than stereotypical individuals when they are described using behaviours but significantly more when they are described using traits. So, for example, people like “a man who is crying” less than “a woman who is crying” but they like “a sensitive man” more than “a sensitive woman”. In both cases, the man is counterstereotypical and the woman is stereotypical. However, in the former case the man and woman are described using a behaviour (“crying”) and in the latter case they are described using a trait (“sensitive”). [https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/boys-don-t-cry-but-they-can-be-sensitive-behavioural-descriptions-of-people-who-deviate-from-stereotypes-cause-greater-prejudice-than-personality-descriptions Rubin, Paolini, and Crisp (2013)] suggest that this behaviour-trait effect is caused by differences in cognitive processing: Counterstereotypical individuals are evaluated relatively negatively when they are described using behaviours because this linguistic description promotes deeper and more systematic processing which highlights the individuals’ stereotype disconfirmation. In contrast, counterstereotypical individuals are evaluated relatively positively when they are described using traits because this linguistic description promotes heuristic processing which highlights the individuals’ uniqueness.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, M., Paolini, S., &amp; Crisp, R. J. (2013). Linguistic description moderates the evaluations of counterstereotypical people. Social Psychology, 44, 289-298. doi: [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/zsp/44/4/289/ 10.1027/1864-9335/a000114]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9358">'''LinuxChix''' is a women-oriented [[Linux]] community. It was formed to provide both technical and social support for women Linux users, although men are encouraged to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;"LinuxChix is a community for women who like Linux and Free Software, and for women and men who want to support women in computing. The membership ranges from novices to experienced users, and includes professional and amateur programmers, system administrators and technical writers." - {{Citation/make link|http://www.linuxchix.org|LinuxChix - Main Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the community are referred to as "a Linux chick" (singular) and "LinuxChix" or "Linux Chix" (plural) regardless of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linuxchix.org/content/about-linuxchix|title=About LinuxChix {{!}} LinuxChix|website=www.linuxchix.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
LinuxChix was founded in 1999 by Deb Richardson, who was a technical writer and web-master at an open source consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

There are two core rules: "be polite and be helpful."&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

LinuxChix started as an [[electronic mailing list]] called ''grrltalk''. The growth of this mailing list led to the establishment of other mailing lists, beginning with ''techtalk'' for technical discussions and ''issues'' for discussion of women's political issues. LinuxChix received attention when [[ZDNet]] published an article on it, which was subsequently cross-posted on [[Slashdot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,,267968,00.html | title = Web Watch:Linux lasses | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = September 23, 1999 | author = Karlin Lillington | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership and structure ==
Deb Richardson oversaw the activities of LinuxChix until 2001, when she handed over global coordination and hosting to Melbourne programmer and writer [[Jenn Vesperman]].&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/03/29/1017206149200.html | title = Linux grrls break free | work = [[The Age]] | author = Adam Turner | date = April 2, 2002 | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenn Vesperman led the community in a mostly hands-off fashion, delegating almost all tasks, including mailing list administration and website maintenance, to a group of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix04/tech/sigs/full_papers/vesperman/vesperman_html/index.html | title = Building and Maintaining an International Volunteer Linux Community | author = Jenn Vesperman, Val Henson | publisher = Proceedings of the 2004 [[USENIX]] Annual Technical Conference, FREENIX Track | date = June 27 – July 2, 2004 | accessdate = 2007-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During Jenn Vesperman's tenure, the number of mailing lists tripled with the ''newchix'' mailing list for those new to Linux, the ''courses'' mailing list used by LinuxChix to teach each other specific topics, and the ''grrls-only'' mailing list (the only list closed to male subscribers) founded by Val Henson in 2002. At around the same time, a LinuxChix IRC server was created.

The term ''LinuxChix'' refers to the organisation centered on the official website, the mailing lists and the [[IRC]] channels. The organisation has no official status, and the name is used by other loosely affiliated groups, including several local, continental, and national chapters which operate independently.

In March 2007, Jenn Vesperman announced that she was retiring as the coordinator and invited nominations for a new leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mailman.linuxchix.org/pipermail/announce/2007-March/000536.html Time for a new LinuxChix coordinator]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Gardiner was announced as the new coordinator In April 2007, planning to serve as coordinator until 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;153046089 |title=LinuxChix announces new international coordinator |author=Liz Tay (LinuxWorld) |work=[[Computerworld]] |date=April 4, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418194917/http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id%3B153046089 |archivedate=April 18, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however she resigned in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://computerworld.com.sg/ShowPage.aspx?pagetype=2&amp;articleid=5479&amp;pubid=3&amp;tab=Home&amp;issueid=113 | title = Girl trouble forces top LinuxChix to quit | date = June 19, 2007 | author = Naomi Hamilton | work = Computerworld | accessdate = 2007-07-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928213935/http://computerworld.com.sg/ShowPage.aspx?pagetype=2&amp;articleid=5479&amp;pubid=3&amp;tab=Home&amp;issueid=113 | archivedate = September 28, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently the organization is led by three lead volunteers known as the "Tres Chix" who are elected by popular vote.  In August 2007, Sulamita Garcia, Akkana Peck and [http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1909 Carla Schroder] were elected to these positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxchix.org/linuxchix-coordinators.html | title = LinuxChix coordinators| work = LinuxChix homepage | accessdate = 2008-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional chapters ==

LinuxChix has over 15 regional chapters around the world.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; In 2004, a chapter was founded in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=54f59036-777a-4c3b-9226-ea355788bc34 |title=An African bid to educate women on IT |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |author=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |date=April 13, 2006 |accessdate=2007-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033757/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=54f59036-777a-4c3b-9226-ea355788bc34 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, on the [[International Women's Day]], Australia's two LinuxChix chapters united to form a nationwide chapter called "AussieChix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.linux.com/articles/60660 | title = Australia's LinuxChix unite to form AussieChix | author = Melissa Draper | date = March 7, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand chapter was established in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0702/S00057.htm | title = Announcing Linuxchix New Zealand | author = LinuxChix NZ Press Release | date = 26 February 2007 | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
Some local LinuxChix chapters hold regular meetings. Others only meet up on special occasions, such as visits from non-local members or in conjunction with technical conferences. In 2007, members of the Sydney chapter organized a LinuxChix miniconf at [[linux.conf.au]] at the [[University of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://builderau.com.au/news/soa/Women_flock_to_Linux_talkfest/0,339028227,339272778,00.htm Women flock to Linux talkfest], [http://lca2007.linux.org.au/Miniconfs/Linuxchix/Proposal Original proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/07/1645205 Portrait: LinuxChix Brazil's Sulamita Garcia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Miniconfs - linux.conf.au 2007|url = https://linux.org.au/conf/2007/Miniconfs.html|website = linux.org.au|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events are held on other special occasions; in 2005, for example, LinuxChix Africa organized an event to celebrate [[Software Freedom Day]] at [[Wits University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?src=rss&amp;id=596 Open source message hits Wits University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807131116/http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php/?src=rss&amp;id=596 |date=2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LinuxChix labs===
The Indian chapter of LinuxChix (aka IndiChix) led an initiative to establish Linux labs in a number of cities in India. These labs provide spaces equipped with PCs and internet connections where women can learn more about Linux and collaborate on contributions to the Libre software community. Labs have gone live in Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8183">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Indiana''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of March 26, 2010, there were 32 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No additional sites are currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Nine sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="109152">'''[[Scientific misconduct]]''' is the violation of the standard codes of [[scholarly method|scholarly conduct]] and [[ethics|ethical behavior]] in the publication of professional [[science|scientific research]].  A ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' review on ''Handling of Scientific Misconduct in Scandinavian countries'' gave examples of policy definitions. In Denmark, scientific misconduct is defined as "intention[al] or gross negligence leading to fabrication of the scientific message or a false credit or emphasis given to a scientist", and in Sweden as "intention[al] distortion of the research process by fabrication of data, text, hypothesis, or methods from another researcher's manuscript form or publication; or distortion of the research process in other ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nylenna M, Andersen D, Dahlquist G, Sarvas M, Aakvaag A | title = Handling of scientific dishonesty in the Nordic countries.

A 2009 [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] of survey data found that about 2% of scientists admitted to falsifying, fabricating, or modifying data at least once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fanelli D | title = How many scientists fabricate and falsify research?

The '''New Guinea Highlands''', also known as the '''Central Range''' or '''Central Cordillera''', are a chain of [[mountain range]]s and intermountain river [[valley]]s, many of which support thriving agricultural communities, on the large island of [[New Guinea]]. The highlands run generally east-west the length of the island, which is divided politically between [[Indonesia]] in the west and [[Papua New Guinea]] in the east.

==Description==
The Central Cordillera, some peaks of which are capped with ice, consists of (from east to west): the Central Highlands and [[Eastern Highlands Province|Eastern Highlands]] of Papua New Guinea including the [[Owen Stanley Range]] in the southeast, whose highest peak is [[Mount Victoria, Papua New Guinea|Mount Victoria]] at 4,038 metres (13,248 feet), the Albert Victor Mountains, the Sir Arthur Gordon Range, and the [[Bismarck Range]],&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=New Guinea |volume=19 |pages=486–490}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose highest peak is [[Mount Wilhelm]] at 4,509 metres (14,793 feet), which is an extinct volcano with a crater lake; the [[Star Mountains]] on the [[Papua New Guinea]]–[[Indonesia]] border; and the [[Maoke Mountains]] or Snow Range in Indonesia, where perpetual snow was found by [[Hendrikus Albertus Lorentz|H. A. Lorentz]] in 1909 at 4,461 m (14,635&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and whose highest peaks are [[Puncak Jaya]] (Mt. Carstensz) at 4,884 m (16,024 feet), [[Puncak Mandala]] (Mt. Juliana) at 4,760 m (15,610&amp;nbsp;ft) and [[Puncak Trikora]] (Mt. Wilhelmina) at 4,750 m (15,580&amp;nbsp;ft).

Although some valleys such as the [[Wahgi Valley]] in the [[Western Highlands Province|Western Highlands]], Papua New Guinea are heavily cultivated and support urban settlements most of the mountains have traditional tribal village communities in the grassy mountain valleys. The PNG Highland provinces are: [[Eastern Highlands Province]], the most heavily populated area of PNG; [[Simbu Province]] (or Chimbu) whose centre is the small coffee-growing town of [[Kundiawa]] on the Wahgi River near Mount Wilhelm; the Western Highlands; the rugged [[Enga Province]] the home of the Enga people with its administration in the very small town of [[Wabag]] on the [[Lai River (Papua New Guinea)|Lai River]], and containing the large [[Porgera Gold Mine]]; and [[Southern Highlands Province]], with its centre in the small town and airport of [[Mendi]], and containing the [[Huli people|Huli]] wigmen area around the town of [[Tari, Papua New Guinea|Tari]]. The [[Highlands Highway]] connects many of these towns. Larger urban areas in the PNG Highlands include the Western Highlands capital and PNG's 3rd largest city [[Mount Hagen]] (near the extinct [[Mount Hagen (volcano)]]), the Eastern Highlands capital and former colonial town of [[Goroka]], and the mining town of [[Tabubil, Papua New Guinea|Tabubil]]. The climate is humid as you would expect of the tropical rainforested island of New Guinea, but the higher mountain slopes are of course cooler than the lowlands.

The Highlands are the source of a number of important rivers including the [[Ramu River]] in the north and the [[Wahgi River]] in the south, and lakes including [[Lake Kutubu]], near which oil has been extracted since 1992 by [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]].  Mining is also very active in the region to the detriment of indigenous groups, with frequent friction.

==Geology==
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
This chain of mountains continues to rise (with corresponding quakes) as the [[Australian plate]] collides with the plates to the northeast, yet marking the southern boundaries of the [[Maoke Plate]] and [[Woodlark Plate]]s.  The width of the mountain range varies considerably, with a central thin segment near the borders of the two nations.

==History==
The fertile Highlands have long been inhabited and artifacts uncovered in the [[Ivane Valley]] indicate that the Highlands were first settled about 50,000 years ago. The inhabitants were nomadic foragers but around 10,000 years ago began developing a fairly advanced agricultural society. The Highlands were not settled by the Western powers during the early colonial period and they were first visited by western zoologists and explorers, such as [[Mick Leahy (explorer)|Mick Leahy]], who opened the Wahgi Valley and [[Mount Hagen]], and [[Richard Archbold]] in the 1930s. During [[World War II]], the eastern highlands saw the [[Kokoda Track campaign]] in which Australian and [[New Zealand]] soldiers, along with native guides who were pressed into service, fought and ultimately stopped the Japanese from advancing south towards [[Port Moresby]] and, ultimately, northern [[Queensland]] on the Australian mainland.

==Ecology==
The New Guinea Highlands are home to a great variety of [[Australasia]]n plant and animal communities, distinct from the surrounding lowlands to the north and south of the central ranges and varying up and along the mountain ranges. The habitats of the mountains have been separated into two [[ecoregions]], depending on their elevation, the tropical montane forests and alpine grasslands, but within these broad bands there is a variety of wildlife along the island as some of the mountains stand quite a distance from others with some species of plant or animal existing on only one or two mountains. Particular centres of plant diversity are: the Star Mountains area of western Papua New Guinea near the Indonesian border including [[Telefomin]] and [[Strickland Gorge]]; the [[Hunstein Range]]; [[Mount Giluwe]], a major birdwatching area for [[birds-of-paradise]]; the volcanic limestone [[Kubor Range]]; the Bismarck Range/Mount Wilhelm/[[Schrader Range]]/Mount [[Gahavisuka]], of which Mount Wilhelm is particularly rich in endemic species; and finally the [[Crater Mountain]] and [[Mount Michael]] in the Eastern Highlands.

===Central Range montane rain forests===
The montane rain forests (from 1,000 to 3,000m) can be further categorised into three broad vegetation zones on the mountains, distinguished by elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0105|name=Central Range Montane rain forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower montane forests extend from 1,000 to 1,500 metres elevation. They are dominated by broadleaf evergreen trees, including ''[[Castanopsis acuminatissima]],'' ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' spp., [[Elaeocarpaceae|elaeocarps]], and [[Lauraceae|laurels]]. Coniferous [[Araucaria]]s may form thick stands. The upper montane forests, which extend from 1,500 to 2,500 metres elevation, are dominated by moss-covered ''[[Nothofagus]]''. Finally, the high mountain forest extends from 2,500 to 3,000 metres elevation. Conifers (''[[Podocarpus]], [[Dacrycarpus]], [[Dacrydium]], [[Papuacedrus]], [[Araucaria]],'' and ''[[Libocedrus]]'') and broadleaf trees of the myrtle family ([[Myrtaceae]]) form a thin canopy, with a prominent understory.

The montane forests are home to a rich wildlife, a great deal of which is unique to these mountains including many plants, reptiles and over 100 birds and animals. Of the 90 mammals found on the island, 44 are endemic, a very high proportion. The birds and animals include many Australasian species such as [[tree-kangaroo]]s, [[bowerbird]]s, [[Petroicidae|Australasian robins]], [[honeyeater]]s, and birds-of-paradise. Four of the endemic mammals are critically endangered: the [[Bulmer's fruit bat]], with only tiny communities remaining in the Papua New Guinea end of the island, and three rodents; a large ''[[Leptomys]]'', the [[eastern shrew mouse]], and the [[lesser small-toothed rat]]. There are 55 bird species endemic to the mountains from a total of 348 birds found here. There are a number of endemic butterflies, particularly on the [[Weyland Mountains]] and the Wahgi Valley.

Apart from in the cultivated valleys the montane forests are largely intact, although the logging industry is a constant threat as more and more access to the mountains is achieved by road building. 20% of this ecoregion is contained within protected areas, mostly in the Indonesian half of the island, including the largest protected area in [[South East Asia]], the huge [[Lorentz National Park]] in the highlands, a section of which is montane forest ecosystem.

===Central Range sub-alpine grasslands===
Above 3,000 metres elevation, the high mountain forest yields to remote sub-alpine habitats including alpine meadows, conifer forest, tree-fern (''[[Cyathea]]'') grasslands, bogs, and shrubby heaths of ''[[Rhododendron]], [[Vaccinium]], [[Coprosma]], [[Rapanea]]'', and ''[[Saurauia]]'' all quite different from the tropical rain forest that covers most of New Guinea.

The alpine habitat above 4,000 metres consists of compact rosette and cushion herbs, such as ''[[Ranunculus]], [[Potentilla]], [[Gentiana]]'', and ''[[Epilobium]]'', grasses (''[[Poa]]'' and ''[[Deschampsia]]''), [[bryophyte]]s, and [[lichen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1002|name=Central Range sub-alpine grasslands|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are a number of endemic plants there are few animals on the higher slopes, with only nine mammals found here: four rodents, two bats, a [[cuscus]] possum, an [[Dasyuridae|antechinus]] and Doria's tree-kangaroo (''[[Dendrolagus dorianus]]''). Four of these are endemic: the small marsupial black-tailed antechinus (''[[Murexechinus melanurus]]''), [[western shrew mouse]], [[glacier rat]] and [[alpine woolly rat]]. There are nearly 100 birds of which 28 are considered endemic or nearly so, including the vulnerable long-bearded melidectes (''[[Melidectes princeps]]''), ribbon-tailed astrapia (''[[Astrapia mayeri]]'') and [[Macgregor's giant honeyeater]], which although endangered generally is a cultural icon of the [[Ketengban]] people of the Star Mountains and therefore protected in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arkive.org/macgregors-bird-of-paradise/macgregoria-pulchra/info.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403175539/http://www.arkive.org/macgregors-bird-of-paradise/macgregoria-pulchra/info.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost half of these remote grasslands are protected in national parks and they are in good condition although in recent times more people are accessing the highlands as visitors or through involvement in mining.

'''Oscar Harger''' (January 12, 1843 – November 6, 1887) was an American [[Invertebrate zoology|invertebrate zoologist]] and [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] known for his studies on [[Isopoda|isopods]], and for his work as an paleontological assistant to [[Othniel Charles Marsh]].

Harger, the son of Alfred Harger, a farmer and land surveyor of [[Huguenot]] descent, was born in [[Oxford, Connecticut|Oxford]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], Conn, January 12, 1843.  He graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1868.   He was obliged throughout his college course to maintain himself by teaching and mathematical work, and he perhaps injured his health permanently by the severe economy which he practiced at that time.  In his boyhood he had been an enthusiastic student of botany, and his success in this department of natural history led him on graduation to take up the study of zoology with Professor [[Addison Emery Verrill|Verrill]] of the [[Sheffield Scientific School]]. He had already shown his special aptitude for original work and had begun important investigations, when he accepted in 1870 the position of Assistant in Paleontology under Professor [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Marsh]], which he retained until his death. He continued, however, his investigations in invertebrate zoology, as long as his health allowed; of his publications in this field the most important is a valuable "Report on the Marine Isopoda of New England and the Adjacent Waters" (in the ''Report of the [[United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries]]'' for 1878). His best work and highest attainments, however, were in the department of vertebrate paleontology.

In 1879 he was attacked by cardiac trouble, which increased from year to year.  He continued engaged in his regular duties, until prostrated by cerebral hemorrhage on Monday, October 31, 1887. He died on the following Sunday, November 6, in his 45th year.

He married, May 13, 1875, Jessie Craig, of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], who survived him without children.

He is commemorated in the genus ''[[Hargeria]]'', a fossil bird,&lt;ref name="Lucas1903"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Frederic A.|last=Lucas|title=Notes on the Osteology and Relationship of the Fossil Birds of the Genera ''Hesperornis'', ''Hargeria'', ''Baptornis'', and ''Diatryma''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGsaAAAAYAAJ|year=1903|journal=Proceedings of the United States National Museum|volume=26| pages=545–556|doi=10.5479/si.00963801.26-1320.545}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the species ''[[Miacis|Miacis hargeri]]'', an extinct carnivorous mammal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wortman|first1=J.

'''Phototropism''' is the growth of an  organism which responds to a light stimulus. It is most often observed in [[plant|plants]], but can also occur in other organisms such as [[fungi]]. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called [[auxin]] that reacts when phototropism occurs. This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light. Phototropism is one of the many plant [[tropism]]s or movements which respond to external stimuli.  Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism, while growth away from light is called negative phototropism ('''skototropism''').{{sfn|Strong|Ray|1975}} Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism, and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth.&lt;ref name="Goyal, A. 2012"&gt;Goyal, A., Szarzynska, B., Fankhauser C. (2012). Phototropism: at the crossroads of light-signaling pathways.

PNAS 98(12), 6969-6974.&lt;/ref&gt; Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism, although [[gravitropism]] may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them. The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction.&lt;ref name="Liscum, E. 2002"&gt;Liscum, E. (2002). Phototropism: Mechanisms and Outcomes. Arabidopsis Book 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
There are several signaling molecules that help the plant determine where the light source is coming from which helps the plant, and this activates several genes, which change the hormone gradients allowing the plant to grow towards the light. The very tip of the plant known as the [[coleoptile]] is necessary in light sensing.&lt;ref name="Goyal, A. 2012"/&gt; The middle portion of the coleoptile is the area where the shoot curvature occurs. The [[Cholodny–Went model|Cholodny–Went hypothesis]], developed in the early 20th century, predicts that in the presence of asymmetric light, auxin will move towards the shaded side and promote elongation of the cells on that side to cause the plant to curve towards the light source.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, J.M., and Murphy, A.S. (2013). Shoot phototropism in higher plants: New light through old concepts. American Journal of Botany 100(1), 35-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Auxins activate proton pumps, decreasing the pH in the cells on the dark side of the plant.  This acidification of the cell wall region activates enzymes known as [[expansin]]s which break bonds in the cell wall structure, making the cell walls less rigid. In addition, the acidic environment causes disruption of hydrogen bonds in the cellulose that makes up the cell wall. The decrease in cell wall strength causes cells to swell, exerting the mechanical pressure that drives phototropic movement.

A second group of genes, ''PIN'' genes, have been found to play a major role in phototropism. They are auxin transporters, so it is thought that they are responsible for the polarization of auxin. Specifically ''PIN3'' has been identified as the primary auxin carrier.&lt;ref&gt;Ding, Z., Galván-Ampudia, C.S., Demarsy, E., Langowski, L., Kleine-Vehn, J., Fan, Y., Morita, M.T., Tasaka M., Fankhauser, C., Offringa, R., Friml, J. (2011). Light-mediated polarization of the PIN3 auxin transporter for the phototropic response in Arabidopsis Nature Cell Biology 13(4), 447-453.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that phototropins receive light and inhibit the activity of PINOID kinase (PID), which then promotes the activity of ''PIN3''. This activation of ''PIN3'' leads to asymmetric distribution of auxin, which then leads to asymmetric elongation of cells in the stem. ''pin3'' mutants had shorter hypocotyls and roots than the wild-type, and the same phenotype was seen in plants grown with auxin efflux inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;Friml, J., Wisniewska, J., Benkova, E., Mendgen, K., Palme, K. (2002). Lateral relocation of auxin efflux regulator PIN3 mediates tropism in Arabidopsis. Nature 415, 806-809.&lt;/ref&gt; Using anti-PIN3 immunogold labeling, movement of the PIN3 protein was observed. PIN3 is normally localized to the surface of hypocotyl and stem, but is also internalized in the presence of Brefeldin A (BFA), an exocytosis inhibitor. This mechanism allows PIN3 to be repositioned in response to an environmental stimulus. PIN3 and PIN7 proteins were thought to play a role in pulse-induced phototropism. The curvature responses in the "pin3" mutant were reduced significantly, but only slightly reduced in "pin7" mutants. There is some redundancy among "PIN1", "PIN3", and "PIN7", but it is thought that PIN3 plays a greater role in pulse-induced phototropism.&lt;ref&gt;Haga, K., and Sakai, T. (2012). PIN Auxin Efflux Carriers Are Necessary for Pulse-Induced But Not Continuous Light-Induced Phototropism in Arabidopsis. Plant Physiology 160, 763-776.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are phototropins that are highly expressed in the upper region of coleoptiles. The two main phototropins are phot1 and phot2. ''phot2'' single mutants have phototropic responses like that of the wild-type, but ''phot1 phot2'' double mutants do not show any phototropic responses.&lt;ref name="Liscum, E. 2002"/&gt; The amounts of ''PHOT1'' and ''PHOT2'' present are different depending on the age of the plant and the intensity of the light. There is a high amount of ''PHOT2'' present in mature ''Arabidopsis'' leaves and this was also seen in rice orthologs. The expression of ''PHOT1'' and ''PHOT2'' changes depending on the presence of blue or red light. There was a downregulation of ''PHOT1'' mRNA in the presence of light, but upregulation of PHOT2 transcript. The levels of mRNA and protein present in the plant were dependent upon the age of the plant. This suggests that the phototropin expression levels change with the maturation of the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Labuz, J., Sztatelman, O., Banas, A. K., Gabrys H. (2012). The expression of phototropins in Arabidopsis leaves: developmental and light regulation. Journal of Experimental Botany 63(4), 1763-1771.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mature leaves contain chloroplasts that are essential in photosynthesis. Chloroplast rearrangement occurs in different light environments to maximize photosynthesis. There are several genes involved in plant phototropism including the ''NPH1'' and ''NPL1'' gene. They are both involved in chloroplast rearrangement.&lt;ref name="Sakai, T. 2001"/&gt; The ''nph1'' and ''npl1'' double mutants were found to have reduced phototropic responses. In fact, the two genes are both redundant in determining the curvature of the stem.

===Five models of auxin distribution in phototropism===
In 2012, Sakai and Haga&lt;ref name="Sakai" /&gt; outlined how different [[auxin]] concentrations could be arising on shaded and lighted side of the stem, giving birth to phototropic response. Five models in respect to [[Plant stem|stem]] phototropism have been proposed, using ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' as the study plant.

[[File:Model for auxin transport.png|left|thumb|Five models showing how auxin is transported in the plant Arabidopsis.]]

;First model
In the first model incoming light deactivates auxin on the light side of the plant allowing the shaded part to continue growing and eventually bend the plant over towards the light.&lt;ref name="Sakai"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=22864452|year=2012 |last1=Sakai |first1=T |last2=Haga |first2=K |title=Molecular genetic analysis of phototropism in Arabidopsis |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=1517–34 |doi=10.1093/pcp/pcs111 |pmc=3439871 |journal=Plant &amp; cell physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Second model
In the second model light inhibits auxin biosynthesis on the light side of the plant, thus decreasing the concentration of auxin relative to the unaffected side.&lt;ref name="Sakai" /&gt;

;Third model
In the third model there is a horizontal flow of auxin from both the light and dark side of the plant. Incoming light causes more auxin to flow from the exposed side to the shaded side, increasing the concentration of auxin on the shaded side and thus more growth occurring.&lt;ref name="Sakai" /&gt;

;Fourth model
In the fourth model it shows the plant receiving light to inhibit auxin [[basipetal]] down to the exposed side, causing the auxin to only flow down the shaded side.&lt;ref name="Sakai" /&gt;

;Fifth model
Model five encompasses elements of both model 3 and 4. The main auxin flow in this model comes from the top of the plant vertically down towards the base of the plant with some of the auxin travelling horizontally from the main auxin flow to both sides of the plant. Receiving light inhibits the horizontal auxin flow from the main vertical auxin flow to the irradiated exposed side. And according to the study by Sakai and Haga, the observed asymmetric auxin distribution and subsequent phototropic response in hypocotyls seems most consistent with this fifth scenario.&lt;ref name="Sakai" /&gt;

==Effects of wavelength==
Phototropism in plants such as ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is directed by blue light receptors called [[phototropin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://abstracts.aspb.org/pb2004/public/S01/9179.html|title = Phototropins: Photoreceptors that provide a novel photochemical mechanism for signaling|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151118210936/http://abstracts.aspb.org/pb2004/public/S01/9179.html|archive-date=2015-11-18 |access-date = 2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other photosensitive receptors in plants include [[phytochrome]]s that sense red light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://plantphys.info/plant_physiology/phytochrome.shtml|title = Phytochrome|website = plantphys.info|access-date = 2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cryptochrome]]s that sense blue light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckardt|first1=N.

Stem tips exhibit positive phototropic reactions to blue light, while root tips exhibit negative phototropic reactions to blue light.  Both root tips and most stem tips exhibit positive phototropism to red light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that absorb blue/ UV-A light, and they help control the circadian rhythm in plants and timing of flowering.

Torrey Botanical Society 138(4), 409-417.&lt;/ref&gt; Together phytochromes and cryptochromes inhibit gravitropism in hypocotyls and contribute to phototropism.&lt;ref name="Goyal, A. 2012" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36545">A '''shape-memory alloy''' ('''SMA''', '''smart metal''', '''memory metal''', '''memory alloy''', '''muscle wire''', '''smart alloy''') is an [[alloy]] that "remembers" its original [[geometry|shape]] and that when deformed returns to its pre-deformed shape when heated. This material is a lightweight, solid-state alternative to conventional [[actuator]]s such as [[hydraulic]], [[pneumatic]], and [[Engine|motor]]-based systems. Shape-memory alloys have applications in [[robotics]] and [[automotive]], [[aerospace]] and [[biomedical]] industries.

== Overview ==
{{expert needed|technology|ex2=engineering|section|date=February 2009}}

The two most prevalent shape-memory alloys are [[copper]]-[[aluminium]]-[[nickel]], and [[nickel]]-[[titanium]] ([[Nickel titanium|NiTi]]) alloys but SMAs can also be created by alloying [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[gold]] and [[iron]].
Although iron-based and copper-based SMAs, such as Fe-Mn-Si, Cu-Zn-Al and Cu-Al-Ni, are commercially available and cheaper than NiTi, NiTi based SMAs are preferable for most applications due to their stability, practicability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilkes | first1 = K.

NiTi alloys change from [[austenite]] to [[martensite]] upon cooling; ''M&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature at which the transition to martensite completes upon cooling. Accordingly, during heating ''A&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''A&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the temperatures at which the transformation from martensite to austenite starts and finishes. Repeated use of the shape-memory effect may lead to a shift of the characteristic transformation temperatures (this effect is known as functional fatigue, as it is closely related with a change of microstructural and functional properties of the material).&lt;ref name=ot&gt;[http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam034/97036119.pdf Shape Memory Materials], K Otsuka, CM Wayman, Cambridge University Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-521-66384-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum temperature at which SMAs can no longer be stress induced is called ''M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'', where the SMAs are permanently deformed.&lt;ref&gt;Duerig TW, Pelton AR. (1994) "Ti-Ni shape memory alloys". in ''Materials Properties Handbook: Titanium Alloys'', Gerhard Welsch, Rodney Boyer, E. W. Collings (eds.) American Society for Metals. pp. 1035–48. {{ISBN|0-87170-481-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition from the martensite phase to the austenite phase is only dependent on temperature and stress, not time, as most phase changes are, as there is no diffusion involved. Similarly, the austenite structure receives its name from steel alloys of a similar structure. It is the reversible diffusionless transition between these two phases that results in special properties. While martensite can be formed from austenite by rapidly cooling [[carbon]]-[[steel]], this process is not reversible, so steel does not have shape-memory properties.

In this figure, ξ(T) represents the martensite fraction. The difference between the heating transition and the cooling transition gives rise to [[hysteresis]] where some of the mechanical energy is lost in the process. The shape of the curve depends on the material properties of the shape-memory alloy, such as the [[alloy]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=S|last2=Wayman|first2=C|title=Martensitic transformations and the shape-memory effect in Ti50Ni10Au40 and Ti50Au50 alloys|journal=Metallography|volume=20|page=359|year=1987|doi=10.1016/0026-0800(87)90045-0|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[work hardening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filip|first1=P|title=Influence of work hardening and heat treatment on the substructure and deformation behaviour of TiNi shape memory alloys|journal=Scripta Metallurgica et Materialia|volume=32|page=1375|year=1995|doi=10.1016/0956-716X(95)00174-T|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== One-way vs. two-way shape memory ==
Shape-memory alloys have different shape-memory effects. Two common effects are one-way and two-way shape memory. A schematic of the effects is shown below.

[[File:SMAoneway.jpg|300px]][[File:SMAtwoway.jpg|300px]]

The procedures are very similar: starting from martensite (a), adding a reversible deformation for the one-way effect or severe deformation with an irreversible amount for the two-way (b), heating the sample (c) and cooling it again (d).

=== One-way memory effect ===
When a shape-memory alloy is in its cold state (below ''A&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''), the metal can be bent or stretched and will hold those shapes until heated above the transition temperature. Upon heating, the shape changes to its original. When the metal cools again it will remain in the hot shape, until deformed again.

With the one-way effect, cooling from high temperatures does not cause a macroscopic shape change. A deformation is necessary to create the low-temperature shape. On heating, transformation starts at ''A&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and is completed at ''A&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' (typically 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;°C or hotter, depending on the alloy or the loading conditions). ''A&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is determined by the alloy type and composition and can vary between {{val|-150|u=°C}} and {{val|200|u=°C}}.

=== Two-way memory effect ===
The two-way shape-memory effect is the effect that the material remembers two different shapes: one at low temperatures, and one at the high-temperature shape. A material that shows a shape-memory effect during both heating and cooling is said to have two-way shape memory. This can also be obtained without the application of an external force (intrinsic two-way effect). The reason the material behaves so differently in these situations lies in training. Training implies that a shape memory can "learn" to behave in a certain way. Under normal circumstances, a shape-memory alloy "remembers" its low-temperature shape, but upon heating to recover the high-temperature shape, immediately "forgets" the low-temperature shape. However, it can be "trained" to "remember" to leave some reminders of the deformed low-temperature condition in the high-temperature phases. There are several ways of doing this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~btrease/share/SMA-Shape-Training-Tutorial.pdf Shape Memory Alloy Shape Training Tutorial]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt; A shaped, trained object heated beyond a certain point will lose the two-way memory effect.

== Superelasticity ==
SMAs also display [[superelasticity]], which is characterized by the recovery of relatively large strains with some , however, dissipation. In addition to temperature-induced phase transformations, martensite and austenite phases can be induced in response to mechanical stress. When SMAs are loaded in the austenite phase (i.e. above a certain temperature), the material will begin to transform into the (twinned) martensite phase when a critical stress is reached. Upon continued loading and assuming isothermal conditions, the (twinned) martensite will begin to [[Crystal twinning|detwin]], allowing the material to undergo plastic deformation. If the unloading happens before [[Plasticity_(physics)|plasticity]], the martensite transforms back to austenite, and the material recovers its original shape by developing a hysteresis. For example, these materials can reversibly deform to very high strains – up to 7 percent. A more thorough discussion of the pseudoelastic behavior is presented by the experimental work of Shaw &amp; Kyriakides&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-5096(95)00024-D| title = Thermomechanical aspects of NiTi| journal = Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids| volume = 43| issue = 8| pages = 1243-1281| year = 1995| last1 = Shaw | first1 = J. | last2 = Kyriakides | first2 = S. | bibcode = 1995JMPSo..43.1243S}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and more recently by Ma et al.&lt;ref name=Ma&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1179/095066010x12646898728363| title = High temperature shape memory alloys| journal = International Materials Reviews| volume = 55| issue = 5| pages = 257| year = 2010| last1 = Ma | first1 = J. | last2 = Karaman | first2 = I. | last3 = Noebe | first3 = R. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first reported steps towards the discovery of the shape-memory effect were taken in the 1930s. According to Otsuka and Wayman, [[Arne Ölander]] discovered the pseudoelastic behavior of the Au-Cd alloy in 1932. Greninger and Mooradian (1938) observed the formation and disappearance of a martensitic phase by decreasing and increasing the temperature of a Cu-Zn alloy. The basic phenomenon of the memory effect governed by the thermoelastic behavior of the martensite phase was widely reported a decade later by Kurdjumov and Khandros (1949) and also by Chang and Read (1951).&lt;ref name=ot /&gt;

The nickel-titanium alloys were first developed in 1962–1963 by the [[United States]] [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] and commercialized under the trade name [[Nitinol]] (an acronym for Nickel Titanium Naval Ordnance Laboratories). Their remarkable properties were discovered by accident. A sample that was bent out of shape many times was presented at a laboratory management meeting. One of the associate technical directors, Dr. David S. Muzzey, decided to see what would happen if the sample was subjected to heat and held his pipe lighter underneath it. To everyone's amazement the sample stretched back to its original shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kauffman, George |author2=Isaac Mayo |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Memory Metal|journal=ChemMatters |date=October 1993|pages= 4–7|url=http://wychem.scienceontheweb.net/ChemCD/ChemMatters/931004t.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolaa.org/files/Nitinol_Oral_History.pdf Oral history by William J. Buehler]. wolaa.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another type of SMA, called a [[magnetic shape memory|ferromagnetic shape-memory alloy]] (FSMA), that changes shape under strong magnetic fields. These materials are of particular interest as the magnetic response tends to be faster and more efficient than temperature-induced responses.

Metal alloys are not the only thermally-responsive materials; [[shape-memory polymer]]s have also been developed, and became commercially available in the late 1990s.

== Crystal structures ==
Many metals have several different crystal structures at the same composition, but most metals do not show this shape-memory effect. The special property that allows shape-memory alloys to revert to their original shape after heating is that their crystal transformation is fully reversible. In most crystal transformations, the atoms in the structure will travel through the metal by diffusion, changing the composition locally, even though the metal as a whole is made of the same atoms. A reversible transformation does not involve this diffusion of atoms, instead all the atoms shift at the same time to form a new structure, much in the way a parallelogram can be made out of a square by pushing on two opposing sides. At different temperatures, different structures are preferred and when the structure is cooled through the transition temperature, the martensitic structure forms from the austenitic phase.

== Manufacture ==
Shape-memory alloys are typically made by casting, using vacuum arc melting or induction melting. These are specialist techniques used to keep impurities in the alloy to a minimum and ensure the metals are well mixed. The [[ingot]] is then [[hot rolled]] into longer sections and then [[Wire drawing|drawn]] to turn it into wire.

The way in which the alloys are "trained" depends on the properties wanted. The "training" dictates the shape that the alloy will remember when it is heated. This occurs by heating the alloy so that the [[dislocation]]s re-order into stable positions, but not so hot that the material [[Recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallizes]]. They are heated to between {{val|400|u=°C}} and {{val|500|u=°C}} for 30 minutes, shaped while hot, and then are cooled rapidly by quenching in water or by cooling with air.

== Properties ==
The copper-based and NiTi-based shape-memory alloys are considered to be engineering materials. These compositions can be manufactured to almost any shape and size.

The yield strength of shape-memory alloys is lower than that of conventional steel, but some compositions have a higher yield strength than plastic or aluminum. The yield stress for Ni Ti can reach {{val|500|ul=MPa}}. The high cost of the metal itself and the processing requirements make it difficult and expensive to implement SMAs into a design. As a result, these materials are used in applications where the super elastic properties or the shape-memory effect can be exploited. The most common application is in actuation.

One of the advantages to using shape-memory alloys is the high level of recoverable plastic strain that can be induced. The maximum recoverable strain these materials can hold without permanent damage is up to {{val|8|s=%}} for some alloys. This compares with a maximum strain {{val|0.5|s=%}} for conventional steels.

== Practical limitations ==

SMA have many advantages over traditional actuators, but do suffer from a series of limitations that may impede practical application. In numerous studies, it was emphasised that only a few of patented shape memory alloy applications are commercially successful due to material limitations combined with a lack of material and design knowledge and associated tools, such as improper design approaches and techniques used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =  10.1177/1045389X16679296| title = Designing shape memory alloy linear actuators: A review| journal = Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures| volume = 28| issue = 13| page = 1699| year = 2016| last1 = M. Jani | first1 = J.| last2 = Leary | first2 = M. | last3 = Subic | first3 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges in designing SMA applications are to overcome their limitations, which include a relatively small usable strain, low actuation frequency, low controllability, low accuracy and low energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.matdes.2013.11.084| title = A review of shape memory alloy research, applications and opportunities| journal = Materials and Design (1980-2015)| volume = 56| issue = 5| pages = 1078–1113| year = 2014| last1 = M. Jani | first1 = J.| last2 = Leary | first2 = M. | last3 = Subic | first3 = A.| last4 = Gibson | first4 = Mark A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response time and response symmetry ===
SMA actuators are typically actuated electrically, where an electric current results in [[Joule heating]]. Deactivation typically occurs by free convective heat transfer to the ambient environment. Consequently, SMA actuation is typically asymmetric, with a relatively fast actuation time and a slow deactuation time. A number of methods have been proposed to reduce SMA deactivation time, including forced convection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lara-Quintanilla|first=A.|author2=Hulskamp, A. W. |author3=Bersee, H. E. |title=A high-rate shape memory alloy actuator for aerodynamic load control on wind turbines|journal=Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures|date=October 2013|volume=24|issue=15|pages=1834–1845|doi=10.1177/1045389X13478271|url=http://jim.sagepub.com/content/24/15/1834|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lagging the SMA with a conductive material in order to manipulate the heat transfer rate.

Novel methods to enhance the feasibility of SMA actuators include the use of a conductive "[[Thermal insulation|lagging]]". this method uses a thermal paste to rapidly transfer heat from the SMA by conduction. This heat is then more readily transferred to the environment by convection as the outer radii (and heat transfer area) are significantly greater than for the bare wire. This method results in a significant reduction in deactivation time and a symmetric activation profile. As a consequence of the increased [[heat transfer]] rate, the required current to achieve a given actuation force is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=S|last2=Leary|first2=Martin|last3=Attalla|first3=Tamer|last4=Probst|first4=K| last5=Subic|first5=A|title=Optimisation of Ni–Ti shape memory alloy response time by transient heat transfer analysis|journal=Materials &amp; Design|volume=35|pages=655–663|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2011.09.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural fatigue and functional fatigue ===
SMA is subject to structural fatigue – a failure mode by which cyclic loading results in the initiation and propagation of a crack that eventually results in catastrophic loss of function by fracture. The physics behind this fatigue mode is accumulation of microstructural damage during cyclic loading. This failure mode is observed in most engineering materials, not just SMAs.

SMAs are also subject to functional fatigue, a failure mode not typical of most engineering materials, whereby the SMA does not fail structurally but loses its shape-memory/superelastic characteristics over time. As a result of cyclic loading (both mechanical and thermal), the material loses its ability to undergo a reversible phase transformation. For example, the working displacement in an actuator  decreases with increasing cycle numbers. The physics behind this is gradual change in microstructure—more specifically, the buildup of accommodation slip [[dislocations]]. This is often accompanied by a significant change in transformation temperatures.&lt;ref name=Miyazaki&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.msea.2006.02.054| title = Development and characterization of Ni-free Ti-base shape memory and superelastic alloys| journal = Materials Science and Engineering: A| volume = 438–440| pages = 18| year = 2006| last1 = Miyazaki | first1 = S.| last2 = Kim | first2 = H. Y. | last3 = Hosoda | first3 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design of SMA actuators may also influence both structural and functional fatigue of SMA, such as the pulley configurations in SMA-Pulley system.&lt;ref name=JMJ&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/057001| title = Fatigue of NiTi SMA-pulley system using Taguchi and ANOVA| journal = Smart Materials and Structures| volume = 25| issue = 5| pages = 057001| year = 2016| last1 = M. Jani | first1 = J.| last2 = Leary | first2 = M. | last3 = Subic | first3 = A.| bibcode = 2016SMaS...25e7001M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unintended actuation ===
SMA actuators are typically actuated electrically by [[Joule heating]]. If the SMA is used in an environment where the ambient temperature is uncontrolled, unintentional actuation by ambient heating may occur.

== Applications ==

=== Industrial ===

==== Aircraft and spacecraft ====
[[Boeing]], [[General Electric Aircraft Engines]], [[Goodrich Corporation]], [[NASA]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and [[All Nippon Airways]] developed the Variable Geometry Chevron using a NiTi SMA. Such a variable area fan nozzle (VAFN) design would allow for quieter and more efficient jet engines in the future. In 2005 and 2006, Boeing conducted successful flight testing of this technology.&lt;ref name=Mabe&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1117/12.776816| chapter = Variable area jet nozzle using shape memory alloy actuators in an antagonistic design| title = Industrial and Commercial Applications of Smart Structures Technologies 2008| volume = 6930| pages = 69300T| series = Industrial and Commercial Applications of Smart Structures Technologies 2008| year = 2008| last1 = Mabe | first1 = J. H. | last2 = Calkins | first2 = F. T. | last3 = Alkislar | first3 = M. B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMAs are being explored as vibration dampers for launch vehicles and commercial jet engines. The large amount of [[hysteresis]] observed during the superelastic effect allow SMAs to dissipate energy and dampen vibrations. These materials show promise for reducing the high vibration loads on payloads during launch as well as on fan blades in commercial jet engines, allowing for more lightweight and efficient designs.&lt;ref name=Hartl&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1243/09544100jaero211| title = Aerospace applications of shape memory alloys| journal = Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering| volume = 221| issue = 4| pages = 535| year = 2007| last1 = Lagoudas | first1 = D. C. | last2 = Hartl | first2 = D. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; SMAs also exhibit potential for other high shock applications such as ball bearings and landing gear.&lt;ref name=DellaCorte&gt;DellaCorte, C. (2014) [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20140010477 Novel Super-Elastic Materials for Advanced Bearing Applications].&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also strong interest in using SMAs for a variety of actuator applications in commercial jet engines, which would significantly reduce their weight and boost efficiency.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1117/12.669027| chapter = High integrity adaptive SMA components for gas turbine applications| title = Smart Structures and Materials 2006: Industrial and Commercial Applications of Smart Structures Technologies| volume = 6171| pages = 61710F| series = Smart Structures and Materials 2006: Industrial and Commercial Applications of Smart Structures Technologies| year = 2006| last1 = Webster | first1 = J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research needs to be conducted in this area, however, to increase the transformation temperatures and improve the mechanical properties of these materials before they can be successfully implemented. A review of recent advances in high-temperature shape-memory alloys (HTSMAs) is presented by Ma et al.&lt;ref name=Ma /&gt;

A variety of wing-morphing technologies are also being explored.&lt;ref name=Hartl /&gt;

==== Automotive ====
The first high-volume product (&gt; 5Mio actuators / year) is an automotive valve used to control low pressure [[pneumatic]] bladders in a [[car seat]] that adjust the contour of the lumbar support / bolsters. The overall benefits of SMA over traditionally-used solenoids in this application (lower noise/EMC/weight/form factor/power consumption) were the crucial factor in the decision to replace the old standard technology with SMA.

The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette became the first vehicle to incorporate SMA actuators, which replaced heavier motorized actuators to open and close the hatch vent that releases air from the trunk, making it easier to close. A variety of other applications are also being targeted, including electric generators to generate electricity from exhaust heat and on-demand air dams to optimize aerodynamics at various speeds.

==== Robotics ====
There have also been limited studies on using these materials in [[robotics]], for example the hobbyist robot [[Stiquito]] (and "Roboterfrau Lara"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lararobot.de/ The Lara Project – G1 and G2]. Lararobot.de. Retrieved on 2011-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt;), as they make it possible to create very lightweight robots. Recently, a prosthetic hand was introduced by Loh et al. that can almost replicate the motions of a human hand [Loh2005]. Other biomimetic applications are also being explored. Weak points of the technology are energy inefficiency, [[Shape-memory alloy#Response time and response symmetry|slow response times]], and large [[hysteresis]].

=== Bio-engineered robotic hand ===
There is some SMA-based prototypes of robotic hand that using shape memory effect (SME) to move fingers &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Duerig|first=T.W.|title=Wide Hysteresis Shape Memory Alloys|date=1990|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-7506-1009-4.50015-9|work=Engineering Aspects of Shape Memory Alloys|pages=130–136|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780750610094|access-date=2018-09-07|last2=Melton|first2=K.N.|last3=Proft|first3=J.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Civil Structures ====
SMAs find a variety of applications in civil structures such as bridges and buildings. One such application is Intelligent Reinforced Concrete (IRC), which incorporates SMA wires embedded within the concrete. These wires can sense cracks and contract to heal macro-sized cracks. Another application is active tuning of structural natural frequency using SMA wires to dampen vibrations.&lt;ref name=Song&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.engstruct.2005.12.010| title = Applications of shape memory alloys in civil structures| journal = Engineering Structures| volume = 28| issue = 9| pages = 1266| year = 2006| last1 = Song | first1 = G.| last2 = Ma | first2 = N.| last3 = Li | first3 = H. -N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Piping ====
The first consumer commercial application  was  a [[shape-memory coupling]] for piping, e.g. oil line pipes for industrial applications, water pipes and similar types of piping for consumer/commercial applications.

==== Telecommunication ====
The second high volume application was an [[autofocus]] (AF) actuator for a [[smart phone]]. There are currently several companies working on an  [[Image stabilization|optical image stabilisation]] (OIS) module driven by wires made from SMAs{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

=== Medicine ===
Shape-memory alloys are applied in medicine, for example, as fixation devices for [[osteotomy|osteotomies]] in [[orthopaedic surgery]], in [[dental braces]] to exert constant tooth-moving forces on the teeth, and in [[Capsule Endoscopy]] they can be used as a trigger for biopsy action.

The late 1980s saw the commercial introduction of [[Nitinol]] as an enabling technology in a number of minimally invasive endovascular medical applications. While more costly than stainless steel, the self expanding properties of Nitinol alloys manufactured to BTR (Body Temperature Response), have provided an attractive alternative to balloon expandable devices in [[stent graft]]s where it gives the ability to adapt to the shape of certain blood vessels when exposed to body temperature. On average, {{val|50|s=%}} of all peripheral vascular [[stent]]s currently available on the worldwide market are manufactured with Nitinol.

==== Optometry ====
[[Glasses|Eyeglass frames]] made from titanium-containing SMAs are marketed under the trademarks [[Flexon]] and TITANflex. These frames are usually made out of shape-memory alloys that have their transition temperature set below the expected room temperature. This allows the frames to undergo large deformation under stress, yet regain their intended shape once the metal is unloaded again. The very large apparently elastic strains are due to the stress-induced martensitic effect, where the crystal structure can transform under loading, allowing the shape to change temporarily under load. This means that eyeglasses made of shape-memory alloys are more robust against being accidentally damaged.

==== Orthopedic surgery ====
{{Expert needed|Medicine|section|date=February 2009}}

Memory metal has been utilized in [[orthopedic surgery]] as a fixation-compression device for [[osteotomy|osteotomies]], typically for lower extremity procedures. The device, usually in the form of a large staple, is stored in a refrigerator in its malleable form and is implanted into pre-drilled holes in the bone across an osteotomy. As the staple warms it returns to its non-malleable state and compresses the bony surfaces together to promote bone union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16546946|year=2006|last1=Mereau|first1=TM|last2=Ford|first2=TC|title=Nitinol compression staples for bone fixation in foot surgery|volume=96|issue=2|pages=102–6|journal=Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association|doi=10.7547/0960102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dentistry ====
The range of applications for SMAs has grown over the years, a major area of development being dentistry. One example is the prevalence of [[dental braces]] using SMA technology to exert constant tooth-moving forces on the teeth; the nitinol [[archwire]] was developed in 1972 by [[Orthodontics|orthodontist]] [[George Andreasen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/15/obituaries/george-andreasen-55-orthodontics-inventor.html Obituary of Dr. Andreasen]. New York Times (1989-08-15). Retrieved on 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This revolutionized clinical orthodontics. Andreasen's alloy has a patterned shape memory, expanding and contracting within given temperature ranges because of its geometric programming.

[[Harmeet D. Walia]] later utilized the alloy in the manufacture of root canal files for [[endodontics]].

==== Essential Tremor ====
Traditional active cancellation techniques for tremor reduction use electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems to actuate an object in the direction opposite to the disturbance. However, these systems are limited due to the large infrastructure required to produce large amplitudes of power at human tremor frequencies. SMAs have proven to be an effective method of actuation in hand-held applications, and have enabled a new class active tremor cancellation devices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/76010/apathak_1.pdf Development of an Antagonistic SMA Actuation Technology for the Active Cancellation of Human Tremor]. deepblue.lib.umich.edu&lt;/ref&gt; One recent example of such device is the [[Liftware]] spoon, developed by [[Verily Life Sciences]] subsidiary [[Lift Labs]].


=== Engines ===
Experimental solid state heat engines, operating from the relatively small temperature differences in cold and hot water reservoirs, have been developed since the 1970s, including the Banks Engine, developed by [[Ridgway Banks]].

=== Crafts ===
Sold in small round lengths for use in affixment-free bracelets.

== Materials ==
A variety of alloys exhibit the shape-memory effect. Alloying constituents can be adjusted to control the transformation temperatures of the SMA. Some common systems include the following (by no means an exhaustive list):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2696">The '''SkyScout''' is an electronic astronomical instrument made by [[Celestron]]. It is intended primarily as an educational device to help users locate and identify celestial objects.

==Device Description==
The SkyScout is a handheld, battery powered device about 7.4" x 4.0" x 2.5", and weighs about 1 pound. It has a viewing port, a 3" x 1" LCD display on the side and several buttons for controlling and selecting device functions.

==Operation==
The SkyScout has a 12 channel [[GPS]] receiver and orientation sensors that measure location and pointing angle. From an internal database of some 6,000 celestial objects an object is identified simply by centering it in the device's zero-power optical finder and pressing a button. The [[LCD]] screen displays the name of the object (star, planet, deep sky object, etc.) and other relevant data. An audio presentation is available via earphones on 200 of the most popular celestial objects.

The SkyScout will also locate an object; the user selects the desired object from the database and red arrows in the viewfinder direct the user to point the viewfinder to the object. The SkyScout also features a "Tonight's Highlights" mode, leading the user through the night's best objects.

==Expandability==
The database can be expanded with extra plug-in SD data cards. A USB connection is also provided for online updates of the object database and device firmware.

==Price and availability==
The SkyScout was announced at the January 2006 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], and became available in July 2006. It has a retail cost of $675, but is available at prices as low as $250.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telescopes.com/telescope-accessories/general-accessories/celestronskyscoutpersonalplanetarium.cfm Celestron SkyScout Personal Planetarium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Skyscout has been known to scratch easily, and battery life is short at about one-half hour. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.
The sensors inside of it were far too twitchy around anything metal and made it difficult to use.  The advent of [[iPhone]]/[[Android (operating system)|Android]] and associated astronomy apps have somewhat eliminated the need for this device. Note: the Celestron SkyScout's database extended up to Jan 1, 2016. The SkyScout is unsupported by Celestron and no longer works as designed.

The '''Small Astronomy Satellite 2''', also known also as '''SAS-2''',''' SAS B''' or '''Explorer 48''', was a [[NASA]] [[gamma ray telescope]]. It was launched on 15 November 1972 into the low Earth orbit with a [[periapsis]] of 443&amp;nbsp;km and an [[apoapsis]] of 632&amp;nbsp;km. It completed its observations on 8 June 1973.&lt;ref name="sasb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftOrbit.do?id=1972-091A | title=NASA - NSSD - Spacecraft - Trajectory Details (SAS-B) | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sasb2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1972-091A | title=NASA - NSSDC - Spacecraft - Details (SAS-B) | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAS 2 was the second in the series of small spacecraft designed to extend the astronomical studies in the X-ray, gamma-ray, ultraviolet, visible, and infrared regions. The primary objective of the SAS-B was to measure the spatial and energy distribution of primary galactic and extragalactic gamma radiation which energies between 20 and 300 MeV. The instrumentation consisted principally of a guard scintillation detector, an upper and a lower spark chamber, and a charged particle telescope.

SAS-2 was launched from the [[Broglio Space Centre|San Marco platform]] off the coast of Kenya, Africa, into a nearly equatorial orbit. The orbiting spacecraft was in the shape of a cylinder approximately 59&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 135&amp;nbsp;cm in length. Four solar paddles were used to recharge the 6 amp-h nickel-cadmium battery and provide power to the spacecraft and telescope experiment. The spacecraft was spin stabilized, and a magnetically torqued commandable control system was used to point the spin axis of the spacecraft to any position in space within approximately 1 degree. The experiment axis lay along this axis allowing the telescope to look at any selected region of the sky with its plus or minus 30 degree acceptance aperture. The nominal spin rate was 1/12 rpm. Data were taken at 1000 bit/s and could be recorded on an onboard tape recorder and simultaneously transmitted in real time. The recorded data were transmitted once per orbit. This required approximately 5 minutes.

The telescope experiment was initially turned on Nov 20 1972, and by Nov 27 1972, the spacecraft became fully operational. The low-voltage power supply for the experiment failed on Jun 8 1973. No useful scientific data were obtained after that date. With the exception of a slightly degraded star sensor, the spacecraft control section performed in an excellent manner.

SAS-2 first detected [[Geminga]], a [[pulsar]] believed to be the remnant of a supernova that exploded 300,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/G/Geminga.html Geminga], The [[Internet Encyclopedia of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, '''undefined''' has several different meanings, depending on the context. Such contexts include the following, among others:
* In various branches of mathematics, certain concepts are introduced as [[primitive notion]]s; for example, in [[geometry]] these might be given the names "point", "line", and "angle". As these terms are not defined in terms of other concepts, such terms may be called "undefined terms".
* A [[function (mathematics)|function]] is said to be "undefined" at points not in its domain{{snd}}for example, in the [[real number]] system, &lt;math&gt; f(x)=\sqrt{x} &lt;/math&gt; is undefined for negative&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; assigns no value to negative arguments.
* As a special case of the latter, some [[arithmetic]] operations may not assign a meaning to certain values of its operands, such as happens with [[division by zero]]. In such a case an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] involving such an operation is called "undefined".

==Undefined terms==
In ancient times, geometers attempted to define every term.  For example, [[Euclid of Alexandria|Euclid]] defined a [[Point (geometry)|point]] as "that which has no part".  In modern times, mathematicians recognize that attempting to define every word inevitably leads to [[circular definition]]s, and therefore leave some terms, "point" for example, undefined (see [[primitive notion]]).

This more abstract approach allows for fruitful generalizations. In [[topology]], a [[topological space]] may be defined as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of points endowed with certain properties, but in the general setting the nature of these "points" is left entirely undefined. Likewise, in [[category theory]] a [[category (mathematics)|category]] consists of "objects" and "arrows"; again, these are primitive, undefined terms. This allows such abstract mathematical theories to be applied to very diverse concrete situations.

==In arithmetic==
The expression 0/0 is undefined in arithmetic, as explained in [[division by zero]] (the expression is used [[L'Hôpital's rule|in calculus]] to represent an [[indeterminate form]]).

Mathematicians have different opinions as to whether 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; should be defined to equal 1, or be left undefined; see [[Zero to the power of zero]] for details.

==Values for which functions are undefined==
The set of numbers for which a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is defined is called the ''domain'' of the function.  If a number is not in the domain of a function, the function is said to be "undefined" for that number.  Two common examples are &lt;math&gt; f(x)=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, which is undefined for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; f(x)=\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;, which is undefined (in the real number system) for negative&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.

==In trigonometry==
In trigonometry, &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sec \theta&lt;/math&gt; are undefined for all &lt;math&gt;\theta = 180^\circ(n - \frac{1}{2})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\cot \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\csc \theta&lt;/math&gt; are undefined for all &lt;math&gt;\theta = 180^\circ(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==In computer science==
===Notation using ↓ and ↑===
In [[computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]], if ''f'' is a [[partial function]] on ''S'' and ''a'' is an element of ''S'', then this is written as ''f''(''a'')↓ and is read as "''f''(''a'') is ''defined''." &lt;ref&gt;Enderton, Herbert B. ''Computability: An Introduction to Recursion Theory''. Elseveier, 2011, pp. 3-6, {{isbn|978-0-12-384958-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''a'' is not in the domain of ''f'', then this is written as ''f''(''a'')↑ and is read as "''f''(''a'') is ''undefined''".

==The symbols of infinity==
In [[analysis]], [[measure theory]], and other mathematical disciplines, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is frequently used to denote an infinite pseudo-number in real analysis, along with its negative, &lt;math&gt; -\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The symbol has no well-defined meaning by itself, but an expression like &lt;math&gt;\left\{a_n\right\}\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; is shorthand for a [[divergent sequence]], which at some point is eventually larger than any given real number.

Performing standard arithmetic operations with the symbols &lt;math&gt;\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; is undefined. Some extensions, though, define the following conventions of addition and multiplication:
* &lt;math&gt;x+\infty=\infty&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;-\infty+x=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;x\cdot\infty=\infty&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;.

No sensible extension of addition and multiplication with &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; exists in the following cases:
* &lt;math&gt;\infty-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;0\cdot\infty&lt;/math&gt; (although in [[measure theory]], this is often defined as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;

See [[extended real number line]] for more information.

==Singularities in complex analysis==

In [[complex analysis]], a point &lt;math&gt;z\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; where a [[holomorphic function]] is undefined is called a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]]. One distinguishes between [[removable singularity|removable singularities]] (the function can be extended holomorphically to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] (the function can be extended [[meromorphic function|meromorphically]] to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;), and [[essential singularity|essential singularities]], where no meromorphic extension to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; exists.

A world manifold is a four-dimensional [[orientability|orientable]] real [[smooth manifold]]. It is assumed to be a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and [[second-countable space|second countable]] [[topological space]]. Consequently, it is a [[locally compact space]] which is a union of a countable number of compact subsets, a [[separable space]], a [[paracompact space|paracompact]] and [[completely regular space]]. Being paracompact, a world manifold admits a partition of unity by smooth functions. It should be emphasized that paracompactness is an essential characteristic of a world manifold. It is necessary and sufficient in order that a world manifold admits a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] and necessary for the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric. A world manifold is assumed to be [[connected space|connected]]  and, consequently, it is [[connected space|arcwise connected]].

== Riemannian structure ==

The [[tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt; of a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the associated [[principal bundle|principal]] [[frame bundle]] &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; of linear tangent frames in &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt; possess a [[general linear group]] [[fiber bundle|structure group]]  &lt;math&gt;GL^+(4,\mathbb R) &lt;/math&gt;.  A world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[parallelizable manifold|parallelizable]] if the tangent bundle &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt; and, accordingly, the frame bundle &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; are trivial, i.e., there exists a global section (a [[frame fields in general relativity|frame field]]) of &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt;. It is essential that the tangent and associated bundles over a world manifold admit a [[atlas (topology)|bundle atlas]] of finite number of trivialization charts.

Tangent and frame bundles over a world manifold are [[general covariant transformations|natural bundles]] characterized by [[general covariant transformations]]. These transformations are [[gauge symmetry (mathematics)|gauge symmetries]] of gravitation theory on a world manifold.

By virtue of the well-known theorem on [[reduction of the structure group|structure group reduction]], a structure group &lt;math&gt;GL^+(4,\mathbb R) &lt;/math&gt; of a frame bundle &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; over a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is always reducible to its maximal compact subgroup &lt;math&gt;SO(4) &lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding global section of the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;FX/SO(4) &lt;/math&gt; is a Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt;g^R&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, a world manifold always admits a Riemannian metric which makes &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a [[metric space|metric topological space]].

== Lorentzian structure ==

In accordance with the [[equivalence principle (geometric)|geometric Equivalence Principle]], a world manifold possesses a [[G-structure|Lorentzian structure]], i.e., a structure group of a frame bundle &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; must be reduced to a [[Lorentz group]] &lt;math&gt;SO(1,3) &lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding global section of the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;FX/SO(1,3) &lt;/math&gt; is a pseudo-Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of signature &lt;math&gt;(+,---)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It is treated as a [[gravitational field]] in [[General Relativity]] and as a [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field]] in [[gauge gravitation theory]].

A Lorentzian structure need not exist. Therefore, a world manifold is assumed to satisfy a certain topological condition. It is either a noncompact topological space or a compact space with a zero [[Euler characteristic]]. Usually, one also requires that a world manifold admits a [[spinor structure]] in order to describe [[fermionic field|Dirac fermion fields]] in gravitation theory. There is the additional topological obstruction to the existence of this structure. In particular, a noncompact world manifold must be parallelizable.

== Space-time structure ==

If a structure group of a frame bundle &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; is reducible to a Lorentz group, the latter is always reducible to its maximal compact subgroup &lt;math&gt;SO(3) &lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, there is the commutative diagram

: &lt;math&gt;  GL(4,\mathbb R) \to  SO(4) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \downarrow \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \downarrow &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; SO(1,3) \to SO(3)&lt;/math&gt;

of the reduction of structure groups of a frame bundle &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; in
gravitation theory. This reduction diagram results in the following.

(i) In gravitation theory on a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, one can always choose an atlas of a frame bundle &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; (characterized by local frame fields &lt;math&gt;\{h^\lambda\}&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;SO(3) &lt;/math&gt;-valued transition functions. These transition functions preserve a time-like component &lt;math&gt;h_0=h^\mu_0 \partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt; of local frame fields which, therefore, is globally defined. It is a nowhere vanishing vector field on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Accordingly, the dual time-like covector field &lt;math&gt;h^0=h^0_\lambda dx^\lambda&lt;/math&gt; also is globally defined, and it yields a spatial [[distribution (differential geometry)|distribution]]
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak F\subset TX&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h^0\rfloor \mathfrak F=0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the tangent bundle &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt; of a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; admits a space-time decomposition
&lt;math&gt;TX=\mathfrak F\oplus T^0X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T^0X&lt;/math&gt; is a one-dimensional fibre bundle spanned by a time-like vector field &lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt;. This decomposition, is called the &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-compatible ''space-time structure''.  It makes a world manifold the [[spacetime|space-time]].

(ii)  Given the above-mentioned diagram of reduction of structure groups, let &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g^R&lt;/math&gt; be the corresponding
pseudo-Riemannian and Riemannian metrics on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. They form a triple &lt;math&gt; (g,g^R,h^0) &lt;/math&gt; obeying the relation

: &lt;math&gt;g=2h^0\otimes h^0 -g^R&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, let a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; admit a nowhere vanishing
one-form &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (or, equivalently, a nowhere vanishing vector
field). Then  any Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt;g^R&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; yields the
pseudo-Riemannian metric

: &lt;math&gt;g=\frac{2}{g^R(\sigma,\sigma)}\sigma\otimes \sigma -g^R&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows that a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; admits a pseudo-Riemannian
metric if and only if there exists a nowhere vanishing vector (or covector) field on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us note that a &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-compatible Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt;g^R&lt;/math&gt;   in a triple  &lt;math&gt; (g,g^R,h^0) &lt;/math&gt; defines a &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-compatible distance function on a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Such a function brings &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a metric space whose locally Euclidean topology is equivalent to a manifold topology on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Given a gravitational field &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-compatible Riemannian metrics and the corresponding distance
functions are different for different spatial distributions &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak F&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak F'&lt;/math&gt;.  It follows that physical observers associated  with
these different spatial distributions perceive a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as different Riemannian spaces. The well-known relativistic changes of sizes of moving bodies exemplify this phenomenon.

However, one attempts to derive a world topology directly from a space-time structure (a [[spacetime topology|path topology]], an [[spacetime topology|Alexandrov topology]]). If a space-time satisfies the [[causality conditions|strong causality condition]], such topologies coincide with a familiar manifold topology of a world manifold. In a general case, they however are rather extraordinary.

== Causality conditions ==

A space-time structure is called integrable if a spatial distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak F&lt;/math&gt;  is involutive. In this case, its integral manifolds constitute a spatial [[foliation]] of a world manifold whose leaves are spatial three-dimensional subspaces. A spatial foliation is called causal if no curve transversal to its leaves intersects each leave more than once. This condition is equivalent to the [[causality conditions|stable causality]] of [[Stephen Hawking]].  A space-time foliation is causal if and only if it is a foliation of level surfaces of some smooth real function on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; whose differential nowhere vanishes. Such a foliation is a [[fibred manifold]] &lt;math&gt;X\to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.
However, this is not the case of a compact world manifold which can not be
a fibred manifold over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

The stable causality does not provide the simplest causal structure. If a fibred manifold &lt;math&gt;X\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a fibre bundle, it is trivial, i.e., a world manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[globally hyperbolic manifold]] &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb R \times M&lt;/math&gt;. Since any oriented three-dimensional manifold is parallelizable, a globally
hyperbolic world manifold is parallelizable.
