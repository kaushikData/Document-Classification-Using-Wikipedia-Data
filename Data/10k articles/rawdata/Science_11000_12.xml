==Synopsis==
''A Contract with the Earth'' is, broadly, a [[manifesto]] that challenges those on the right to provide a strategy for repairing the planet &lt;ref name="MieszkowskiSalon" /&gt; and calls on government to embrace the concept that a healthy environment is required for a healthy [[democracy]] and [[economy]].&lt;ref name="MieszkowskiSalon" /&gt; This approach, alternately branded mainstream and [[entrepreneurial]] [[environmentalism]] by the authors,
&lt;ref name="PublishersWeekly"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Nonfiction Reviews: Week of 9/17/2007 |work=Publishers Weekly |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=2007-09-17 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6478174.html |accessdate=2008-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317071131/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6478174.html |archivedate=March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires that companies should lead the way in environmental issues while governments provide them with incentives to reduce their [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name="MieszkowskiSalon" /&gt;

With its 10 "commandments", ''A Contract with the Earth'' calls for politicians to abandon [[adversarial]] politics and for business and [[conservationists]] to form compatible partnerships. In one of the book's themes, Gingrich and Maple argue that environmental efforts shouldn't be exclusive to one political philosophy and reject the idea that [[free enterprise]] and a cleaner world are opposing forces.&lt;ref name="PublishersWeekly" /&gt;

The book generated a storm of media attention in late 2007 and early 2008 as the U.S. presidential campaign began to heat up. Gingrich in particular made numerous media appearances arguing that the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] was losing popular support because their response to environmental policy was simply, as he put it, "NO!" Maple toured the country as Gingrich's stand-in, most notably before the [[Republicans for Environmental Protection]] (REP, www.repamerica.org) during their annual meeting (at which [[John McCain]] was endorsed as the most "[[green energy|green]]" of the Republican presidential candidates). In 2008 Gingrich published another book that advocated [[oil drilling]], ''Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less'', and many pundits called his environmental commitment into question. However, this book's fifth chapter provided an argument for environmental protection. Like many aspects of Gingrich's career, his interest in environmental issues has generated controversy.

The book, whose title is similar to Gingrich's co-authored book ''[[Contract with America]]'',&lt;ref name="PublishersWeekly" /&gt; criticizes the [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]'s legislation and litigation on environmental protection issues.&lt;ref name="PublishersWeekly" /&gt;

==Authors==
Gingrich has been described by [[Katharine Mieszkowski]] as a "green conservative."&lt;ref name="MieszkowskiSalon"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mieszkowski |first=Katharine |title=Give Newt a chance |work=Salon.com |publisher=Salon Media Group |url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2007/11/10/gingrich/index.html |accessdate=2008-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515205515/http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2007/11/10/gingrich/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of House of Representatives]], and Maple is president and CEO of the [[Palm Beach Zoo]] and professor of conservation and behavior at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Wilson is a prize-winning conservation [[biology|biologist]] and author.

'''Archer Glacier''' ({{Coord|65|10|S|63|5|W|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] flowing northwest into the head of [[Bolson Cove]], [[Flandres Bay]], on the west coast of [[Graham Land]]. It was first charted by the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] under [[Adrien de Gerlache]], 1897&amp;ndash;99, and named by the [[United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] in 1960 for [[Frederick Scott Archer]], an [[England|English]] architect who in 1849 invented the wet [[collodion process]] of photography, the first practical process on glass.

The '''Comet Galaxy''', a [[spiral galaxy]] located 3.2 billion [[light-years]] from [[Earth]], in the galaxy cluster [[Abell 2667]], was found with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. This galaxy has slightly more mass than our [[Milky Way]]. It was detected on 2 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.11369.x | bibcode=2007MNRAS.376..157C | volume=376 | title=The strong transformation of spiral galaxies infalling into massive clusters atz≈ 0.2 | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages=157–172 | last1 = Cortese | first1 = L.|arxiv = astro-ph/0703012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
This unique spiral galaxy, which is situated 3.2 billion light-years from the Earth, has an extended stream of bright blue knots and diffuse wisps of young stars. It rushes at 3.5 million km/h through the [[Galaxy cluster|cluster]] [[Abell 2667]] and therefore, like a [[comet]], shows a [[Comet tail|tail]], with a length of 600,000 [[light-year]]s.

==Galaxy fate==

The Сomet Galaxy is currently being ripped to pieces, moving through a cluster at speeds of greater than 2 million mph.  As the galaxy speeds through, its gas and stars are being stripped away by the tidal forces exerted by the cluster - just as the tidal forces exerted by the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]] push and pull the Earth's [[ocean]]s. Also contributing to this destructive process is the pressure of the cluster's hot gas [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] reaching temperatures as high as 100 million degrees. Scientists estimate that the total duration of the transformation process is close to one billion years. What is seen now in the Hubble's image is roughly 200 million years into the process. Even though the Comet Galaxy’s mass is slightly greater than the Milky Way, it will lose all its gas and dust, and so not be able to generate stars later in life. It will become a gas-poor galaxy with an old population of red stars.

During the [[ram pressure]] stripping process, the [[charged particle]]s strip and push away the infalling galaxy’s gas, just as the solar wind of charged particles pushes [[ionized gas]] away from a comet to create a gas tail. For this reason the scientists have nicknamed the stretched spiral the "comet galaxy."

"This unique galaxy, situated 3.2 billion light-years from Earth, has an extended stream of bright blue knots and diffuse wisps of young stars driven away by the tidal forces and the ram pressure stripping' of the hot dense gas," said Jean-Paul Kneib, a study collaborator from the [[Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille]].

Even though its mass is slightly larger than that of the Milky Way, the spiral will inevitably lose all its gas and dust as well as its chance of generating new stars later, and become a gas-poor galaxy with an old population of red stars. The finding sheds light on the process by which gas-rich galaxies might evolve into gas-poor galaxies over billions of years. The new observations also reveal one mechanism for forming of “homeless” stars seen scattered throughout galaxy clusters.

The strong [[gravitational pull]] exerted by the galaxy cluster's collective mass has bent the light of other, more distant galaxies and distorted their shapes - an effect called [[gravitational lens]]ing. The giant bright banana-shaped arc seen just to the left of the cluster center corresponds to the [[magnification|magnified]] and [[distortion|distorted]] image of a distant galaxy located behind the cluster's core.

Examples include the 2:3 commensurability between the orbital periods of [[Neptune]] and [[Pluto]],&lt;ref name=Williams1971/&gt; the 3:4 commensurability between the orbital periods of the [[Saturn]]ian satellites [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]],&lt;ref name=Bevilacqua1980/&gt; the orbital periods associated with the [[Kirkwood gap]]s in the [[asteroid belt]] relative to that of [[Jupiter]],&lt;ref name=Moons1996/&gt; and the 2:1 commensurability between [[Gliese 876 b]] and [[Gliese 876 c]].

Commensurabilities are normally the result of an [[orbital resonance]], rather than being due to coincidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1366">The '''Committee on the Public Understanding of Science''' or '''Copus''' was founded in 1985 by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (BAAS), the [[Royal Institution]] and the [[Royal Society]]. Its aim was to interpret scientific advances and make them more accessible to non-scientists.

It played a part in developing the [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]] it establishing standards for communicating science and technology

The Copus Grant Schemes was set up in 1987 and the last round of grants was for 2003/4. The scheme was funded by the [[Office of Science and Technology]] and the [[Royal Society]]. 25 grants worth a total of over £750,000 were awarded in 2003/2004.

In 2000 The new Copus Council was formed to be a more inclusive partnership for science communication in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 following a report commissioned by the [[Office of Science and Technology]] the Copus Council was discontinued.

'''Empressite''' is a [[mineral]] form of [[silver telluride]], AgTe.
It is a rare, grey, orthorhombic mineral with which can form compact masses, rarely as bipyrimidal crystals.

Recent crystallographic analysis&lt;ref&gt;L. Bindi ''et al.'', American Mineralogist, '''89''', 1043 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; has confirmed that empressite is a distinct mineral with orthorhombic crystal structure, different from the hexagonal Ag&lt;sub&gt;5−x&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with which empressite has been commonly confused in mineralogy literature. 
At the same time, empressite does not appear on the equilibrium Ag-Te phase diagram,&lt;ref&gt;Karakaya, I., Thompson, W.T.: J. Phase Equilibria '''12''', 56 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore it is only [[Metastability in molecules|metastable]] at ambient conditions. Given infinite time, it would phase separate into pure Ag&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and pure Te.

The name empressite comes from the location of its discovery – the Empress Josephine mine, [[Saguache County, Colorado]], US. It was first described in 1914.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

'''Exformation''' (originally spelled ''eksformation'' in Danish) is a term coined by Danish science writer [[Tor Nørretranders]] in his book ''[[The User Illusion (book)|The User Illusion]]'' published in English 1998. It is meant to mean ''explicitly discarded information''. However, the term also has other meanings related to [[information]], for instance "useful and relevant information"&lt;ref&gt;http://foxhugh.wordpress.com/reference-fiction/science-fiction-dictionary/{{rs|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a specific kind of [[information explosion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanislaw Lem]]: ''[http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/2/2108/1.html Exformation]. ''Telepolis'' 1997-01-30 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

Consider the following phrase: "the best horse at the race is number 7". The information carried is very small, if considered from the point of view of [[information theory]]: just a few words. However let's assume that this phrase was spoken by a knowledgeable person, after a complex study of all the horses in the race, to someone interested in betting. The details are discarded, but the receiver of the information might get the same practical value of a complete analysis.

== Meaning as proposed by Nørretranders ==

Effective [[communication]] depends on a shared body of [[knowledge]] between the persons communicating. In using words, sounds, and gestures, the speaker has deliberately thrown away a huge body of [[information]], though it remains implied. This shared context is called exformation.

Exformation is everything we do not actually say but have in our heads when, or before, we say anything at all - whereas information is the measurable, demonstrable utterance we actually come out with.

If someone is talking about computers, what is said will have more meaning if the person listening has some prior idea what a computer is, what it is good for, and in what contexts one might encounter one. From the information content of a message alone, there is no way of measuring how much exformation it contains.

In 1862 the author [[Victor Hugo]] wrote to his publisher asking how his most recent book, ''[[Les Misérables]]'', was getting on. Hugo just wrote "?" in his message, to which his publisher replied "!", to indicate it was selling well. This exchange of messages would have no meaning to a third party because the shared context is unique to those taking part in it.  The amount of information (a single character) was extremely small, and yet because of exformation a meaning is clearly conveyed.

Thought, argues Nørretranders, is in fact a process of chucking away information, and it is this detritus (happily labelled exformation) that is crucially involved in automatic behaviours of expertise (riding a bicycle, playing the piano), and which is therefore the most precious to us as people.|''The Guardian'', September 1998}}

A '''floodgate effect''' is situation in which a small action can result in a far greater effect with no easily discernible limit.  The original [[analogy]] is that of a [[floodgate]], which once opened, no matter how minutely, will allow water to flow from either side through the gate until both sides are balanced up.  It may also be used to refer to the effect where, once a floodgate has been opened, water will gush out in a torrent through the gate, making it easier to continue to open the gate, but harder to close it.

The term is commonly used to illustrate a situation where a precedent will set the stage for repeated performances, the number of which is hard to control. Such an example can be illustrated as follows:

''The setting up of a [[redlight district]] here will create a floodgate effect, causing redlight districts to be set up elsewhere.''

It is especially useful for solving problems involving [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] or contact discontinuities. An FCT algorithm consists of two stages, a transport stage and a flux-corrected anti-diffusion stage. The numerical errors introduced in the first stage (i.e., the transport stage) are corrected in the anti-diffusion stage.

== Mission concept and history ==
''GOLD'' is intended to perform a two-year mission imaging Earth's [[thermosphere]] and [[ionosphere]] from [[geostationary orbit]]. ''GOLD'' is a two-channel [[far-ultraviolet]] (FUV) imaging [[spectrograph]] built by the [[Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics]] at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] and flown as a hosted payload on the commercial communications satellite [[SES-14]].&lt;ref name=UCF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.ucf.edu/55-million-grant-makes-ucf-florida-history/ |title=$55 Million Grant Makes UCF, Florida History |publisher=[[University of Central Florida]] |first=Chad |last=Binette |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional organizations participating in the ''GOLD'' mission include the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], [[Virginia Tech]], the [[University of California Berkeley]], the [[University of Central Florida]], Computational Physics Inc., the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], the [[U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]], [[Boston University]], and [[Clemson University]].

In June 2017, [[SES S.A.|SES]] announced the successful integration of ''GOLD'' with the SES-14 satellite under construction at [[Airbus Defence and Space]] in [[Toulouse]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.ses.com/press-release/ses-14-integrates-nasa-ultraviolet-space-spectrograph |title=SES-14 Integrates NASA Ultraviolet Space Spectrograph |publisher=SES |first1=Markus |last1=Payer |first2=Natalia |last2=Kossobokova |date=23 May 2017 |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GOLD'' was launched on 25 January 2018 at 22:20&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]] aboard [[Ariane 5 flight VA241]] from the [[Guiana Space Centre]].&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/01/26/ariane-5-va241-status-1/ |title=Ariane 5 deploys two telecom satellites in orbit despite telemetry loss |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=26 January 2018 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific Objectives ==
The scientific objectives of the ''GOLD'' mission are to determine how geomagnetic storms alter the temperature and composition of Earth’s atmosphere, to analyze the global-scale response of the thermosphere to solar extreme-ultraviolet variability, to investigate the significance of atmospheric waves and tides propagating from below the temperature structure of the thermosphere and to resolve how the structure of the equatorial ionosphere influences the formation and evolution of equatorial plasma density irregularities.
The viewpoint provided by ''GOLD''’s geostationary orbit – from which the same hemisphere is always observable – is a new perspective on the Earth’s upper atmosphere. This viewpoint allows local time, universal time and longitudinal variations of the thermosphere and ionosphere's response to the various forcing mechanisms to be uniquely determined.&lt;ref name=EOS /&gt;

It was developed by [[Eugene Garfield]], the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information and the inventor of important information retrieval tools such as ''[[Current Contents]]'' and the ''[[Science Citation Index]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 21 July 2008 from http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Purpose==
The main purpose of the software is to make it easier for individuals to perform bibliometric analysis and visualization tasks. [[Bibliometrics|Bibliometric]] analysis is the use of the bibliographic information (titles, authors, dates, author addresses, references, etc.) that describe published items to measure and otherwise study various aspects of a specific field of scholarly endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Apriliyanti, I.D., Alon, I.

HistComp: bibliographic analysis and visualization of the “Biological Bulletin.” In: Anderson KL, editor. Every continent, every ocean. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the [[International Association of the Aquatic and Marine Science Libraries and Information Centers (IAMSLIC)]]; 2006 Oct 8–12; Portland, OR.

Lib Q. 2006;76(1):10-18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some typical questions asked by bibliometricians that can be answered by HistCite analysis are:

# How much literature has been published in this field? When and in what countries has it been published? What countries are the major contributors to this field? What are the languages most frequently used by the items published in this field?
# What journals cover the literature of the field? Which are the most important?
# Who are the key authors in this field? What institutions do these authors represent?
# Which articles are the most important?
# How have the various contributors to the field influenced each other?

The answers to such questions are valuable to researchers, librarians, and administrators.

[[Visualization (computer graphics)|Information visualization]] is the transformation of non-numerical data into a graphic format. Visualization helps various researchers and scholars understand large collections of information. Although there are numerous uses for information visualization, HistCite performs one specific application: it converts bibliographies into diagrams called historiographs. 

A historiograph is a time-based network diagram of the papers in a bibliography and their citation relationships to each other. Historiographs are based on the citation relationships between the papers in a bibliography. In a historiograph, each paper in the bibliography is represented by a symbol selected by the user. The symbols are arranged over a timeline of the publication dates of the papers. By changing the time frame of the analysis, the resulting historiograph can form a snapshot of a specific period or an in-depth look at the total history of a subject. Once a historiograph is created for a bibliography, it is easier to see and understand the subject’s key publication events, their chronology, and their relative influence.

==Applications==
A wide variety of professionals who need to analyze the published literature use HistCite for analysis, for example: researchers, historians, journal editors, librarians and patent lawyers.

==Operation==
In order to perform its functions, HistCite must import a bibliography from another source. Once the bibliography is imported, basic point-and-click commands initiate the various analyses and visualizations. 

HistCite is currently set up to import bibliographies created by searches of the Web of Science database offered by Thomson-Reuters Scientific. Bibliographies from other sources can be manually entered into HistCite.

The bibliography the user feeds to HistCite represents the literature of the subject area as it is defined by that user’s unique perspective. Thus, the analyses and visualizations produced by HistCite from that bibliography are one-of-a-kind. 
 
HistCite operates on Windows computers with Internet Explorer.

'''Jonathan B. Spira''' (born 1961) is a [[researcher]] and [[industry analyst]] known for his work in the area of collaboration and knowledge sharing and the problem of [[information overload]].

==Early life==
Spira was born in New York and grew up in [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]], the son of photographic pioneer [[:de:Fred Spira|Fred Spira]] and his wife Marilyn (née Hacker). He studied Central European History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] where he was a member of the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity &lt;ref&gt;2011 Pi Lambda Phi Membership Guide&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted his graduate studies at the [[University of Munich]] (Ludwig-Maximilians Universität)

==Career==
Spira began his career in business and technology while still in high school when he became involved in the management of office systems at [[Spiratone]], a company founded and run by [[:de:Fred Spira|Fred Spira]].  After completing his studies in 1983, he founded a research and IT advisory firm, [[Basex]] (originally called The Basex Group) in 1983, that focused on helping organizations understand how [[knowledge worker]]s work and what they can do to manage them more effectively.  He has been associated with the firm ever since. Though some may consider that significant, Spira's career has not had sufficient enough impact to meet Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Notability_(people)|notability guidelines]],and this page, which is arguably the most tangible evidence of his impact, will likely be deleted or merged.

==Research==
Spira's research focuses on the problems organizations are having as they migrate from the industrial age to the [[knowledge economy]] and what managers can do to remain competitive.  According to Knowledge Management in the Public Sector,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSc102GMZ9cC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22jonathan+spira%22&amp;hl=en Knowledge Management in the Public Sector]&lt;/ref&gt; the main thrust of Spira's arguments is that software companies should develop new systems that are designed from the beginning for knowledge and information work but collaboration and knowledge sharing are "less a question of technology than of systems that facilitate people working together."

Spira started researching the problem of information overload in the early 1990s and was interviewed in March 1993 by [[CNBC]] on the topic.  In 2003, he published research that assigned specific costs to components of the problem of information overload and in 2008 published an estimate &lt;ref&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/read-this-and-cost-your-company-dough/?scp=1&amp;sq=%24900%20billion%20and%20basex&amp;st=cse New York Times: Read This and Cost Your Company Dough]&lt;/ref&gt; of the cost of information overload to the U.S. economy ($900 billion per annum).  In 2008, he helped found the [http://www.iorgforum.org Information Overload Research Group], a business and academic consortium that is working to bring attention to the problem and potential solutions.

==Books and publications==
Spira is the author of [https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470879602/vbbooks Overload! How Too Much Information Is Bad For Your Organization], published by Wiley in 2011.  He is also the co-author of [https://web.archive.org/web/20110210031421/http://spiracollection.com/spira/home.nsf/Home?Open The History of Photography] (Aperture, 2001), named a "best book of the year" by the New York Times &lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D7153AF931A35751C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=history%20of%20photography%20and%20spira%20collection&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=4 New York Times Best Books of the Year: Photography]&lt;/ref&gt; when it came out.  He is the author of Managing the Knowledge Workforce: Understanding the Information Revolution That's Changing the Business World (Mercury Business Press, 2005).  He has also written several major reports on [[information overload]] including Information Overload: We Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us.  He is regularly quoted by publications including the [[New York Times]], [[Wall Street Journal]], the [[Financial Times]], [[Business Week]], among others.

'''Jonny Holmstrom''' is a Swedish professor of [[Informatics]] at [[Umeå University]]&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umu.se/sok/english/staff-directory?languageId=1&amp;uid=joho0002|title=Faculty directory at Umeå university|date=|accessdate=September 28, 2015|publisher=Umeå university}}&lt;/ref&gt; and director and co-founder of Swedish Center for Digital Innovation.

==Biography==
Holmstrom was born in [[Arvidsjaur]] in 1968. He received his Ph.D. from [[Umeå University]] in 2000, and has been a visiting scholar at [[Georgia State University]] and [[Florida International University]].{{cn|date=October 2017}} Holmstrom is a senior editor at Information and Organization&lt;ref name="Information and Organization"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-organization/editorial-board/|title=Information and Organization editorial board|date=|accessdate=September 28, 2015|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serves at the editorial boards for [[European Journal of Information Systems]]&lt;ref name=EJIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ejis/about.html#Editors|title=EJIS editorial board|date=|accessdate=September 28, 2015|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Communications of the AIS.&lt;ref name=CAIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/editorialboard.html|title=CAIS editorial board|date=|accessdate=September 28, 2015|publisher=AIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmstrom has written 2 books and has published over 100 scholarly articles in professional journals and edited volumes. 

==Career==
Holmstrom is a professor of Informatics at Umeå University and director and co-founder of the Swedish Center for Digital Innovation. His work has appeared in journals including Communications of the AIS, Convergence, Design Issues, European Journal of Information Systems, Industrial Management and Data Systems, Information and Organization, Information Resources Management Journal, Information Systems Journal, Information Technology and People, Journal of the AIS, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, Research Policy, and The Information Society.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

===IT and Organizational Change===
Holmstrom’s early work examined the interaction between information technology and organizations. Prior research often assumed information technology to be either an objective, external force with deterministic impacts on organizations, or the outcome of social action. Holmstrom’s research suggested that either view is incomplete, and he proposed to take both perspectives into account. Drawing from actor-network theory as analytical lens, Holmstrom has explored the role of IT in contexts such as municipal organizations, airports, and digital cash projects. In these studies, Holmstrom stressed the notion of non-human agency in which processes, technological tools and other similar concepts can be viewed as non-human actors that acquire an identity of their own.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

===Digital Innovation===
In more recent{{when?|date=October 2017}} research, Holmstrom has addressed digital innovation and digital transformation, specifically how organizations are dealing with “the digitization of everything” as a challenge and an opportunity. To deal with digital transformation, Holmstrom argues that organizations need to develop a comprehensive digital strategy. Holmstrom’s research addresses how digital capabilities increasingly determines which companies create or lose value. Among these studies we find studies of firms in the mining industry, the paper and pulp industry, and the publishing industry. He also published a [[Harvard Business School]] case focusing on the ways in which digitization brings challenges as well as opportunities to firms in the publishing industry.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

===Awards===
Holmstrom was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship by the STINT Foundation (The Swedish Foundation for International Co-operation in Research and Higher Education) for post-doctoral research at Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA in 2000/2001.{{cn|date=October 2017}} He was also awarded a fellowship by the STINT Foundation to enable a visiting research position at Decision Sciences and Information Systems Department, College of Business Administration, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA, in 2004.

'''Liroconite''' is a complex mineral: Hydrated copper aluminium arsenate hydroxide, with the formula [[copper|Cu]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Aluminium|Al]][(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|[[Arsenic|As]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·4(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). It is a vitreous [[monoclinic]] mineral, colored bright blue to green, often associated with [[malachite]], [[azurite]], [[olivenite]], and [[clinoclase]]. It is quite soft, with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 2 - 2.5, and has a [[specific gravity]] of 2.9 - 3.0.
[[File:Liroconite-Clinoclase-120699.jpg|thumb|left|Vugs in [[gossan]] lined with lustrous, blue-green liroconite blades and sparkly, dark blue [[clinoclase]] microcrystals from Wheal Gorland (size: 3.4 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm)]]
It was first identified in 1825 in the tin and copper mines of Devon and [[Cornwall, England]]. Although it remains quite rare it has subsequently been identified in a variety of locations including [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Australia]], [[New Jersey]] and [[California]].&lt;ref name=mindat/&gt;

The [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] for Liroconite is [[Wheal Gorland]] in [[St Day]], [[Cornwall]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=mindat/&gt;

It occurs as a secondary mineral in copper deposits in association with [[olivenite]], [[chalcophyllite]], [[clinoclase]], [[cornwallite]], [[strashimirite]], [[malachite]], [[cuprite]] and [[limonite]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

{{Main|Vacuum tube computer}}
'''Vacuum tube computers''', now termed ''' first generation computers''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hsu|first1=John Y.|title=Computer Architecture: Software Aspects, Coding, and Hardware|date=December 21, 2017|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=142004110X|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUe2ackElHEC|accessdate=Dec 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are programmable digital computers using [[vacuum tube]] logic circuitry.
They were preceded by systems using electromechanical [[relay]]s and followed by systems built from discrete [[transistor]]s.  Later entries in this list may have been built using transistors in addition to vacuum tubes.

This is a '''list of vacuum tube computers''', arranged by date put into service:

'''Lumpers''' and '''splitters''' are opposing factions in any [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] that has to [[Categorization|place individual examples into rigorously defined categories]]. The lumper-splitter problem occurs when there is the need to create classifications and assign examples to them, for example schools of [[literature]], [[biology|biological]] [[taxon|taxa]] and so on. A "lumper" is an individual who takes a [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] view of a definition, and assigns examples broadly, assuming that differences are not as important as signature similarities. A "splitter" is an individual who takes precise definitions, and creates new categories to classify samples that differ in key ways.

==Origin of the terms==
The earliest known use of these terms was by [[Charles Darwin]], in a letter to [[J. D. Hooker]] in 1857 ("It is good to have hair-splitters &amp; lumpers."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | last=Darwin | first=Charles | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project | title=Letter no. 2130 | date=1 August 1857 | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/DCP-LETT-2130 | accessdate=10 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) They were introduced more widely by [[George G. Simpson]] in his 1945 work ''The Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals''. As he put it, "splitters make very small units – their critics say that if they can tell two animals apart, they place them in different genera ... and if they cannot tell them apart, they place them in different species. ... Lumpers make large units – their critics say that if a [[Carnivora|carnivore]] is neither a dog nor a bear, they call it a cat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=George G.|title=The Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals|journal=Bulletin of the AMNH|volume=85|page=23|year=1945|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early use can be found in the title of a 1969 paper by the medical geneticist [[Victor McKusick]]: "On lumpers and splitters, or the nosology of genetic disease".&lt;ref&gt;McKusick VA. On lumpers and splitters, or the nosology of genetic disease. Perspect Biol Med. 1969 Winter;12(2):298-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference to lumpers and splitters also appeared in a debate in 1975 between [[J. H. Hexter]] and [[John Edward Christopher Hill|Christopher Hill]], in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''. It followed from Hexter's detailed review of Hill's book ''Change and Continuity in Seventeenth Century England'', in which Hill developed [[Max Weber]]'s argument that the rise of capitalism was facilitated by [[Calvinist]] Puritanism. Hexter objected to Hill's "mining" of sources to find evidence that supported his theories. Hexter argued that Hill plucked quotations from sources in a way that distorted their meaning. Hexter explained this as a mental habit that he called "lumping". According to him, lumpers rejected differences and chose to emphasize similarities. Any evidence that did not fit their arguments was ignored as aberrant. Splitters, by contrast, emphasised differences, and resisted simple schemes. While lumpers consistently tried to create coherent patterns, splitters preferred incoherent complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chase|first=Bob|title=Upstart Antichrist|journal=History Workshop Journal|issue=60|date=Autumn 2005|pages=202–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in various fields==

===Biology===
{{anchor|Lumping and splitting in biology}}
{{main|Biological classification}}
The categorization and naming of a particular species should be regarded as a ''hypothesis'' about the [[evolution]]ary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms. As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be confirmed or refuted. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual [[organism]]s later identified as the same species. When two named species are agreed to be of the same species, the older species name is almost always retained dropping the newer species name honoring a convention known as "priority of nomenclature".  This form of lumping is technically called synonymization. Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxa is called splitting. Taxonomists are often referred to as "lumpers" or "splitters" by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognizing differences or commonalities between organisms.

=== History ===
{{main|Periodization}}

In history, lumpers are those who tend to create broad definitions that cover large periods of time and many disciplines, whereas splitters want to assign names to tight groups of inter-relationships. Lumping tends to create a more and more unwieldy definition, with members having less and less mutually in common. This can lead to definitions which are little more than conventionalities, or groups which join fundamentally different examples. Splitting often leads to "[[Distinction without a difference|distinctions without difference]]", ornate and fussy categories, and failure to see underlying similarities.

For example, in the arts, "[[Romanticism|Romantic]]" can refer specifically to a period of [[Germany|German]] poetry roughly from 1780–1810, but would exclude the later work of [[Goethe]], among other writers. In music it can mean every composer from [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]] through [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], plus many that came after.

=== Software modelling ===
[[Software engineering]] often proceeds by building models (sometimes known as [[model-driven architecture]]). A lumper is keen to generalize, and produces models with a small number of broadly defined objects. A splitter is reluctant to generalize, and produces models with a large number of narrowly defined objects. Conversion between the two styles is not necessarily symmetrical. For example, if error messages in two narrowly defined classes behave in the same way, the classes can be easily combined. But if some messages in a broad class behave differently, every object in the class must be examined before the class can be split. This illustrates the principle that "splits can be lumped more easily than lumps can be split".&lt;ref name=Pugh2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pugh|first1=Ken|title=Prefactoring|date=2005|publisher=O'Reilly Media|pages=14–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nykB7qerJYC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language classification ===
{{main|Language family}}

There is no agreement among [[Historical linguistics|historical linguists]] about what amount of evidence is needed for two languages to be safely classified in the same [[language family]]. For this reason, many language families have had lumper–splitter controversies, including [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]], [[Nilo-Saharan]], and most of the larger [[Classification schemes for indigenous languages of the Americas|families of the Americas]]. At a completely different level, the splitting of a [[mutually intelligible]] [[dialect continuum]] into different languages, or lumping them into one, is also an issue that continually comes up, though the consensus in contemporary linguistics is that there is no completely objective way to settle the question.

Splitters regard the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] (meaning not comparison in general, but only reconstruction of a common ancestor or [[protolanguage]]) as the only valid proof of kinship, and consider [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] relatedness to be the question of interest. American linguists of recent decades tend to be splitters.

Lumpers are more willing to admit techniques like [[mass lexical comparison]] or [[lexicostatistics]], and mass typological comparison, and to tolerate the uncertainty of whether relationships found by these methods are the result of [[linguistic divergence]] (descent from common ancestor) or [[language convergence]] (borrowing). Much long-range comparison work has been from Russian linguists like [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Sergei Starostin]]. In the US, [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]]'s and [[Merritt Ruhlen|Ruhlen]]'s work has been met with little acceptance from linguists. Earlier American linguists like [[Morris Swadesh]] and [[Edward Sapir]] also pursued large-scale classifications like [[Classification schemes for indigenous languages of the Americas#Sapir .281929.29: Encyclop.C3.A6dia Britannica|Sapir's 1929 scheme for the Americas]], accompanied by controversy similar to that today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nostratic.ru/books/(137)ruhlen12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810014839/http://www.nostratic.ru/books/(137)ruhlen12.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }} [[Merritt Ruhlen]]: Is Algonquian Amerind?&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liturgical studies ===
[[Paul F. Bradshaw]] suggests that the same principles of lumping and splitting apply to the study of early Christian [[liturgy]]. Lumpers, who tend to predominate, try to find a single line of texts from the apostolic age to the fourth century (and later). Splitters see many parallel and overlapping strands which intermingle and flow apart so that there is not a single coherent path in development of liturgical texts. Liturgical texts must not be taken solely at face value; often there are hidden agendas in texts.&lt;ref name="bradshaw"&gt;Bradshaw, Paul F., ''The Search for the Origins of Christian Worship'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. ix. {{ISBN|0-19-521732-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu religion is essentially a lumper's concept, sometimes also known as [[Smartism]].  Hindu splitters, and individual adherents, often identify themselves as adherents of a religion such as [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]], or [[Shaktism]] according to which deity they believe to be the supreme creator of the universe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Philosophy===
[[Freeman Dyson]] has suggested that "observers of the philosophical scene" can be broadly, if over-simplistically, divided into splitters and lumpers, roughly corresponding to [[materialists]], who imagine the world as divided into atoms, and [[Platonists]], who regard the world as made up of ideas.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''Mausumi Dikpati''' is a [[scientist]] at the [[High Altitude Observatory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://staff.ucar.edu/users/dikpati|title=Staff Directory, NCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; operated by the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]].

== Career ==
In March 2006, she was the first person to predict the strength and timing of the next [[solar cycle]] based on [[simulation]]s of the [[physics]] of the [[Sun|solar interior]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ucar.edu/news/releases/2006/sunspot.shtml |title=Scientists Issue Unprecedented Forecast of Next Sunspot Cycle |work=ucar.edu |date=2006 |accessdate=2006-02-03|ref=pressnews2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt; During 2006-2007 Mausumi Dikpati issued three predictions for solar cycle 24 -- (i) a delayed onset of solar cycle 24 which would start in late 2008 instead of 2006, (ii) a strong solar cycle 24 whose peak would be 30%-50% stronger than the previous cycle ('Cycle 23'), and (iii) the solar cycle in southern hemisphere would be stronger than that in the northern hemisphere of the Sun. Two of these three predictions, (i) and (iii) have been validated. Her research paper explaining the cause of delayed onset of solar cycle 24 was one of the top 100 discoveries in the Discover Magazine &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/43 |title=Plasma Rivers Explain the Quiet Sun }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Currently she is intensely involved in improving her solar dynamo model for building a more accurate dynamo-based solar cycle prediction tool which can assimilate solar magnetic fields and flow data in a sophisticated way as used in oceanic and atmospheric predictions, such as El Nino.

[[File:MemoryFoam-fast.jpg|thumb|Memory foam]]'''Memory foam''' consists mainly of [[polyurethane]] as well as additional chemicals increasing its [[viscosity]] and [[density]]. It is often referred to as "[[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]]" polyurethane foam, or low-resilience polyurethane foam ([[LRPu]]). The foam bubbles or ‘cells’ are open, effectively creating a matrix through which air can move. Higher-density memory foam softens in reaction to body heat, allowing it to mold to a warm body in a few minutes. Newer foams may recover more quickly to their original shape.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles, Barbara. "[http://www.healthyfoundations.com/blog/?p=842 Exhibitors emphasize value pricing in Vegas Foam trends, adjustables and top-of-bed also make news] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201174051/http://www.healthyfoundations.com/blog/?p=842 |date=2014-02-01 }}."

== History ==
[[File:MemoryFoam-slow.jpg|thumb|Memory foam with a slower springback than the foam above. Note characteristic [[Polyurethane#Effects of visible light|polyurethane yellowing caused by light exposure]].]]
Memory foam was developed in 1966 under a contract by NASA's Ames Research Center to improve the safety of aircraft cushions. The temperature-sensitive memory foam was initially referred to as "slow spring back foam"; Yost called it "temper foam".&lt;ref name=spinoff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2005/ch_6.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320071931/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2005/ch_6.html|title=spinoff 2005-Forty-Year-Old Foam Springs Back With New Benefits|archivedate=20 March 2009|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by feeding gas into a polymer matrix, the foam has an open-cell solid structure that matches pressure against it, yet slowly springs back to its original shape.&lt;ref name=cosmosmag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthyfoundations.com/blog/?p=848|title="Eight spin-offs from space" Article from Cosmos Magazine|work=The Healthy Foundations Blog|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201174813/http://www.healthyfoundations.com/blog/?p=848|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later commercialisation of the foam included use in both medical equipment such as X-ray table pads and sports equipment such as [[Football helmet|American / Canadian football helmet]] liners.

When NASA released memory foam to the public domain in the early 1980s, [[Fagerdala World Foams]] was one of the few companies willing to work with the foam, as the manufacturing process remained difficult and unreliable. Their 1991 product, the "[[Tempur-Pedic]] Swedish Mattress" eventually led to the mattress and cushion company, Tempur World.

Memory foam was subsequently used in medical settings. For example, it was commonly used in cases where the patient was required to lie immobile in their bed on a firm mattress for an unhealthy period of time. The pressure on some of their body regions impaired the blood flow to the region, causing [[pressure sore]]s or [[gangrene]]. Memory foam mattresses significantly decreased such events.&lt;ref name=spinoff/&gt; Claims have also been made that memory foam reduces the severity of pain associated with fibromyalgia.

Memory foam was initially too expensive for widespread use,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} but became cheaper. Its most common domestic uses are mattresses, pillows, shoes and blankets. It has medical uses, such as wheelchair seat cushions, hospital bed pillows and padding for people suffering long-term pain or postural problems; for example, a memory foam cervical pillow may alleviate chronic neck pain. Its heat-retaining properties may help some pain sufferers who find the added warmth helps to decrease the pain.

The heat-retaining properties can also be a disadvantage when used in mattresses and pillows so in the second generation memory foam, companies began using open cell structure to improve breathability. In 2006, the third generation of memory foam was introduced. Gel visco or gel memory foam consists of gel particles fused with visco foam to reduce trapped body heat, speed up spring back time and help the mattress feel softer. This technology was originally developed and patented by Peterson Chemical Technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Bruce W|title=Mr.|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/20130296449|work=Polyurethane Gel-Like Polymers, Methods and Use in Flexible Foams|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419013634/http://patents.justia.com/patent/20130296449|archivedate=2014-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gel mattresses became popular with the release of Serta's iComfort line and Simmons' Beautyrest line in 2011. Gel-infused memory foam was next developed with what were described as "beads" containing the gel which, as a [[phase-change material]], would achieve the desired temperature stabilization or cooling effect by changing from a solid to a liquid "state" within the capsule. Changing physical states can significantly alter the heat absorption properties of an element, which is why the technology was applied to memory foam.

Since the development of gel memory foam, other materials have been added. [[Aloe vera]], [[green tea extract]] and [[activated charcoal]] have been combined with the foam to reduce odors and even provide [[aromatherapy]] while sleeping. [[Rayon]] has been used in woven mattress covers over memory foam beds to wick moisture away from the body to increase comfort. Phase-change materials (PCMs) have also been used in the covers that are used on memory foam pillows, beds, and mattress pads.

== Mattresses ==

A memory foam mattress is usually denser than other foam mattresses, making it both more supportive and heavier. Memory foam mattresses are often sold for higher prices than traditional mattresses. Memory foam used in mattresses is commonly manufactured in densities ranging from less than 1.5&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 8&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; density.

The property of firmness (hard to soft) of memory foam is used in determining comfort. Firmness is measured by a foam's [[indentation force deflection]] (IFD) rating. However, it is not a complete measurement of a "soft" or "firm" ''feel''. A foam of higher IFD but lower density can feel soft when compressed.

IFD measures the force (in [[pounds-force]]) required to make a dent 1 inch into a foam sample 15" x 15" x 4" by an 8-inch-diameter (50 sq in) disc—known as IFD @ 25% compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfa.org/jifsg/jifsgs1.html|title=Polyurethane Foam Association|work=pfa.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104200333/http://www.pfa.org/jifsg/jifsgs1.html|archivedate=2010-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFD ratings for memory foams range between super soft (IFD 10) and semi-rigid (IFD 12). Most memory foam mattresses are firm (IFD 12 to IFD 16).

Some {{according to whom|date=June 2011}} report that IFD is a poor way to measure softness of memory foam, and that foam density as a measure of quality is more important, but not always true. Foam density of 5 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] per cubic foot (80&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or greater is considered high quality, although most standard memory foam has a density of 1 to 5&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (16–80&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Most bedding, such as topper pads and comfort layers in mattresses is 3 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Very high densities such as 5.3&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (85&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are used infrequently in mattresses.

The new second and third generation memory foams have an open-cell structure that reacts to body heat and weight by 'molding' to the sleeper's body, helping relieve pressure points, preventing pressure sores, etc. Most memory foam has the same basic chemical composition, however the density and layer thickness of the foam makes different mattresses feel very different. A high-density mattress will have better compression ratings over the life of the bedding. A lower-density one will have slightly shorter life due to the compression that takes place after repeated use.

== Hazards ==
Emissions from memory foam mattresses may directly cause more respiratory irritation than other mattresses. {{medcn|date=March 2017}} Memory foam, like other [[polyurethane]] products, can be combustible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Memory-Foam Bedding a Fire Risk?|url = http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/institute/a18314/gel-infused-memory-foam-bedding/|accessdate = 2015-09-09|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150726055036/http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/institute/a18314/gel-infused-memory-foam-bedding/|archivedate = 2015-07-26|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws in several jurisdictions have been enacted to require that all bedding, including memory foam items, be resistant to ignition from an open flame such as a candle or cigarette lighter.

Methylene chloride makes up over 98 percent of the total HAP emissions from this industry. Short-term exposure to high concentrations of [[methylene chloride]] also irritates the nose and throat. The effects of chronic (long-term) exposure to methylene chloride in humans involve the central nervous system, and include headaches, dizziness, nausea, and memory loss. Animal studies indicate that inhalation of methylene chloride affects the liver, kidney, and cardiovascular system.

The '''Mobile Launcher Platform''' ('''MLP''') is one of three two-story steel structures used by [[NASA]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] to support the [[Space Shuttle]] stack throughout the build-up and launch process: during assembly at the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB), while being transported to [[Launch Complex 39|Launch Pads 39A and B]], and as the vehicle's launch platform. NASA's three MLPs were originally constructed for the [[Apollo program]] to launch the [[Saturn V]] rockets in the 1960s and 1970s, and remained in service through the end of the shuttle program in 2011 with alterations. The [[Space Launch System]] rocket will be mounted atop a renovated platform.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Apollo ==
[[File:Ap11-KSC-69PC-241HR.jpg|thumb|upright|The Saturn V "stack" for Apollo 11 on ML-1 (MLP-3) and a [[crawler-transporter]] ]]

The MLP was constructed for transporting and launching the [[Saturn V]] rocket for the [[Apollo program]] lunar landing missions of the 1960s and 1970s.  Each MLP originally had a single exhaust vent for the Saturn V's engines.  The MLPs also featured a {{convert|380|ft|m|order=flip|sp=us|adj=on}} Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) with nine arms that permitted servicing of the vehicle on the launch pad, and swung away from it at launch. After the Apollo test program, [[Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 37]] was decommissioned and launches of the [[Saturn IB]] rocket were moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]]B for the [[Skylab]] and [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project|Apollo-Soyuz]] programs. MLP No. 1 was therefore modified to add a {{convert|140|ft|m|order=flip|sp=us|adj=on}} four-legged pedestal (nicknamed "the milkstool" because of its resemblance to the stool used by farmers when milking cows by hand) for the shorter Saturn IB to stand on. This allowed use of the Saturn V tower and service arms for the Saturn IB, and Saturn V Ground Support Equipment (GSE) was removed or de-activated and Saturn IB GSE equipment was installed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Space Shuttle ==
[[File:STS-79 rollout.jpg|thumb|left|upright|{{OV|Atlantis}} atop a Mobile Launcher Platform]]

After the Apollo program, the launcher platforms were modified for the [[Space Shuttle]] (Space Transport System). The umbilical towers from Mobile Launchers 2 and 3 were removed.  Portions of these tower structures were erected at the two launch pads, 39A and 39B.  These permanent structures are now known as the [[Service structure#Kennedy Space Center|Fixed Service Structures]] (FSS).  The umbilical tower from Mobile Launcher 1 (which was the platform used for the most significant Apollo missions) was taken apart and stored in the Kennedy Space Center's industrial area. Efforts to preserve it in the 1990s failed, however, for lack of funding and it was scrapped.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In addition to removal of the umbilical towers, each Shuttle-era MLP was extensively reconfigured with the addition of two Tail Service Masts, one on either side of the Main Engine exhaust vent.  These {{convert|31|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} masts contained the feed lines through which liquid hydrogen (LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and liquid oxygen (LOX) were loaded into the shuttle's external fuel tank, as well as electrical hookups and flares that were used to burn off any ambient hydrogen vapors at the launch site immediately prior to Main Engine start.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The [[Space Shuttle main engine]]s (SSMEs) vented their exhaust through the original opening used for the Saturn rocket exhaust.  Two additional exhaust ports were added to vent exhaust from the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] that flanked the external fuel tank.

The Space Shuttle assembly was held to the MLP at eight holddown points using large [[Threaded rod|studs]], four on the aft skirt of each Solid Rocket Booster. Immediately before SRB ignition, [[frangible nut]]s attached to the top of these studs were detonated, releasing the Shuttle assembly from the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/290339main_8-388221J.pdf |title=Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster: Frangible Nut Crossover System |publisher=NASA |first=Steve |last=Roy |date=November 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2016 |id=NP-2008-09-143-MSFC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202220813/https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/290339main_8-388221J.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sound Suppression System ===
[[File:Sound suppression water system test at KSC Launch Pad 39A.jpg|thumb|Water is released onto an MLP at Launch Pad 39A at the start of a rare sound suppression system test in 2004. During launch, {{convert|300000|USgal|l|disp=flip}} are poured onto the pad in only 41 seconds.]]

When NASA began launching Shuttle missions, it became clear that the MLP might inadvertently pose a danger to the crew or the vehicle, due to the possibility of massive acoustic shock waves bouncing off the platform and hitting the Shuttle as it lifted off. This was true for the Saturn V launches as well, but there was less risk because the Apollo spacecraft, atop the {{convert|363|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} stack, was much farther away from the engines.  Because the Shuttle was about half the height of the Saturn, the crew cabin and payload bay were much closer to the platform, and much more vulnerable to the tremendous forces bouncing back off the MLP - on the first mission, [[STS-1]], the shock waves damaged many of the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|protective thermal tiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quest.nasa.gov/qna/questions/FAQ_Shuttle_Launch.htm |title=FAQ: Why do you drop water under the shuttle as the engines start? |publisher=NASA |date=5 January 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515113630/http://quest.nasa.gov/qna/questions/FAQ_Shuttle_Launch.htm |archivedate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://metinmediamath.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/space-shuttle-launch-and-sound-suppression/ |title=Space Shuttle Launch and Sound Suppression |last=Bektas |first=Metin |website=Metin's Media &amp; Maths |date=1 December 2013 |access-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011073748/https://metinmediamath.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/space-shuttle-launch-and-sound-suppression/ |archive-date=11 October 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA's solution to this danger was to cushion the MLP at every launch with a flood of flowing water.  Starting 6.6 seconds before engine ignition, a {{convert|300000|USgal|l|adj=on|disp=flip}} [[water tower]] at the launch site began dumping water down a pipeline and into the exhaust vents of the MLP.  Next, six {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}}-high towers known as "rainbirds" began to spray water over the MLP and into the flame deflector trenches below it.  The water absorbed some of the bruising forces of the acoustic waves, and discouraged fires that might be caused by the rocket exhaust.  This water-dumping mechanism, known as the Sound Suppression System, emptied the launch pad tank in around 41 seconds.&lt;ref name="water-test" /&gt;  The giant white clouds that billowed around the shuttle at each launch were not smoke, but water vapor generated as the rocket exhaust boiled away huge quantities of water.&lt;ref name="facts-sound"/&gt; The suppression system reduced the acoustic sound level to approximately 142 [[Decibel|dB]].

=== Capabilities ===
[[File:Stsctmlp.jpg|thumb|An MLP being carried by a crawler-transporter]]

Each MLP weighs {{convert|8230000|lb|kg|-4|abbr=on|disp=flip}} unloaded and roughly {{convert|11000000|lb|kg|-6|abbr=on|disp=flip}} with an unfueled Shuttle aboard, measures {{convert|160|by|135|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, and is {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} high. It was carried by a [[crawler-transporter]], which measures {{convert|131|by|114|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, and is {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} high. Each crawler weighs about {{convert|6000000|lb|kg|-6|abbr=on|disp=flip}} unloaded, has a maximum speed of about {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}} per hour loaded, and has a leveling system designed to keep the launch vehicle vertical while negotiating the 5 percent grade leading to the top of the launch pad. Two {{convert|2750|hp|abbr=on|disp=flip}} diesel engines power each crawler.&lt;ref name="facts-transp" /&gt;

Originally designated the "Mobile Launcher",&lt;ref name="nasa-mlps" /&gt; the MLP was designed as part of NASA's strategy for vertical assembly and transport of space vehicles.  Vertical assembly allows the preparation of the spacecraft in a ready-for-launch position, and avoids the additional step of lifting or craning a horizontally-assembled vehicle onto the launchpad (as the engineers of the Soviet space program chose to do).

The Mobile Launcher Platform was set atop six legs, each {{convert|22|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} tall, when stationary. The Solid Rocket Boosters were mounted on top of the MLP.  The External Tank was then lowered between the two boosters and attached to them.  After that, the orbiter was lowered into position and attached to the External Tank.  The crawler-transporter then carried the combined platform and vehicle to the launch site, and deposited them there together.  Once the launch was completed, the crawler-transporter retrieved the empty MLP from the pad to be readied for its next use.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Constellation ==
[[File:Mobile Launching Platform 1 (Ares I) stationary at ML east park site.jpg|thumb|Ares I MLP and crawler-transporter at east park site]]

With the retirement of the Shuttle in 2011 and its planned replacement [[Orion spacecraft]] and launcher in the design and test phase, NASA converted LC-39B from Shuttle operations to support Orion launches.  The [[Ares I-X]] suborbital mission utilized MLP-1, to support the stacking and launch operations.  The cancelled [[Ares I-Y]] would have used the same MLP.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Space Launch System ==
The MLP that was built to launch the [[Ares I]] rocket will be modified to support the [[Space Launch System]]. The mobile launcher will have to be altered in order to support the heavier weight and additional thrust of the heavy lift rocket. The biggest modifications to the MLP will be on the platform's base, where engineers will increase the size of a {{convert|22|ft2|m2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} exhaust duct to a rectangle stretching {{convert|60|by|30|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} and strengthen the surrounding structure. The SLS will weigh more than twice as much as the planned Ares I rocket. The Ares 1 rocket would have featured a single solid-fueled first stage, while the Space Launch System will include two large solid rocket boosters and a powerful core with four Space Shuttle main engines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">'''Nascent state''' or '''''in statu nascendi''''' ([[Latin language|Lat.]] newly formed moiety: ''in the state of being born'' or ''just emerging''), is an [[Superseded scientific theories|obsolete theory]] in [[chemistry]]. It refers to the form of a [[chemical element]] (or sometimes compound) in the instance of their liberation or formation. Often encountered are [[Allotropes of oxygen#Atomic oxygen|atomic oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;nasc&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nascent hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;nasc&lt;/sub&gt;), and similar forms of chlorine (Cl&lt;sub&gt;nasc&lt;/sub&gt;) or bromine (Br&lt;sub&gt;nasc&lt;/sub&gt;).

The concept of a "nascent state" was developed to explain the observation that gases generated [[in situ]] are frequently more reactive than identical chemicals that have been stored for an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;"The 'Chemical Age' Chemical Dictionary. Chemical Terms", Ernest Benn Limited, London, 1924, p.107 [https://archive.org/stream/chemicalagechemi030510mbp#page/n0/mode/2up (link)]&lt;/ref&gt; First usage of the term was in work by [[Joseph Priestley]] around 1790. [[Auguste Laurent]] expanded on the theory in the mid 19th century.&lt;ref name="Jensen1990" /&gt;

Constantine Zenghelis hypothesized in 1920 that the increased reactivity of the "nascent" state was due to the fine dispersion of the molecules, not their status as free atoms.&lt;ref name="Zenghelis1920"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zenghelis|first1=Constantine|title=Nouvelles recherches sur l’action des gaz extremement divisés.|journal=Comptes Rendus|date=1920|volume=171|pages=167–170|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jensen1990" /&gt; Still popular in the early 20th century, the nascent state theory was recognized as declining by 1942.&lt;ref name="Reedy1942"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reedy|first1=J. H.|last2=Biggers|first2=E. D.|title=The nascent state|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=1 September 1942|volume=19|issue=9|pages=403|doi=10.1021/ed019p403|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed019p403|accessdate=6 May 2017|issn=0021-9584|bibcode=1942JChEd..19..403R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1990 review noted that the term was still found as a passing mention in contemporary textbooks. The review summarized that the increased activity observed is actually caused by multiple kinetic effects, and that grouping all these effects into a single term could cause chemists to view the effect too simplistically.&lt;ref name="Jensen1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=William B|journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry|title=Whatever Happened to the Nascent State?|date=1990|issue=5|pages=26–36|url=http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/w.%20b.%20jensen/reprints/051.%20Nascent%20State%20.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10094">An '''online discussion platform''' is an online platform that allows for, or is built specifically for, online discussion. 

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}
{{See also|Web 2.0|Blog|Internet forum|Wiki|Q&amp;A website}}
In 1979 students from Duke University created the first online discussion platform with [[Usenet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Mo|title=The Oxford Handbook of Retirement|date=2012|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199746521|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GuqFh1Ff3rgC&amp;pg=PA494|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutchison|first1=Amy|last2=Colwell|first2=Jamie|title=Using a wiki to facilitate an online professional learning community for induction and mentoring teachers|journal=Education and Information Technologies|date=1 September 2012|volume=17|issue=3|pages=273–289|doi=10.1007/s10639-011-9159-7|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-011-9159-7|accessdate=27 July 2017|language=en|issn=1360-2357}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Uses==
Online discussion platforms can engage people in collective reflection and exchanging perspectives and cross-cultural understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Liping|last2=Chen|first2=Yang-Hsueh|last3=Li|first3=Sandy C.|title=Supporting cross-cultural online discussion with formal and informal platforms: a case between Hong Kong and Taiwan|journal=Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning|date=23 January 2017|volume=12|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/s41039-017-0050-z|url=https://telrp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41039-017-0050-z|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=En|issn=1793-7078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public display of ideas can encourage intersubjective meaning making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Malley|first1=Claire|title=Computer Support Collaborative Learining Practices: CSCL2009 Conference Prceedings|date=2009|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781615841370|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=4smfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}}

Online discussion platforms may be an important structural means for effective large-scale participation.&lt;ref name=mano/&gt;

===In education===
{{See also|Educational technology|Edutainment|Massive open online course|Reddit}}
Online discussion platforms can play a role in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) Conference 2013, Volume 2|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781483406671|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ydywBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}} In recent years, online discussion platform have become a significant part of not only [[distance education]] but also in campus-based settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hybrid Learning: Innovation in Educational Practices - 8th {{!}} Simon K.S. Cheung {{!}} Springer|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319206202|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed interactive e-learning community (iELC) is a platform that engages physics students in online and classroom learning tasks. In brief classroom discussions fundamental physics formulas, definitions and concepts are  disclosed, after which students participate in the iELC form discussion and utilize chat and dialogue tools to improve their understanding of the subject. The teacher then discusses selected forum posts in the subsequent classroom session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=Su Luan|last2=Abu Bakar|first2=Kamariah|title=Qualitative findings of students’ perception on practice of self-regulated strategies in online community discussion|journal=Computers &amp; Education|date=1 August 2009|volume=53|issue=1|pages=94–103|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2008.12.021|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131509000062|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classroom online discussion platforms are one type of such platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Participation, Interaction, and Academic Achievement in an Online Discussion Environment (PDF Download Available)|journal=ResearchGate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272239937_Participation_Interaction_and_Academic_Achievement_in_an_Online_Discussion_Environment|accessdate=27 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose argues that the basic motivation for the development of e–learning platforms is efficiency of scale — teaching more students for less money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coopman|first1=Stephanie J.|title=A critical examination of Blackboard’s e-learning environment|journal=First Monday|date=17 May 2009|volume=14|issue=6|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2434/2202|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study found that learners will enhance the frequencies of course discussion and actively interact with e-learning platform when e-learning platform integrates the curriculum reward mechanism into learning activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lan|first1=Yu-Feng|last2=Yang|first2=Chia-Lung|title=A practical approach to encourage students participation in asynchronous online discussions based on expectancy theory|journal=2009 IEEE International Conference on Virtual Environments, Human-Computer Interfaces and Measurements Systems|pages=271–276|doi=10.1109/VECIMS.2009.5068907|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5068907/|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In smart cities===
"City townhall" includes a participation platform for policy-making in [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janssen|first1=Marijn|last2=Kuk|first2=George|last3=Wagenaar|first3=René W.|title=A survey of Web-based business models for e-government in the Netherlands|journal=Government Information Quarterly|date=1 April 2008|volume=25|issue=2|pages=202–220|doi=10.1016/j.giq.2007.06.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X07001049|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Streamlining==
Online discussion platforms may be designed and improved to streamline discussions for efficiency, usefulness and quality. For instance voting, targeted notifications, user levels, [[gamification]], subscriptions, bots, discussion requirements, structurization, layout, sorting, linking, feedback-mechanisms, reputation-features, demand-signaling features, requesting-features, visual highlighting, separation, curation, tools for real-time collaboration, tools for mobilization of humans and resources, standardization, data-processing, segmentation, summarization, moderation, time-intervals, categorization/tagging, rules and indexing can be leveraged in synergy to improve the platform.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2013 Sarah Perez claimed that the best platform for online discussion doesn't yet exist, noting that comment sections could be more useful if they showed "which comments or shares have resonated and why" and which "understands who deserves to be heard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perez|first1=Sarah|title=The Best Platform For Online Discussion Doesn’t Exist Yet|publisher=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/21/the-best-platform-for-discussion-online-doesnt-exist-yet/|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online platforms don't intrinsically guarantee informed citizen input. Research demonstrates that such spaces can even undermine deliberative participation when they allow hostile, superficial and misinformed content to dominate the conversation (see also: [[Internet troll]], [[shitposting]]). A necessary mechanism that enables these platforms to yield informed citizen debate and contribution to policy is [[deliberation]]. It is argued that the challenge lies in creating an online context that does not merely aggregate public input but promotes informed public discussion that may benefit the policy-making process.&lt;ref name=mano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manosevitch|first1=Edith|last2=Steinfeld|first2=Nili|last3=Lev-On|first3=Azi|title=Promoting online deliberation quality: cognitive cues matter|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|date=26 November 2014|volume=17|issue=10|pages=1177–1195|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2014.899610|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2014.899610|accessdate=27 July 2017|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online citizen communication has been studied for an evaluations of how deliberative their content is and how selective perception and ideological fragmentation play a role in them (see also: [[filter bubble]]).
One sub-branch of online deliberation research is dedicated to the development of new platforms that "facilitate deliberative experiences that surpass currently available options".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freelon|first1=Deen|title=Discourse architecture, ideology, and democratic norms in online political discussion|journal=New Media &amp; Society|date=1 May 2015|volume=17|issue=5|pages=772–791|doi=10.1177/1461444813513259|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444813513259|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overcategorization,''' '''overcategorisation''' or '''category clutter''' is the process of assigning too many categories, classes or [[index term]]s to a given [[document]]. It is related to the [[Library and information science|Library and Information Science]] (LIS) concepts of [[document classification]] and [[subject indexing]].

In LIS, the ideal number of terms that should be assigned to classify an item are measured by the variables [[precision and recall]]. Assigning few category labels that are most closely related to the content of the item being classified will result in searches that have high precision, I.e., where a high proportion of the results are closely related to the query. Assigning more category labels to each item will reduce the precision of each search, but increase the recall, retrieving more relevant results. Related LIS concepts include exhaustivity of indexing and [[information overload]].

==Basic principles==
If too many categories are assigned to a given document, the [[Implication table|implications]] for users depend on how [[informative]] the links are. If the user is able to distinguish between [[Useful field of view|useful]] and not useful links, the damage is limited: The user only wastes time selecting links. In many cases, however, the user cannot judge whether or not a given link will turn out to be fruitful. In that case he or she has to follow the link and to read or skim another document. The worst case scenario is, of course, that even after reading the new document the user is unable to decide whether or not it might be useful if its subject matter is not thoroughly investigated. 

Overcategorization also has another unpleasant implication: It makes the system (for example [[Wikipedia:Overcategorization|in Wikipedia]]) difficult to maintain in a [[consistent]] way. If the system is inconsistent, it means that when the user considers the links in a given category, he or she will not find all documents relevant to that category.

Basically, the problem of overcategorization should be understood from the perspective of [[relevance]] and the traditional measures of [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] and [[precision (information retrieval)|precision]]. If too few ''relevant'' categories are assigned to a document, recall may decrease. If too many non-relevant categories are assigned, precision becomes lower. The hard job is to say which categories are fruitful or [[Relevance|relevant]] for future use of the document.

'''Pamphile''' ({{lang-el|Παμφίλη}}), ''Plateae filia'' or ''Latoi filia'', was the daughter of Platea, or of [[Apollo]] (Latous)&lt;ref&gt;Longman, 1827 ''Classical Manual; or, a mythological, historical, and geographical commentary on Pope's Homer and Dryden's Æneid of Virgil, with a copious index''&lt;/ref&gt;, a woman of the Greek island of [[Kos]]. 
[[File:Wilhelm Maria Hubertus Leibl 010.jpg|thumb|200px|left|&lt;center&gt;Distaff]]

It is said that silk was first spun by her. She also invented the technique of preparing a thread from cotton wool for spinning on a [[distaff]]. She developed the technique of weaving from cotton thread. 

[[Pliny the Elder]] described in 70 BC: "Silk was obtained by removing the down from the leaves with the help of water". He also recounted the legend of Pamphile, who invented silk weaving on the Greek island of [[Kos]].  He said that Pamphile discovered the technique of weaving like a spider's web and that "she ought not to be cheated of the glory of making a silk dress that covers a woman but reveals her charms". Aristotle also associated Pamphile with inventing the concept of weaving silk.

	'''Paul Niggli''' (26 June 1888 &amp;ndash; 13 January 1953) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Crystallography|crystallographer]] who was a leader in the field of [[X-ray crystallography]].

Niggli was born in [[Zofingen]] and studied at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] (ETH) in [[Zurich]] and the [[University of Zurich]], where he obtained a doctorate. His 1919 book, ''Geometrische Kristallographie des Diskontinuums'', played a seminal role in the refinement of [[space group]] theory. In this book, Niggli demonstrated that although X-ray reflection conditions do not always uniquely determine the space group to which a crystal belongs, they do reveal a small number of possible space groups to which it could belong.  Niggli used morphological methods to account for internal structure and, in his 1928 ''Kristallographische und Strukturtheoretische Grundbegriffe,'' he took up what is essentially the reverse process, the task of establishing the connection between space lattices and external crystal morphology.  The great aim of his life was to integrate the whole field of [[Earth science]]s.

In 1920, Niggli became the lead scientist at the ETH's ''Institut für Mineralogie und Petrographie'', where he brought his systematic approach to the study of crystal morphologies using X-ray diffraction.  In 1935, Niggli and his doctoral student Werner Nowacki (1909–1988) determined the 73 three-dimensional arithmetic crystal classes ([[Space group|symmorphic space groups]]).  Niggli retired from the Institute in 1949. He was also professor of mineralogy at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule and at the University of Zurich.

Niggli succeeded [[Paul Heinrich von Groth|Paul Heinrich von Groth (1843 - 1927)]] as editor of ''[[Zeitschrift für Kristallographie]]''.

In 1948, Niggli was awarded the [[Roebling Medal]] of the [[Mineralogical Society of America]].

The Paul Niggli Foundation awards medals to outstanding Swiss mineral scientists below the age of 35 with a strong perspective for an academic career.

[[Dorsum Niggli]] on the [[Moon]] was named after him.

==Overview==
Krauss focuses on [[theoretical physics]] and has published researches on a number of topics within that field. His primary contribution is to [[cosmology]] as one of the first physicists to suggest that most of the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass and energy]] of the universe resides in empty space, an idea now widely known as "[[dark energy]]". Furthermore, Krauss has formulated a model in which the universe could have potentially come from "nothing," as outlined in his later book ''[[A Universe from Nothing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html|title=On the Origin of Everything|date=25 March 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |last=Boutin |first=Paul |title=Theory of Anything?

Whether our universe is ever-expanding depends on the amount and properties of matter, but there is too little visible matter around us to explain the behavior we can see—over 90% of the universe consists of the missing mass or dark matter,&lt;ref name="dreyfus"&gt;{{cite web |title=Questions That Plague Physics: Lawrence Krauss Speaks About Unfinished Business |url=http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/sa_krauss.pdf |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=July 27, 2015 |author=Dreyfus, Claudia |date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Krauss termed "the fifth essence." In this book Krauss demonstrates how the dark matter problem is now connected with two widely discussed areas in the modern cosmology: the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]]. He also discusses an [[antigravity|antigravity force]] that may explain recent observations of a permanently expanding universe.

'''Raymond L. Heacock''' (January 9, 1928 – December 20, 2016) was an American engineer who spent his career at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] where he worked on the [[Ranger program]]&lt;ref name="Caidin1963"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caidin|first=Martin|title=The moon: new world for men|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMA5AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=April 17, 2011|year=1963|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s and on the [[Voyager program]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Swift1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Swift|first=David W.|title=Voyager tales: personal views of the grand tour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-NGFqfq1LsC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=April 17, 2011|year=1997|publisher=AIAA|isbn=978-1-56347-252-7|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomayko1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomayko|first=James E.|title=Computers in spaceflight: the NASA experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbIFcxOqKosC&amp;pg=PA177|accessdate=April 17, 2011|date=1987-08-03|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-2268-5|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kluger2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kluger|first=Jeffrey|title=Moon hunters: NASA's remarkable expeditions to the ends of the solar system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgYu1uHNhk0C&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=April 17, 2011|date=2001-07-10|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-86559-1|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Caltech]] engineering graduate, he was the winner of the [[James Watt International Medal]] for 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-me-raymond-heacock-20161223-story.html|title=Raymond Heacock, JPL engineer who worked on Voyager mission, dies at 88|first=Deborah|last=Netburn|work=latimes.com|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and work==
Heacock joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1953, after receiving his Master of Science Degree in Engineering from the California Institute of Technology. Prior to joining the Voyager Project in 1972 as Spacecraft Systems Manager he had advanced through various positions of responsibility at the Laboratory. In October 1977, he was appointed Deputy Manager of the Voyager Project and became Manager in 1979. He was a member of the [https://www.aiaa.org/ American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics] and has served as Secretary, Treasurer, Vice-President and President of the Board of Directors of the Caltech Alumni Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2375/1/1974_07_08_06.pdf|format=PDF|title=CALTECH NEWS|volume=8, 6|date=July 1974|website=Caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heacock is a native of Santa Ana, California and now lives in La Crescenta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Interstellar_Voyage_Continues_With_New_Project_Manager_999.html|title=Interstellar Voyage Continues With New Project Manager|work=space-travel.com|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of the Voyager Project in 1972, Heacock was deeply involved in guiding and shaping the successful development and operation of the sophisticated craft. The scientific data from the flight experiments carried aboard them have yielded startling new information on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Heacock was a leader in the design, development and flight operations of these craft as well as of their scientific instruments complement. As Spacecraft System Manager, Deputy Project Manager, and Project Manager he contributed personally to the development of various advanced design features leading to the Project's outstanding success.

NASA's two robot spacecraft, ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'', were launched in the Summer of 1977 on their journeys to Jupiter of more than 625 million miles. A fitting tribute to the efforts and ingenuity of many engineers and scientists, the spacecraft have now completed the exploration of the outer solar system. [[Voyager 1#Flyby of Saturn|''Voyager 1'' reached Saturn]] in November 1981, and then left the solar system. Nearly 10 years later ''Voyager 1'' turned around to point its cameras towards Earth and took the famous ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' image. [[Voyager 2#Encounter with Saturn|''Voyager 2'' reached Saturn]] in August 1981, then went on to [[Voyager 2#Encounter with Uranus|Uranus]] in 1986, and [[Voyager 2#Encounter with Neptune|Neptune]] in 1989.

==James Watt International Medal==

The presentation of the 1979 James Watt International Medal was made on Wednesday, June 25, 1980 at the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in London. The Medal was presented to Heacock, Project Manager—Voyager, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, by the President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Bryan Hildrew, C.B.E., M.Sc, D.I.C., F.Eng., F.I.Mech.E., F.I.Mar.E., who read a citation.

The James Watt International Medal is awarded biennially to an engineer of any nationality who is deemed worthy of this, the highest award which the Institution of Mechanical Engineers can bestow. The Council awarded the 1979 Medal to Heacock for his outstanding achievements as leader of the team responsible for shaping the development and execution of the technically advanced spacecraft used by the United States of America in the exploration of the outer planets of our solar system.

'''Risk management''' is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of [[risk]]s (defined in [[ISO 31000]] as ''the effect of uncertainty on objectives'') followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events&lt;ref name="Risk Management pg. 46"&gt;{{cite book|first=Douglas|last=Hubbard|title=The Failure of Risk Management: Why It's Broken and How to Fix It|page=46|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to maximize the realization of opportunities.

Risks can come from various sources including uncertainty in financial markets, threats from project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, [[Act of God|natural causes and disasters]], deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable [[Root cause|root-cause]]. There are two types of events i.e. negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities.  Several risk management [[Technical standard|standards]] have been developed including the [[Project Management Institute]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], actuarial societies, and ISO standards.&lt;ref name=voc&gt;{{cite book | author=ISO/IEC Guide 73:2009 | title= Risk management — Vocabulary | publisher=International Organization for Standardization | year=2009 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=44651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iso&gt;{{cite book | author=ISO/DIS 31000 | title= Risk management — Principles and guidelines on implementation | publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] | year=2009 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods, definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management, security, [[Risk analysis (engineering)|engineering]], [[Industrial Process|industrial processes]], financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety.

Strategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat, and the opposites for opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits).

Certain aspects of many of the risk management standards have come under criticism for having no measurable improvement on risk; whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seem to increase.&lt;ref name="Risk Management pg. 46"/&gt; For example, one study found that one in six IT projects were "[[black swan theory|black swan]]s" with gigantic overruns (cost overruns averaged 200%, and schedule overruns 70%).&lt;ref name="Bent Flyvbjerg"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flyvbjerg, Bent  |author2=Budzier, Alexander  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011|title=Why Your IT Project May Be Riskier Than You Think|url=https://hbr.org/2011/09/why-your-it-project-may-be-riskier-than-you-think|journal= Harvard Business Review|volume=89|issue=9|pages=601–603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}


A widely used vocabulary for risk management is defined by ''ISO Guide 73:2009'', "Risk management. Vocabulary."&lt;ref name=voc/&gt;

In ideal risk management, a prioritization process is followed whereby the risks with the greatest loss (or impact) and the greatest [[probability]] of occurring are handled first, and risks with lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order. In practice the process of assessing overall risk can be difficult, and balancing resources used to mitigate between risks with a high probability of occurrence but lower loss versus a risk with high loss but lower probability of occurrence can often be mishandled.

Intangible risk management identifies a new type of a risk that has a 100% probability of occurring but is ignored by the organization due to a lack of identification ability. For example, when deficient knowledge is applied to a situation, a [[knowledge]] risk materializes. Relationship risk appears when ineffective collaboration occurs. Process-engagement risk may be an issue when ineffective operational procedures are applied. These risks directly reduce the productivity of knowledge workers, decrease cost-effectiveness, profitability, service, quality, reputation, brand value, and earnings quality. Intangible risk management allows risk management to create immediate value from the identification and reduction of risks that reduce productivity.

Risk management also faces difficulties in allocating resources. This is the idea of [[opportunity cost]]. Resources spent on risk management could have been spent on more profitable activities. Again, ideal risk management minimizes spending (or manpower or other resources) and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.

According to the definition to the risk, the risk is the possibility that an event will occur and adversely affect the achievement of an objective. Therefore, risk itself has the uncertainty.  Risk management such as COSO ERM, can help managers have a good control for their risk.  Each company may have different internal control components, which leads to different outcomes. For example, the framework for ERM components includes Internal Environment, Objective Setting, Event Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Response, Control Activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring.

==Method==

For the most part, these methods consist of the following elements, performed, more or less, in the following order.

# identify, characterize [[threat]]s
# assess the [[vulnerability]] of critical assets to specific threats
# determine the [[risk]] (i.e. the expected likelihood and consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets)
# identify ways to reduce those risks
# prioritize risk reduction measures

==Principles==

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) identifies the following principles of risk management:&lt;ref name="iso3100"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Committee Draft of ISO 31000 Risk management |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |url=http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |format=PDF |publication-date=2007-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325160441/http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk management should:
* create [[value (economics)|value]] – resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than the consequence of inaction
* be an integral part of organizational processes
* be part of decision making process
* explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions
* be a systematic and structured process
* be based on the best available information
* be tailorable
* take human factors into account
* be transparent and inclusive
* be dynamic, iterative and responsive to change
* be capable of continual improvement and enhancement
* be continually or periodically re-assessed

==Process==
According to the standard [[ISO 31000]] "Risk management – Principles and guidelines on implementation,"&lt;ref name=iso /&gt; the process of risk management consists of several steps as follows:

===Establishing the context===
This involves:

#
#*the social scope of risk management
#*the identity and objectives of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]
#*the basis upon which risks will be evaluated, constraints.
#defining a framework for the activity and an agenda for identification
#developing an analysis of risks involved in the process
#mitigation or solution of risks using available technological, human and organizational resources

===Identification===
After establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks.  Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk identification can start with the source of our problems and those of our competitors (benefit), or with the problem itself.
* Source analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/StaticFiles/Emprendedores/Analisis_Riesgos/pages/pdf/metodologia/3IdentificaciondelosRiesgos_en.pdf|title=Risk Identification|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Comunidad de Madrid|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Risk sources may be internal or external to the system that is the target of risk management (use mitigation instead of management since by its own definition risk deals with factors of decision-making that cannot be managed).
Examples of risk sources are: stakeholders of a project, employees of a company or the weather over an airport.
* Problem analysis{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} – Risks are related to identified threats. For example: the threat of losing money, the threat of abuse of confidential information or the threat of human errors, accidents and casualties. The threats may exist with various entities, most important with shareholders, customers and legislative bodies such as the government.
When either source or problem is known, the events that a source may trigger or the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated. For example: stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project; confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed network; lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on board immediate casualties.

The chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture, industry practice and compliance. The identification methods are formed by templates or the development of templates for identifying source, problem or event. Common risk identification methods are:
* Objectives-based risk identification {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} – Organizations and project teams have objectives. Any event that may endanger achieving an objective partly or completely is identified as risk.
* Scenario-based risk identification – In [[scenario analysis]] different scenarios are created. The scenarios may be the alternative ways to achieve an objective, or an analysis of the interaction of forces in, for example, a market or battle. Any event that triggers an undesired scenario alternative is identified as risk – see [[Futures Studies]] for methodology used by [[Futurists]].
* Taxonomy-based risk identification – The taxonomy in taxonomy-based risk identification is a breakdown of possible risk sources. Based on the taxonomy and knowledge of best practices, a questionnaire is compiled. The answers to the questions reveal risks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/93tr006.cfm CMU/SEI-93-TR-6 Taxonomy-based risk identification in software industry]. Sei.cmu.edu. Retrieved on 2012-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common-risk checking &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsa.go.jp/p_fsa/news/newse/ne_023/03.pdf|title=Risk Management Systems Checklist (Common Items)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fsa.go.jpn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – In several industries, lists with known risks are available. Each risk in the list can be checked for application to a particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cve.mitre.org Common Vulnerability and Exposures list]. Cve.mitre.org. Retrieved on 2012-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risk charting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crockford|first=Neil|title=An Introduction to Risk Management|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Woodhead-Faulkner|edition=2|year=1986|page=18|isbn=0-85941-332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – This method combines the above approaches by listing resources at risk, threats to those resources, modifying factors which may increase or decrease the risk and consequences it is wished to avoid. Creating a [[Risk matrix|matrix]] under these headings enables a variety of approaches. One can begin with resources and consider the threats they are exposed to and the consequences of each.   Alternatively one can start with the threats and examine which resources they would affect, or one can begin with the consequences and determine which combination of threats and resources would be involved to bring them about.

===Assessment===
{{Main article|Risk assessment}}
Once risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown. Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the [[risk management plan]].

Even a short-term positive improvement can have long-term negative impacts.  Take the "turnpike" example. A highway is widened to allow more traffic. More traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the improved traffic capacity.   Over time, traffic thereby increases to fill available capacity. Turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly endless cycles. There are many other engineering examples where expanded capacity (to do any function) is soon filled by increased demand. Since expansion comes at a cost, the resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting and management.

The fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events, simply because of their infrequency. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals. Thus, there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is: "Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude."{{vague|section|date=January 2016}}

==Risk options==
Risk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the following major risk options, which are:

#Design a new business process with adequate built-in risk control and containment measures from the start.
#Periodically re-assess risks that are accepted in ongoing processes as a normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures.
#Transfer risks to an external agency (e.g. an insurance company)
#Avoid risks altogether (e.g. by closing down a particular high-risk business area)

Later research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRISC Exam Questions|url=https://www.dumpsbook.com/Exam/CRISC|accessdate= 23 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the financial benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the frequency and how risk assessment is performed.

In business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk assessments in financial, market, or schedule terms. Robert Courtney Jr. (IBM, 1970) proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms. The Courtney formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the US governmental agencies. The formula proposes calculation of ALE (annualized loss expectancy) and compares the expected loss value to the security control implementation costs ([[cost-benefit analysis]]).

===Potential risk treatments===
Once risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorfman|first=Mark S. |title=Introduction to Risk Management and Insurance|edition=9 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-13-224227-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
* Reduction (optimize – mitigate)
* Sharing (transfer – outsource or insure)
* Retention (accept and budget)

Ideal use of these [[risk control strategies]] may not be possible.  Some of them may involve trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions. Another source, from the US Department of Defense (see link), [[Defense Acquisition University]], calls these categories ACAT, for Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer.  This use of the ACAT acronym is reminiscent of another ACAT (for Acquisition Category) used in US Defense industry procurements, in which Risk Management figures prominently in decision making and planning.

====Risk avoidance====
This includes not performing an activity that could carry risk.  An example would be not buying a [[Real property|property]] or business in order to not take on the [[legal liability]] that comes with it.  Another would be not flying in order not to take the risk that the [[airplane]] were to be [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]]ed.  Avoidance may seem the answer to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed.  Not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits.  Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions, in favor of patients presenting with lower risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D. |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counseling|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085|url=http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4314/1/McGivern_G___Fischer_M_D__%282012%29_Reactivity_and_Reactions_to_Regulatory_Transparency_in_Medicine_Psychotherapy_and_Counselling_%28Authors%27_version%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk reduction====
Risk reduction or "optimization" involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring.  For example, [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler]]s are designed to put out a [[fire]] to reduce the risk of loss by fire.  This method may cause a greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable.  [[Halomethane|Halon]] fire suppression systems may mitigate that risk, but the cost may be prohibitive as a [[strategy]].

Acknowledging that risks can be positive or negative, optimizing risks means finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or activity; and between risk reduction and effort applied. By an offshore drilling contractor effectively applying [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) management in its organization, it can optimize risk to achieve levels of [[residual risk]] that are tolerable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iadc.org/ebookstore/ebook-iadc-hse-case-guidelines-for-mobile-offshore-drilling-units/ IADC HSE Case Guidelines for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units] 3.2, section 4.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and delivering software incrementally.  Early methodologies suffered from the fact that they only delivered software in the final phase of development; any problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often jeopardized the whole project.  By developing in iterations, software projects can limit effort wasted to a single iteration.

[[Outsourcing]] could be an example of risk sharing strategy if the outsourcer can demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roehrig|first=P|year=2006|url=http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=bet-governance&amp;page=ss-viewresearch|title=Bet On Governance To Manage Outsourcing Risk|journal=Business Trends Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company may outsource only its software development, the manufacturing of hard goods, or customer support needs to another company, while handling the business management itself.  This way, the company can concentrate more on business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for a center.

====Risk sharing====
Briefly defined as "sharing with another party the burden of loss or the benefit of gain, from a risk, and the measures to reduce a risk."

The term of 'risk transfer' is often used in place of risk sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a "transfer of risk." However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses "transferred", meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the policy holder namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policy holder then some compensation may be payable to the policy holder that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.

Some ways of managing risk fall into multiple categories. Risk retention pools are technically retaining the risk for the group, but spreading it over the whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group. This is different from traditional insurance, in that no premium is exchanged between members of the group up front, but instead losses are assessed to all members of the group.

====Risk retention====
Risk retention involves accepting the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when the incident occurs.  True [[self-insurance]] falls in this category.  Risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default.  This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible.  [[War]] is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war, so the loss attributed to war is retained by the insured.  Also any amounts of potential loss (risk) over the amount insured is retained risk.  This may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great that it would hinder the goals of the organization too much.

===Risk management plan===
{{main|Risk management plan}}

Select appropriate controls or countermeasures to mitigate each risk. Risk mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management. For instance, a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top management decision behind it whereas IT management would have the authority to decide on computer virus risks.

The risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks. For example, an observed high risk of computer viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software. A good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation and responsible persons for those actions.

According to [[ISO/IEC 27001]], the stage immediately after completion of the [[risk assessment]] phase consists of preparing a Risk Treatment Plan, which should document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be handled.  Mitigation of risks often means selection of [[security controls]], which should be documented in a Statement of Applicability, which identifies which particular control objectives and controls from the 
standard have been selected, and why.

===Implementation===
Implementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of the risks.  Purchase insurance policies for the risks that it has been decided to transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without sacrificing the entity's goals, reduce others, and retain the rest.

===Review and evaluation of the plan===
Initial risk management plans will never be perfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with the risks being faced.

[[Risk analysis (business)|Risk analysis]] results and management plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasons for this: 
# to evaluate whether the previously selected security controls are still applicable and effective
# to evaluate the possible risk level changes in the business environment. For example, information risks are a good example of rapidly changing business environment.

==Limitations==
Prioritizing the ''risk management processes'' too highly could keep an organization from ever completing a project or even getting started.  This is especially true if other work is suspended until the risk management process is considered complete.

It is also important to keep in mind the distinction between risk and [[uncertainty]]. Risk can be measured by impacts × probability.

If risks are improperly assessed and prioritized, time can be wasted in dealing with risk of losses that are not likely to occur.  Spending too much time assessing and managing unlikely risks can divert resources that could be used more profitably.  Unlikely events do occur but if the risk is unlikely enough to occur it may be better to simply retain the risk and deal with the result if the loss does in fact occur. Qualitative risk assessment is subjective and lacks consistency. The primary justification for a formal risk assessment process is legal and bureaucratic.

==Areas==
As applied to [[corporate finance]], ''risk management'' is the technique for measuring, monitoring and controlling the financial or [[operational risk]] on a firm's [[balance sheet]], a traditional measure is the [[value at risk]] (VaR), but there also other measures like [[profit at risk]] (PaR) or [[margin at risk]]. The [[Basel II]] framework breaks risks into [[market risk]] (price risk), [[credit risk]] and operational risk and also specifies methods for calculating [[capital requirement]]s for each of these components.

In Information Technology, Risk management includes "Incident Handling", an action plan for dealing with intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service, fire, floods, and other security-related events. According to the [[SANS Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/ SANS Glossary of Security Terms] Retrieved on 2016-11-13&lt;/ref&gt; it is a six step process: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

===Enterprise===
{{Main article|Enterprise Risk Management}}
In enterprise risk management, a risk is defined as a possible event or circumstance that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question.  Its impact can be on the very existence, the resources (human and capital), the products and services, or the customers of the enterprise, as well as external impacts on society, markets, or the environment.  In a financial institution, enterprise risk management is normally thought of as the combination of credit risk, [[interest rate risk]] or [[asset liability management]], liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk.

In the more general case, every probable risk can have a pre-formulated plan to deal with its possible consequences (to ensure ''contingency'' if the risk becomes a ''liability'').

From the information above and the average cost per employee over time, or [[cost accrual ratio]], a project manager can estimate:

* the cost associated with the risk if it arises, estimated by multiplying employee costs per unit time by the estimated time lost (''cost impact'', ''C'' where ''C = cost accrual ratio * S''){{abbreviations|date=September 2016}}.
* the probable increase in time associated with a risk (''schedule variance due to risk'', ''Rs'' where Rs = P * S):
** Sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the schedule first. This is intended to cause the greatest risks to the project to be attempted first so that risk is minimized as quickly as possible.
** This is slightly misleading as ''schedule variances'' with a large P and small S and vice versa are not equivalent. (The risk of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sinking vs. the passengers' meals being served at slightly the wrong time).
* the probable increase in cost associated with a risk (''cost variance due to risk'', ''Rc'' where Rc = P*C = P*CAR*S = P*S*CAR)
** sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the budget first.
** see concerns about ''schedule variance'' as this is a function of it, as illustrated in the equation above.

Risk in a [[project]] or [[business process|process]] can be due either to [[Special Cause Variation]] or [[Common Cause Variation]] and requires appropriate treatment.  That is to re-iterate the concern about extremal cases not being equivalent in the list immediately above.

===Enterprise Security===
ESRM is a security program management approach that links security activities to an enterprise's mission and business goals through risk management methods. The security leader's role in ESRM is to manage risks of harm to enterprise assets in partnership with the business leaders whose assets are exposed to those risks. ESRM involves educating business leaders on the realistic impacts of identified risks, presenting potential strategies to mitigate those impacts, then enacting the option chosen by the business in line with accepted levels of business risk tolerance&lt;ref&gt;ASIS https://www.asisonline.org/publications--resources/news/blog/esrm-an-enduring-security-risk-model/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical device===
For medical devices, risk management is a process for identifying, evaluating and mitigating risks associated with harm to people and damage to property or the environment. Risk management is an integral part of medical device design and development, production processes and evaluation of field experience, and is applicable to all types of medical devices. The evidence of its application is required by most regulatory bodies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]]. The management of risks for medical devices is described by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in ISO 14971:2007, Medical Devices—The application of risk management to medical devices, a product safety standard. The standard provides a process framework and associated requirements for management responsibilities, risk analysis and evaluation, risk controls and lifecycle risk management.

The European version of the risk management standard was updated in 2009 and again in 2012 to refer to the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) revision in 2007, as well as the In Vitro Medical Device Directive (IVDD). The requirements of EN 14971:2012 are nearly identical to ISO 14971:2007. The differences include three "(informative)" Z Annexes that refer to the new MDD, AIMDD, and IVDD.  These annexes indicate content deviations that include the requirement for risks to be reduced ''as far as possible'', and the requirement that risks be mitigated by design and not by labeling on the medical device (i.e., labeling can no longer be used to mitigate risk).

Typical risk analysis and evaluation techniques adopted by the medical device industry include [[hazard analysis]], [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), hazard and operability study ([[HAZOP]]), and risk traceability analysis for ensuring risk controls are implemented and effective (i.e. tracking risks identified to product requirements, design specifications, verification and validation results etc.). FTA analysis requires diagramming software. FMEA analysis can be done using a [[spreadsheet]] program. There are also integrated medical device risk management solutions.

Through a [http://www.fda.gov/medicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm206153.htm draft guidance], the FDA has introduced another method named "Safety Assurance Case" for medical device safety assurance analysis. The safety assurance case is structured argument reasoning about systems appropriate for scientists and engineers, supported by a body of evidence, that provides a compelling, comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a given application in a given environment. With the guidance, a safety assurance case is expected for safety critical devices (e.g. infusion devices) as part of the pre-market clearance submission, e.g. 510(k). In 2013, the FDA introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturers to submit cybersecurity risk analysis information.

===Project management===
{{Main article| project risk management}}
Project risk management must be considered at the different phases of acquisition.  In the beginning of a project, the advancement of technical developments, or threats presented by a competitor's projects, may cause a risk or threat assessment and subsequent evaluation of alternatives (see [[Analysis of Alternatives]]). Once a decision is made, and the project begun, more familiar project management applications can be used:&lt;ref&gt;Lev Virine and Michael Trumper. ''Project Decisions: The Art and Science''.

What Is Risk Management?  http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-risk-management&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* Planning how risk will be managed in the particular project.  Plans should include risk management tasks, responsibilities, activities and budget.
* Assigning a risk officer – a team member other than a project manager who is responsible for foreseeing potential project problems.  Typical characteristic of risk officer is a healthy skepticism.
* Maintaining live project risk database.  Each risk should have the following attributes: opening date, title, short description, probability and importance.  Optionally a risk may have an assigned person responsible for its resolution and a date by which the risk must be resolved.
* Creating anonymous risk reporting channel.  Each team member should have the possibility to report risks that he/she foresees in the project.
* Preparing mitigation plans for risks that are chosen to be mitigated.  The purpose of the mitigation plan is to describe how this particular risk will be handled – what, when, by whom and how will it be done to avoid it or minimize consequences if it becomes a liability.
* Summarizing planned and faced risks, effectiveness of mitigation activities, and effort spent for the risk management.

===Megaprojects (infrastructure)===
[[Megaproject]]s (sometimes also called "major programs") are large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than $1 billion per project. Megaprojects include major bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection schemes, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defense systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Megaprojects and Risk"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bent|last=Flyvbjerg|title=Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=0521804205|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk management is therefore particularly pertinent for megaprojects and special methods and special education have been developed for such risk management.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford BT Centre for Major Programme Management]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural disasters===
It is important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like [[Flood risk assessment|floods]], [[seismic hazard|earthquakes]], and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, business interruption losses and other downtime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costs of reducing the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Alan.

===Wilderness===

The management of risks to persons and property in [[Wilderness|wilderness]] and remote natural areas has developed with increases in outdoor recreation participation and decreased social tolerance for loss.  Organizations providing commercial wilderness experiences can now align with national and international consensus standards for training and equipment such as [[American_National_Standards_Institute|ANSI]]/NASBLA 101-2017 (boating)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American National Standard ANSI/NASBLA 101-2017: Basic Boating Knowledge--Human Propelled|url= https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.americancanoe.org/resource/resmgr/spp-documents/ANSI_NASBLA_101-2017_Human_P.pdf|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[International_Climbing_and_Mountaineering_Federation|UIAA]] 152 (ice climbing tools)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UIAA Standard 152: Ice Tools|url= https://www.theuiaa.org/documents/safety-standards/152_IceTools_UIAA2018.pdf|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[European_Committee_for_Standardization|European Norm]] 13089:2015 + A1:2015 (mountaineering equipment)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EN 13089 Mountaineering equipment - Ice-tools - Safety requirements and test methods (includes Amendment A1:2015)|url= https://www.en-standard.eu/din-en-13089-mountaineering-equipment-ice-tools-safety-requirements-and-test-methods-includes-amendment-a1-2015/|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Standard I.S.EN 13089:2011+A1:2015 Mountaineering equipment - Ice-tools - Safety requirements and test methods|url= https://infostore.saiglobal.com/preview/is/en/2011/i.s.en13089-2011%2Ba1-2015.pdf?sku=1458668|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Information technology===
{{Main article|IT risk management}}
[[IT risk]] is a risk related to information technology. This is a relatively new term due to an increasing awareness that [[information security]] is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports.

[[ISACA]]'s ''[[Risk IT]]'' framework ties IT risk to [[enterprise risk management]].

CIS RAM provides a method to design and evaluate the implementation of the CIS Controls™.

===Petroleum and natural gas===
For the offshore oil and gas industry, operational risk management is regulated by the [[safety case]] regime in many countries. Hazard identification and risk assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard ISO 17776:2000, and organisations such as the IADC ([[International Association of Drilling Contractors]]) publish guidelines for [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) Case development which are based on the ISO standard. Further, diagrammatic representations of hazardous events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management in safety case submissions; these are known as '''[[bow-tie diagram]]s''' (see [[Network theory in risk assessment]]). The technique is also used by organisations and regulators in mining, aviation, health, defence, industrial and finance.

===Pharmaceutical sector===
The principles and tools for quality risk management are increasingly being applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality systems. These aspects include development, manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and submission/review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug substances, drug products, biological and biotechnological products (including the use of raw materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling materials in drug products, biological and biotechnological products). Risk management is also applied to the assessment of [http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2011/126.html microbiological contamination] in relation to pharmaceutical products and cleanroom manufacturing environments.&lt;ref name=Sandle&gt;{{cite book | author = Saghee M, Sandle T, Tidswell E (editors) | title = Microbiology and Sterility Assurance in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices | edition = 1st | publisher = Business Horizons | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-8190646741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk communication==
Risk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary academic field related to [[Value system|core values]] of the targeted audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/policy-and-instruction/nmcphc-risk-communications-primer.pdf Risk Communication Primer—Tools and Techniques]. Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/publications/UnderstandingRiskCommunicationTheory.pdf Understanding Risk Communication Theory: A Guide for Emergency Managers and Communicators]. Report to Human Factors/Behavioral Sciences Division, Science and Technology Directorate,  U.S. Department of Homeland Security (May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Problems for risk communicators involve how to reach the intended audience, how to make the risk comprehensible and relatable to other risks, how to pay appropriate respect to the audience's values related to the risk, how to predict the audience's response to the communication, etc. A main goal of risk communication is to improve collective and individual decision making. Risk communication is somewhat related to [[crisis communication]]. Some experts coincide that risk is not only enrooted in the communication process but also it cannot be dissociated from the use of language. Though each culture develops its own fears and risks, these construes apply only by the hosting culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''sleeper effect''' is a psychological phenomenon that relates to persuasion. It is a delayed increase of the effect of a message that is accompanied by a discounting cue.

==The sleeper effect==
When people are exposed normally to a persuasive message (such as an engaging or persuasive television advertisement), their attitudes toward the advocacy of the message display a significant increase.

Over time, however, their newly formed attitudes seem to gravitate back toward the opinion held prior to receiving the message, almost as if they were never exposed to the communication.  This pattern of normal decay in attitudes has been documented as the most frequently observed longitudinal pattern of persuasion research (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).

In contrast, some messages are often accompanied with a discounting cue (e.g., a message disclaimer, a low-credibility source) that would arouse a recipient’s suspicion of the validity of the message and suppress any attitude change that might occur by exposure to the message alone.  Furthermore, when people are exposed to a persuasive message followed by a discounting cue, people tend to be more persuaded over time; this is referred to as the sleeper effect (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).

For example, in [[political campaign]]s during important elections, [[Swing vote|undecided voters]] often see negative advertisements about a party or candidate for office.  At the end of the advertisement, they also might notice that the opposing candidate paid for the advertisement.  Presumably, this would make voters question the truthfulness of the advertisement, and consequently, they may not be persuaded initially.  However, even though the source of the advertisement lacked credibility, voters will be more likely to be persuaded later (and ultimately, vote against the candidate disfavored by the advertisement).

This pattern of attitude change has puzzled social psychologists for nearly half a century, primarily due to its counter-intuitive nature and for its potential to aid in understanding attitude processes (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).  It has been a very widely studied phenomenon of persuasion research (Kumkale &amp; Albarracín, 2004; see also Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).
Despite a long history, the sleeper effect has been notoriously difficult to obtain 
or to replicate, with the exception of a pair of studies by Gruder et al. (1978).

== Controversy about the existence of a "sleeper effect" ==
One of the more challenging aspects that the sleeper effect posed to some researchers in early studies was the sheer difficulty of obtaining the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Capon|first=N|author2=J. Hulbert |title=The Sleeper Effect - An awakening.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1973|doi=10.1086/268097|volume=37|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeper effect is controversial because the influence of a persuasive communication is greater when one measures the effect closer to the presentation instead of farther from the time of the reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=TD|author2=BR FLay |title=The persistence of experimentally induced attitude change|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=Ah|author2=S. Chaiken |title=The psychology of attitudes|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attempting to replicate the effect and failing, some researchers suggested that it might be better to accept the [[null hypothesis]] and conclude that the sleeper effect does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillig|first=PM|author2=AG Greenwald |title=Is it time to lay the sleeper effect to rest?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|doi=10.1037/h0035744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeper effect is involved with initial message impression so the phenomenon has implications for models of persuasion, including teaching methods, as well as more recent conceptualizations, such as the [[heuristic-systematic model]] and the [[elaboration likelihood model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracín |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|date=23 May 2011|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Cook and his associates responded by suggesting that previous studies failed to obtain the sleeper effect because the requirements for a strong test were not met.  Specifically, they argued that the sleeper effect will occur only if:
:(a) the message is persuasive;
:(b) the discounting cue has a strong enough effect to suppress initial attitude change;
:(c) enough time has elapsed between immediate and delayed post-tests; and
:(d) the message itself still has an effect on attitudes during the delayed post-test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=TD|author2=CL Gruder |author3=KM Hennigan |author4=BR Flay |title=History of the Sleeper Effect: Some Logical Pitfalls in Accepting the Null Hypothesis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1979|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.4.662 |volume=86 |pages=662–679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental studies conducted did, in fact, provide evidence for the sleeper effect occurring under such theoretically relevant conditions.  Furthermore, the sleeper effect did not occur when any of the four requirements were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruder|first=CL|author2=TD Cook |author3=KM Hennigan |author4=BR Flay |author5=C Alessis |author6=J Halamaj |title=Empirical tests of the absolute sleeper effect predicted from the discounting-cue hypothesis.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1978|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.10.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the dissociation interpretation, a sleeper effect appears to happen when a convincing message is conferred with a discounting cue (such as a low-credible source or counterargument). A sleeper effect occurs because of an impulsive dissociation of a message and a discounting cue over time (contrasting to a simple forgetting of a source).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratkanis|first=Anthony R. |author2=Leippe |author3=Greenwald |author4=Baumgardner|title=In Search of Reliable Persuasion Effects: The Sleeper Effect is Dead. Long Live the Sleeper Effect|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=54| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.2.203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First identified==
The sleeper effect was first identified in U.S. soldiers during World War II, after attempts to change their opinions and morals. Hovland et al. measured the soldier’s opinions five days or nine weeks after they were shown a movie presentation of army propaganda.  It was found that the difference in opinions of those who had observed the army propaganda movie and those who did not watch the movie were greater nine weeks after viewing it than five days.  The difference in delayed persuasion is (which Hovland et al. termed) the sleeper effect, where there was a significant increase of persuasion in the experimental group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracín |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first efforts to justify the effect were consistent with the understanding of persuasion processes at that time.  Hovland and his colleagues introduced a program of research to study how recall of the message and the source persuaded the sleeper effect.  They first hypothesized that message receivers forget the noncredible communicator as time goes by, and therefore the initial message rejection diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=CL|author2=W Weiss |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951|doi=10.1086/266350|volume=15|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they later propositioned that message receivers may not entirely forget the cue, yet the association between the representations of the discounting cue and the message content may fade over time and produce a sleeper effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=CL|author2=W Weiss |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951|doi=10.1086/266350|volume=15|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two formulations vary in that (a) '''forgetting''' suggests that the traces of the cue disappear or become unavailable in memory over time, while (b) '''dissociation''' suggests that cue remains available in memory but is simply less easily retrieved (less accessible) in relation to the topic of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracin |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses on how the sleeper effect occurs==
Because the sleeper effect has been considered to be counter-intuitive, researchers since the early 1950s have attempted to explain how and why it occurs.
[[Image:Sleeper Effect2.jpg|thumb|right|Figure A: Forgetting&lt;br /&gt;Figure B: Dissociation&lt;br /&gt;Figure C: Differential-Decay]]

===Forgetting and dissociation===
According to the forgetting hypothesis, a discounting cue associated with a message initially decreases acceptance of the message. As time goes by, one may observe a delayed increase of persuasion if the recipient forgets the cue but recalls the merits of the message (Hovland et al., 1949). To test this hypothesis, Hovland and his colleagues (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Kelman &amp; Hovland, 1953; Weiss, 1953) initiated a series of experiments in which participants received messages attributed to either trustworthy or untrustworthy sources and then completed measures of opinions as well as of recall of the message content and the source. Overall, messages with credible sources produced greater initial persuasion than messages delivered by non credible sources.

[[Carl Hovland|Hovland]], Lumsdaine, and Sheffield (1949) first discovered the effect by a well-known study that demonstrated the delayed impact of a [[World War II]] [[propaganda film|propaganda movie]] on American soldiers.

With a subset of conditions that caused participants to question the credibility of the source in the movie, participants later reported a slight increase of persuasion (much to the researchers’ surprise). After examining the results, they initially hypothesized that forgetting of the discounting cue (in this case, the non-credible source) was causing the effect. Over time, however, the effect of the messages presented by credible sources decayed, whereas the effect of the messages presented by non-credible sources either remained the same or increased slightly. Despite evidence for the sleeper effect from this series of studies, the recall measures indicated that recipients could still remember the non-credible sources of the messages at the time of the delayed follow-up.

This is when the forgetting hypothesis was replaced by the dissociation hypothesis. Now according to the dissociation hypothesis the sleeper effect does not need to imply that the discounting cue becomes permanently unavailable in memory. A weakened association between the cue and the message may be sufficient for the sleeper effect to occur. As the association weakens over time, rendering the cue less accessible in relation to the communication topic, there may be a delayed increase in persuasion as long as the message arguments are still memorable. To this extent, factors that facilitate retention of the message content should create settings conducive to the sleeper effect.

According to this reasoning, the sleeper effect occurs because the association between the discounting cue and the message in one’s memory becomes weakened over time; hence, when the message is recalled for purposes of producing an attitude, the source is not readily associated.

===Differential decay===

Something that Hovland and his team ignored that is important is why over time, the discounting cue becomes less accessible than the message even when both pieces are similarly effective at the onset.  To answer this question Greenwald, Pratkanis, and their team (Greenwald et al., 1986; Pratkanis et al., 1988) implemented a study to identify the conditions by which the sleeper effect does and does not occur.
Pratkanis directed a series of seventeen experiments in which he presented the discounting cue either before or after the message and found that the sleeper effect occurred mostly when the cue followed the message but not when the cue was first. 
In order to explain his findings, Pratkanis and his team proposed a modified forgetting hypothesis, which suggested that the sleeper effect occurs because the effect of the message and the cues decay at different rates. Based on this suggestion the message and the cue act like two communications operating in opposite directions. The sleeper effect emerges when the effect of these communications is about equal, promptly following message exposure, but the effect of the cue later decays more rapidly than that of the message. However, the timing of the discounting cue is essential to produce the effect because information presented first lasts longer, whereas more recent information dissipates more rapidly (Miller &amp; Campbell, 1959). Thus, the sleeper effect should occur when the discounting cue occurs at the end of a persuasive communication and stimulates a primacy effect of the message content.
Years later, Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe, and Baumgardner (1988) offered an [[Alternate hypothesis|alternative hypothesis]] that differed from Hovland and his colleagues.

They argued that the conditions under which the sleeper effect is more likely to occur were not emphasized by the dissociation hypothesis.  Additionally, the requirements for a sleeper effect specified by Gruder et al. (1978) did not detail the empirical conditions necessary to observe the sleeper effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">{{short description|The nearshore zone where wave water comes onto the shore}}
As [[ocean surface wave]]s come closer to [[shore]] they [[breaking wave|break]], forming the foamy, bubbly surface called [[Surfing|surf]]. The region of breaking waves defines the '''surf zone'''. After breaking in the surf zone, the waves (now reduced in height) continue to move in, and they run up onto the sloping front of the [[beach]], forming an uprush of water called [[swash]].  The water then runs back again as [[Swash#Backwash current|backswash]]. The nearshore zone where wave water comes onto the beach is the surf zone. The water in the surf zone, or breaker zone, is shallow, usually between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33&amp;nbsp;ft) deep; this causes the [[Water waves|waves]] to be unstable.

==Animal life==
The animals that often are found living in the surf zone are [[crabs]], [[clams]], and [[snails]]. Surf clams and [[mole crabs]] are two species that stand out as inhabitants of the surf zone. Both of these animals are very fast burrowers. The surf clam, also known as the variable coquina, is a filter feeder that uses its gills to filter microalgae, tiny [[zooplankton]], and small particulates out of seawater. The mole crab is a suspension feeder that eats by capturing zooplankton with its antennae. All of these creatures burrow down into the sand to escape from being pulled into the ocean from the tides and waves. They also burrow themselves in the sand to protect themselves from predators. The surf zone is full of nutrients, oxygen, and sunlight which leaves the zone very productive with animal life.

==Rip currents==

[[File:Rip Current.jpg|thumb|Rip current in the ocean. Rip currents are often very difficult to spot with one's bare eyes, take caution in any body of water]]

The surf zone can contain dangerous [[rip currents]]: strong local currents which flow offshore and pose a threat to swimmers. Rip-current outlooks use the following set of qualifications:
# ''Low-risk rip currents'': Wind and/or wave conditions are not expected to support the development of rip currents; however, rip currents can sometimes occur, especially in the vicinity of [[jetties]] and [[pier]]s. Know how to swim and heed the advice of lifeguards.
# ''Moderate-risk rip currents'': Wind and/or wave conditions support stronger or more frequent rip currents. Only experienced surf swimmers should enter the water.
# ''High-risk rip currents'': Wind and/or wave conditions support dangerous rip currents. Rip currents are life-threatening to anyone entering the surf.

The '''Sydney Observatory''' is an heritage-listed [[meteorological station]], [[Astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]], function venue, [[science museum]], and education facility located on [[Observatory Park, Sydney|Observatory Hill]] at Upper Fort Street, in the inner city [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Millers Point, New South Wales|Millers Point]] in the [[City of Sydney]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was designed by [[William Weaver (architect)|William Weaver]] (plans) and [[Alexander Dawson (architect)|Alexander Dawson]] (supervision) and built from 1857 to 1859 by Charles Bingemann &amp; Ebenezer Dewar. It is also known as '''The Sydney Observatory'''; '''Observatory'''; '''Fort Phillip'''; '''Windmill Hill'''; and '''Flagstaff Hill'''. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 22 December 2000.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5051545|Sydney Observatory|hr=01449|fn=14/47756; 09/4833; s94/0422|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was formerly a defence fort, [[Flag semaphore|semaphore station]], [[time ball|time ball station]], [[meteorological station]], observatory and [[windmill]]s. The site evolved from a fort built on 'Windmill Hill' in the early 19th century to an observatory during the nineteenth century. It is now a working museum where evening visitors can observe the stars and planets through a modern {{convert|40|cm|adj=on}} [[Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope]] and an historic {{convert|29|cm|adj=on}} [[refractor telescope]] built in 1874, the oldest telescope in Australia in regular use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.sydneyobservatory.com.au/about/aboutUs.asp|publisher=Sydney Observatory|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observatoryhilleec.nsw.edu.au/|title=Sydney Observatory|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Early use of the site===
The site of the Sydney Observatory has been a significant place in Sydney and has undergone a number of name changes. It was known as Windmill Hill in the 1790s when it was the site of the first windmill. After 1804 references are made to it as Fort Phillip or Citadel Hill, referring to the construction , but never completion, of a citadel on the site at [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]]'s instruction for use in the case of an insurrection in Sydney. This was prompted by an influx of "Death or Liberty" Boys after the abortive 1798 uprising in Ireland, some of whom he believed to be of the most desperate character and cause for constant suspicion. Construction began but the citadel was not completed until Bligh had been installed in office. There were further discussions about a citadel during the Macquarie period but nothing eventuated beyond a half built powder magazine, [[Francis Greenway]]'s first work after his appointment as civil architect in 1815.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

In 1797, early on during the European settlement of [[New South Wales]], Australia, a [[windmill]] was built on the hill above the first settlement. Within ten years the windmill had deteriorated to the point of being useless; the canvas sails were stolen, a storm damaged the machinery, and already by 1800 the foundations were giving way.  The name of [[Millers Point, New South Wales|Millers Point]] remembers this early land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.co/Attraction_Review-g255060-d256722-Reviews-Sydney_Observatory-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html|title=Sydney Observatory Reviews|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, [[Fort Philip, Sydney|Fort Philip]] was built on the site under the direction of [[John Hunter (New South Wales)|Governor Hunter]] to defend the new settlement against a possible attack by the French and also from rebellious [[Convictism in Australia|convicts]].  The fort was never required to be used for any such purposes.  In 1825 the eastern wall of the fort was converted to a signal station. Flags were used to send messages to ships in the harbour and to the [[Semaphore line|signal station]] &lt;!--guessing it was semaphore, fits in with semaphore history and photograph looks like semaphore, but not 100% sure--&gt;on the [[Sydney Heads|South Head]] of the [[Port Jackson|harbour]].

The site was known as Flagstaff Hill during and after the Macquarie era. A flagstaff had been erected on the site by 1811. Flag signalling was a cumbersome process and [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] advised Macquarie that it was expedient to erect a semaphore at South Head and Fort Phillip. The flag and semaphore were used for signalling in a variety of combinations.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

===Observatory===
[[File:Sydney Observatory at night.JPG|thumb|250px|Sydney Observatory at night]]
An early observatory was established in 1788 on [[Dawes Point]], at the foot of Observatory Hill, in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to observe in 1790 the return of a comet suggested by Edmond Halley of [[Halley's Comet]] fame.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/sydneyobservatory&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1848, a new signal station was built by the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]],  [[Mortimer Lewis]], on top of the fort wall on Windmill Hill.  At the instigation of the Governor, Sir [[William Denison]], it was agreed seven years later to build a full observatory next to the signal station.  The first [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]], [[William Scott (astronomer and clergyman)|William Scott]], was appointed in 1856, and work on the new observatory was completed in 1858.

The most important role of the observatory was to provide time through the [[Time ball|time-ball tower]]. Every day at exactly 1.00 pm, the time-ball on top of the tower would drop to signal the correct time to the city and harbour below. At the same time a cannon on Dawes Point was fired, later the cannon was moved to [[Fort Denison, New South Wales|Fort Denison]].  The first time-ball was dropped at [[noon]] on 5 June 1858.  Soon after the drop was rescheduled to one o'clock.  The time-ball is still dropped daily at 1pm using the original mechanism, but with the aid of an electric motor, not as in the early days when the ball was raised manually.

After the [[Federation of Australia|federation of Australia in 1901]],  [[meteorology]] became a function for the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Commonwealth Government]] from 1908, while the observatory continued its astronomical role.  The observatory continued to contribute observations to ''The astrographic catalogue'', kept time and provided information to the public.  For example, each day the Observatory supplied Sydney newspapers with the rising and setting times of the sun, moon and planets. A proposal to close the observatory in 1926 was narrowly avoided, but, by the mid-1970s, the increasing problems of [[air pollution]] and [[Light pollution|city light]] made work at the observatory more and more difficult. In 1982, the NSW Government decided that Sydney Observatory was to be converted into a museum of astronomy and related fields as part of what is now the [[Powerhouse Museum]].

In November 1821 [[Thomas Brisbane|Governor Brisbane]] arrived with a set of astronomical instruments, a plan for an observatory and two personal employees with astronomical expertise - Charles Rumker and James Dunlop. Brisbane set up an observatory at the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]]'s residence in [[Parramatta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/sydney-observatory-the-rocks|title=Sydney Observatory: The Rocks|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems developed between Brisbane and Rumker. Rumker lost his position and it was not until Brisbane had been recalled that Rumker was reinstated by the Colonial Secretary. The following year [[Ralph Darling|Governor Darling]], the new Governor, appointed Rumker as [[Government of New South Wales|Government]] Astronomer, the first to hold the title in Australia. In 1831 Dunlop was appointed Superintendent at the observatory, Rumker again losing his position while on a visit to London.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

Brisbane's instruments remained at Parramatta when he left and they were used in that observatory until it was closed in 1847. The recommendation for the closure came from a commission appointed by [[Charles Augustus FitzRoy|Governor Fitzroy]] at the prompting of London. Dunlop had become increasingly frail and negligent and the Parramatta observatory had fallen into decay. The instruments were placed in ordnance storage at the urge of [[Phillip Parker King]], a leading astronomer in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

====Construction of an observatory====
King argued that a government observatory should be set up, and not just the suggested time ball. King's preference for Fort Phillip to be the site was eventually accepted. In the eight years from [[Edmund Blacket]]'s modest 1850 plan for the time ball observatory until its completion, the plans underwent progressive enlargement. The 1850 plan was a {{convert|13|by|14|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} room for a transit telescope and timekeeping apparatus with a small ante-room. In 1851 an enlarged version was presented to the Colonial Secretary but it had no time ball tower, because neither King or Blacket, the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]], knew how it worked. The need for an Observer's dwelling was noted.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

Plans were redrawn in the next couple of years. When Blacket resigned in 1854 to take on the design and supervision of construction of [[The University of Sydney]], plans were underway for an observatory that would be both functional and of architectural quality. Blacket's successor, William Weaver, replaced him on the observatory project. Weaver was appointed Colonial Architect in October 1854. Correspondence from him to Blacket in the early years indicates that Weaver was much happier in direct supervision of works than performing the duties of his desk-bound role. As head of an over-loaded department, he complained:&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

{{blockquote|"The arrangements for the performance of the various works, the official correspondence, the number of reports, and the examination of accounts, absorb nearly the whole time of the head of department, who practically can have little or no professional oversight of any work".}}

A Select Committee on the Colonial Architect's Department in August 1855 questioned an overpayment to the stonemasonry contractor of the Dead House at [[Circular Quay]] and accused him of defrauding the Government. Weaver, as head of the Department, was accused of negligence for paying him and subsequently submitted his resignation in apparent disgust. Weaver was only 18 months as Colonial Architect and of the two major architectural works to come from his Department during his term in office, the Government Printing Office at the corner of Phillip and Bent Streets no longer stands and the Sydney Observatory has been generally attributed to his successor. In fact, [[William Denison|Sir William Denison]] approved Weaver's plans "for an Observatory and Astronomical resicence" in August 1855 after some specifications supplied by Denison had been incorporated. When building commenced a year later the new Colonial Architect Alexander Dawson adopted those plans.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449-1449-1&gt;Maguire, 1984, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

Little more was done until the arrival of Sir William Denison as Governor General in January 1855. Denison saw an observatory as an important addition to the colony. As a result the {{Australian pound|600}} allocated to the time ball and building was augmented by an additional vote of {{Australian pound|7,000}} for a complete observatory and Denison wrote to the Astronomer Royal asking him to find a competent astronomer. Plans and estimates were submitted in August 1855 but Denison decided to defer the final decision on the site and design until the arrival of the astronomer.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

Alexander Dawson replaced Weaver as Colonial Architect in April 1856 and the new Government Astronomer, Reverend William Scott, M.A., arrived with his family in October that year. Tenders for the construction were advertised in February 1857. The successful tenderers were Charles Bingemenn and Ebenezer Dewar. The plans used appear to have been the work of Dawson rather than those of his predecessors, there being numerous references by Scott to consultations with the Colonial Architect on the design of the building. Extra work was approved after Bingemann and Dewar won their tender. This included the addition of a telescope dome and an increase in the height of the time ball tower. This increased height caused some dismay for Scott as it blocked out an increased area of the eastern sky.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

The completed building combined, for the first time in a major Sydney building, two architectural streams - Italian High Renaissance Palazzo and the Italian Villa forms. These contributed the symmetry of the townhouse facade for the residence and an asymmetry for the observatory born of the peculiar needs of transit room, equatorial dome and time ball tower. The building was thus elevated from basic necessity to fashionable stylishness. Dawson's budget had enabled him to emphasise the distinction between the private and the public, the domestic and the official. The style and form was overlaid with early Victorian theories of fitness and association, that style should be chosen to indicate the nature and status of the building and in some cases, the site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

====Operations, 1858 to 1980s====
Scott occupied the residence in 1858 and commenced a trial operation of the time ball in June. His initial equipment was modest, mostly the instruments from Parramatta. He did, however, obtain the money for an equatorial telescope. In 1862 Scott resigned, recommending prominent amateur astronomer [[John Tebbutt]] as his replacement. Tebbutt declined the offer and the search for a replacement was commenced. In the meantime, his assistant [[Henry Chamberlain Russell]] was left in charge of the observatory. In January 1864 the new appointee George Robarts Smalley arrived and Russell was his second in command.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

In 1870 Smalley died and was replaced by Russell. Russell's talent, entrepreneurial flair, intimate knowledge of how to work the political and bureaucratic system of NSW and longevity gave him a 35-year tenure as Government Astronomer and made him the Grand Old Man of physical science in the colonies. It was during Russell's period that Sydney Observatory was popularly believed to have been at its professional zenith, particularly from the 1870s through to the 1890s. Russell wasted no time in pressing the government for the necessary physical and instrumental resources to carry out his astronomical programs at the Observatory. The addition of a west wing designed by colonial architect James Barnett was the main work resulting from this. It provided for a major ground floor room for Russell, a library, a second equatorial dome on a tower at its northern extremity which removed the blind spot imposed by the time ball tower. An enlarged Muntz metal dome was also placed on the old equatorial tower to accommodate a new Schroeder telescope. The telescope remains a prized and functional possession today. Russell also turned his attention to improving the residence, claiming it was not large enough to accommodate his family. In 1875 Russell succeeded in securing an extension of the Observatory enclosure. Like his predecessors, he had been concerned with the restrictive nature of the Observatory grounds which made siting of meteorological and auxiliary astronomical instruments difficult, if not impossible. This extension, together with the adjacent signal station give the site its present symmetrical perimeter. The Astrographic Catalogue was Russell's greatest commitment and would affect programs at the observatory for 80 years. His interest in the application of photography to astronomy and a visit to Paris in 1887 prompted Russell to take part in a "great star catalogue". The Sydney Zone of the catalogue was a massive logistical enterprise and was not practically completed until 1964. Russell died in 1907 after taking leave for an extended period of time due to ill health. His assistant Alfred Lenehan was appointed acting Government Astronomer during this period and later Government Astronomer in 1907. However, in 1906 a premier's conference resolved that the Commonwealth Government would take over meteorological work, leaving astronomy to the states. Thus, the meteorological section of the Observatory became a Commonwealth agency under the direction of a former officer of the Observatory, Henry Hunt. Lenehan and Hunt continuously quarrelled and did not develop a good working relationship.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

In January 1908 Lenehan had a stroke and never returned to work. At the same time the Commonwealth agency was installed in the Observatory residence. William Edward Raymond, the officer responsible for transit work, became officer in charge for four years, until the appointment of William Ernest Cooke in 1912. Cooke was lured to Sydney from [[Perth]] Observatory with promises of a new site located in Wahroongah, then free of city lights and traffic, the purchase of modern instruments and a world trip to investigate the latest developments. None of these eventuated during Cooke's fourteen years at the observatory. In 1916 the board of visitors to the Observatory was reconstituted. Russell had allowed it to lapse during his term of office and in 1917 the residence was again inhabited by the Astronomer.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

[[File:Photoheliograph Sydney Observatory 02.JPG|thumb|[[Photoheliograph]] used to photograph the sun.]]All government astronomers from Scott to Cooke were worried about increasing levels of city light, vibration from traffic and magnetic disturbance which rendered the Flagstaff Hill site increasingly unsuitable. Recommendations had been made by Smalley in 1864 and others in the first quarter of the twentieth century. While Russell had managed to have the astrographic telescope relocated to [[Pennant Hills, New South Wales|Pennant Hills]], there was general worry over the reaction to the cost of relocation of the whole observatory. In July 1925 Cooke wrote to his minister pointing out the problems at the site and with the equipment. The State Cabinet took him at his word and in October decided to close the Observatory rather than face the cost of removal and re-equipment. However, protests from the Board of Visitors, the Royal Society of NSW, the NSW Branch of the British Astronomical Association, the University of Sydney and interested members of the public caused the Government to change its mind and allow the observatory to continue - but with a heavily reduced staff and program. Most of the staff were transferred to other departments and Cooke was retired the following year. Only the time ball and completion of the astrographic program survived. This experience inhibited later Government Astronomers in their arguments for a new site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

Two World Wars, a great depression and a commitment to a logistically exacting astrographic program helped reduce the vitality of the establishment in the twentieth century. The deployment of major resources to the astrographic program became something of an incubus as the twentieth century progressed. The Government Astronomers could not suspend or abort the program even if they had thought it desirable. At the same time the fulfilment of international obligations under the program was largely instrumental in the survival of the Observatory.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

The completion of the program in 1964 and publication of the final volume in 1971 meant the Observatory's days were numbered. Other fundamental reasons also contributed to the notion that the Observatory was no longer a viable proposition. The transfer of meteorology to the Commonwealth in 1908 removed the Observatory's most high profile public service, electric telegraphy and radio had reduced and in time eliminated the need for local navigational and time services. Ambient city light was starting to  restrict astronomical observation though the place was still suitable for the time consuming analysis of the observations and other astronomical work together with functions such as a public observatory and a centre for public and media enquiries.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

Post [[World War II]] was an exciting time for Australian astronomical development, particularly in radio astronomy. These developments bypassed Sydney though the Government Astronomer Harley Wood kept a close involvement as the first president of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA) in 1966 and as the co-ordinator of the first International Astronomical Union (IAU) General Assembly to be held in the southern hemisphere in Sydney, 1973. Without major capital funds to develop its own specialisations in the west, Sydney remained tied to its traditional role. Despite this there was some positive activity at the Observatory. During the 1950s and 1960s under Wood, the Observatory enjoyed a modest renaissance. Staff numbers were built up and new equipment acquired. Both the Sydney and [[Melbourne]] sections of the Astrographic catalogue were completed and published.  A new domed building was constructed in the south east corner of the Observatory to house the Melbourne star camera that replaced the original Sydney one. A new survey of the southern sky was commenced and by 1982 Wood's successor William Robertson had completed the photography and measurement was underway. Education was another aspect of the observatory's work that Wood developed. Always one of its aims, increasing numbers of visitors, including teaching students, attended the Observatory.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

These activities commanded respect for Sydney Observatory in astronomical circles, but its image in the [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW Parliament]] and associated Public Service remained forgettable. Wood's annual reports failed to help this. They did not communicate any sense of excitement and worth in the Observatory.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

====Disestablishment as a functioning observatory====
The disestablishment of the Observatory echoed that of fifty years earlier when Cooke stressed the need for a new location. The Chairman of the Board of Visitors wrote a letter to the [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] in 1979 urging the establishment of a remote observing site for the Observatory and stressing the difficulty of the conditions at the existing site. This co-incided with a nation-wide review of astronomy facilities commissioned by the ASA and led by [[Monash University]] Professor of Astronomy Kevin Westfold (1980) This concluded that astronomy was a federal responsibility and that resources should be allocated to research operations, highlighting radio astronomy. It should also be noted that the State of NSW was in financial difficulties. This, and likely other pressures, resulted in a letter from the Premier in June 1982 announcing his decision to transfer the Observatory to the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences and discontinue scientific work. Despite letters from international astronomers, and a concerted offort from now-retired Harley Wood, the Government did not rescind its decision.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

In July 1984 the Minister for [[NSW Public Works|Public Works]], Ports and Roads announced an $800,000 project to restore Sydney Observatory for astronomy education, public observatory and a Museum of Astronomy. While the importance of the exterior was recognised, the interior was less fortunate. Work inside the building in the creation of the museum involved the staged removal of almost all instruments, equipment, and furniture and furnishings to the Museum's store.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449-1449-2&gt;Kerr 1991: 1-38&lt;/ref&gt; The astrographic building was demolished and the dome, instruments and most of the glass plate and paper collection was removed to [[Macquarie University]] for future research use.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

In 1997 the observatory was refurbished, this time instruments were returned to their original locations or showcased. 'The "By the light of the Southern Stars" exhibition theme also included the Parramatta Observatory instruments and Indigenous Astronomy. In 1999 a major stonemasonry repair project on the observatory building commenced. This continued through to 2008.  In 2002 the conservation plan was updated by Kerr, this time complimentary on the relocation and interpretation of the instruments.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

A number of key astronomical events haveoccurred in recent years, most notable are Halleys Comet (1986), The impact of Shoemaker Levy on Jupiter (1994), [[Mars, New South Wales|Mars]] at its closest encounter (2003), transits of Venus (2004, 2012), Comet McNaught (2007), planetary alignments and eclipses. Thousands of people came to the Observatory to view these through telescopes and to see relevant exhibitions. Further the Observatory provided information about these events to many more people either directly or through the media.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

In 2008, for the 150th anniversary, the Signal Station building was stabilised, one of the original two flagstaffs re-constructed and an archaeological investigation commenced around the base of the fort led by NSW Government Architects, building design and Heritage office and Casey and Lowe. Original fort footings were uncovered and the base of a room which was once a bombproof inside the fort wall foundations.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

In 2009 permission was granted for a temporary marquee to be erected for a restricted period of time in order to raise funds. Furthermore the Astrographic dome and instruments have been returned by Macquarie University to the Museum store where they are awaiting conservation and a Heritage NSW approved structure on the Observatory site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt; The most significant change to Sydney Observatory in 50 years, the new Eastern Dome was opened on 27 January 2015, by the [[Deputy Premier of New South Wales|Deputy Premier]] [[Troy Grant]] and Minister for Disability Services, [[John Ajaka]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Central Sydney'', 28 January 2015, p7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georg Merz and Sons, vintage 7.25-inch refracting telescope===
Located at the Sydney Observatory is a vintage 7.25-inch refracting telescope on an [[Equatorial mount]] that was manufactured by the German company Georg Merz and Sons between 1860 and 1861.  The 7.25-inch [[Merz Telescopes|Merz refracting telescope]] arrived at Sydney Observatory, Sydney, Australia, in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/480704/view|title=7.25-inch telescope, refracting telescope, on an equatorial mount, was made by the German company Georg Merz and Sons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The observatory is a [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] two-storey building in the [[Italianate]] style.  There are two telescope [[Dome|domes]] on octagonal bases and a four-storey tower for the time-ball.  The 1858 building designed by the Colonial Architect, [[Alexander Dawson (architect)|Alexander Dawson]], comprised a dome to house the [[Equatorial mount|equatorial telescope]], a room with long, narrow windows for the [[transit telescope]], an office for calculations, and a residence for the [[astronomer]]. A western wing was added in 1877 with office and library space and a second dome for another telescope.  Some of the first astronomical photographs of the southern sky were taken at the observatory, under the direction of [[Henry Chamberlain Russell]].  The observatory also took part in the compilation of the first [[atlas]] of the whole sky, [[Star catalogue#AC|''The astrographic catalogue'']].  The part completed at Sydney took over 70 years, from 1899 to 1971, and filled 53 volumes. The observatory once contained offices, instruments, a library and an astronomer's residence. It is now a public observatory and a museum of astronomy and meteorology.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

The building is of [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Renaissance Revival|Florentine Renaissance]] style and the storeys are divided by string courses while articulated [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] at corners, stone bracketed [[eaves]] and [[Entablature|entablatures]] to openings of the residence contribute to the fine stone masonry work. A single storey wing to the north has had a timber [[balcony]] [[Veranda|verandah]] with a stone [[balustrade]] built above. Windows are of twelve pane type and the doors are six panels.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449-1449-3&gt;Sheedy 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

The physical condition is good.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 20 October 2005, the Observatory is of exceptional significance in terms of European culture. Its dominant location beside and above the port town and, later, [[City of Sydney]] made it the site for a range of changing uses, all of which were important to, and reflected, stages in the development of the colony.  These uses included: milling (the first windmill); defence (the first, and still extant, fort fabric); communications (the flagstaffs, first semaphore and first electric telegraph connection); astronomy, meteorology and time keeping. The surviving structures, both above and below ground, are themselves physical documentary evidence of 195 years changes of use, technical development and ways of living.  As such they are a continuing resource for investigation and public interpretation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

The place has an association with an extensive array of historical figures most of whom have helped shape its fabric.  These include: colonial Governors Hunter, Bligh, Macquarie &amp; Denison; military officers and engineers Macarthur; Barrallier; Bellasis and Minchin; convicts: the as yet unnamed constructors of the mill and fort; architects: Greenway (also a convict), Lewis, Blacket, Weaver, Dawson and Barnet; signallers and telegraphists such as Jones and the family Moffitt; astronomers: particularly PP King, Scott, Smalley, Russell, Cooke and Wood.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt; The elevation of the site, with its harbour and city views and vistas framed by mature Moreton Bay fig (''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'') trees of the surrounding park, make it one of the most pleasant and spectacular locations in Sydney.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

The picturesque Italianate character and stylistic interest of the Observatory and residence building, together with the high level of competence of the masonry (brick and stone) of all major structures on the site, combine to create a precinct of unusual quality;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt; Finally, the continued use of the observatory for astronomical observations and the survival of astronomical instruments, equipment (Appendix 4) and some early furniture (Appendix 3), although temporarily dispersed, and the retention of most interior spaces, joinery, plasterwork, fireplaces, and supports ensure that the observatory can remain the most intact and longest serving early scientific building in the State.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449-1449-9&gt;Kerr 1991: 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt; Also of significance for relationship of Commonwealth and State powers. Site of the first intercolonial conference on meterology and astronomy.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449-1449-10&gt;Pearson, ''et al'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt; An excellent example of a Colonial building erected for scientific purposes and continuing to perform its function at the present time. The structure makes an imposing composition atop the historic hill originally known as Flagstaff Hill and occupies the historic Fort Phillip site (1804-45). Designed by the colonial architect Alexander Dawson and built in 1858.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AHC&lt;/ref&gt;

Sydney Observatory was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

The Observatory's dominant location beside and above the port town, and later, city of Sydney, made it the site for a range of changing uses. All of these were important to, and reflected changes in the development of the colony.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt; The place has an association with an extensive array of historical figures, most of whom have helped shape its fabric. These include colonial governors, military officers and enginees, convicts, architects and astronomers&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449-1449-9/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The elevation of the site with its harbour and city views and vistas framed by the mature fig trees of the surrounding park, make it one of the most pleasant and spectacular locations. The picturesque Italianate character and stylistic interest of the observatory and residence building, together with the high level of competence of the masonry (both stone and brick) of all major structures on the site, combine to create a precinct of unusual quality.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449-1449-9/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The surviving structures, both above and below ground, are themselves physical documentary evidence of 195 years of changes of use, technical development and ways of living. As such they are a continuing resource for investigation and public interpretation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449-1449-11&gt;Kerr 1991:39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1449/&gt;

In the early 1990s, a new type of [[sliding mode control]], named '''terminal sliding modes''' (TSM) was invented at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) by Venkataraman and Gulati.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkataraman|first=S. T.|last2=Gulati|first2=S.|date=June 1992|title=Control of Nonlinear Systems Using Terminal Sliding Modes|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4792209/|journal=1992 American Control Conference|pages=891–893}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSM is [[Robust control|robust]] [[Nonlinear control|non-linear control]] approach.

The main idea of terminal sliding mode control evolved out of seminal work on terminal attractors done by Zak in the JPL, and is evoked by the concept of terminal attractors which guarantee finite time convergence of the states. While, in normal sliding mode, [[Lyapunov stability|asymptotic stability]] is promised which leads to the convergence of the states to the origin.
But this convergence may only be guaranteed within infinite time. In TSM, a [[nonlinear]] term is introduced in the sliding surface design so that the manifold is formulated as an attractor. After the sliding surface is intercepted, the trajectory is attracted within the manifold and converges to the origin following a power rule.

There are some variations of the TSM including: Non-singular TSM,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002-12-01|title=Non-singular terminal sliding mode control of rigid manipulators|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109802001474|journal=Automatica|language=en|volume=38|issue=12|pages=2159–2167|doi=10.1016/S0005-1098(02)00147-4|issn=0005-1098|last1=Feng|first1=Yong|last2=Yu|first2=Xinghuo|last3=Man|first3=Zhihong}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fast TSM,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Xinghuo|last2=Zhihong|first2=Man|date=February 2002|title=Fast terminal sliding-mode control design for nonlinear dynamical systems|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/983876/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications|volume=49|issue=2|pages=261–264|doi=10.1109/81.983876|issn=1057-7122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminal sliding mode also has been widely applied to nonlinear process control, for example, rigid robot control etc.. Several open questions still remain on the mathematical treatment of the system's behavior at the origin since it is non-Lipschitz.

==Control Scheme==
Consider a continuous nonlinear system in canonical form

&lt;math&gt;\overset{\cdot}{x}_{1}(t) =x_{2}(t) &lt;/math&gt; ......

&lt;math&gt;\overset{\cdot}{x}_{n-1}(t) =x_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overset{\cdot}{x}_{n}(t)=a(x)+b(x)u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x(t)\in  R^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the state vector, &lt;math&gt;u\in R&lt;/math&gt; is the control
input, &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b(x)&lt;/math&gt; are nonlinear functions in &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then a sequence of terminal sliding surfaces can be designed as follows:

&lt;math&gt;s_{1}(t) =\overset{\cdot }{s}_{0}(t)+\alpha _{1}(t)s_{0}^{\gamma _{1}}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s_{2}(t) =\overset{\cdot }{s}_{1}(t)+\alpha _{2}(t)s_{1}^{\gamma _{2}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; ......

&lt;math&gt;s_{n-1}(t) =\overset{\cdot }{s}_{n-2}(t)+\alpha _{n-1}(t)s_{n-2}^{\gamma
_{n-1}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s_{0}(t)=x_{1}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma _{i}=\frac{p_{i}}{q_{i}}, i=1,2,...,n-1&lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt;p_{i}, q_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are positive odd numbers and &lt;math&gt;p_{i}\leq q_{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10951">A '''test method''' is a [[methodology|method]] for a test in [[science]] or [[engineering]], such as a [[physical test]], [[chemical test]], or [[statistical hypothesis testing|statistical test]]. It is a definitive procedure that produces a test result.&lt;ref name="ASTMForm17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.astm.org/FormStyle_for_ASTM_STDS.html |title=Form and Style for ASTM Standards |publisher=ASTM International |date=October 2017 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure accurate and relevant test results, a test method should be "explicit, unambiguous, and experimentally feasible."&lt;ref name="ASTM335_63"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eN5rTdbiXUkC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=ASTM Manual for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study of a Test Method |author=Committee E-11 on Quality Control of Materials |publisher=American Society for Testing and Materials |year=1963 |page=3 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as effective&lt;ref name="NighTest00"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Test method evaluation experiments and data |journal=Proceedings from the International Test Conference, 2000 |author=Nigh, P.; Gattiker, A. |volume=2000 |year=2000 |pages=454–463 |doi=10.1109/TEST.2000.894237}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reproducible.&lt;ref name="BridwellPerspectives10"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perspectives on Method Validation: Importance of Adequate Method Validation |journal=The Quality Assurance Journal |author=Bridwell, H.; Dhingra, V.; Peckman, D. et al. |volume=13 |issue=3–4 |pages=72–77 |year=2010 |doi=10.1002/qaj.473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test can be considered an [[observation]] or [[experiment]] that determines one or more characteristics of a given sample, product, process, or service. The purpose of testing involves a prior determination of expected observation and a comparison of that expectation to what one actually observes.&lt;ref name="UCMPGlossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/glossary/glossary.php?start=s&amp;end=z |title=Glossary: S–Z |work=Understanding Science |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of testing can be [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] (yes/no), [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] (a measured value), or [[Categorical variable|categorical]] and can be derived from personal [[observation]] or the output of a precision [[measuring instrument]].

Usually the test result is the [[dependent variable]], the measured response based on the particular conditions of the test or the level of the [[independent variable]]. Some tests, however, may involve changing the independent variable to determine the level at which a certain response occurs: in this case, the test result is the independent variable.

==Importance==
In [[software development]], [[engineering]], [[science]], [[manufacturing]], and [[business]], its developers, researchers, manufacturers, and related personnel must understand and agree upon methods of obtaining data and making [[measurement]]s. It is common for a [[physical property]] to be strongly affected by the precise method of testing or measuring that property. As such, fully documenting [[experiment]]s and measurements while providing needed documentation and descriptions of [[specification]]s, [[contract]]s, and test methods is vital.&lt;ref name="APLACWhy08"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cala.ca/iad_APLAC_TC_011_draft-3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Why are these rest results so different?: The importance of testing methods in chemical and microbiological testing |publisher=Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation |date=January 2008 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASTM335_63" /&gt;

Using a [[Technical standard|standardized]] test method, perhaps published by a respected [[standards organization]], is a good place to start. Sometimes it is more useful to modify an existing test method or to develop a new one, though such home-grown test methods should be validated&lt;ref name="BridwellPerspectives10" /&gt; and, in certain cases, demonstrate technical equivalency to primary, standardized methods.&lt;ref name="APLACWhy08" /&gt; Again, documentation and full disclosure are necessary.&lt;ref name="ASTM335_63" /&gt;

A well-written test method is important. However, even more important is choosing a method of measuring the correct property or characteristic. Not all tests and measurements are equally useful: usually a test result is used to predict or imply suitability for a certain purpose.&lt;ref name="ASTM335_63" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NighTest00" /&gt; For example, if a manufactured item has several components, test methods may have several levels of connections:

* test results of a raw material should connect with tests of a component made from that material
* test results of a component should connect with [[Performance test (assessment)|performance testing]] of a complete item
* results of laboratory performance testing should connect with field performance

These connections or [[correlation]]s may be based on published literature, engineering studies, or formal programs such as [[quality function deployment]]. [[Verification and validation|Validation]] of the suitability of the test method is often required.&lt;ref name="BridwellPerspectives10" /&gt;

==Content==
[[Quality management system]]s usually require full documentation of the procedures used in a test. The document for a test method might include&lt;ref name="SnodgrassISO14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aafco.org/Portals/0/SiteContent/Regulatory/Committees/Lab-Methods-and-Services/Presentations/2014_Annual-ISO_17025-QMS_Panel-Final_v2.pdf |format=PDF |title=ISO 17025 Accreditation/Quality Management Systems Panel Discussion |author=Snodgrass, B.; Grant, T.; McCallum, K. et al. |publisher=Association of American Feed Control Officials |date=26 July 2014 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HigginsTest09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszcah/G53QAT/Presentations09/jxo07u/QATpresentations-JXO07u.ppt |format=PPT |title=Test Design and Documentation |author=Higgins, C. |publisher=University of Nottingham |date=2009 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

== Validation ==
Test methods are often scrutinized for their validity, applicability, and accuracy. It is very important that the scope of the test method be clearly defined, and any aspect included in the scope is shown to be accurate and repeatable through validation.&lt;ref name="BridwellPerspectives10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SnodgrassISO14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APHLTest"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aphl.org/programs/food_safety/laboratory-accreditation/Documents/10,%20Test%20methods,%20validation,%20verification/Quality%20Management%20System%20Test%20Method%20Validation%20and%20Verification%20Learning%20Aid%202017.pdf |format=PDF |title=Test Method, Validation and Verification of Methods: APHL Quality Management System (QMS) Competency Guidelines |publisher=Association of Public Health Laboratories |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDALabMan14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ScienceResearch/FieldScience/LaboratoryManual/UCM092012.pdf |format=PDF |title=5.4 Test Methods and Method Validation |work=Laboratory Manual Of Quality Policies For ORA Regulatory Laboratories: Volume 1 |author=Office of Regulatory Science |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test method validations often encompass the following considerations&lt;ref name="ASTM335_63" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BridwellPerspectives10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SnodgrassISO14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APHLTest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FDALabMan14" /&gt;:

* [[accuracy and precision]]; demonstration of accuracy may require the creation of a reference value if none is yet available
* [[repeatability]] and [[Reproducibility Project|reproducibility]], sometimes in the form of a [[ANOVA gauge R&amp;R|Gauge R&amp;R]].
* range, or a continuum scale over which the test method would be considered accurate (e.g., 10 N to 100 N force test)

'''''The Whetstone of Witte''''' is the shortened title of [[Robert Recorde]]'s [[mathematics]] book published in 1557, the full title being '''''The whetstone of witte, whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmetike: containyng thextraction of Rootes: The ''Coßike'' practise, with the rule of ''Equation'': and the woorkes of ''Surde Nombers'''. The book covers topics including whole numbers, the extraction of roots and irrational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1007/978-0-85729-862-1_10|title=Robert Recorde: Tudor Polymath, Expositor and Practitioner of Computation|series=History of Computing|first=Jack|last=Williams|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9780857298621|contribution=The Whetstone of Witte|pages=173–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is notable for containing the first recorded use of the [[equals sign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Galileo's Finger:The Ten Great Ideas of Science|first=Peter|last=Atkins|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780191622502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJyXzvkXWBAC&amp;pg=PT484|page=484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also for being the first book in English to use the [[plus and minus signs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|first=Florian|last=Cajori|authorlink=Florian Cajori|publisher=Cosimo|year=2007|isbn=9781602066847|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhEh8jPGQOcC&amp;pg=PA164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime factor exponent notation|Recordian notation]] for [[exponentiation]], however, differed from the later Cartesian notation &lt;math&gt;p^q = p \times p \times p \cdots \times p&lt;/math&gt;.  Recorde expressed [[exponent|indices]] and [[Nth root|surds]] larger than 3 in a systematic form based on the [[prime factorization]] of the exponent: a factor of two he termed a ''zenzic'', and a factor of three, a ''cubic''. Recorde termed the larger prime numbers appearing in this factorization ''sursolids'', distinguishing between them by use of ordinal numbers: that is, he defined 5 as the ''first sursolid'', written as '''ʃz''' and 7 as the ''second sursolid'', written as '''Bʃz'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
He also devised symbols for these factors: a zenzic was denoted by '''z''', and a cubic by '''&amp;'''.  For instance, he referred to ''p&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;2×2×2&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''zzz''' (the [[zenzizenzizenzic]]), and ''q&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;=q&lt;sup&gt;2×2×3&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''zz&amp;''' (the zenzizenzicubic).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the book he includes a chart of exponents all the way up to ''p&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;2×2×2x2x5&lt;/sup&gt;'' written as '''zzzzʃz'''. There is an error in the chart, however, writing ''p&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''Sʃz''', despite it not being a prime. It should be ''p&lt;sup&gt;3x23&lt;/sup&gt;'' or '''&amp;Gʃz'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zenodo''' is a general-purpose [[open-access repository]] by [[OpenAIRE]] and [[CERN]].&lt;ref name=suber&gt;{{cite book |title=Open Access book |chapter=10 self help |url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/?title=Open_Access_%28the_book%29&amp;oldid=5242#Chapter_10:_Self-Help |author=Peter Suber |year=2012 |publisher=MIT |isbn=9780262517638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suberhow&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/How_to_make_your_own_work_open_access#Deposit_in_an_OA_repository_.28.22green.22_OA.29 | title=How to make your own work open access – Harvard Open Access Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

It was created in 2013 as the OpenAire orphan records repository,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2018-11-14 |title=CERN and OpenAIREplus launch new European research repository |url=https://sciencenode.org/feature/cern-and-openaireplus-launch-new-european-research-repository.php |newspaper=Science Node}}&lt;/ref&gt; to let researchers in any subject area to comply with any [[open science]] deposit requirement absent an [[institutional repository]].
It was re-launched as Zenodo in 2015 to provide a place for researchers to deposit datasets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zenodo Launches! |url=https://www.openaire.eu/zenodo-is-launched |website=OpenAIRE |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows upload files up to 50&amp;nbsp;GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zenodo – FAQ |url=https://zenodo.org/faq |accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sicilia |first=Miguel-Angel |last2=García-Barriocanal |first2=Elena |last3=Sánchez-Alonso |first3=Salvador |title=Community Curation in Open Dataset Repositories: Insights from Zenodo |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050917302776 |journal=Procedia Computer Science |volume=106 |pages=54–60 |doi=10.1016/j.procs.2017.03.009 |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's recommended by [[Peter Suber]] as [[green open access]] repository in his instructions for researchers.&lt;ref name=suberhow/&gt;&lt;ref name=suber/&gt;

It provides a DOI to datasets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1045/january2016-herterich |title=Data Citation Services in the High-Energy Physics Community |journal=D-Lib Magazine |volume=22 |year=2016 |last1=Herterich |first1=Patricia |last2=Dallmeier-Tiessen |first2=Sünje |url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january16/herterich/01herterich.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other submitted data which lacks one, to make the work easier to cite and supports various data and license types. One supported source are [[GitHub]] repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making Your Code Citable |url=https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/ |website=GitHub |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zenodo took part in [[Google Summer of Code]] 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4630502569934848/ |title=Google Summer of Code |website=summerofcode.withgoogle.com |language=en |access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
