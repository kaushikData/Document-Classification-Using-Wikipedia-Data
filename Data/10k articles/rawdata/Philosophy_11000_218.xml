The '''"I AM" Movement''' is the original [[Ascended Master Teachings]] [[New religious movement|religious movement]] founded in the early 1930s by [[Guy Ballard]] (1878&amp;ndash;1939) and his [[Edna Anne Wheeler Ballard]] (1886–1971) in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Saint Germain Foundation.

==Overview==

The movement believes in the existence of a group called the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]], a hierarchy of supernatural beings that includes the original Theosophical Masters such as [[Ascended master#Jesus|Jesus Christ]], [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya Khan]], [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], and in addition several dozen more beyond the original 20 [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] of the original [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] as described by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]].

These "Ascended Masters" are believed to be humans who have lived in a succession of [[reincarnations]] in physical bodies. Over time they became highly advanced souls, able to move beyond the cycles of "re-embodiment" and [[karma]], and attained their "Ascension", becoming immortal. The Ascended Masters are believed to communicate to humanity through certain [[Amanuenses|trained messengers]] per Blavatsky, including Guy and [[Edna Anne Wheeler Ballard|Edna Ballard]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="partridge" /&gt; Because Jesus is believed to be one of the Ascended Masters, making the "Christ Light" available to seekers who wish to move out of darkness, many of the members of the "I AM" Activity consider it to be a Christian religion.&lt;ref name="UnivVirginia"/&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Magazine]]'', Ballard said he was the re-embodiment of [[George Washington]], an Egyptian priest, and a noted French musician.&lt;ref name="lamag" /&gt;

The "I AM" Activity was the continuation of the teachings received by [[Helena Blavatsky|H. P. Blavatsky]] and [[William Quan Judge]]. Ballard was always guided and inspired by the writings of William Quan Judge (1851-1896), who used the pseudonym David Lloyd due to the persecution of his enemies in the [[Theosophical Society]]. Then Ballard came in contact with the Mahatma called "Ascended Master" Saint Germain.

Ballard died in 1939. In 1942 his wife and son were convicted of fraud,&lt;ref name="scotus"&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/322/78/case.html United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamag"&gt;{{cite news |first= Joshua |last=Thompkins |title=The mighty I Am: Cult led by Guy Ballard |publisher=[[Los Angeles Magazine]] |date= April 1, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; a conviction which was overturned in a landmark [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision, ruling that the question of whether the Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to a jury.&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The "I AM" Activity was founded by [[Guy Ballard]] (pseudonym Godfré Ray King) in the early 1930s.  Ballard was well-read in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and its offshoots, and while hiking on [[Mount Shasta]] looking for a rumored branch of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] known as "The Brotherhood of Mount Shasta", he claimed to have met and been instructed by a man who introduced himself as "Saint Germain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Godfré Ray |year=1935 |orig-year=1934 |title=Unveiled Mysteries |url=https://archive.org/stream/02TheMagicPresenceByGodfrRayKing1935FirstEdition/%2301%20-%20Unveiled%20Mysteries%2C%20by%20Godfr%C3%A9%20Ray%20King%20-%201935%20-Second%20Edition#page/n1 |publisher=Saint Germain Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |edition=Second |chapter=1: Meeting the Master |pages=1-32 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Saint Germain]] is regular component of theosophical religions as an Ascended Master, based on the historical [[Comte de Saint-Germain]], an 18th-century adventurer.&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sects, 'Cults', and Alternative Religions: A World Survey and Sourcebook|last= Barrett|first= David|year= 1996|publisher= Blandford|location= London|isbn= 0-7137-2567-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The Ballards said they began talking to the Ascended Masters regularly.  They founded a publishing house, ''Saint Germain Press'', to publish their books and began training people to spread their messages across the United States.  These training sessions and "Conclaves" were held throughout the United States and were open to the general public and free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the "I AM"'' Number 1, March 1936. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press. page 27&lt;/ref&gt; A front-page story in a 1938 edition of the ''Chicago Herald and Examiner'' noted that the Ballards "do not take up collections or ask for funds".&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;''Chicago Herald and Examiner'' October 8, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original members of I AM were recruited from the ranks of [[William Dudley Pelley]]’s organization the [[Silver Shirts]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Meetings became limited to members only after hecklers began disrupting their open meetings.&lt;ref name="partridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;  Over their lifetimes, the Ballard's recorded nearly 4,000 Live dictations, which they said were from the Ascended Masters.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Guy Ballard, his wife Edna, and later his son Donald became the sole "Accredited Messengers" of the Ascended Masters.&lt;ref name="barrett"/&gt;

=== Popularity ===

The Ballards' popularity spread, including up to a million followers in 1938.&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;  They accepted donations (called "love gifts") from their followers across the country, though no such donation or dues were required.&lt;ref name="Herald"  /&gt;

The first of many "Conclaves" held in scores of cities in their national tours was Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 10–19, 1934.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; According to a ''Los Angeles Magazine'' article, in August 1935, the Ballards hosted a gathering at the [[Shrine Auditorium]]  in Los Angeles that drew a crowd of 6,000.&lt;ref name="lamag"/&gt; Guy Ballard spoke under the pseudonym he used in authoring his books, Godfre Ray King, and his wife used the pseudonym Lotus. The meeting included teachings they described as being received directly from the Ascended Masters. They led the audience in prayers and affirmations that they called decrees, including adorations to God and invocations for abundance of every good thing, including love, money, peace, and happiness.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

=== Guy Ballard's death ===

At the height of his popularity, Guy Ballard died from arteriosclerosis at 5:00 A.M. on December 29, 1939, in Los Angeles, in the home of his son Donald. On December 31 his body was cremated. On New Year's Day during the annual ''Christmas Class'', Edna Ballard stated that Guy had completed his Ascension at midnight December 31, 1939, from the "Royal Teton Retreat".&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Students of the "I Am" Activity believe in death as a change, not an ending. The "I AM" activity believe ''Ascension'' can mean [[Entering heaven alive]], that is, to "raise one's body"—physically translating to a higher form of existence, as in the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  This is what Guy Ballard had claimed his followers would be able to do if they followed his instructions.  Recorded in a dictation prior to Guy W Ballard's death a new dispensation to make the Ascension after the passing of death and cremation was given, and is recorded at the Saint Germain Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;"War on High" -- Interview with [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] ''Gnosis'' magazine No. 21 Fall 1991 Pages 32-37&lt;/ref&gt; Students using this more traditional definition would have to conclude that Mrs. Ballard did not tell the full teaching, since Mr. Ballard had died a quite ordinary death and his body had been cremated. There had also been questions raised about devout members who had died without entering heaven alive. At this time, Edna Ballard defined "Ascension" as dying an ordinary death, but going to a higher level of heaven than a normal person because one has balanced "51% of one's [[karma]]".&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press--"Ascension--the Goal of Life" Page 51&lt;/ref&gt; This modified and more practical definition of "ascension" is used by all Ascended Master Teachings religions today, although they still believe that a select few, the higher level Ascended Masters such as Jesus and St. Germain, entered heaven alive.

=== Fraud trial of Edna and Donald Ballard ===

In 1942, Edna Ballard and her son Donald were charged with eighteen counts of mail fraud on the basis of claims made in books sent through the mail.  The presiding judge instructed the jury not to consider the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs, but only whether the Ballards sincerely believed the claims or did not, and the jury found them guilty.&lt;ref name="scotus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamag"/&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] overturned the conviction on the grounds that the judge improperly excluded the credibility of their religious beliefs from consideration, and the government appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].  In ''[[United States v. Ballard]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-4 landmark decision held that the question of whether Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to the jury, and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the fraud conviction.  Interpreting this decision, the Ninth Circuit later found that the Court did not go so far as to hold that "the validity or veracity of a religious doctrine cannot be inquired into by a Federal Court."&lt;ref&gt;''Cohen v. United States'', 297 F.2d 760 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

On a second appeal, the Supreme Court in 1946 vacated the fraud conviction, on the grounds that women were improperly excluded from the jury panel.&lt;ref name="supreme.justia.com"&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/329/187/case.html ''Ballard v. United States'', 329 U.S. 187 (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relocation to Santa Fe and Edna Ballard's death ===

In March 1942, Edna Ballard moved the western branch of the ''Saint Germain Press'' and her residence to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], where she recorded live before an audience thousands more dictations she said were from the Ascended Masters.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Despite the ultimate dismissal of the court cases, it was not until 1954 that the organization's right to use the mail was restored.  The [[Internal Revenue Service]] revoked their tax-exempt status in 1941, stating it did not recognize the movement as "a religion".  A court ruling in 1957 overturned the ruling of the IRS and re-established the group's tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name="partridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Albanese"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Mind and Spirit |author =Catherine L. Albanese |year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press  |isbn= 0-300-11089-8|page=470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent history and present day ===

As of 2007, Saint Germain Foundation maintains a reading room in [[Mount Shasta]], California, and its headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois.  Several annual conclaves are held at their 12-story "''I AM Temple''" at 176 West Washington Street in downtown Chicago.  Among the hundreds attending, there are usually dozens of "I AM" students from other nations.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Classes and conclaves are regularly held in approximately 300 locations in America, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Africa.&lt;ref name="SGF-temples"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintgermainfoundation.org/SGF_05_IAMTeach_Group_DecreeGps.html|title=Saint Germain "I AM" Group Activities|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Saint Germain Foundation|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Saint Germain Press'', a subsidiary of the ''Saint Germain Foundation'', publishes the historical books and related artwork and audio recordings of the Ballards' teachings, and a monthly magazine available by subscription, titled ''"The Voice of the 'I AM'"''.&lt;ref name="SGPress"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintgermainpress.com  |title=Saint Germain Press official home page |accessdate=December 17, 2007 |publisher=Saint Germain Foundation | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071217141143/http://www.saintgermainpress.com/| archivedate= December 17, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that the ''Saint Germain Press'' has printed and put into circulation over one million books.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The Saint Germain Foundation presents the ''"I AM" COME!'' Pageant every August at Mount Shasta, and has done so each year since 1950.  Their website states that the performance is open to the public at no cost, and describes the Pageant as a portrayal of "the life of Beloved Jesus, focusing on His Miracles of Truth and Healing, and the example of the Ascension which He left to the world."&lt;ref name="SGF-Pageant"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.saintgermainfoundation.org/pageant.htm  |title=Saint Germain Foundation ''"I AM" COME!''

== Teachings ==

According to the group's teachings, [[Ascended Master]]s are believed to be individuals who have left the [[reincarnation]] cycle of re-embodiment.

The "I AM" Activity calls itself Christian, because [[Master Jesus|Jesus]] is considered to be one of the more important Ascended Masters. It also refers to itself as patriotic because Ascended Master [[Count of St. Germain|St. Germain]] is believed to have inspired and guided the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Followers claim that St. Germain belonged to the same [[Freemasons|Masonic Lodge]] as [[George Washington]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. However, Guy Ballard tended to downplay any relation of his ideas to Freemasonry because of his great discordance with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], a famous Freemason. Thus the notion that Saint-Germain belonged to a Masonic Lodge was more part of general occult lore than part of Ballard's emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Folkloric accounts collected in Raymond Bernard's ''Great Secret Count St Germain'' (Mokelumne Hill Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The movement teaches that the omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent creator God ('I AM' – Exodus 3:14) is in all of us as a spark from the Divine Flame, and that we can experience this presence, love, power and light – and its power of the Violet Consuming Flame of Divine Love – through quiet contemplation and by repeating 'affirmations' and 'decrees'.  By affirming something one desires, one may cause it to happen.&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The group teaches that the "Mighty I AM Presence" is God existing in and as each person's Higher Self, and that a light known as the "Violet Flame" is generated by the "I AM Presence" and may surround each person who calls forth the action of the Holy Spirit for expression of mercy or forgiveness. The group believes that by tapping into these internalized powers in accordance with the teachings of the Ascended Masters, one can use one's relationship to the "Presence" to amplify the expressions of virtue such as justice, peace, harmony, and love; to displace or abate the expression of evil (relative absence of good) in the world; and to minimize personal difficulties in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.saintgermainfoundation.org/SGF_01_MightyIAM.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritual goal of the teachings is that, through a process of self-purification, the believer may attain the perfected condition of the saints, or become an Ascended Master when leaving their body, contrasted to common concepts of 'ordinary death'. The process of attaining these results includes one or another of interior practices to facilitate resonance and alignment with the "I AM Presence": self-assessment in light of saintly exemplars such as Jesus, care in the use of language, devotion (to the Divine), gratitude, meditation, affirmations; and external practices such as "decrees" (repeated prayers given aloud with conviction) and invocations such as for the Violet Flame, all of which amplify the energetic presence of the divine in one's experience, resulting in the desired positive changes.&lt;ref name="UnivVirginia"/&gt;
The science behind decrees and affirmations has received extensive attention in medical and other fields. The 'hidden side' of human life is explored, largely with the view of releasing consciousness from burden and error so that it may seek to be more fully engaged in higher purpose, inspired by divine guidance, to serve the Greater Good of All.&lt;ref&gt;Your Body Believes Every Word You Say - Barbara Hoberman Levine, Hung By The Tongue - Francis P Martin; Healing Words -[[Larry Dossey]], M.D., 5 Common Words That Create Failure -Geoffrey James&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also emphasizes personal freedom, embracing patriotic symbols, and often displays American flags in its Temples or other offices.&lt;ref name="UnivVirginia"/&gt;

These "positive thinking" beliefs overlap with several other New Age movements such as [[Religious Science]] and the [[Human Potential Movement]].&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;

Typically, ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] for [[abstract art]] in general.

==In the visual arts==
Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-10826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs and shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100410114556/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.] Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
In music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714025231/http://public.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.] Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Life==
Alexander Dobrokhotov started his academic career as a historian of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek Philosophy]] and as an interpreter of [[Parmenides]]' and [[Heraclitus]]’ theories of [[being]]. His studies resulted in several books, one of which, ‘The Category of [[Being]] in Classical West-European Philosophy’ (1986), summarises his main ideas.

From 1988 to 1995, Dobrokhotov was the chair of the Department of Cultural History of the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]. From 1995 to 2009, Alexander Dobrokhotov was the chair of History and Theory of World Culture of the Faculty of Philosophy, [[Moscow State University]]. The chair was created in 1990. Many prominent [[Philosophy in the Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Russian scholars like [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Viacheslav Ivanov]], [[Sergei Sergejewitsch Awerinzew]], [[Aron Gurevich]], [[Mikhail Gasparov]], Georgii Knabe, [[Yeleazar Meletinsky]], Vladimir Romanov, Tatiana Vasilieva, Nina Braginskaia, [[Vladimir Bibikhin]] have worked there. From 1995 to 2015, Alexander Dobrokhotov taught at the Graduate School of European Cultures (VSHEK) which is an international training and research centre at [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] (VSHEK was established in April 2007 and replaced the Institute of European Cultures). From 2009 until today, Alexander Dobrokhotov is also a professor at the [[National Research University – Higher School of Economics|National Research University Higher School of Economics]] (HSE), at the School of Cultural Studies. He teaches various courses on philosophy, philosophy of culture, metaphysics and theology, history of Russian culture.&lt;ref name="coursera1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hse.ru"/&gt; In 2010, he became a tenured professor at HSE.&lt;ref name="hse.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/136024 |title=Staff - Alexandr L.

Today, Alexander Dobrokhotov is a leading Russian philosopher of culture and prominent scholar in [[culturology]]. He often appears on television and has taught a massive online course on [[Coursera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ru.coursera.org/learn/filosofiya-kultury |title=Archived item |accessdate=2016-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918145117/https://ru.coursera.org/learn/filosofiya-kultury |archivedate=2016-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In late 1980s and early 1990s, the academic disciplinary landscape on the territory of the former [[Soviet Union]] underwent significant changes. Some disciplines based on [[Marxism–Leninism]] ceased to exist, and a number of new disciplines in the humanities and social sciences appeared. Among the new fields there was an approach towards culture within the Russian humanities which came to be known as ‘[[culturology]]’ (kulturologia). There have been many versions of this discipline, and Alexander Dobrokhotov became the founder of his own original version of [[culturology]], based on the Kantian and Hegelian philosophical traditions and on the [[List of Russian philosophers|Russian philosophy on the Silver Age]]. He regards studies of culture as a combination of theoretical philosophy of culture on one hand, and empirical studies on the other hand.

In his works on philosophy of culture, he argues that ‘Culture’ can be regarded as an independent regional of being, alongside ‘Nature’ and ‘Spirit’. He defines Culture as the universe of artefacts. The artefact is the result of an objectification of Spirit and an anthropomorphization of Nature. In this respect, culture mediates Nature and Spirit. Culture makes obsolete the ontological conflict between Nature and Spirit. In their place, two other ontological conflicts appear: the conflict between Nature and Culture, and between Culture and Spirit. Alexander Dobrokhotov further argues that Culture is not a mechanism of human adaptation to the natural environment, but is rather an ontological wholeness, with its own aim setting, or, in his terms, ‘[[Teleology|teleologism]]’. Pure or transcendental forms set aims for culture. This idea stems from works by [[Plato]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]. Each artefact of Culture is created in order to take its place within the ontological wholeness, and thus, alongside its concrete meaning or function, it also contains a latent interpretation of the wholeness. ‘How should the world look like so that I could be a part of it?’ — this is the question which each artefact answers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Доброхотов А. Л. Телеология культуры. М. : Прогресс-Традиция, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

From this follows an empirical method which forms the foundation of the empirical discipline of [[culturology]]. This method involves reconstructing the ontological wholeness from the individual artefact. In other words, the method involves answering the question of how the world should look like so that the artefact could be a part of it. Furthermore, if the wholeness is the same for all its artefacts, an isomorphism of heterogeneous artefacts can be discovered. Hence, the main question of the empirical study of culture is ‘How can we reconcile the heterogeneity and isomorphism of cultural artefacts?’&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In his numerous empirical studies of culture, Alexander Dobrokhotov demonstrates how his theory and method work. He reveals the underlying isomorphism in works by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Pablo Picasso]]; in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[avant-garde]] in art; in [[Age of Enlightenment|the 18th-century philosophy of mind]] and [[Novel|the novel]]; in [[theology]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]’s films.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

{{Anthroposophy}}

'''Anthroposophy''' is a [[philosophy]] founded by the 19th century esotericist [[Rudolf Steiner]] that postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible [[spirituality|spiritual]] world, accessible to human experience. Followers of anthroposophy aim to develop mental faculties of spiritual discovery through a mode of thought independent of sensory experience.&lt;ref name="Essential"&gt;Robert McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}, pp. 3&amp;ndash;11, 392&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.eb.com/eb/article-9007798 "Anthroposophy"], Encyclopædia Britannica online, accessed 10/09/07&lt;/ref&gt; They also aim to present their ideas in a manner verifiable by rational discourse and specifically seek a precision and clarity in studying the spiritual world mirroring that obtained by [[natural history|natural historians]] in investigations of the physical world.

The philosophy has its roots in [[German idealism|German idealist]] and [[German mysticism|mystical]] philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Clement (ed.), ''Rudolf Steiner: Schriften über Mystik, Mysterienwesen und Religionsgeschichte''.

==History==
[[File:Steiner um 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rudolf Steiner]]]]

The early work of the founder of anthroposophy, [[Rudolf Steiner]], culminated in his ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'' (also translated as ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'' and ''Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path''). Here, Steiner developed a concept of [[free will]] based on inner experiences, especially those that occur in the creative activity of independent thought.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;

By the beginning of the twentieth century, Steiner's interests turned almost exclusively to spirituality. His work began to interest others interested in spiritual ideas; among these was the [[Theosophical Society]]. From 1900 on, thanks to the positive reception his ideas received from Theosophists, Steiner focused increasingly on [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|his work with the Theosophical Society]], becoming the [[General Secretary|secretary]] of its section in Germany in 1902. During his leadership, membership increased dramatically, from just a few individuals to sixty-nine lodges.&lt;ref name="ahern2edAnthSec"&gt;Of these, 55 lodges – about 2,500 people – seceded with Steiner to form his new Anthroposophical Society at the end of 1912. Geoffrey Ahern, ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com/  Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner Movement and Gnosis in the West, 2nd edition]'', 2009, James Clark and Co, {{ISBN|978-0-227-17293-3}}, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1907, a split between Steiner and the Theosophical Society became apparent. While the Society was oriented toward an [[Orient|Eastern]] and especially [[India]]n approach, Steiner was trying to develop a path that embraced [[Christianity]] and [[natural science]].&lt;ref name="Lachman"&gt;Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', New York:Tarcher/Penguin {{ISBN|978-1-58542-543-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split became irrevocable when [[Annie Besant]], then president of the Theosophical Society, presented the child [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] Christ. Steiner strongly objected and considered any comparison between Krishnamurti and Christ to be nonsense; many years later, Krishnamurti also repudiated the assertion. Steiner's continuing differences with Besant led him to separate from the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]. He was subsequently followed by the great majority of the Theosophical Society's German members, as well as many members of other national sections.&lt;ref name="ahern2edAnthSec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lachman"/&gt;

By this time, Steiner, had reached considerable stature as a spiritual teacher and [[List of occult writers|expert in the occult]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, Geoffrey. (1984): Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner movement and the Western esoteric tradition&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke about what he considered to be his direct experience of the [[Akashic Records]] (sometimes called the "Akasha Chronicle"), thought to be a spiritual chronicle of the history, pre-history, and future of the world and mankind.  In a number of works,&lt;ref&gt;especially ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' and ''An Outline of Esoteric Science''&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner described a path of inner development he felt would let anyone attain comparable spiritual experiences. In Steiner's view, sound vision could be developed, in part, by practicing rigorous forms of ethical and cognitive self-discipline, concentration, and meditation. In particular, Steiner believed a person's spiritual development could only occur after a period of moral development.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;

[[File:Goetheanum Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Second [[Goetheanum]], seat of the Anthroposophical Society]]
In 1912, the Anthroposophical Society was founded. After [[World War I]], the Anthroposophical movement took on new directions. Followers of Steiner's ideas soon began applying them to create counter-cultural movements in [[Waldorf education|traditional]] and [[Camphill Movement|special education]], farming, and [[anthroposophical medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uhrmacher |first1=P.

By 1923, a schism had formed between older members focused on inner development and younger members eager to become active in contemporary social transformations. In response, Steiner attempted to bridge the gap by establishing an overall School for ''Spiritual Science''. As a spiritual basis for the reborn movement, Steiner wrote a "[[wikisource:Foundation Stone Meditation|Foundation Stone Meditation]]" which remains a central touchstone of anthroposophical ideas.

Steiner died just over a year later, in 1925. The Second World War temporarily hindered the anthroposophical movement in most of Continental Europe, as the Anthroposophical Society and most of its practical counter-cultural applications were banned by the [[National Socialist|Nazi government]].&lt;ref&gt;Inge Hansen-Schaberg and Bruno Schonig (eds.), ''Waldorf-Pädogogik'', {{ISBN|3-8340-0042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though at least one prominent member of the Nazi Party, [[Rudolf Hess]], was a strong supporter of anthroposophy, very few anthroposophists belonged to the National Socialist Party.&lt;ref name=Zander&gt;Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', {{ISBN|978-3-525-55452-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}&lt;ref name="DuganWaldorfCritics"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dugan |first1=Dan |title=Anthroposophy |url=http://www.waldorfcritics.org/articles/Anthroposophy.html |website=www.waldorfcritics.org |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Priestman |first1=Karen |title=Illusion of Coexistence: The Waldorf Schools in the Third Reich, 1933–1941 |journal=Doctoral Thesis at the Wilfrid Laurier University |date=2009 |url=https://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2079 |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ernst |first1=Edzard |title=Rudolf Hess (Hitler's deputy) on alternative medicine |url=https://edzardernst.com/2015/01/rudolf-hess-hitlers-deputy-on-alternative-medicine/ |website=Edzard Ernst |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Staudenmaier |first1=Peter |title=Between occultism and Nazism : anthroposophy and the politics of race in the fascist era |date=2014 |publisher=Aries Books |isbn=9789004270152 |pages=101-145 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/b9789004270152_005 |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, national branches of the Anthroposophical Society had been established in fifty countries and about 10,000 institutions around the world were working on the basis of anthroposophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goetheanum.org/121.html?&amp;L=1 |title=Goetheanum |publisher=Goetheanum |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology and earlier uses of the word===
''Anthroposophy'' is an amalgam of the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄνθρωπος|ἄνθρωπος]]}} (''anthropos'' = "human") and {{lang|grc|[[Sophia (wisdom)|σοφία]]}} (''sophia'' = "wisdom"). An early English usage is recorded by [[Nathan Bailey]] (1742) as meaning "the knowledge of the nature of man."&lt;ref&gt;"Anthroposophy", [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Troxler Portrait 1830.jpg|thumb|right|Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler]]
The first known use of the term ''anthroposophy'' occurs within ''[[Arbatel|Arbatel de magia veterum, summum sapientiae studium]]'', a book published anonymously in 1575 and attributed to [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim|Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]. The work describes anthroposophy (as well as theosophy) variously as an understanding of goodness, nature, or human affairs. In 1648, the Welsh philosopher [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] published his ''Anthroposophia Theomagica, or a discourse of the nature of man and his state after death.'' &lt;ref&gt;Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius Philalethes): ''Anthroposophia Theomagica, or a discourse of the nature of man and his state after death.'' Oxford 1648&lt;/ref&gt;

The term began to appear with some frequency in philosophical works of the mid- and late-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The term was used for example in a [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=1&amp;size=1&amp;id=nq.1863.5.9.3.71.x.373 discussion of Boehme] in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', May 9, 1863, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of that century, [[Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler|Ignaz Troxler]] used the term "anthroposophy" to refer to philosophy deepened to self-knowledge, which he suggested allows deeper knowledge of nature as well. He spoke of human nature as a mystical unity of God and world. [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] used the term ''anthroposophy'' to refer to "rigorous human self-knowledge," achievable through thorough comprehension of the human spirit and of the working of God in this spirit, in his 1856 work ''Anthropology: The Study of the Human Soul''. In 1872, the philosopher of religion [[Gideon Spicker]] used the term ''anthroposophy'' to refer to self-knowledge that would unite God and world: "the true study of the human being is the human being, and philosophy's highest aim is self-knowledge, or Anthroposophy." &lt;ref&gt;''Die Philosophie des Grafen von Shaftesbury'', 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann|Robert Zimmermann]] published the treatise, "An Outline of Anthroposophy: Proposal for a System of Idealism on a Realistic Basis," proposing that idealistic philosophy should employ logical thinking to extend empirical experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthroposophie im Umriß. Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltsicht auf realistischer Grundlage'', 1882&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner attended lectures by Zimmermann at the [[University of Vienna]] in the early 1880s, thus at the time of this book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zimmermann ''Geschichte der Aesthetik als philosophische Wissenschaft. Vienna, 1858.  Anthroposophie im Umriss-Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltansicht auf realistischer Grundlage.'' (Vienna, 1882): Steiner, ''Anthroposophic Movement'': Lecture Two: ''The Unveiling of Spiritual Truths'',  11 June 1923.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA258/English/RSP1993/19230611p01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, Steiner began using the term ''anthroposophy'' (i.e. human wisdom) as an alternative to the term ''theosophy'' (i.e. divine wisdom).

==Central ideas==

===Spiritual knowledge and freedom===
Anthroposophical proponents aim to extend the clarity of the [[scientific method]] to phenomena of human soul-life and spiritual experiences. Steiner believed this required developing new faculties of objective spiritual perception, which he maintained was still possible for contemporary humans. The steps of this process of inner development he identified as consciously achieved ''[[imagination]]'', ''[[:wikt:inspiration|inspiration]]'' and ''[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]''.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Peter Schneider, Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik, {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner believed results of this form of spiritual research should be expressed in a way that can be understood and evaluated on the same basis as the results of natural science.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider20"/&gt;

Steiner hoped to form a spiritual movement that would free the individual from any external authority.&lt;ref name="Schneider20"&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik'', pp. 20-1; Schneider quotes here from Steiner's dissertation, ''Truth and Knowledge''&lt;/ref&gt; For Steiner, the human capacity for [[rationality|rational]] thought would allow individuals to comprehend spiritual research on their own and bypass the danger of dependency on an authority such as himself.&lt;ref name="Schneider20"/&gt;

Steiner contrasted the anthroposophical approach with both conventional [[mysticism]], which he considered lacking the clarity necessary for exact knowledge, and [[natural science]], which he considered arbitrarily limited to what can be seen, heard, or felt with the outward senses.

===Nature of the human being===
{{Refimprove_section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Representative of humanity.gif|thumb|upright|''The Representative of Humanity'', detail of a sculpture in wood by Rudolf Steiner and [[Edith Maryon]].&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37021855/A_Portrait_of_Edith_Maryon_Artist_and_Anthroposophist A Portrait of Edith Maryon: Artist and Anthroposophist], Journal of Fine Arts, 1(2):8-15.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In ''Theosophy'', Steiner suggested that human beings unite a physical body of substances gathered from (and that ultimately return to) the inorganic world; a life body (also called the [[etheric body]]), in common with all living creatures (including plants); a bearer of [[sentience]] or [[consciousness]] (also called the [[astral body]]), in common with all [[animal]]s; and the ego, which anchors the faculty of self-awareness unique to human beings.

Anthroposophy describes a broad evolution of human consciousness. Early stages of human evolution possess an intuitive perception of reality, including a [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] perception of spiritual realities. Humanity has progressively evolved an increasing reliance on [[intellect]]ual faculties and a corresponding loss of intuitive or clairvoyant experiences, which have become atavistic. The increasing intellectualization of consciousness, initially a progressive direction of evolution, has led to an excessive reliance on [[abstraction]] and a loss of contact with both natural and spiritual realities. However, to go further requires new capacities that combine the clarity of intellectual thought with the imagination, and beyond this with consciously achieved inspiration and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] insights.&lt;ref name=RAMcD&gt;Robert A. McDermott, "Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy", in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', {{ISBN|0-8245-1444-0}}, p. 299&amp;ndash;301; 288ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthroposophy speaks of the reincarnation of the human spirit: that the human being passes between stages of existence, incarnating into an earthly body, living on earth, leaving the body behind and entering into the spiritual worlds before returning to be born again into a new life on earth. After the [[death]] of the physical body, the human spirit recapitulates the past life, perceiving its events as they were experienced by the objects of its actions. A complex transformation takes place between the review of the past life and the preparation for the next life. The individual's [[karmic]] condition eventually leads to a choice of parents, physical body, disposition, and capacities that provide the challenges and opportunities that further development requires, which includes karmically chosen tasks for the future life.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Steiner described some conditions that determine the interdependence of a person's lives, or [[karma]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, Theosophy, {{ISBN|0-85440-269-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, An Outline of Esoteric Science, {{ISBN|0-88010-409-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution====
The anthroposophical view of [[evolution]] considers all [[animals]] to have evolved from an early, unspecialized form. As the least specialized animal, human beings have maintained the closest connection to the archetypal form;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verhulst|first=Jos|title=Developmental Dynamics|year=2003|publisher=Adonis Press|location=Ghent, NY|isbn=978-0-932776-28-0|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the Darwinian conception of human evolution, all other animals ''devolve'' from this archetype.&lt;ref&gt;George Trevelyan ''Operation Redemption'' 1981, pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual archetype originally created by spiritual beings was devoid of physical substance; only later did this descend into material existence on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Man as Symphony of the Creative Word'' and ''Occult Science''&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, human evolution has accompanied the Earth's evolution throughout the existence of the Earth.

{{quote|The evolution of man, Steiner said, has consisted in the gradual incarnation of a spiritual being into a material body. It has been a true "descent" of man from a spiritual world into a world of matter. The evolution of the animal kingdom did not precede, but rather ''accompanied'' the process of human incarnation. Man is thus not the end result of the evolution of the animals, but is rather in a certain sense their ''cause''. In the succession of types which appears in the fossil record-the fishes, reptiles, mammals, and finally fossil remains of man himself — the stages of this process of incarnation are reflected.&lt;ref&gt;John Waterman ''Evolution and The Image of Man'' in A. C. Harwood ''The faithful thinker: Centenary essays on the work and thought of Rudolf Steiner'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1961, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anthroposophy adapted [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]'s complex system of cycles of world development and human evolution. The evolution of the world is said to have occurred in cycles. The first phase of the world consisted only of heat. In the second phase, a more active condition, light, and a more condensed, gaseous state separate out from the heat. In the third phase, a fluid state arose, as well as a sounding, forming energy. In the fourth (current) phase, solid physical matter first exists. This process is said to have been accompanied by an evolution of consciousness which led up to present human culture.

===Ethics===
The anthroposophical view is that good is found in the balance between two polar influences on world and human evolution. These are often described through their mythological embodiments as spiritual adversaries which endeavour to tempt and corrupt humanity, [[Lucifer]] and his counterpart [[Ahriman]]. These have both positive and negative aspects. Lucifer is the light spirit, which "plays on human pride and offers the delusion of divinity", but also motivates [[creativity]] and [[spirituality]]; Ahriman is the dark spirit that tempts human beings to "...deny [their] link with divinity and to live [[materialism|entirely on the material plane]]", but that also stimulates intellectuality and [[technology]]. Both figures exert a negative effect on humanity when their influence becomes misplaced or one-sided, yet their influences are necessary for human freedom to unfold.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

Each human being has the task to find a balance between these opposing influences, and each is helped in this task by the mediation of the ''Representative of Humanity'', also known as the Christ being, a spiritual entity who stands between and harmonizes the two extremes.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

Biodynamic agriculture, the first intentional form of organic farming,&lt;ref name=Lenart/&gt; began in 1924, when Rudolf Steiner gave a series of lectures published in English as ''The Agriculture Course''.&lt;ref name=first&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/18809/1/Paull2011KoberwitzEJSS.pdf  "Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner’s Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924"], ''European Journal of Social Sciences'', 21(1):64-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner is considered one of the founders of the modern [[organic farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Curtis Ferree, Ian J.

===Anthroposophical medicine===
{{Main|Anthroposophical medicine}}
Steiner gave several series of lectures to physicians and medical students. Out of those grew an [[complementary medicine|alternative medical]] movement intending to "extend the knowledge gained through the methods of the natural sciences of the present age with insights from spiritual science."&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, GA27, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; This movement now includes hundreds of M.D.s, chiefly in Europe and North America, and has its own clinics, hospitals, and medical schools.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;

One of the most studied applications has been the use of mistletoe extracts in cancer therapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe |title=Study by the National Cancer Institute on mistletoe's use for treating cancer |publisher=Cancer.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221133732/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe |archivedate=2010-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but research has found no evidence of benefit.&lt;ref name="coch-2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horneber MA, Bueschel G, Huber R, Linde K, Rostock M |title=Mistletoe therapy in oncology |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003297 |year=2008 |pmid=18425885 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003297.pub2 |type=Systematic review|quote=The review found that there was not enough evidence to reach clear conclusions about the effects on any of these outcomes and it is therefore not clear to what extent the application of mistletoe extracts translates into improved symptom control, enhanced tumour response or prolonged survival.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |work=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editor=Ades TB |pages=424–428 |title=Mistletoe |quote=Available evidence from well-designed clinical trials does not support claims that mistletoe can improve length or quality of life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special needs education and services===
{{Main|Camphill Movement}}
In 1922, [[Ita Wegman]] founded an anthroposophical center for special needs education, the Sonnenhof, in Switzerland. In 1940, [[Karl König]] founded the [[Camphill Movement]] in Scotland. The latter in particular has spread widely, and there are now over a hundred Camphill communities and other anthroposophical homes for children and adults in need of special care in about 22 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camphill.org/ Camphill]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Karl König, [[Thomas Weihs]] and others have written extensively on these ideas underlying Special education.&lt;ref&gt;Karl König ''The Child with Special Needs: Letters and Essays on Curative Education'' Publisher: Floris Books  2009 {{ISBN|0863156932}} {{ISBN|978-0863156939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J.

===Eurythmy===
{{Main|Eurythmy}}
Together with [[Marie von Sivers]], Steiner developed [[eurythmy]], a [[performing art|performance art]] combining [[dance]], speech, and music.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Poplawski ''Eurythmy'', p. 67, Steiner Books, 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-88010-459-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earl j.

===Social finance and entrepreneurship===
{{See also|Social finance}}
Around the world today are a number of banks, companies, charities, and schools for developing co-operative forms of business using Steiner's ideas about economic associations, aiming at harmonious and socially responsible roles in the world economy.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; The first anthroposophic bank was the ''[[GLS bank|Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken]]'' in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]], founded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gls.de/ |title=Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken |publisher=Gls.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational development, counselling and biography work===
[[Bernard Lievegoed]], a psychiatrist, founded a new method of individual and institutional development oriented towards humanizing organizations and linked with Steiner's ideas of the threefold social order. This work is represented by the NPI Institute for Organizational Development in the Netherlands and sister organizations in many other countries.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; Various forms of [[Biography Work|biographic]] and counselling work have been developed on the basis of anthroposophy.

===Speech and drama===
There are also anthroposophical movements to renew speech and drama, the most important of which are based in the work of [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]] (''speech formation'', also known as ''Creative Speech'') and the ''Chekhov Method'' originated by [[Michael Chekhov]] (nephew of [[Anton Chekhov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Byckling, L: [https://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/01/chekhovwest.shtml Michael Chekhov as Actor, Teacher and Director in the West] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231085044/http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/01/chekhovwest.shtml |date=2006-12-31 }}.

===Art===
Anthroposophic painting, a style inspired by [[Rudolf Steiner]], featured prominently in the first [[Goetheanum]]'s cupola. The technique frequently begins by filling the surface to be painted with color, out of which forms are gradually developed, often images with symbolic-spiritual significance. Paints that allow for many transparent layers are preferred, and often these are derived from plant materials.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;{{rp|381–382, 1080, 1105}} [[Rudolf Steiner]] appointed the English sculptor [[Edith Maryon]] as head of the School of [[Fine Art]] at the [[Goetheanum]].&lt;ref  name=EM&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37021855/A_Portrait_of_Edith_Maryon_Artist_and_Anthroposophist A Portrait of Edith Maryon: Artist and Anthroposophist], Journal of Fine Arts, 1(2):8-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they carved the 9 metre tall sculpture ‘The Representative of Man’ which is on display at the [[Goetheanum]].&lt;ref  name=EM&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37021855/A_Portrait_of_Edith_Maryon_Artist_and_Anthroposophist A Portrait of Edith Maryon: Artist and Anthroposophist], Journal of Fine Arts, 1(2):8-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social goals==
{{Main|Social Threefolding}}
For a period after World War I, Steiner was extremely active and well known in Germany, in part because he lectured widely proposing social reforms. Steiner was a sharp critic of [[nationalism]], which he saw as outdated, and a proponent of achieving social solidarity through individual freedom.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; A petition proposing a radical change in the German constitution and expressing his basic social ideas (signed by [[Herman Hesse]], among others) was widely circulated. His main book on social reform is ''Toward Social Renewal''.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;

Anthroposophy continues to aim at reforming society through maintaining and strengthening the independence of the spheres of [[culture|cultural life]], [[human rights]] and the [[economy]]. It emphasizes a particular ideal in each of these three realms of society:&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;
# Freedom in cultural life
# [[Equality before the law|Equality]] of [[rights]], the sphere of [[legislation]]
# [[:wikt:fraternity|Fraternity]] in the [[economy|economic sphere]]

==Esoteric path==

===Paths of spiritual development===
According to Steiner, a real [[supernatural|spiritual]] world exists, evolving along with the material one. Steiner held that the spiritual world can be researched in the right circumstances through direct experience, by persons practicing rigorous forms of [[ethics|ethical]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[self-discipline]]. Steiner described many exercises he said were suited to strengthening such self-discipline; the most complete exposition of these is found in his book ''How To Know Higher Worlds''. The aim of these exercises is to develop higher levels of [[higher consciousness|consciousness]] through [[meditation]] and [[observation]]. Details about the spiritual world, Steiner suggested, could on such a basis be discovered and reported, though no more infallibly than the results of natural science.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

{{quote|Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe…. Anthroposophists are those who experience, as an essential need of life, certain questions on the nature of the human being and the universe, just as one experiences hunger and thirst.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Steiner regarded his research reports as being important aids to others seeking to enter into spiritual experience. He suggested that a combination of spiritual exercises (for example, concentrating on an object such as a seed), moral development (control of thought, feelings and will combined with openness, tolerance and flexibility) and familiarity with other spiritual researchers' results would best further an individual's spiritual development. He consistently emphasised that any inner, spiritual practice should be undertaken in such a way as not to interfere with one's responsibilities in outer life.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt; Steiner distinguished between what he considered were true and false paths of spiritual investigation.&lt;ref&gt;''True and False Paths in Spiritual Investigation'', first English edition 1927 (online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA243/English/RSP1969/TruFal_index.html]), 2010 edition Kessinger Publishing Company {{ISBN|9781162592510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anthroposophy, artistic expression is also treated as a potentially valuable bridge between spiritual and material reality.&lt;ref name=Lindenberg/&gt;{{rp|97}}

===Prerequisites to and stages of inner development===
{{quote|A person seeking inner development must first of all make the attempt to give up certain formerly held inclinations. Then, new inclinations must be acquired by constantly holding the thought of such inclinations, virtues or characteristics in one's mind. They must be so incorporated into one's being that a person becomes enabled to alter his soul by his own will-power. This must be tried as objectively as a chemical might be tested in an experiment. A person who has never endeavored to change his soul, who has never made the initial decision to develop the qualities of endurance, steadfastness and calm logical thinking, or a person who has such decisions but has given up because he did not succeed in a week, a month, a year or a decade, will never conclude anything inwardly about these truths.|Rudolf Steiner|"On the Inner Life",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsarchive.org/Lectures/InnDev_index.html |title=The Inner Development of Man |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Rsarchive.org |date=1904-12-15 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Steiner's stated prerequisites to beginning on a spiritual path include a willingness to take up serious cognitive studies, a respect for factual evidence, and a responsible attitude. Central to progress on the path itself is a harmonious cultivation of the following qualities:&lt;ref name="Willmann_path"&gt;[[Carlo Willmann]], ''Waldorfpädagogik'', {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, pp. 10&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Control over one's own thinking
* Control over one's will
* Composure
* Positivity
* Impartiality

Steiner sees meditation as a concentration and enhancement of the power of thought. By focusing consciously on an idea, feeling or intention the meditant seeks to arrive at pure thinking, a state exemplified by but not confined to pure mathematics. In Steiner's view, conventional sensory-material knowledge is achieved through relating perception and concepts. The anthroposophic path of esoteric training articulates three further stages of supersensory knowledge, which do not necessarily follow strictly sequentially in any single individual's spiritual progress.&lt;ref name="Willmann_path"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;Stein, W. J., ''Die moderne naturwissenschaftliche Vorstellungsart und die Weltanschauung Goethes, wie sie Rudolf Steiner vertritt'', reprinted in Meyer, Thomas, ''W.J. Stein / Rudolf Steiner'', pp. 267&amp;ndash;75; 256&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* By focusing on symbolic patterns, images, and poetic mantras, the meditant can achieve consciously directed Imaginations that allow sensory phenomena to appear as the expression of underlying beings of a soul-spiritual nature.
* By transcending such imaginative pictures, the meditant can become conscious of the meditative activity itself, which leads to experiences of expressions of soul-spiritual beings unmediated by sensory phenomena or qualities.  Steiner calls this stage Inspiration.
* By intensifying the will-forces through exercises such as a chronologically reversed review of the day's events, the meditant can achieve a further stage of inner independence from sensory experience, leading to direct contact, and even union, with spiritual beings ("Intuition") without loss of individual awareness.&lt;ref name="Willmann_path"/&gt;

===Spiritual exercises===
{{Main|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}

Steiner described numerous exercises he believed would bring spiritual development; other anthroposophists have added many others. A central principle is that "for every step in spiritual perception, three steps are to be taken in moral development." According to Steiner, moral development reveals the extent to which one has achieved control over one's inner life and can exercise it in harmony with the spiritual life of other people; it shows the real progress in spiritual development, the fruits of which are given in spiritual perception. It also guarantees the capacity to distinguish between false perceptions or illusions (which are possible in perceptions of both the outer world and the inner world) and true perceptions: i.e., the capacity to distinguish in any perception between the influence of subjective elements (i.e., viewpoint) and objective reality.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

==Place in Western philosophy==
Steiner built upon [[Goethe]]'s conception of an imaginative power capable of synthesizing the sense-perceptible form of a thing (an image of its outer appearance) and the concept we have of that thing (an image of its inner structure or nature). Steiner added to this the conception that a further step in the development of thinking is possible when the thinker observes his or her own thought processes. "The organ of observation and the observed thought process are then identical, so that the condition thus arrived at is simultaneously one of perception through thinking and one of thought through perception."&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

Thus, in Steiner's view, we can overcome the subject-object divide through inner activity, even though all human experience begins by being conditioned by it. In this connection, Steiner examines the step from thinking determined by outer impressions to what he calls sense-free thinking. He characterizes thoughts he considers without sensory content, such as mathematical or logical thoughts, as free deeds. Steiner believed he had thus located the origin of free will in our thinking, and in particular in sense-free thinking.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

Some of the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] basis for Steiner's later anthroposophical work is contained in the seminal work, [[Philosophy of Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Pifer, "Saul Bellow Against the Grain", University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990; see also Steiner's doctoral thesis, ''Truth and Science''&lt;/ref&gt; In his early works, Steiner sought to overcome what he perceived as the dualism of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] idealism and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian subjectivism by developing Goethe's conception of the human being as a natural-supernatural entity, that is: natural in that humanity is a product of nature, supernatural in that through our conceptual powers we extend nature's realm, allowing it to achieve a reflective capacity in us as philosophy, art and science.&lt;ref name="Tarnas"&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', {{ISBN|0-7126-7332-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner was one of the first European philosophers to overcome the subject-object split in [[Western thought]].&lt;ref name="Tarnas"/&gt; Though not well known among philosophers, his philosophical work was taken up by [[Owen Barfield]] (and through him influenced the [[Inklings]], an [[Oxford]] group of Christian writers that included [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Doris T. Myers, "C.S. Lewis in Context."  Kent State University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian and Jewish mystical thought have also influenced the development of anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Bader, Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Rudolf Steiner als aktiver Gegner des Antisemitismus'',  Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paddock, F. and Spiegler, M., Judaism and Anthroposophy, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union of science and spirit===
Steiner believed in the possibility of applying the clarity of scientific thinking to spiritual experience, which he saw as deriving from an objectively existing spiritual world.&lt;ref name=Lindenberg&gt;Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Rowohlt 1992, {{ISBN|3-499-50500-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77ff}} Steiner identified [[mathematics]], which attains certainty through thinking itself, thus through inner experience rather than empirical observation,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein, [http://www.tu-harburg.de/rzt/rzt/it/Geometry.html Geometry and Experience] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011124171015/http%3A//www.tu%2Dharburg.de/rzt/rzt/it/geometry.html |date=2001-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of his epistemology of spiritual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Anthroposophy and Science'', lecture of March 16, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to religion==

===Christ as the center of earthly evolution===
Steiner's writing, though appreciative of all religions and cultural developments, emphasizes Western tradition as having evolved to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref name="Lachman"/&gt; He describes Christ and his mission on earth of bringing individuated consciousness as having a particularly important place in human evolution,&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; whereby:&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;
*Christianity has evolved out of previous religions;
*The being which manifests in Christianity also manifests in all faiths and religions, and each religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born;
*All historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed considerably to meet the continuing evolution of humanity.

{{quote|Spiritual science does not want to usurp the place of Christianity; on the contrary it would like to be instrumental in making Christianity understood. Thus it becomes clear to us through spiritual science that the being whom we call Christ is to be recognized as the center of life on earth, that the Christian religion is the ultimate religion for the earth's whole future. Spiritual science shows us particularly that the pre-Christian religions outgrow their one-sidedness and come together in the Christian faith. It is not the desire of spiritual science to set something else in the place of Christianity; rather it wants to contribute to a deeper, more heartfelt understanding of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner,[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/AntChr_index.html "Anthroposophy and Christianity"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, anthroposophy considers there to be a being who unifies all religions, and who is not represented by any particular religious faith. This being is, according to Steiner, not only the Redeemer of [[the Fall of Man|the Fall from Paradise]], but also the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and of human history.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; To describe this being, Steiner periodically used terms such as the "Representative of Humanity" or the "good spirit"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=The foundations of human experience|year=1996|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|isbn=0-88010-392-2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=A Chapter of Occult History|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/19081216p01.html|date=December 16, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than any denominational term.

===Divergence from conventional Christian thought===
Steiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include [[gnostism|gnostic]] elements:

* One central point of divergence is Steiner's views on [[reincarnation]] and karma.
* Steiner differentiated three contemporary paths by which he believed it possible to arrive at [[Christ]]:
** Through heart-filled experiences of the [[Gospels]]; Steiner described this as the historically dominant path, but becoming less important in the future.
** Through inner experiences of a spiritual reality; this Steiner regarded as increasingly the path of spiritual or religious seekers today.
** Through [[initiation|initiatory experiences]] whereby the reality of Christ's death and resurrection are experienced; Steiner believed this is the path people will increasingly take.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;
* Steiner also believed that there were two different [[Jesus]] children involved in the [[Incarnation]] of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; (The genealogies given in the two gospels diverge some thirty generations before Jesus' birth, and 'Jesus' was a common name in biblical times.)
* His view of [[the second coming]] of Christ is also unusual; he suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life for increasing numbers of people beginning around the year 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ReapChrist/19100125p01.html "The Appearance of Christ in the Etheric World"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* He emphasized his belief that in the future humanity would need to be able to recognize the ''Spirit of Love'' in all its genuine forms, regardless of what name would be used to describe this being. He also warned that the traditional name of the ''Christ'' might be misused, and the true essence of this being of love ignored.

===Judaism===
Rudolf Steiner wrote and lectured on Judaism and Jewish issues over much of his adult life. He was a fierce opponent of popular antisemitism, but asserted that there was no justification for the existence of Judaism and Jewish culture in the modern world, a radical assimilationist perspective which saw the Jews completely integrating into the larger society.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Erik Ebbestad Hansen, [https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/8831 The Jews - Teachers of the Nazis?] In: NORDEUROPAforum. Journal for the Study of Culture. Yearbook 2015.

In his later life, Steiner was accused by the [[Nazis]] of being a Jew, and [[Adolf Hitler]] called anthroposophy "Jewish methods". The anthroposophical institutions in Germany were banned during Nazi rule and several anthroposophists sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Staudenmeier, [https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/17662/Staudenmaier%2C%20Peter.pdf?sequence=1 Between Occultism and Facism] - Anthroposophy and the Politics of Race and

Important early anthroposophists who were Jewish included two central members on the executive boards of the precursors to the modern Anthroposophical Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=24 Adolf Arenson] (board member 1904-1913) and [http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=724 Carl Unger] (board member 1908-1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and Karl König, the founder of the [[Camphill movement]], who had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Paddock and Mado Spiegler: Judaism and Anthroposophy, pp. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Buber]] and [[Hugo Bergmann]], who viewed Steiner's social ideas as a solution to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab–Jewish conflict]], were also influenced by anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;Paddock &amp; Spiegler 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous anthroposophical organisations in [[Israel]], including the anthroposophical [[kibbutz]] [[Harduf]], founded by [[Jesaiah Ben-Aharon]], forty Waldorf kindergartens and seventeen [[Waldorf schools]] (stand as of 2018).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Waldorf_World_List/Waldorf_World_List.pdf Statistics for Waldorf schools worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these organizations are striving to foster positive relationships between the Arab and Jewish populations: The Harduf Waldorf school includes both Jewish and Arab faculty and students, and has extensive contact with the surrounding Arab communities, while the first joint Arab-Jewish kindergarten was a Waldorf program in Hilf near [[Haifa]].

===Christian Community===
{{Main|Christian Community}}
Towards the end of Steiner's life, a group of theology students (primarily Lutheran, with some Roman Catholic members) approached Steiner for help in reviving Christianity, in particular "to bridge the widening gulf between modern science and the world of spirit".&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; They approached a notable [[Lutheran]] pastor, [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], who was already working with Steiner's ideas, to join their efforts. Out of their co-operative endeavor, the ''Movement for Religious Renewal'', now generally known as [[The Christian Community]], was born. Steiner emphasized that he considered this movement, and his role in creating it, to be independent of his anthroposophical work,&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; as he wished anthroposophy to be independent of any particular [[religion]] or religious denomination.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

The historian of religion [[Olav Hammer]] has termed anthroposophy "the most important esoteric society in European history."&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;[[Olav Hammer]], ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', Brill 2004, pp. 329; 64f; 225-8; 176. See also p. 98,&lt;/ref&gt; Authors, scientists, and physicians including [[Michael Shermer]], Michael Ruse, [[Edzard Ernst]], [[David Gorski]], and [[Simon Singh]] have criticized anthroposophy's application in the areas of medicine, biology, agriculture, and education to be dangerous and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="ShermerEncyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruse2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianWaldorf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski"/&gt; Others including former Waldorf pupil Dan Dugan and historian Geoffrey Ahern have criticized anthroposophy itself as a dangerous cult that is fundamentally anti-rational and anti-scientific.&lt;ref name="DuganCritics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RawlingsQuackwatch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisQuackoMeter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndependentWaldorf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShermerEncyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SunAtMidnight"/&gt;

===Scientific basis===
Though Rudolf Steiner studied [[natural science]] at the Vienna Technical University at the undergraduate level, his [[doctorate]] was in epistemology and very little of his work is directly concerned with the empirical sciences. In his mature work, when he did refer to science it was often to present phenomenological or [[Goethean science]] as an alternative to what he considered the materialistic science of his contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

Steiner's primary interest was in applying the methodology of science to realms of inner experience and the spiritual worlds (His appreciation that the essence of science is its method of inquiry is unusual among [[esoteric]]ists&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;), and Steiner called anthroposophy ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' (lit.: Science of the mind, or cultural or spiritual science), a term generally used in German to refer to the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philolex.de/geistwis.htm |title=Philolex entry |publisher=Philolex.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether this is a sufficient basis for anthroposophy to be considered a spiritual science has been a matter of controversy.&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, Chap. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HammerB&gt;Olav Hammer, ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', Brill 2004, pp. 243, 329, 204, 225&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; As Freda Easton explained in her study of Waldorf schools, "Whether one accepts anthroposophy as a science depends upon whether one accepts Steiner's interpretation of a science that extends the consciousness and capacity of human beings to experience their inner spiritual world."&lt;ref&gt;Freda Easton, ''The Waldorf Impulse in Education'', Columbia University dissertation 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Sven Ove Hansson]] has disputed anthroposophy's claim to a scientific basis, stating that its ideas are not empirically derived and neither reproducible nor testable.&lt;ref&gt;Sven Ove Hansson, ''Is Anthroposophy Science?'', Professor, Philosophy Unit of the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, in Conceptus XXV (1991), No. 64, pp. 37&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlo Willmann points out that as, on its own terms, anthroposophical methodology offers no possibility of being falsified except through its own procedures of spiritual investigation, no [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective validation]] is possible by conventional scientific methods; it thus cannot stand up to empiricist critics.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; Peter Schneider describes such objections as untenable, asserting that that if a non-sensory, non-physical realm exists, then according to Steiner the experiences of pure thinking possible within the normal realm of consciousness would already be experiences of that, and it would be impossible to exclude the possibility of empirically grounded experiences of other supersensory content.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

Olav Hammer suggests that anthroposophy carries [[scientism]] "to lengths unparalleled in any other Esoteric position" due to its dependence upon claims of clairvoyant experience, its subsuming natural science under "spiritual science." Hammer also asserts that the development of what she calls "fringe" sciences such as [[anthroposophic medicine]] and [[biodynamic agriculture]] are justified partly on the basis of the ethical and ecological values they promote, rather than purely on a scientific basis.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

Though Steiner saw that spiritual vision itself is difficult for others to achieve, he recommended open-mindedly exploring and rationally testing the results of such research; he also urged others to follow a spiritual training that would allow them directly to apply his methods to achieve comparable results.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

[[Anthony Storr]] stated about Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy: "His belief system is so eccentric, so unsupported by evidence, so manifestly bizarre, that rational skeptics are bound to consider it delusional....  But, whereas Einstein's way of perceiving the world by thought became confirmed by experiment and mathematical proof, Steiner's remained intensely subjective and insusceptible of objective confirmation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storr|first1=Anthony|author-link1=Anthony Storr|year=1997|orig-year=1996|chapter=IV.

===Religious nature===
As an explicitly spiritual movement, anthroposophy has sometimes been called a religious philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=anthroposophy definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561500913/anthroposophy.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kyWUo6lQ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561500913/anthroposophy.html |archivedate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 [[PLANS|People for Legal and Non-Sectarian Schools (PLANS)]] started a lawsuit alleging that anthroposophy is a religion for [[Establishment Clause]] purposes and therefore several California school districts  should not be chartering Waldorf schools; the lawsuit was dismissed in 2012 for failure to show anthroposophy was a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= PLANS, Inc. v.

===Statements on race===
Anthroposophical ideas have been criticized from both sides in the race debate:

* From the mid-1930s on, National Socialist ideologues attacked the anthroposophical world-view as being opposed to Nazi racist and nationalistic principles; anthroposophy considered "Blood, Race and Folk" as primitive instincts that must be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, 7. Februar 1935. BAD R 4901&amp;ndash;3285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report of the SD-Hauptamtes Berlin: "Anthroposophy”, May 1936, BAD Z/B I 904.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An academic analysis of the educational approach noted that "a naive version of the evolution of consciousness, a theory foundational to both Steiner's anthroposophy and Waldorf education, sometimes places one race below another in one or another dimension of development".&lt;ref name="McDermott"&gt;Ray McDermott et al.: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/5q9t836w350v8768/ ''Waldorf education in an inner-city public school''.] ''The Urban Review'', Volume 28, Number 2 / June, 1996, pp. 119&amp;ndash;140&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such critiques, the [[Anthroposophical Society]] in America published a statement clarifying its stance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We explicitly reject any racial theory that may be construed to be part of Rudolf Steiner's writings. The Anthroposophical Society in America is an open, public society and it rejects any purported spiritual or scientific theory on the basis of which the alleged superiority of one race is justified at the expense of another race.&lt;ref&gt;The General Council of the Anthroposophical Society in America (1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080106140711/http://www.anthroposophy.org/Gov/StatementOnDiversity.php Position Statement on Diversity].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2785">The term '''biblical authority''' refers to the extent to which commandments and doctrines within the [[Bible | Old and New Testament scriptures]] are authoritative over humans' [[belief]] and conduct, as well as the extent to which Biblical propositions are accurate in matters of history and science. The case for biblical authority stems from the claim that [[God]] has revealed himself in written form through human authors and that the information contained in [[Biblical canon (Christian) | canonical books]] is not of human origin.  It entails, but is not exhausted by, questions raised by [[biblical inerrancy]], [[biblical infallibility]], [[biblical interpretation]], [[biblical criticism]], and [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a debate over biblical authority arose between [[Jack Rogers (clergy)|Jack B. Rogers]] and [[Donald K. McKim]], on the one hand, and John D. Woodbridge, on the other.  Rogers and McKim, in their 1979 book, ''The Authority and Interpretation of the Bible: An Historical Approach'', advanced the view that the Bible has authority over social endeavors (issuing imperatives for conduct, for church organization, and for articles of faith) but isn't necessarily reliable in its reportage of historical events and scientific facts.  The belief that Scripture is "inerrant" in matters of history and science, argued Rogers and McKim, constituted a 19th-century innovation.  Woodbridge challenged this thesis in his 1982 book ''Biblical Authority: A Critique of the Rogers/McKim Proposal'',&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
arguing that for each of those categories, [[Word of God (disambiguation) | God's Word]] has authority and is without error.  Moreover, Woodbridge asserted that this particular view of biblical authority had been the normative, orthodox position throughout the [[history of Christianity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12923">A '''center of origin''' (or '''center of diversity''') is a geographical area where a group of organisms, either domesticated or wild, first developed its distinctive properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|title=International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i0510e.pdf |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |year=2009|page=Article 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also considered centers of diversity. Centers of origin were first identified in 1924 by [[Nikolai Vavilov]].

==Plants==
Locating the origin of crop plants is basic to [[plant breeding]].  This allows one to locate wild relatives, related species, and new genes (especially dominant [[genes]], which may provide resistance to diseases).
Knowledge of the origins of crop plants is important in order to avoid [[genetic erosion]], the loss of germplasm due to the loss of ecotypes and landraces, loss of habitat (such as rainforests), and increased urbanization. Germplasm preservation is accomplished through [[gene banks]] (largely seed collections but now frozen stem sections) and preservation of natural habitats (especially in centers of origin).

Vavilov argued that plants were not domesticated somewhere in the world at random, but that there were regions where domestication started. The center of origin is also considered the center of diversity.

Vavilov centers are regions where a high diversity of [[crop wild relative]]s can be found, representing the natural relatives of domesticated crop plants. Later in 1935 Vavilov divided the centers into 12, giving the following list:

# Chinese center
# Indian center
# Indo-Malayan center
# Central Asiatic center
# Persian center
# Mediterranean center
# Abyssinian center
# South American center
# Central American center
# Chilean center
# Brazilian-Paraguayan center
# North American center

==Importance==

In 2016, researchers linked the origins and primary regions of diversity ("areas typically including the locations of the initial domestication of crops, encompassing the primary geographical zones of crop variation generated since that time, and containing relatively high species richness in crop wild relatives") of food and agricultural crops with their current importance around the world in modern national food supplies and agricultural production. The results indicated that foreign crops were 68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean, and their usage has greatly increased in the last fifty years.&lt;ref name=Khouryorigins&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khoury, C.K. |author2=Achicanoy, H.A. |author3=Bjorkman, A.D. |author4=Navarro-Racines, C. |author5=Guarino, L. |author6=Flores-Palacios, X. |author7=Engels, J.M.M. |author8=Wiersema, J.H. |author9=Dempewolf, H. |author10=Sotelo, S. |author11=Ramírez-Villegas, J. |author12=Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P. |author13=Fowler, C. |author14=Jarvis, A. |author15=Rieseberg, L.H. |author16=Struik, P.C. |title=Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide |journal=Proc.

{{Christianity and gender|positions}}

'''Christian egalitarianism''' (derived from the [[French language|French]] word '''égal''', meaning ''equal'' or ''level''), also known as '''biblical equality''', is a Christian form of [[egalitarianism]]. It holds that all human persons are created equally in God's sight—equal in fundamental worth and moral status. This view does not just apply to gender, but to religion, skin colour and any other differences between individuals. It does not imply that all have equal skills, abilities, interests, or physiological or genetic traits. Christian egalitarianism holds that all people are equal before [[God in Christianity|God]] and in [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]]; have equal responsibility to use their gifts and obey their calling to the glory of God; and are called to roles and ministries without regard to class, gender, or race.&lt;ref&gt;Padgett, Alan G. "What Is Biblical Equality?" ''Priscilla Papers'', Summer 2002: 16:3 Padgett is professor of Systematic Theology at Luther Seminary, St. Paul, MN.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equality==
According to Christian egalitarianism, [[gender equality]] is biblically sound in Christian church leadership (including [[pastor]]s) and in Christian marriage. Its theological foundations are interpretations of the teachings and example of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] and other [[New Testament]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Parakeet: Rethinking How You Read the Bible  Scot McKnight - 2008 "The former is often called "complementarian" and the latter "egalitarian," though simple labels mask both the seriousness of the views as well as nuances within and between such views. The term "complementarian" fudges the reality; ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

It refers to a biblically-based belief that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that [[women]] and [[men]] are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.&lt;ref&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. "The Bible and Gender Equality." [http://www.cbeinternational.org Christians for Biblical Equality Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linda Belleville"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Belleville|authorlink1=Women in Ministry: an egalitarian perspective|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=James R.|title=Two views on women in ministry|date=2009|isbn=0-310-86451-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pXcMvBsrMLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=biblical+views+of+women#v=onepage&amp;q=biblical%20views%20of%20women&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egalitarian beliefs are generally subscribed to by [[Quaker]]s, [[The United Methodist Church|United Methodist Churches]], The Presbyterian Church (USA), The Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians (ECO), [[American Baptist Churches USA|Northern Baptists]], [[Church of the Nazarene]], [[Wesleyan Church]], [[Evangelical Covenant Church|The Evangelical Covenant Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.covchurch.org/wc/2011/07/what-do-you-think/|title="What do you think?" - Worship Connect|date=2011-07-15|work=Worship Connect|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Pentecostal churches such as the [[Assemblies of God]] and [[United Church of God]].

The opposing view is [[complementarianism]], a view which holds that differing, often non-overlapping roles between men and women, manifested in marriage, church leadership, and elsewhere, are biblically required. Complementarianism is the belief that men were created for the headship role and women were created for the support role.

== Biblical foundations ==

All three Synoptic Gospels record Jesus as saying:
{{Quotation|You know that the rulers of the Gentiles ''lord it over'' them, and their high officials ''exercise authority'' over them. But it shall not be so among you".{{bibleref2c|Matthew|20:25–26||Mt 20:25–26a}} {{bibleref2c|Mk|10:42}} {{bibleref2c|Lk|22:25}}}} According to Clive Marsh and Steve Moyise, while "lord it over" implies abusive leadership, Jesus' words "exercise authority" have no connotation of abuse of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. ''Jesus and the Gospels.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. {{ISBN|0-567-04073-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apostle Paul]] wrote:

{{quotation|There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.|{{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}}}

Christian egalitarians' interpretation of scriptures and spiritual convictions bring them to the conclusion that the manner and teaching of Jesus ''abolished'' [[discrimination]] against racial minorities, slaves, and women in both the church and marriage. They believe that the Bible teaches the fundamental equality of believers of all racial and ethnic groups and all economic classes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiritrestoration.org/Church/ministry-profile-christians-for-biblical-equality.htm Christians for Biblical Equality&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=October 2015}}{{Self-published inline|date=October 2015}} They consider overarching principles of the [[Bible]] to be that [[Gender equality|men and women are equally created]] in God's image, equally responsible for sin, equally redeemed by Christ, and equally gifted by God's Spirit for service and held responsible for using their God-given gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. (2011) ''Let My People Go: A Call to End the Oppression of Women in the Church.'' Charleston, SC: Createspace. {{ISBN|978-1-4664-0111-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the six times [[Aquila and Priscilla|Aquila and his wife Priscilla]] are mentioned by name in the New Testament, they are listed together as a couple. Their order of appearance alternates in a perfect odd-even equality, with each mentioned first three times. Aquila appears first in the first, third and fifth mentions, and Priscilla (Prisca) first in the second, fourth and sixth mentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|18:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:18|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:26|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|16:3|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|16:19|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:19|KJV}} Authorized Version&lt;/ref&gt; Some revisions of the Bible put Priscilla rather than Aquila first, in Acts 18:26, following the Vulgate and a few Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Acts%2018:26 Acts 18:26 multi-version]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest that Priscilla was the head of the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Achtenmeier |first=P.J. |title=HarperCollins Bible Dictionary |publisher=HarperCollins |edition=revised |year=1996 |page=882 |isbn=0-06-060037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Christian egalitarianism holds that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status. A significant source of this trend of thought is the Christian notion that humankind were created in the living [[image of God]] ''(Imago Dei)''.

Jesus Christ did not conform to a mentality unfavorable to women, but reacted against inequalities based on sexual differences.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrative of efforts to institutionalize this notion are these excerpts from the organizational ''Statement of Faith'' of [[Christians for Biblical Equality]], a major Christian Egalitarian organization:

==History==
The first organization whose purpose was advocating Christian egalitarianism was "Men, Women and God", established in the United Kingdom in 1984. The American organization [[Christians for Biblical Equality]] was established by [[evangelicals]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBE's History|url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/content/cbes-history|website=CBE International|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Egalitarian anthropologies ==
Titled in accordance with [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]]'s work in Christian theology, Egalitarian anthropologies explore varying views of gender equality in Christianity. These include [[Eschatology|eschatological]] feminism, [[liberal feminism]], and romantic feminism. According to Ruether, the commonality among these anthropologies is the belief that gender equality was the original intention of God and that it was somehow skewed by humanity. Ruether goes on to point out that the belief in the ideal of gender equality "leaves room for considerable variation in relating this equality to woman's present subjugated state in history under patriarchy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexism and God-Talk|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1986|isbn=0-8070-1205-X|location=Boston, MA|pages=99–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding statement, Ruether qualifies the need for further exploration into the following anthropologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Eschatological feminism ===
Ruether connects eschatological feminism to [[mysticism]] and [[asceticism]] by way of its roots in [[transcendentalism]]. Her assertion is that the original human, Adam, was androgynous and that "[[Fall of man|the fall]]" was the initial creation of gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruether|first=Rose Radford|date=2014|title=Sexism and Misogyny in the Christian Tradition: Liberating Alternatives|url=|journal=Buddhist-Christian Studies|volume=34|pages=83–94|via=|doi=10.1353/bcs.2014.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reaffirms this point in a later article, "Sexism and Misogyny in the Christian Tradition: Liberating Alternatives", referencing Galatians 3:28,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3:28&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Galatians 3:28 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that through baptism androgyny is restored.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sexuality, the main division between genders, is said to be the root of female subordination. Relationships that are typically rooted in sexuality (marriage and motherhood) place women in roles that are subordinate in accordance with society's patriarchal norms. The path to equality is believed to be found when women transcend these roles- traditionally through celibacy (as seen in the life of Paul&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Corinthians 7 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Transcending worldly norms, which the Bible instructs Christians to do,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12:2&amp;version=ESV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Romans 12:2 - English Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; brings men and women to the state of androgyny that eliminates gender subordination; thus, Christianity is intended to manifest gender equality. Ruether says that transcendence is the core of eschatological feminism; women reach equality with men by separating from the world, rather than changing it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Liberal feminism ===
Liberal feminism rejects the notion that creation established the patriarchy; Ruether asserts that gender equality originally existed, but was distorted by historical injustices against women. This branch of egalitarianism dictates that gender equality must be restored rather than introduced. This restoration will be accomplished by economic, political, social, and systemic reformation. Ruether includes the church in her discussion of social reform, displaying its participation in gender subordination. Ruether continues saying, "The Church as a bearer of redeemed humanity ought especially to represent this equality of men and women in its institutional life. But it does so as a paradigm of what all social institutions should become, not as a representative of an eschatological humanity outside of and beyond history."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Here she distinguishes liberal from eschatological feminism stating that liberal feminism calls for liberation within society, rather than removal from it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Romantic feminism ===
Ruether states that in romantic feminism the distinction between genders is found primarily in "spiritual" traits. Ruether references a sixteenth century humanist, Cornelius Agrippa, saying that women have an "affinity with divine Wisdom that gives them  moral and spiritual superiority."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Montanist Oracles and Testimonia|last=Heine|first=Ronald E.|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Macon, GA|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are perceived to be innately altruistic, sensitive, and pure- traits that are considered morally superior compared to "male traits." Ruether continues saying that men and women are both inherently capable of goodness, but because of the patriarchy placing men into positions of power, more negative character traits are manifested (pride, aggression, dominance, etc.). Since women are not allowed into positions of power, Ruether supposes that they retain humanity's natural goodness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Romantic feminism contains varying ideologies in itself which are as follows.

==== Conservative romanticism ====
According to Ruether, conservative romanticism suggests that women remain in the home in order to maintain their goodness. Ruether says, "If a woman leaves the home to take up a traditional male occupation, she will straightaway lose this good femininity and become a she-male, a monstrous virago, or will become debased to carnal femaleness, fallen woman." In one survey conducted in 1999 a researcher concluded based on participants' responses, "Even though husbands were not always the sole providers, for the majority of men they remained symbolically so, such that women's employment was nearly  always described as secondary, even expendable, in light of wives' responsibility to rear and nurture children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Sally K.|last2=Smith|first2=Christian|date=1999|title=Symbolic Traditionalism and Pragmatic Egalitarianism: Contemporary Evangelicals, Families, and Gender|jstor=190389|journal=Gender and Society|volume=13|issue=2|pages=211–233|doi=10.2307/190389}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative romanticism opposes gender equality in the work force in order to better preserve traditional roles in the home. Women's innate goodness makes her the ideal candidate to raise children and to support the husband. In turn, this spousal support allows the husband to perform better in the workforce; this trickle effect of women sending good husbands and sons into the world is how conservative romantics suppose women make an impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Reformist romanticism ====
Reformist romanticism aligns with conservative romanticism except in the reformist belief that the inherent goodness of women cannot be lost by equality in society. Ruether says that this ideology prescribes women to morally reform men and male-centric institutions, but to do so they require education, voting rights, and political power. Reformist romanticism believes that the innate goodness of women is needed in leadership positions to improve the nature of the world. It is also believed that the nature of women is incompatible with war and that under female leadership, the world would be at peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Radical romanticism ====
Radical feminism rejects the entirety of male culture and debates whether males can be redeemed at all. Ruether says that radical feminists desire a utopian society completely independent from males in which women's inherent goodness is unimpeded by male inferiority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Catholic views on egalitarianism==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has formally opposed ''[[radical egalitarianism]]'' and has stated that the differences between men and women are not merely phenomenal, but are in fact ontological in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn073104.htm National Catholic Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 ''Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World'', Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] warned against a related tendency to see gender as culturally constructed, which has generated "a new model of polymorphous sexuality", which reflects an "attempt to be free from one’s biological conditioning".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vis.pcn.net/doc/040731x_en.htm VIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Guest was the son of [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest]]. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1929 and studied from 1930 to 1931 in [[Göttingen]] in Germany, where he was sentenced to two weeks in prison for anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] political activity. On his return he joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] at Cambridge in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grahamstevenson.me.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=250:david-guest&amp;catid=7:g&amp;Itemid=108|title=David Guest|author=Michael Walker|publisher=Communist Biogs|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There Guest became the head of a party cell that included [[John Cornford]], [[Guy Burgess]], [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], [[Victor Kiernan]] and [[James Klugmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/David_Guest.htm Biography of David Guest]&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled dons such as [[Maurice Dobb]] and [[John Bernal]] to take a back-seat. It was claimed that David Guest would "stride into hall at Trinity wearing a hammer and sickle pin in his lapel."&lt;ref&gt; Phillip Knightley, Philby: KGB Masterspy (1988) page 32&lt;/ref&gt;  

After leaving Cambridge Guest lectured in [[mathematics]] and worked for the Communist party at the ''Peoples' Bookshop'' in [[Lavender Hill]], also teaching for a short while at a secondary school for English-speaking children in Moscow.

In 1938 he left his post as a lecturer at [[University of Southampton|University College]] in [[Southampton]] to volunteer for the [[International Brigades]] fighting in Spain. He wrote of his decision:
:''Today we have certainly entered a period of crisis, when the arguments of 'normal times' no longer apply, when considerations of most immediate usefulness come in. That is why I have decided to take the opportunity of going to Spain.''
Guest arrived in Spain on 31 March 1938 and joined the [[British Battalion]] of the International Brigades. The Battalion went into action at the [[Battle of the Ebro]] which began on 25 July 1938. Three days later, on 28 July 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/spanjews.pdf |title=Against Fascism – Jews who served in The International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War |first=Martin |last=Sugarman |work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |year=2012|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international-brigades.org.uk/british_volunteers/roll_of_honour.htm |title=List of those who died in Spain |first1=Jim |last1=Carmody |first2=Richard |last2=Baxell |authorlink2=Richard Baxell |work=[[International Brigade Memorial Trust]] |year=2012 |accessdate=6 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207001643/http://www.international-brigades.org.uk/british_volunteers/roll_of_honour.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Guest was killed on Hill 481&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I14848&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged |title=David Haden-Guest |first=Nicholas |last=Jenkins |work=W.H.

'''''De libero arbitrio''''' ('''''libri tres''''') ([[English language|English]]: '''''On Free Choice of the Will''''') is a book by [[Augustine of Hippo]] about the [[Free will in theology|freedom of will]]. Young Augustine wrote it in three volumes, one 387–389 in Rome, after his [[baptism]], and the other two between 391 and 395, after his priestly ordination in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Roberts: ''Augustine's Earliest Writings'', in: ''The Journal of Religion'', Vol. 33, No. 3, July 1953, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author started ''De libero arbitrio'' as a part of a series of works against [[Manichaeism]] and argued in favor of aspects of [[Scepticism]]. Augustine challenged [[Determinism]] in the first volume and investigated the conditions of the existence of God and knowledge in the other two parts.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chadwick: ''Augustine'' in: Frances Margaret Young, Lewis Ayres, Andrew Louth: ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', CUP, Cambridge 2004, pp. 330–331.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dispensational theology''' refers to the unified teachings of [[dispensationalism]] that address what other views teach as divergent theologies in the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. Its name reflects a view that biblical history is best understood as a series of [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]]s, or separated time-periods, in the Bible.

Each dispensation is said to represent a different way in which God deals with man. Some writers also believe that it also involves a different testing of Man. "These periods are marked off in Scripture by some change in God's method of dealing with mankind, in respect to two questions: of sin, and of man's responsibility," explained [[Cyrus Scofield|C. I. Scofield]]. "Each of the dispensations may be regarded as a new test of the natural man, and each ends in judgment—marking his utter failure in every dispensation."

==Periodization==

===Seven dispensational periods===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Dispensationalism seeks to address what many see as opposing theologies between the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. Its name comes from the fact that it sees biblical history as best understood in light of a series of dispensations in the Bible. Most dispensationalists cite seven dispensations although this is not a critical or foundational factor to the theology: 
 
# the dispensation of [[innocence]] (Gen 1:1–3:7), prior to Adam's [[original sin|fall]],
# of [[conscience]] (Gen 3:8–8:22), Adam to Noah,
# of [[government]] (Gen 9:1–11:32), Noah to Abraham,
# of [[patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchal]] rule (Gen 12:1–Exod 19:25), Abraham to Moses,
# of the [[Torah|Mosaic Law]] (Exod 20:1–Acts 2:4), Moses to Christ,
# of [[divine grace|grace]] (Acts 2:4–Rev 20:3—except for [[Hyperdispensationalism|Hyperdispensationalists]] and [[Ultradispensationalism|Ultradispensationalists]]), the longest dispensation, is the current church age, and
# of a literal, earthly 1,000-year [[Millennium|Millennial]] Kingdom that has yet to come but soon will (Rev 20:4–20:6).

[[John Nelson Darby]] did not consider the [[Garden of Eden]] to represent a dispensation, and listed only six.

Each one of these dispensations is said to represent a different way in which God deals with man, specifically a different test for man.  "These periods are marked off in Scripture by some change in God's method of dealing with mankind, in respect to two questions: of sin, and of man's responsibility," explained C. I. Scofield. "Each of the dispensations may be regarded as a new test of the natural man, and each ends in judgment—marking his utter failure in every dispensation."

Viewing the flow of biblical history as a series of "dispensations" may be seen in some works that predate Darby's dispensationalism. [[Joachim of Fiore]] proposed that human history would be divided into the [[Three Eras|three ages]] of the [[Father]], [[Son]], and [[Holy Spirit]]. The term "dispensation" is drawn from [[Calvinist]] theology, as in the [[Westminster Confession]], to describe the different forms of divine worship and law practiced in Judaism and Christianity. Some writers, such as ''L'Économie Divine'' by [[Pierre Poiret]] (1646&amp;ndash;1719), listed multiple dispensations. However, these earlier works did not include the unique testing/failure motif described by Scofield or any hint of the four underlying tenets of classic dispensationalism listed below.

===Four dispensational periods===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
An alternative to the above “seven-dispensations” approach derives from the question: How and by whom is God evangelizing lost men and women at any given time? A pattern can be traced through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. First, through various Gentile nations; second, through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the progenitors of the nation Israel; thirdly, through Jesus Christ; fourthly, through the Church, the Body of Christ. (Israel becomes the focus of divine dealings again after the Rapture for 7 more years). This is followed by the Second Coming proper and the instituting of the millennial kingdom.

# the dispensation or age of Gentile nations (Gen 1-11), from Adam to Abraham’s Call;
# of Israel (Gen 12 – Acts 1), from Abraham’s Call to Pentecost in Acts 2;
# of the Church (Acts 2 – Rev. 2), the longest one, from Pentecost in Act 2 to the end of the Church age;
# of the (missionary) tribulation of Israel (Rev. 6-19), A yet-future seven-year period;
# of a literal, earthly 1,000-year millennial kingdom that has yet to come but soon will (Rev 20:4–20:6).

==Basic tenets==

===Progressive revelation===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
One of the most important underlying theological concepts for dispensationalists is progressive revelation. While some nondispensationalists start with progressive revelation in the New Testament and refer this revelation back into the Old Testament, dispensationalists begin with progressive revelation in the Old Testament and read forward in a historical sense. Therefore, there is an emphasis on discontinuity as seen in Scripture&lt;!-- This is the second time I'm seeing this 'discontinuity' statement. What exactly do you mean? --&gt;. Biblical covenants are intricately tied to the dispensations. When these Biblical covenants are compared and contrasted, the result is a historical ordering of different dispensations. Also with regard to the different Biblical covenant promises, dispensationalists place more emphasis on to whom these promises were written, the original recipients. This has led to certain fundamental dispensational beliefs, such as a distinction between Israel and the church.

===Historical-grammatical interpretation===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Another important theological concept is the emphasis on what is referred to as the historical-grammatical method of interpretation. This is often popularly referred to as the "literal" interpretation of Scripture. Just as it is with progressive revelation, the historical-grammatical method is not a concept or practice that is exclusive to dispensationalists. However, a dispensational distinctive is created when the historical-grammatical method of interpretation is closely coupled with an emphasis on progressive revelation along with the historical development of the covenants in Scripture.

===Distinction between Israel and the church===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
All dispensationalists perceive a clear distinction between Israel and the church, particularly as different groups who receive a different set of promises. Dispensationalists hold that God provided the nation of Israel with specific promises which will be fulfilled at a future time in the Jews. The Church has received a different set of promises than that of Israel. Most dispensationalists also recognize "membership" overlap between Israel and the Church. Jewish Christians such as Paul, Peter and John are in this category. While most do not believe that Israel and the church are mutually exclusive groups, there is a small minority of past and present dispensationalists who do. Those who do hold that Israel and the church are mutually exclusive include some classical dispensationalists and virtually all ultradispensationalists.

===Other proposed distinctions: law and grace ===
Classical dispensationalism teaches that law and grace are mutually exclusive concepts. Statements made by Scofield and other early classic dispensationalists teach a radical law-grace distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth| author =C. I. Scofield| chapter =Ch. 6, Law and Grace| pages =34, 36|chapter-url =http://www.biblebelievers.com/scofield/scofield_rightly06.html| accessdate =2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Nelson Darby]], ''[http://www.stempublishing.com/authors/darby/MISCELLA/34031_4E.html The Law, and the Gospel of the Glory of Christ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922020646/http://www.stempublishing.com/authors/darby/MISCELLA/34031_4E.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}'', pp. 431, 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they teach that law ''contains'' no grace, and that grace is not ''conditioned'' on keeping the law. This does not mean that grace was missing from the dispensation of law, only that the law itself was diametrically opposed to grace, which operated by other means (such as promises and blessings). Some modern dispensationalists disagree with making such a radical distinction. In fact, Daniel Fuller, a non-dispensationalist, stated in his book ''Gospel and Law'' (p.&amp;nbsp;51) that "Although today's dispensationalism explains the relationship between law and grace in wording that is different from that of [[covenant theology]], there is no substantial difference in meaning."

== Types ==

=== Classical dispensationalism ===
Early dispensational writers such as Darby and Chafer are referred to as classical dispensationalists. This view differs from today's traditional or "revised" dispensationalists. The early Scofield Bible (but not the Revised Scofield Bible) reflects a classical dispensational view. Classical dispensationalists are a small minority today, and Miles Stanford is one writer who represents this point of view. Also known as Pauline dispensationalism, they hold to an Acts 2 start for the church and practice water baptism and the Lord's Supper. Many of the peculiar doctrines taught by this position have also been taught in the Mid-Acts camp (hyperdispensationalism) which has even used the 'Pauline Dispensationalism' moniker to describe their doctrine. Yet hyperdispensationalists today have not necessarily maintained these teachings due to no central authority and a desire to be faithful to Scripture. Meanwhile, Acts 2 Pauline Dispensationalism in some camps (Peter Ruckman, Douglas Stauffer, William Grady) have garnered a reputation of being as extreme as the hyperdispensationalists and ultradispensationalists in making sharp distinctions between the earthly/prophetic program for Israel and the heavenly/mystery program for the church, as well as, teaching different ways of salvation in different dispensations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wayoflife.org/reports/beware_of_hyper_dispensatinalism.html Unfortunately, the author of the material on this web site confuses Classic Pauline Dispensationalists with hyperdispensationalists and ultradispensationalists.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional dispensationalism ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
The traditional view is the majority view for dispensationalists today. John Walvoord and Charles Ryrie are two traditional dispensational authors. The Revised Scofield Bible of the 1960s also reflects a traditional dispensational view, which is why traditional dispensationalists are sometimes called "Revised" dispensationalists.

=== Progressive dispensationalism ===
{{main article|Progressive dispensationalism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
In the late 1980s a number of dispensational scholars—in particular [[Craig A. Blaising]], [[Darrell L. Bock]], and  [[Robert L. Saucy]]—proposed a significant new position developed from within dispensationalism. The major difference between traditional and progressive dispensationalism is in how each views the relationship of the present dispensation to the past and future dispensations.

Traditional dispensationalists perceive the present age of grace to be a parenthesis or "intercalation" with relation to past and future dispensations. In general that means God's plans as revealed in the past dispensations have been "put on hold" until after the rapture. Progressive dispensationalists however hold that this present dispensation is a key link between past dispensations and the future dispensations. In general that means God's plans have continued in this present dispensation, marking it as a crucial link between past and future dispensations and not a parenthesis. This idea of a key link or progression between dispensations has resulted in the label progressive dispensationalism.

Progressive dispensationalism holds much in common with traditional dispensationalism, including a distinction between Israel and the Church, a future rapture, a 7-year tribulation, and the rule of Christ over the earth centered in Jerusalem during the millennial kingdom.

Both progressive and traditional dispensationalists hold to a clear distinction between Israel and the Church. In short, God has provided the nation of Israel with specific promises such as possession of the land, promises which will be fulfilled in the future. Both Progressive and traditional dispensationalists do recognize some "membership" overlap between the Israel and the Church: Jewish Christians such Paul, Peter, and John are all Jewish (of Israel) and Christian (members of the church). This is in contrast to ultradispensationalists who see the Church and Israel as mutually exclusive.

Both progressive and traditional dispensationalists hold to a distinctly "dispensational" end-time view with a pretribulation rapture and a millennial kingdom with Jesus physically reigning from Jerusalem. This common view with traditional dispensationalism is also what clearly distinguishes progressive dispensationalism from historical premillennialism.

The reasons for progressives holding to a progression of dispensations as opposed to a parenthesis is related to:
1) the relationship between the covenants, and
2) hermeneutics.

====Relationship between the covenants====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
One of the most crucial covenants which highlight the differences between progressive and traditional dispensationalists is the new covenant. In the past, dispensationalists have had a surprising variety of views with regard to the new covenant. Some dispensationalists (Charles Ryrie, Walvoord in the 1950s) argued for two new covenants: one new covenant for the church and another new covenant for Israel. &lt;!-- Since when did Ryrie and Walvoord argue that there's a new covenant for Israel? This appears unsourced. I have their books and they only talk about "The New Covenant". --&gt;Other dispensationalists (Darby and John Master) argued for one new covenant applied only to Israel. And still other dispensationalists (Scofield and John McGahey 1950s) have argued for one new covenant for 1) believing Israel today and an ongoing partial fulfillment, and for 2) a future believing Israel when Jesus returns for a complete fulfillment.

Progressive dispensationalists, like Scofield and McGahey, argue for one new covenant with an ongoing partial fulfillment and a future complete fulfillment for Israel. Progressives hold that the new covenant was inaugurated by Christ at the last supper. Progressives hold that while there are aspects of the new covenant currently being fulfilled, there is yet to be a final and complete fulfillment of the new covenant in the future. This concept is sometimes referred to as an already-but not yet fulfillment.

====Hermeneutics====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Both traditional and progressive dispensationalists share the same historical-grammatical hermeneutic. As with all dispensationalists, progressive revelation is emphasized so that the dispensationalist interprets the Old Testament in such a way as to retain the original meaning and audience. Thus progressives, like traditionalists, place great emphasis on the original meaning and audience of the text.

The primary differences in hermeneutics between traditionalists and progressives are that
1) progressives are more apt to see ''partial or ongoing fulfillment'', and
2) progressives are more apt to utilize [[complementary hermeneutics]].

These differences between traditionalists and progressives show up in how one views the Old Testament texts and promises in the New Testament and how they are handled by the New Testament writers.

For traditionalists who perceive the present dispensation as a parenthesis, the standard approach has been to view Old Testament quotations in the New Testament as applications rather than fulfillment. If an Old Testament quotation is said to have a fulfillment role in the New Testament, then that may imply that the present dispensation is no longer a parenthesis, but has a relationship or connection with the prior dispensation.

In contrast, progressives, instead of approaching all Old Testament quotations in the New Testament as application, attempt to take into account the context and grammatical-historical features of both OT and New Testament texts. An Old Testament quote in the New Testament might turn out to be an application, but it also might be a partial fulfillment or a complete fulfillment or even something else.

Complementary hermeneutics means that previous revelation (such as the Old Testament) has an added or expanded meaning alongside the original meaning. For example, in Jeremiah 31:31-34, the original recipients of the new covenant were Jews - i.e., "the house of Israel and the house of Judah." Progressives hold that in Acts 2, believing Jews first participated in the new covenant based on Jer 31:31-34. Gentiles were not named as original participants. However, additional revelation came in Acts 9-10 concerning believing Gentiles where God (through Peter and Cornelius) formally accepted believing Gentiles as co-heirs with the Jews. In other words, God used additional NT revelation to further expand the participants of the new covenant to include believing Gentiles. God did not ''replace'' the original recipients or change the original meaning of the new covenant, he simply expanded it. This expansion of meaning while keeping the original intact is called complementary hermeneutics.

===Hyper-dispensationalism and Ultra-dispensationalism===
{{main article|Hyperdispensationalism|Ultradispensationalism}}

The majority of dispensationalists are known as ''Acts 2 dispensationalists''. They believe the present church began on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 and practice water baptism. The majority also believe the New Testament epistles of Hebrews through Revelation were written directly to the present church. Likewise, most dispensationalists also believe the doctrine contained in the Four Gospels also pertains to the present church.

However, there are two minority camps within dispensationalism branded by their opponents as [[Hyperdispensationalism|hyper-dispensationalists]] and [[Ultradispensationalism|ultra-dispensationalists]]. One camp, known as the ''Mid-Acts view'', believes the church began with the Apostle Paul (in either Acts chapter 9 or others in chapter 13 and there are a very few variations) and do not practice water baptism as it is seen as only for Israel. The second camp believes that the church began with the Apostle Paul after Acts 28:28 with Paul's announcement "Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it" and see both water baptism and the Lord's Supper as only for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[Acts 28:28 ""Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it."]&lt;/ref&gt; The Acts 28 camp sees Paul's ministry from the middle of Acts to the end of the book as part of Israel's administration of the Abrahamic Covenant and not part of the present dispensation, and consequently  Paul's epistles written prior to the so-called Prison Epistles are then not directly for the church today either.

Both views believe that the Church of today is based on Paul's unique ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[Romans 11:13 "For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am '''the''' apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office."]&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is referenced in Scripture in what may be referred to as the "Pauline Distinctive"&lt;ref&gt;[Romans 16:25 "Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to '''my''' gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, '''which was kept secret since the world began'''."]&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Gospel of the Grace of God",&lt;ref&gt;[Acts 20:24 "But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, '''to testify the gospel of the grace of God'''."]&lt;/ref&gt; and marks an unmistakable shift away from the Mosaic law&lt;ref&gt;[Romans 8:3 "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."]&lt;/ref&gt; and the beginning of a completely new Church,&lt;ref&gt;[Ephesians 1: 22-23 "And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all"]&lt;/ref&gt; called the "Body of Christ"&lt;ref&gt;[Ephesians 5:30 "For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."]&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of both Jews and Gentiles "in one body."&lt;ref&gt;[Ephesians 2:16 "And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby."]&lt;/ref&gt; It is this distinction, rather than eschatology as such, that marks both camps. The Acts 2 camp says that the mystery of the church was merely first revealed through Paul rather than actually starting with Paul. The Mid-Acts and Acts 28 camps point out that Acts 2 was merely the beginning of the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy concerning the New Covenant made only with Israel. Nothing new that was not prophesied was going on there nor is there any indication of the equality found in the church which is Christ's body in which Jew and Gentile are joint-heirs. Rather the men of Israel were being addressed concerning their king, kingdom, and their restoration unto it. Both the Mid-Acts and Acts 28 camps hold that all prophecy belongs to Israel and their literal kingdom and is not for the church. The New Covenant is with Israel and not the church. Christ's shed blood is the basis for redemption for all, as well as, the New Covenant for Israel. The New Covenant is not the cause of redemption, rather the shed blood is the cause for both. Thus the Acts 2 camp is inconsistent in failing to maintain the dispensational distinction between "prophecy" and "mystery," i.e., the earthly kingdom program for Israel from the heavenly program for the church.

One notable implication of both hyper-dispensationalism and ultra-dispensationalism is the view that the doctrine contained in the four Gospels (biographies of Jesus' earthly ministry) and many of the New Testament epistles written by the Twelve Apostles was directly applicable to the Jews of Jesus' day, and which will come to fruition in the coming millennial kingdom. These books are held as proclaiming the "Gospel of the Kingdom", and as such are not directly applicable for the member of Christ's body church of today. Furthermore, the Acts 28 position holds that the pre-prison Pauline Epistles are for the Israelite Church of the Acts period with its own distinct dispensation of the Spirit, and not for the Body of Christ Church today. Meanwhile, the Mid-Acts position rather sees a transition in early Acts from the former dispensation and only one church during this period and thus all of Paul's epistles are the direct teachings to the Church as they proclaim the Gospel of the Grace of God first revealed through the apostle to the Gentiles/uncircumcision.

The prefixes "hyper" or "ultra" mean "further than", and are not meant to be derogatory terms, although some mainstream dispensationalists use them as such. These two groups are branded by the opponents as "hyper-dispensationalists" and "ultra-dispensationalists" because they tend to take dispensational concepts further than those of the Acts 2 persuasion. They themselves see this as simply being consistent with the dispensational distinction that is supposed to be maintained between Israel and the church.

== Alternatives ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Prior to dispensationalism's 19-20th century systemization, [[covenant theology]] was the prominent [[Protestant]] view regarding redemptive history and is still the view of the Reformed churches. A relatively recent view, which is seen as a third alternative, especially among some Baptists, is called [[New Covenant theology]].

The early Christian theologians saw the New Covenant in Christ as a [[Supersessionism|replacement]] for the Mosaic Covenant. Historically, statements on behalf of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] have claimed her ecclesiastical structures to be a fulfillment and replacement of Jewish ecclesiastical structures (see also [[Jerusalem in Christianity#Jerusalem as an allegory for the Church|Jerusalem as an allegory for the Church]]). As recently as 1965 Vatican Council II affirmed, "the Church is the new [[people of God]]," without intending to make "Israel according to the flesh", the Jewish people, irrelevant in terms of [[eschatology]]. Modern Catholicism affirms these spokesmen as authoritative for doctrine, alongside the New Testament. Modern Protestants hold to a range of positions, some with more emphasis on continuity ([[covenant theology]]) and others with more emphasis on discontinuity ([[dispensationalism]] and [[New Covenant Theology]]).

An '''eligible bachelor''' is a [[bachelor]] considered to be a particularly desirable potential [[husband]], usually due to [[wealth]], [[social status]] or other specific personal qualities. 
   
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[heir]] to the throne or someone close in succession is often considered to be the nation's, or the world's most eligible bachelor, due to their social status, as has happened with [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kOE08Va3p4gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22eligible+bachelor%22&amp;ots=4BGzodI1Po&amp;sig=boa0z0E0F2dGR7XH5nVn_WlsqNY#PPA23,M1]  Diana Style
 By Colin McDowell&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]].

[[Jane Austen]]'s novels are often concerned with the heroine's relationship with an eligible bachelor.  Jane Austen's ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' particularly concerns a woman's attempt to obtain a husband for her friend by embellishing the truth.  The gentleman in that case sees it as an example of the [[matchmaking|matchmaker]]'s [[creativity]] and [[Falling in love|falls in love]] with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Postmodernist Portraits|author=Wendy Steiner |date=1987|journal=Art Journal|volume=46|issue=3 |jstor=777029|pp=173–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homosexuals as ''apparent'' eligible bachelors==
During the 1950s and 1960s, [[Rock Hudson]] was hailed as an eligible bachelor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=h4hxUfPouKAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22eligible+bachelor%22+gay&amp;ots=FSTGON16m_&amp;sig=xkPtDS0sXMTpCMtUd3o-Yd9wIAg#PPR21,M1] Gay and Lesbian Professionals in the Closet&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, if a man chose to remain an eligible bachelor for long he may have been suspected of being [[homosexual]],&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Mary Nokes [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=7gPng0b8eJ4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22eligible+bachelor%22&amp;ots=DaqNYz3rQz&amp;sig=kp2CxZlJON1SF5DbNr_PzhUTMSg] hiv/aids and the older adult&lt;/ref&gt;. The term 'confirmed bachelor' has fallen from common usage, as past life patterns involving marriage, divorce and prolonged bachelorhood have been altered for men since the advent of the [[sexual revolution]].

==Sociology==
[[Robin Lakoff]] argues that the term indicates an inequality between men and women, as an  "eligible bachelor" chooses to be a bachelor, whereas an "eligible spinster" does not have a choice. Lakoff believes this use of language fosters, and grows from, [[sexual discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jsri.ro/new/?download=jsri_14_articol_09_iulia_grad.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}    Words and Women.

'''Francisco José Ayala Pereda''' (born March 12, 1934) is a [[Spain|Spanish]]-[[United States|American]] [[evolutionary biologist]] and [[philosopher]] who was a longtime faculty member at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Pinar García, Susana | title= De Dios y ciencia.

After graduating from the [[University of Salamanca]], he moved to the United States in 1961 to study for a PhD at [[Columbia University]]. There, he studied for his doctorate under [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], graduating in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Theodosius Dobzhansky: The Man and the Scientist |journal=[[Annual Review of Genetics]] | date=1976| first=Francisco | last=Ayala | pmid=797305 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.10.120176.000245 | volume=10 | pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[US citizen]] in 1971. 

He has been President and Chairman of the Board of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/science/29prof.html | title=Roving Defender of Evolution, and of Room for God  |work=New York Times | date=April 29, 2008  | accessdate =April 24, 2009 | first=Cornelia | last=Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt; At University of California, Irvine, his academic appointments included [[University Professorship (University of California)|University Professor]] and Donald Bren Professor of Biological Sciences, Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology (|School of Biological Sciences), Professor of Philosophy, (School of Humanities), and Professor of Logic and the Philosophy of Science (School of Social Sciences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/16880/ | title=Biologist Francisco J. Ayala |publisher=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] | date=February 5, 1996 | last= | accessdate =April 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2018, Dr. Ayala officially resigned from the University of California, Irvine, due to substantiated sexual harassment claims. His name was removed from the [[UCI School of Biological Sciences|School of Biological Sciences]], the Science Library, as well as various graduate fellowships, scholarship programs, and endowed chairs.&lt;ref name=newname/&gt; Details of the charges were made public online on July 20th, 2018 in an elaborate 97-page investigative report detailing the sexual harassment that occurred starting from as early as 2003 till 2018.

==Career==
He is known for his research on population and evolutionary genetics, and has been called the "[[Polymath|Renaissance Man]] of Evolutionary Biology".&lt;ref name="AAASInterview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aaas.org/programs/centers/pe/events/20060323ayala.shtml | title=A Conversation with Hana and Francisco J.

He served on the advisory board of the now defunct [[Campaign to Defend the Constitution]], an organization that has lobbied in support the [[separation of church and state]].  He has been publicly critical of U.S. restrictions on federal funding of [[embryonic stem cell]] research. He is also a critic of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]] theories, claiming that they are not only [[pseudoscience]], but also misunderstood from a [[theology|theological]] point of view. He suggests that the theory of [[evolution]] resolves [[the problem of evil]], thus being a kind of [[theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ayala|first1=F.

Can a Darwinian Be a Christian? : The Relationship between Science and Religion. Cambridge University Press: New York, xi + 242 pp. 2001, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Ayala does not say whether he remains a religious believer, not wanting to be "tagged by one side or the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dean|first1=Cornelia|title=Roving Defender of Evolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/science/29prof.html|work=New York Times|date=April 29, 2008|quote=Dr. Ayala does not say whether he remains a religious believer.  "I don't want to be tagged,” he said. "By one side  or the other.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival|Beyond Belief]] symposium on November 2006. Ayala debated [[Christian apologist]] [[William Lane Craig]] in November 2009 on the topic of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Intelligent Design Viable?

On October 18, 2011, UCI announced that Professor Ayala would be donating $10 million to the university's School of Biological Sciences. The gift was to be "$1 million a year for the next decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-uci-gift-20111018,0,2845450.story?track=rss |deadurl=yes |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Carla |last=Rivera |title=UC Irvine professor donating $10 million to school |date=October 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018162336/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-uci-gift-20111018,0,2845450.story?track=rss |archivedate=October 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, Ayala has been listed on the Advisory Council of the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |title=Advisory Council |website=ncse.com |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810112828/https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |archivedate=2013-08-10 |accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment investigation and resignation===
In June 2018, UCI announced that it had investigated and confirmed the accusations of four women who claimed that Ayala had sexually harassed them. Ayala resigned, without becoming a [[professor emeritus]], and the university removed his name from the School of Biological Sciences, Science Library, and endowed chairs that had been named after Ayala.&lt;ref name=newname&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.uci.edu/2018/06/28/uci-proposes-new-name-for-school-of-biological-sciences-science-library-after-internal-investigation-substantiates-sexual-harassment-claims-against-signature-donor/|title=UCI proposes new name for School of Biological Sciences, science library after internal investigation substantiates sexual harassment claims against signature donor|work=UCI News|date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT2018&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watanabe |first1=Teresa |title=Acclaimed UC Irvine geneticist resigns after committing sexual harassment |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-edu-uc-irvine-ayala-sexual-harassment-20180628-story.html |accessdate=29 June 2018 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The complete report of the investigation was made public (and then later removed at the request of people close to the case) on the website of the journal ''[[Science_(journal)|Science]]'', detailing multiple incidents of gender-biased and inappropiate comments and actions towards female faculty and students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/here-s-sexual-harassment-report-felled-famed-geneticist-and-his-defense|title=Here’s the sexual harassment report that felled a famed geneticist—and his defense|date=2018-07-20|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2831">'''Graded Salience Hypothesis''' is the theory regarding irony processing developed by Rachel Giora, that assumes the priority of [[Salience (language)|salient]] over less salient meaning in the process of language comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Giora Rachel. 2002. "Literal vs. figurative language: Different or equal?", ''Journal of Pragmatics'' 34: 487-506.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexical salience ==

The meaning of a word is considered salient, if it is coded in the [[mental lexicon]].&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Mimi Ziwei. 2009. “Solving the riddle of metaphor: A salience-based model for metaphorical interpretation in a discourse context”, in: New Directions in cognitive linguistics. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 107-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the degree of salience of a given word meaning cannot be viewed as a permanent, defining characteristic, but rather as a function of a number of factors, such as frequency, conventionality, familiarity, and prototypicality. The more frequent, conventional, familiar, or prototypical a given word meaning is, the greater degree of salience it holds.&lt;ref&gt;Kecskes Istvan. 2006. "On my mind: thought about salience, context and figurative language from a second language perspective": ''Second Language Research'' 22,2: 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesis ==

The graded salience hypothesis revolves around two major assumptions:
1. Salient meaning of a word is always activated and cannot be bypassed.
2. Salient meaning is always activated first, before the less salient meanings.&lt;ref name="GioraRachel_a"&gt;Giora Rachel. 1997. "Understanding figurative and literal language: The graded salience hypothesis, ''Cognitive Linguistics'' 8-3: 183-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of context ==

In the view of the graded salience hypothesis, context has a very limited role. Even though it can facilitate activation of a word meaning, it cannot inhibit the process of the more salient meaning activation.&lt;ref name="GioraRachel_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, Raymond. 1994. “Figurative Thought and Figurative Language”, in: Morton Ann Gernsbacher (ed.), Handbook of Psycholinguistics. San Diego: Academic Press, 411-442.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ionian Enlightenment'''&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, ''Flame of Miletus'', I.B. Tauris, 2012, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; was a set of advances in [[Timeline of scientific thought|scientific thought]], explanations on nature, and discovering the natural and [[Causality|rational causes]] behind [[Physical phenomena|observable phenomena]], that took place in [[archaic Greece]] beginning in the 6th century BC. This movement began on the [[Ionia]]n coast of western [[Anatolia]] by small numbers of forward-thinking Greeks (see [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]] and [[Milesian School]]) from [[poleis|cities]] such as [[Miletus]], [[Samos]], and [[Halicarnassus]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren, James.  Presocratics.  Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Daniel W. The Texts of Early Greek Philosophy. New York: Cambridge University Press,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Daniel W. Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian Tradition of Scientific Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Eric H., and Mark W. Graham. Ancient Empires: From Mesopotamia to the Rise of Islam. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Jonathan. Early Greek Philosophy. New York: Penguin, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; They saw the world as something ordered and intelligible, its history following an explicable course and its different parts arranged in a comprehensible system. Most historians agree that [[Thales]], one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], started this movement by [[prediction|predicting]] a [[solar eclipse]] that actually occurred, though some believe this feat to be false.

== Miletus ==
The Greek city of [[Miletus]] was the birthplace of Greek philosophy and Western scientific thought.  Their culture combined the best of a resurgent Greek civilization with borrowings from Egypt and the Middle East.  Internally, the politics of the Milesians were of faction, strife, and bloody revolution; externally, they were neighbored by two powerful empires in the Lydians and Persians.  Despite these unfavorable circumstances, the Milesians were commercially indefatigable.  With its three harbors and progeny of daughter colonies, Miletus was the “Jewel of Ionia.”  They traded not only with the Eastern empires, but also with Egypt; they sent out numerous colonies to settle in Thrace and along the coast of the Black Sea; and they had connections with Sybaris in southern Italy.  Miletus bred [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]; the first three philosophers.   Miletus was an essential location for this intellectual revolution to flourish because that they had connections with the great civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia which in turn allowed for a vast array of exchange of goods and ideas from across the Mediterranean and three continents.

== Rise of philosophy ==

Up until this point in time (6th century BC) the [[Greeks]], and many empires before them, explained the events of the world as products of supernatural actions of divine agents.  This can be seen in the writings of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], two famous Greek poets.   With the introduction of rational and natural thought the Milesian [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratic philosophers]], as they were termed, attempted to produce an improved and rationalized theology in place of the anthropomorphic divinities of the Olympian pantheon.  But their theology had little to do with religion, and they removed most of the traditional functions from the gods, such as thunder was no longer the growling of a minatory [[Zeus]] or that [[Poseidon]] created storms.  This new [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratic]] approach gave no direct credence to traditional lore and furthermore these philosophers simply ignored the kinds of explanations that were imbedded in myths and advanced their own accounts on the basis, not of tradition, but of reasons.  Their approach refused to allow any supernatural actions to govern natural processes.  This rejection of the supernatural did not make the philosophers atheists, rather it made them subordinate divine action to natural law which was known as Physis.   These first philosophers offered reasons for their opinions and gave arguments for their views.  For the most part, they were concerned not to advance opinions, but to advance reasoned opinions.

== Milesian School ==
{{main article|Milesian School}}
This school of thought is made up of the philosophies of three Presocratic philosophers: Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes.  These philosophers all hailed from the Greek city state of Miletus and are known as the first philosophers.  Their philosophy is what started the Ionian Intellectual Revolution.

=== Thales (c. 625 BCE – 545 BCE) ===

According to [[Aristotle]], Thales of Miletus was the “Founder of Natural Philosophy.”   Even though he is recognized as the founder of philosophy much of what we know about him and his philosophy is up to debate because he left no writings for which early students of philosophy could rely on.  Known as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages]], which was an exclusive club of poets and statesmen, he was the only one who could claim to be a philosopher and scientist.  Thales is credited with being a political adviser, philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and engineer.  Throughout his life he is alleged to have traveled and studied throughout the [[Mediterranean]] in places such as Egypt, Phoenicia, and Babylon which all influenced his philosophy and theories.   Thales allegedly founded [[geometry]], although he may have been taught this in Egypt, and also studied the stars.   Thales tried to search for the arkhe, which can be translated to searching for the source for all things.  He believed the source for all things (arkhe) was water.  This is based on the notion that somehow all things, and more importantly all living things, originate in water and therefore water is the basic starting-point of everything.   The apparent stability of the Earth became one phenomenon for which any self-respecting natural philosopher had to have an explanation, for Thales he believed the Earth rested upon water. 
  
=== Anaximander (c. 610 BCE – 540 BCE) ===

Anaximander was a pupil of Thales.  Many historians start the beginning of Greek Philosophy and therefore the Ionian Intellectual Revolution with Anaximander since Thales did not leave any written records.  Therefore, there is not any reliable information on Thales and the various elements of his thought and practice.   Anaximander is responsible for the oldest surviving fragment of Greek philosophical writing.  He, as with Thales, offered his own insight into what he believed the arkhe to be which for him was termed “the boundless” (apeiron).  This boundless he describes as a principle that is neither water nor any of the other so called elements, but instead some different limitless nature.  His principle of “boundless” meant that if mass is anywhere, it is everywhere; at the same time, if empty space is limitless, body too must be limitless.  He never explicitly states what this boundless principle is made up of and therefore creates an inevitable question for ancient and modern scholars.   Anaximander also theorized about astronomical phenomena such as the distances of the sun, moon, and stars and about the origin and development of living things in the world.   He was the first to try and draw the inhabited world on a tablet, and with the help of a traveler from Miletus this tablet was made more accurate.   Throughout his life he provides explanations for the existence of the sea, wind, storms, thunder, lightning, and deals a lot with biology.

=== Anaximenes (c. 585 BCE – 528 BCE) ===

Anaximenes was a pupil of Anaximander.  Of the three philosophers of the Milesian school, Anaximenes is often thought of as the least important simply because he took Anaximander’s grand vision of cosmology and identified a mechanism by which it might operate.   As with those before him, Anaximenes’ arkhe was air (aer).  His major philosophical advancement was to posit a clear and definite mechanism by which this aer is transformed into the various more familiar components of the world, thereby tying the world and the arkhe together.   Anaximenes theory of change reported that air is the source of everything; there is a set of elements or basic stuffs: (i) fire, (ii) air, (iii) wind, (iv) cloud, (v) water, (vi) earth, (vii) stones, which are ordered by their relative density; and the condensation process is analogous to the action of felting.   Anaximenes is usually viewed as the inventor of Material Monism, the theory by which there is only one substance (in this case air) of which all other stuffs are mere modifications or states.
 
== Possible influences ==

Historians tend to debate on whether the early Greek philosophers were influenced by other ancient empires during the 6th century BC or were the first to think about theory and other sciences such as astrology.  Below are some of the possible influencers of the Ionian Intellectual Revolution:

=== Babylon ===

Babylonians were known for their vast knowledge of the skies.  Temple Priests kept detailed observations of the skies in order to report and anticipate ominous phenomena.  Records of eclipses have been found from around 747 BC.  The Babylonians also developed a complex system of mathematics based on the number sixty, which they used to track the motions of the sun and moon.  Babylonian archives contained vast stores of mathematical and astronomical data on cuneiform tablets.   The eclipse that Thales predicted, which began this movement, may have been done off the basis of Babylonian tablets.

=== Egypt ===

Egyptians were known for their vast knowledge of arithmetic.  It is possible that Thales brought back a knowledge of “geometry” from Egypt.  The roots of the Greek word mean “earth-measurement”, indicating that kind of science he would have encountered there: practical surveying.   Egyptians used scribes who had a knowledge of basic arithmetic on which to base practical questions of ordering supplies and the like.  They used a simple but highly practical year of 365 days and made simple astronomical observations.

'''James Martineau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|t|ən|ˌ|oʊ}}; 21 April 1805 – 11 January 1900)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3242352|title=Obituary - Dr. James Martineau, London - January 12, 1900|work=The West Australian |date=15 January 1900 |page =5|accessdate=15 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[Christian philosophy|religious philosopher]] influential in the [[history of Unitarianism]].

For 45 years he was Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy in [[Manchester New College]], the principal [[seminary|training college]] for [[British Unitarianism]].

Many portraits of Martineau, including one painted by [[George Frederick Watts]], are held at London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]. In 2014, the gallery  revealed that its patron, [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], was related to Martineau. The Duchess' great-great-grandfather, [[Lupton family|Francis Martineau Lupton]], was Dr James Martineau's grandnephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Furness|first=Hannah|title=Duchess of Cambridge visits National Portrait Gallery - home of little known Middleton family paintings|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/10631996/Duchess-of-Cambridge-visits-National-Portrait-Gallery-home-of-little-known-Middleton-family-paintings.html|work=UK  Daily Telegraph  - page 3|publisher=UK Daily Telegraph  - February  11th,  2014|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallery, London|first=National Portrait|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw04254/James-Martineau|title=George Frederick Watts,- Portrait  of James Martineau, 1873|publisher=NPG,  London, 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gallery also holds written correspondence between  Martineau and [[Poet Laureate]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] - who records that he "regarded Martineau as the master mind of all the remarkable company with whom he engaged". [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said of Martineau; "he is beyond question the greatest of living thinkers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=A.W.|url=http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/702683591|title=James Martineau - A biography and Study|publisher=Little, Brown and Co, Boston, Mass|year=1901|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his children was the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] watercolourist [[Edith Martineau]].

==Early life==
The seventh of eight children, James Martineau was born in [[Norwich]], England, where his father Thomas (1764–1826) was a cloth manufacturer and merchant. His mother, Elizabeth Rankin, was the eldest daughter of a sugar refiner and grocer. The [[Martineau family]] were descended from Gaston Martineau, a [[Huguenot]] surgeon and refugee, who married Marie Pierre in 1693, and settled in Norwich. His son and grandson — respectively the great-grandfather and grandfather of James Martineau — were surgeons in the same city. Many of the family were active in [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] causes, so much so that a room in [[Essex Hall]], the headquarters of [[British Unitarianism]], was eventually named after them. Branches of the Martineau family in Norwich, Birmingham and London were socially and politically prominent Unitarians; other elite Unitarian families in Birmingham were the Kenricks, Nettlefolds and the Chamberlains, with much intermarriage between these families taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tree|first=Chamberlain Family|url=http://www.greywall.demon.co.uk/genealogy/WynnHall/chamberlain.html|title=Chamberlain Family|publisher=Graham Wall  copyright 2001|accessdate=20 Jan 2014|quote=Note connection of Martineau, Kenrick, Nettleford and Chamberlain families (1862-1945)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruston|first=Alan|title=Joseph Chamberlain|publisher=UUHHS. c2011|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc=chpt. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essex Hall held a statue of Martineau.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc=chpt. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His niece, [[Frances Lupton]], who  was close to his sister [[Harriet Martineau|Harriet]], had worked to open up [[Female education#Modern period|educational opportunities for women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edited by Elisabeth Sanders Arbuckle|first1=Harriet Martineau|title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgwood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154|publisher=Stanford University Press | page= 150 |date= 1 January 1983|accessdate=15 May 2015|quote=(May 1857) My (H.

James was educated at [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich Grammar School]] where he was a school-fellow with [[George Borrow]] under [[Edward Valpy]], as good a scholar as his better-known brother [[Richard Valpy|Richard]], but proved too sensitive for school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Souvenir of the George Borrow Celebration|first=James|last=Hooper|page=14|year=1913|publisher=Jarrold &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to [[Bristol]] to the private academy of Dr. [[Lant Carpenter]], under whom he studied for two years. On leaving he was apprenticed to a [[civil engineer]] at [[Derby, England|Derby]], where he acquired "a store of exclusively scientific conceptions," but also began to look to religion for mental stimulation.

Martineau's [[religious conversion|conversion]] followed, and in 1822 he entered the [[dissenting academy]] [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester College]], then at [[York]] - his uncle [[Peter Finch Martineau]] was one of its Vice-Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=February 2018|title=Peter Finch Martineau and his Son|url=|journal=The Martineau Society Newsletter|volume=41|pages=10–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he "woke up to the interest of moral and metaphysical speculations." Of his teachers, one, the Rev. [[Charles Wellbeloved]], was, Martineau said, "a master of the true [[Nathaniel Lardner|Lardner]] type, candid and catholic, simple and thorough, humanly fond indeed of the counsels of peace, but piously serving every bidding of sacred truth." The other, the Rev. [[John Kenrick (historian)|John Kenrick]], he described as a man so learned as to be placed by [[Dean Stanley]] "in the same line with [[Edward Valentine Blomfield|Blomfield]] and [[Connop Thirlwall|Thirlwall]]," and as "so far above the level of either vanity or dogmatism, that cynicism itself could not think of them in his presence." On leaving the college in 1827 Martineau returned to [[Bristol]] to teach in the school of Lant Carpenter; but in the following year he was ordained for a &lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc=chpt. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian church in [[Dublin]], whose senior minister was a relative of his.
[[File:JamesMartineauYoung.jpg|thumb|right|upright|James Martineau at a younger age.]]
Martineau's ministerial career was suddenly cut short in 1832 by difficulties growing out of the "[[regium donum]]", which had on the death of the senior minister fallen to him. He conceived it as "a religious monopoly" to which "the nation at large contributes," while "Presbyterians alone receive," and which placed him in "a relation to the state" so "seriously objectionable" as to be "impossible to hold." The invidious distinction it drew between [[Presbyterian]]s on the one hand, and Catholics, members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), other [[nonconformists]], unbelievers, and Jews on the other, who were compelled to support a ministry they conscientiously disapproved, offended his conscience. His conscience did, however, allow  him to attend both the [[Coronation of Queen Victoria]] in 1837 and the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|her Golden Jubilee]] half a century later. A year prior to the coronation, at [[St James's Palace]], Martineau had "[[Kissing hands|kissed the hand]]" of the queen at the [[Deputation]] of British Presbyterians ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=J. Estlin|title=James Martineau, theologian and teacher; A study of his life in thought|publisher=Philip Green, Essex Steet, London, 1905, Chapter VII,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work and writings==
From Dublin, he was called to [[Liverpool]]. He lodged in a house owned by [[Joseph Williamson (philanthropist)|Joseph Williamson]]. It was during his 25 years in Liverpool that he published his first work, ''Rationale of Religious Enquiry'', which caught the attention of many religious and philosophical figures.

In 1840 Martineau was appointed Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy in [[Manchester New College]], the seminary in which he had been educated, and which had now moved from York back to [[Manchester]]. This position, and the  principalship (1869-1885), he held for 45 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University of Oxford|first1=Harris Manchester College -|title=Archives and History - Harris Manchester College, University of Oxford|url=http://www.hmc.ox.ac.uk/pages/default.asp?id=20&amp;sID=135&amp;cP=201|website=hmc.ox.ac.uk|publisher=Harris Manchester College Pty Ltd|accessdate=22 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018063606/http://www.hmc.ox.ac.uk/pages/default.asp?id=20&amp;sID=135&amp;cP=201|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 the college moved to London, and four years later he followed it there. In 1858 he combined this work with preaching at the pulpit of [[Little Portland Street Chapel]] in London, which for the first two years he shared with [[John James Tayler]] (who was also his colleague in the college), and then for twelve years as its only minister.

In 1866, the [[Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] at [[University College, London]], fell vacant when the liberal nonconformist [[John Hoppus|Dr John Hoppus]] retired. Martineau became a candidate, and despite strong support from some quarters, potent opposition was organised by the anti-clerical [[George Grote]], whose refusal to endorse Martineau resulted in the appointment of [[George Croom Robertson]], then an untried man. Martineau, however, sidestepped Grote's opposition, much as Hoppus had learnt to do during his Professorship, and developed a cordial friendship with Robertson.

Martineau was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1872.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded LL.D. of Harvard in 1872, S.T.D. of [[university of Leiden|Leiden]] in 1874, D.D. of [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] in 1884, D.C.L. of [[university of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1888 and D. Litt. of [[university of Dublin|Dublin]] in 1891.

==Life and thought==
Martineau described some of the changes he underwent; how he had "carried into logical and ethical problems the maxims and postulates of physical knowledge," and had moved within narrow lines "interpreting human phenomena by the analogy of external nature"; and how in a period of "second education" at [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin, with [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]], he experienced "a new intellectual birth". It made him, however, no more of a [[theist]] than he had been before, and he developed [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] views, which became a significant current within Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany K. Wayne, ''Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism'' (2006), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
[[File:James Martineau by Elliott &amp; Fry, c1860s-crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|James Martineau by [[Elliott &amp; Fry]], circa 1860s]]
Martineau was in his early life a preacher. Although he did not believe in the Incarnation, he held deity to be manifest in humanity; man underwent an [[apotheosis]], and all life was touched with the dignity and the grace which it owed to its source. His preaching led to works that built up his reputation:''Endeavours after the Christian Life'', 1st series, 1843; 2nd series, 1847; ''Hours of Thought'', 1st series, 1876; 2nd series, 1879; the various hymn-books he issued at Dublin in 1831, at Liverpool in 1840, in London in 1873; and the ''Home Prayers'' in 1891.

In 1839 Martineau came to the defence of Unitarian doctrine, under attack by Liverpool clergymen including [[Fielding Ould]] and [[Hugh Boyd M‘Neile]]. In the controversy, Martineau published five discourses, in which he discussed "the Bible as the great autobiography of human nature from its infancy to its perfection," "the Deity of Christ," "Vicarious Redemption," "Evil," and "Christianity without Priest and without Ritual."

In Martineau's earliest book, ''The Rationale of Religious Enquiry'', published in 1836, he placed the authority of reason above that of Scripture; and he assessed the New Testament as "uninspired, but truthful; sincere, able, vigorous, but fallible."&lt;ref&gt;James Martineau, ''The Rationale of Religious Enquiry'' (London, 1836), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The book marked him down, among older British Unitarians, as a dangerous radical, and his ideas were the catalyst for a pamphlet war in America between [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] (who favored Martineau's questioning of the historical accuracy of scripture) and the more conservative [[Andrews Norton]]. Despite his belief that the Bible was fallible, Martineau continued to hold the view that "in no intelligible sense can any one who denies the supernatural origin of the religion of Christ be termed a Christian," which term, he explained, was used not as "a name of praise," but simply as " a designation of belief."&lt;ref&gt;James Martineau, ''The Rationale of Religious Enquiry'' (London, 1836), "Preface to the Second Edition", p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; He censured the German rationalists "for having preferred, by convulsive efforts of interpretation, to compress the memoirs of Christ and His apostles into the dimensions of ordinary life, rather than admit the operation of miracle on the one hand, or proclaim their abandonment of Christianity on the other."{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Transcendentalism===
[[File:James Martineau by George Frederic Watts.jpg|right|thumb|200px|James Martineau -   Replica  (National Portrait Galley) by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1873]]
Martineau came to know German philosophy and criticism, especially the criticism of [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]] and the [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] school, which affected his construction of Christian history. French influences were [[Ernest Renan]] and the Strassburg theologians. The rise of evolution compelled him to reformulate his theism. He addressed the public, as editor and  contributor, in the ''[[Monthly Repository]]'', the ''[[Christian Reformer]]'', the ''[[Prospective Review]]'', the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' and the ''[[National Review]]''. Later he was a frequent contributor to the literary monthlies. More systematic expositions came in ''Types of Ethical Theory'' and ''The Study of Religion'', and, partly, in ''The Seat of Authority in Religion'' (1885, 1888 and 1890). What did Jesus signify? This was the problem which Martineau attempted to deal with in ''The Seat of Authority in Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Martineau, James. [https://archive.org/details/a592331600martuoft ''The Seat of Authority in Religion'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memorial to James Martineau (1805 - 1900) - geograph.org.uk - 114114.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Memorial to Martineau, near [[Aviemore]], Scotland]]

Martineau's theory of religious society, or church, was that of an idealist. He propounded a scheme, which was not taken up, that would have removed the church from the hands of a clerical order, and allowed the coordination of sects or churches under the state. Eclectic by nature, he gathered ideas from any source that appealed. [[Stopford Brooke (chaplain)|Stopford Brooke]] once asked [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley|A. P. Stanley]], [[Dean of Westminster]], "if the Church of England would broaden sufficiently to allow James Martineau to be made [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waller|first=Ralph|work=Oxford Dictionary of  National Biography|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18229|title=(Entry) - James Martineau|publisher=Oxford University Pty. Ltd.  2004|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had opposed the removal (1889) of Manchester New College to Oxford, Martineau took part in the opening of the new buildings, conducting the communion service (19 October 1893) in the chapel of what is today [[Harris Manchester College]], University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= A.G. |title=Entry - James Martineau|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/olddnb.jsp?articleid=18229|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press - (Date of original publication - 1901)|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide circle of friends mourned his death on 11 January 1900 — [[Oscar Wilde]] references him in his prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|title=The Prose of Oscar Wilde|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibNYKfOxB-AC&amp;pg=PA494|origyear=1st. pub.

'''''Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don't Know About Them)''''' is a book by [[Bart D. Ehrman]], a [[New Testament]] scholar at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  This work includes a narrative of Ehrman's own progression in Biblical studies and beliefs, an overview of the issues raised by scholarly analysis of the Bible, details of a selection of findings from such analysis, and an exhortation regarding the importance of coming to understand the Bible more fully.

Regarding the importance of Biblical study, Ehrman says in the preface, "This kind of information is relevant not only to scholars like me, who devote their lives to serious research, but also to everyone who is interested in the Bible -- whether they personally consider themselves believers or not. In my opinion this really matters. Whether you are a believer -- fundamentalist, evangelical, moderate, liberal -- or a nonbeliever, the Bible is the most significant book in the history of our civilization. Coming to understand what it actually is, and is not, is one of the most important intellectual endeavors that anyone in our society can embark upon."

One particular statement from early on appears to summarize the development of the subject matter that Ehrman attempts to cover in this volume: "Scholars of the Bible have made significant progress in understanding the Bible over the past two hundred years, building on archaeological discoveries, advances in our knowledge of the ancient Hebrew and Greek languages in which the book of Scripture were originally written, and deep and penetrating historical, literary, and textual analyses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ehrman | first = Bart | authorlink = Bart D.

==Reception==
{{Undue-section|date=January 2015}}
''Jesus, Interrupted'' became a [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] best-seller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/books/review/InsideList-t.html | title=Inside The List: Honest To Jesus |publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 19, 2009 | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler | accessdate = 2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining Ehrman's previous popular work of textual criticism ''[[Misquoting Jesus]]''. Critics applauded Ehrman's writing ability.&lt;ref&gt;John Blake "...even many of Ehrman's critics say he has a knack for making arcane New Testament scholarship accessible to the public."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishop William H. Willimon in ibid commented "He has a gift for clear thinking and an ability to present some complicated things in simple, direct ways." Rev. Guy Williams noted that "His take on the scriptures is a gift to the church because of his ability to articulate questions and challenges. It gives us an opportunity to wrestle with the [Bible's] claims and questions."{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/05/15/bible.critic/ | title=Former fundamentalist 'debunks' Bible |publisher=[[CNN]] | date=May 15, 2009 | first=John | last=Blake | accessdate = 2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael J. Kruger]], Associate Professor of New Testament at [[Reformed Theological Seminary]] called it "a book full of ironies" and "intellectual schizophrenia," stating that "it purports to be about unbiased history but rarely presents an opposing viewpoint; ironic that it claims to follow the scholarly consensus but breaks from it so often; ironic that it insists on the historical-critical method but then reads the gospels with a modernist, overly-literal hermeneutic; ironic that it claims no one view of early Christianity could be 'right' (Walter Bauer) but then proceeds to tell us which view of early Christianity is 'right;'"&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Kruger, "A Review of Jesus, Interrupted", ''[[Westminster Theological Journal]]'' 71, no.2, Fall 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism raised, which was also raised over ''Misquoting Jesus'', is that Ehrman implies that the information being presented is new, or groundbreaking. Bishop [[William H. Willimon]] says, "He keeps presenting this stuff as if this is wonderful new knowledge that has been kept from you backward lay people and this is the stuff your preachers don't have the guts to tell, and I have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/05/15/bible.critic/ | title=Former fundamentalist 'debunks' Bible |publisher=[[CNN]] | date=May 15, 2009 | first=John | last=Blake | accessdate = 2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich Barlow, of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', writes that "he repeatedly stresses that historical-critical study need not kill faith. And, honest scholar that he is, he admits that some of his contentions can be challenged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2009/05/06/turning_a_critical_eye_to_the_bible/ | title=Book review: Turning a critical eye to the Bible |publisher=[[Boston Globe]] | date=May 6, 2009 | first= Rich| last= Barlow| accessdate = 2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. James F. McGrath of [[Patheos]] called the book "a readable overview presenting information about the Bible and early Christianity that ought by now to be common knowledge. The reason it is not probably is due largely to the belief that such critical study of the Bible is antithetical to the Christian faith, and that the appropriate Christian stance is to affirm the Bible’s inerrancy rather than allow one’s view of the Bible and other matters to be shaped by the Bible’s actual contents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exploringourmatrix.blogspot.com/2009/03/review-of-bart-ehrman-jesus-interrupted.html | title=A review of ''Jesus, Interrupted'' |publisher=[[Patheos]] | date=March 20, 2009 | first=James | last=McGrath | accessdate = February 24, 2017}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Matthew Rispoli''' (17 August 1582 – 6 April 1639) was a major Maltese philosopher of great erudition. He was held in high esteem by the Grand Masters of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] Order, the Bishops of Malta, the [[Viceroys of Sicily]], cardinals, bishops, inquisitors, and the common people. Perhaps the most eminent Maltese philosopher of the [[Middle Ages]], the various extant writings of his are witness to his philosophical aptitude and dexterity as to his high calibre as a philosopher. These qualities were highly appreciated during his lifetime, in Malta as in France and Italy. He lived a busy life, both as an intellectual and as an administrator. He was professor of philosopher at various institutions of high education, an able preacher, and an official at various posts within the [[Dominican Order]], of which his was a member. He was an avid aficionado of music, and was talented with playing musical instruments. Though the fame of holiness accompanied him in his life, this did not deter the [[Inquisition]] from suspecting him of heresy, and keeping him in its dungeons for fourteen months. When he died, he was given an almost state funeral.

==Life==

===Birth and education===
Rispoli was born in [[Senglea]], [[Malta]], on 17 August 1582, to John Vincent and Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;''Senglea Parish Baptismal Records'', Vol. I, f. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He was christened John Mary. His father was a pilot on one of the galleys of the [[Knights Hospitaller]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomeo Dal Pozzo, ''Historia della S. Religione Militare di S. Giovanni, detta di Malta'', 1764, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the family enjoyed a decent financial income. In fact, Rispoli was given a good education from an early age.

===A Dominican friar===
At sixteen years of age, in 1598, Rispoli joined the [[Dominican Order]] at the Annunciation Priory of [[Vittoriosa]]. He was formally admitted a year later, and given the name John Matthew as a sign of his new religious status.&lt;ref name="Fasdni_704"&gt;{{harvp|Fsadni|1993|p=704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he was sent to [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], to begin and complete his institutional education at the Dominican ''[[Studium Generale]]'' there in philosophy and theology.

===At Paris===
Rispoli's initial studies ended seven years later, in 1606. Though he returned to Malta to commence his academic and pastoral work, he came under the eye of [[Alof de Wignacourt]], Grand Master to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], who conceded him protection. Most probably, this was due to Rispoli's intellectual capabilities as much as the high esteem in which the Grand Master held his father, whom, as recompense for his thirty-seven years in the service of the Knights Hospitaller, had been elected Donat and Brother in the Order.&lt;ref name="Fasdni_704"/&gt; Whatever the case, the Grand Master personally recommended Rispoli to King [[Henry IV of France]] in order to ensue his theological studies at the [[University of Sorbonne]], in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Azzopardo, ''Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta'', Archive of the Dominicans, Rabat, Malta, ff. 190v-193, n. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Rispoli left almost immediately for France. This gave the twenty-four-year-old Rispoli an opportunity to upgrade his studies at one of the then most illustrious centres of learning in the world, and show his true colours. In fact, as it happened, this opening gave him great prestige throughout his whole life.

Rispoli remained in Paris for the next six years. Throughout his stay there he was known as ''le Jacobin Maltois'', the Maltese Dominican (since in France the Dominicans were known as ''Jacobins'' because their first convent in Paris was built near the church of ''Saint Jacques''). His outstanding intelligence and erudition can be gauged from the fact that, just over two years into his studies at the Sorbonne, in 1609, the twenty-seven-year-old Rispoli was earmarked to be appointed professor to the seat theology teaching on [[Peter Lombard|Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]] ''.&lt;ref&gt;''Registrum Magister Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum Augustini Galamini'', Archivium Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, f. 53, cited by {{harvp|Callus|1929|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the professorship was eventually awarded to one of the two French candidates who were presented together with Rispoli, this being solely due to their nationality, since Rispoli was clearly ''tanto dotto e più di quelli due'' (by far much brighter than the other two).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Callus|1929|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the limelight===
Despite this setback which could have changed his life forever, during that same year (1609) Rispoli published a book which impressed his peers and contemporaries. It was entitled ''Status Controversiæ Prædefinitionum et Prædeterminationum cum Libero Arbitrio'' (''The State of the Question dealing with the Predefinition and the Predestination of Free Will''). Basically, Rispoli concludes that divine grace fully respects human freedom, and does not tarnish it in any way. This conclusion clearly sides with the position of the Dominican [[Domingo Bañez]] against the Jesuit [[Luis de Molina|Luis Molina]] in the famous and very often acrimonious controversy on the intervention of divine grace in relation to free will. The work surely did not go unnoticed for, some two years later, in 1611, it threw him in the limelight. It so happened that, in 1611, the [[General Chapter]] of the [[Dominican Order]], gathering some 450 Dominicans from across the world, met at Paris. As was the custom, four of the best scholars were chosen to carry out a public [[disputation]], and Rispoli was the first to be given this great honour.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre de l'Etoile, ''Journal du regne de Henri IV'', La Haye, 1741, Vol. IV, p. 216, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one contemporary, Rispoli's disputation, held on May 15, 1611, was attended by the whole academic world of Paris, the Apostolic Nuntio to the King of France ([[Roberto Ubaldini]]), the bishops of [[Montpellier]] and [[Orléans]] together with a great number of ecclesiastics, and of course the Capitular friars, including the Master of the Dominican Order.&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire de Louis XIII, Roy de France et de Navarre'', Paris, 1616, pp. 100–103, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=10}} (following Antonin Mortier, ''Histoire des Maitres Généraux de l'Ordre des Fréres Précheurs'', Paris, 1913, Vol. VI, p. 160).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rispoli's performance that day left a deep an impression upon his illustrious audience. Eyewitnesses attested that his words were ''docte et gloriose'' (brilliant and persuasive),&lt;ref&gt;''Acta Capituli Generalis'', ed. by Benedictus Maria Reichert, Vol. VI, Rome, 1902, p. 160, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they were received ''cum laude'' (with great praise).&lt;ref&gt;''Regestra Magistri Ordinis Galamini 1608–12'', Archivium Generalis Ordinis Prædicatorum, Vol. IV, 51, f. 43, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact was so great that the Apostolic Nuntio there and then requested of the Master of the Order that he grants Rispoli the coveted title of Master of Sacred Theology.&lt;ref&gt;Azzopardo, ''Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta'', f. 191, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was only twenty-nine years old.

===Academic posts===
Such a success catapulted Rispoli to the highest ranks of learned Dominicans. Only a few months after his Paris disputation, in 1612, to show his delight in championing such a first rate scholar, and in respect towards his family, for all its worth [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Alof de Wignacourt]] appointed him his personal theologian and consultor, and made him a familiar of the Order of [[Knights Hospitaller]].&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Malta, Archives of the Order of St. John, 458, ''Familiaritas pro Ven. Fr. Jo. Mattheo Rispolo'', ff. 292v-293, cited in {{harvp|Fsadni|1993|p=705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon terminating his studies in Paris in 1612, Rispoli was also on great demand at the many [[Studia Generali]] of the [[Dominican Order]]. That same year, the General Chapter of Paris appointed him Regent of Studies at the newly established [[Studium Generale]] of [[Messina]],&lt;ref&gt;''Acta Capituli Generalis'', ed. by Benedictus Maria Reichert, Vol. VI, Rome, 1902, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Regestra Magistri Ordinis Galamini 1608–12'', Archivium Generalis Ordinis Prædicatorum, Vol. IV, f. 121, both cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sicily]]. Then, in 1613, not having yet completed his one-year assignment at Messina, the Provincial Chapter of [[Sicily]], celebrated at [[Palermo]], appointed him Regent at the [[Studium Generale]] of [[Palermo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Regestra Magistri Ordinis Sicci 1612–14'', Archivium Generalis Ordinis Prædicatorum, Vol. IV, 58, ff. 12v and 25v, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed at the Sicilian capital city up till 1617.

===Accused of heresy===
In the meantime, in 1615 and 1616, Rispoli went through a hell of an experience. During his Regency at [[Palermo]], he was accused before the Sicilian [[Inquisition]] of teaching heretical doctrines. The precise imputations against Rispoli are not known. It appears that the records of the Inquisition at [[Palermo]] have not survived the ravishes of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Callus|1929|pp=16f}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems that Rispoli's accusers were numerous and powerful, and that the accusations were quite serious.&lt;ref name="Azzopardo_191"&gt;Azzopardo, ''Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta'', f. 191, cited by {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Expenses for a defence lawyer were shared between Rispoli's religious communities at [[Palermo]] and at [[Vittoriosa]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominican Archive at Vittoriosa, Malta, ''Quietanze 1605 et. seq.'', August 1616, cited by {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most heart-rending upshot of the incident was that, between May 1615 and July 1616, pending the charges, Rispoli was incarcerated at one of the [[Inquisition]]'s dungeons for fourteen months.&lt;ref name="Azzopardo_191"/&gt; Eventually, his accusations were proved to be unfounded. He was thus declared not guilty, released, and, on July 15, 1616, reinstated to his former offices.&lt;ref&gt;Archivium Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 60, f. 107, extracted by Stephen Forte, notes relevant to ''Johannes Mattheus Rispoli'', Archive of the Maltese Dominican Province, Rabat, Malta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Azzopardo_191"/&gt;

===Reinstated===
Having overcome this harrowing ordeal, Rispoli continued to hold the Regency at the [[Studium Generale]] of [[Palermo]] for another year. In 1617, after an absence of eighteen years, he was back to [[Malta]] as superior (of Vicar-General) of the Maltese Dominicans, and as official Visitor for the three Dominican Priories in [[Malta]] on behalf of the Sicilian Prior Provincial.&lt;ref&gt;Notarial Archive, Valletta, Malta, Deeds of Notary A. Albano, R12/22, f. 293 (June 3, 1617), f. 455 (May 22, 1618), f. 711 (September 28, 1619) and f. 833 (April 26, 1620), cited in {{harvp|Fsadni|1993|p=705}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Malta, for one academic year (1617–18) Rispoli lectured at the ''Studium'' of the Portus Salutis Priory at [[Valletta]], and, during the following academic year (1618–19), at the Dominican ''Studium'' of the Annunciation Priory at [[Vittoriosa]]. Here, at [[Vittoriosa]], he was also chosen at Master of Studies,&lt;ref&gt;Notarial Archive, Valletta, Malta, Deeds of Notary S. Ciantar, R184/18, f. 802 (November 12, 1618) and f. 806 (November 20, 1618), cited in {{harvp|Fsadni|1993|p=706}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and elected Prior,&lt;ref&gt;Notarial Archive, Valletta, Malta, Deeds of Notary S. Ciantar, R184/18, f. 636v (September 5, 1618) and R184/19, f. 403v (July 6, 1620), cited in {{harvp|Fsadni|1993|p=706}}.&lt;/ref&gt; offices he held up till 1623.&lt;ref&gt;Archive of the Dominicans at [[Vittoriosa]], ''Libri di Quietanze'' for 1622 and 1623, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Alof de Wignacourt]] attests to Rispoli's excellent conduct at the time. Already in 1617, when Rispoli returned to Malta, he immediately appointed him as his personal theologian and consultor.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Abela, ''Descrittione di Malta'', Malta, 1647, p. 518, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, two years later, he sent various letters to the Master of the Dominican Order and to the Prior Provincial of Sicily most probably to scotch current rumours about some alleged shortcomings on the part of Rispoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fsadni|1993|loc=p. 706, note 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Master referred to Rispoli's work and personal demeanour in glowing terms, praising his erudition and exemplary life, his prudence and charity shown in his administrative role, his good sense in the works and benefices with which he endowed the priory, and his high standards of strict observance within his religious community.&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Malta, Archives of the Order of St. John, 1398, letters dated April 9 and October 2, 1619&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Malta, Archives of the Order of St. John, 1399, letter dated November 30, 1620&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Malta, Archives of the Order of St. John, 1400, letter dated April 19, 1621.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at [[Vittoriosa]] during the years 1618–20, Rispoli was also appointed Moderator and Consultor to the [[Inquisition]] in [[Malta]]. How ironical for a man who, barely two years before, has been held captive for more than a year at the dungeons of the Sicilian Inquisition!

===High activity===
The latter years of Rispoli's life were rather hectic. He frequently had to travel by sea and land between and over Italy, France, Sicily and Malta, occupying a series of temporary abodes.

Rispoli left Malta for Italy in 1623 to take up the office of Regent of Studies at the College of [[San Sisto Vecchio]] in Rome, Italy. He stayed here for two years, until 1626.&lt;ref&gt;Archivium Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 63, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, precisely in 1624, he was appointed by the Master of the Order, Seraphim Secchi, as Censor for a particular case dealing with a book, entitled ''Vox Turturis'' (''A Dove's Voice''), by the Dominican [[Dominic Gravina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Callus|1929|pp=19f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1626, Rispoli was back to Malta for a few months once more as Vicar-General of the Maltese Dominicans, and as official Visitor for the three Dominican Priories in [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;Azzopardo, ''Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta'', f. 191v, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November of this year he was back in Rome, probably as Socius (or Assistant) to the Master of the Order.&lt;ref&gt;''Registrum Magister Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum Serafinus Secchi'', Archivium Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 63, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=20}} (following Matteo Coniglioni).&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1626 the Archbishop of [[Osimo]], Italy, Augustine Galamini (who, one might recall, had presided as Master of the Dominican Order over Rispoli's disputation at Paris in May 1611; he had been created Cardinal in August 1611, and Archbishop of [[Osimo]] in April 1920), requested that Rispoli serves as his Vicar-General. This appointment probably lasted until 1629.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Abela, ''Descrittione di Malta'', Malta, 1647, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Zammit, ''Elogia Illustrium Virorum Melitensium'', n. 102, p. 293, cited and commented in {{harvp|Callus|1929|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, it appears that Rispoli was not residing continually at [[Osimo]]. In 1628 he attended the [[General Chapter]] of the [[Dominican Order]] at [[Toulouse]], France, as Definitor.&lt;ref&gt;''Acta Capituli Generalis'', ed. by Benedictus Maria Reichert, Vol. VI, Rome, 1902, p. 353, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he preached at [[Macerata]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Callus|1929|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1930, Rispoli was appointed by the Master of the Dominican Order to act as Commissioner to restore regular life at the priory at [[Messina]], [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;''Registrum Provinciæ Siciliæ'', Archivium Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. XIII, 798, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 1630, he was than appointed for the third time Vicar-General of the Maltese Dominicans, and as official Visitor for the three Dominican Priories in [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Registrum Magister Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum Niccolò Ridolfi, 1630–37'', f. 116, Archivium Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed in Malta until 1632.

In that year, precisely on May 22, 1632, Rispoli was once more appointed Regent of Studies at [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;''Registrum Vicarii Generalis 1628–32'', f. 36, Archivium Generalis Ordo Prædicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 66, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not take up office until September, apparently because the Sicilian Prior Provincial had found some objection in the appointment&lt;ref&gt;''Registrum Vicarii Generalis 1628–32'', f. 39v., cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed in office until 1936, when he returned to Malta, once more as Vicar-General of the Maltese Dominicans, and as official Visitor for the three Dominican Priories in [[Malta]] on behalf of the Sicilian Prior Provincial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Callus|1929|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Rispoli also lectured in Holy Scripture and morals at the Cathedral of [[Mdina]], [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of the Cathedral, Mdina, Malta, Archive of the Mdina Cathedral, Misc. 275, ''Repertorium Mandatorum, B, Compendio dei Mandati, 1587–1645'', ff. 71-72v, ''passim'', cited by {{harvp|Fsadni|1993|p=706}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1638, Rispoli was elected Prior of the community at [[Valletta]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelagio, ''Catalogo cronologico dei Scrittori Maltesi'', ''Stromatum Melitensium'', Vol. II, collected by John Xavier Mifsud, 1752, National Library of Malta, Malta, n. 16, f. 224, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was his last assignment in Malta.

===Death===
In March 1639, Rispoli was in [[Catania]], [[Sicily]], where he went to preach Lenten sermons at the Cathedral. It seems that, during the rough 93&amp;nbsp;km crossing between [[Malta]] and [[Sicily]], he caught an ugly chill.&lt;ref name="Azzopardo_192v"&gt;Azzopardo, ''Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta'', f. 192v, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unwilling to rest or take time to convalescent, Rispoli plod through the sermons of the first couple of days. On April 1, after the appointed sermon, he feverishly took to bed unable to rise again. His condition worsened during the night, and died the day after, on April 2, 1639.&lt;ref name="Azzopardo_192v"/&gt;

His funeral in [[Catania]] was held four days later (April 6). Though technically just a simple friar, Rispoli was given a state funeral in everything but name.&lt;ref&gt;John Baptist de Grossis, ''Catanense Decachordum'', Catania, Sicily, 1642, Vol. I, p. 144, cited in {{harvp|Callus|1929|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chroniclers were impressed by the multitude of people, both common and dignitaries, who attended his service and interment. He was buried at the Dominican church of St. Catherine, [[Catania]], in a grave reserved for all friars. Unfortunately, in the subsequent years, through war and natural disasters, the church was destroyed, and the burial place lost. Today, only the original plaque which covered the grave still exists.

==Posthumous recognition==
Considering the outstanding intellectual and personal qualities of Rispoli, relatively little academic attention has been given to him, and much less to his philosophy. The only genuine biographical research carried out on original sources was done by Daniel Callus in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Callus|1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent scholars heavily relied on his work, adding here and there some further unsubstantial information.&lt;ref&gt;This was mainly done by Michael Fsadni and Mark Montebello.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, in general the academia ignored Rispoli, perhaps considering him just another withered mediaeval scholastic who, apart from some historical value, had no particular consequence or philosophical relevance to contemporary discussions.

Rispoli's works have ''never'' been meticulously or systematically studied. None of them have ever been translated, in part or in whole, into a modern language, let alone freshly read and studied. Indeed, the translation of his works, or even the transliteration of his manuscripts, is riddled with logistical problems. Most of the manuscripts (perhaps excluding the ''Commentaria'' of 1633) are written in a minuscule, mostly indecipherable, handwriting. Furthermore, they are peppered with inscrutable abbreviations. Of course, all of this does not apply to his ''Status Controversiæ'' of 1609, which is his only extant printed text, and which might possibly contain the best of his philosophy and originality.

As Rispoli's personality continues to attract attention, the eventual study of his philosophy is not a forlorn prospect.

==Works==
[[File:Rispoli 1609 thesis.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of Rispoli's 1609 ''magnum opus'']]
All of Rispoli's works attest to his Aristotelian-Thomist type of philosophy. Basically, [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] are his main sources, and his writing style is heavily influenced by the method of composition proper to [[Scholasticism]]. For this reason, most of his works are organised into 'Books', 'Chapters', 'Questions', and 'Conclusions'. Rispoli's extant writings are sixteen in all. They are of three types: (1) one published book; (2) fourteen endorsed manuscripts; and (3) one authored manuscript.

===Published book===
Rispoli published just one book in his lifetime, and that was at the beginning of his academic and intellectual career. Copies of the publication are extremely rare. Two are known to exist, one is at the Dominican Archive at [[Rabat, Malta]], and another at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] in Paris, France.
* 1609 – ''Status Controversiæ Prædefinitionum et Prædeterminationum cum Libero Arbitrio'' (''The State of the Question dealing with the Predefinition and the Predestination of Free Will'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, pp. 188f}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, in Latin, was published on June 15, 1609, by Reginald Chaudière, Paris. It contains twenty-two introductory pages (Roman numbering) and 424 body pages (Arabic numbering), and measures 17&amp;nbsp;cm x 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm. It was published ''cum privilegio Regis'' (by appointment of the King).

===Endorsed manuscripts===
These fourteen manuscripts are all held at the Dominican Archive at [[Rabat, Malta]]. They were put in writing by a cleric, John Mary Camilleri, who attended Rispoli's lectures, and presumably sanctioned for their accuracy by Rispoli himself (for they were in his possession). Some of the lectures were read at the Dominican ''Studium'' of the Portus Salutis Priory at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], and others at the Dominican ''Studium'' of the Annunciation Priory at [[Vittoriosa]], [[Malta]]. They are the following:
* ''c.''1617 – ''Tractatus Summularum'' (''A Short Treatise on Logic'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authored work===
This manuscript was discovered by Mark Montebello in 1992, and as yet remains the last of Rispoli's work to be located. It is held at the Commune Library of the Municipality of [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]]. The special and precious feature of this document is that it is the only manuscript personally penned down by Rispoli himself.

{{Nihongo|'''Kōgaku-ji'''|向嶽寺}}, originally '''Kōgaku-an''', is one of fourteen autonomous branches of the [[Rinzai]] school of [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]], founded in 1380 by [[Bassui Tokushō]]. The temple is located in southern [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], Japan near [[Mount Fuji]]. Due to its great popularity under the leadership of Bassui, the [[Emperor Go-Kameyama]] of the late 14th century declared it "a temple to pray for the nation" (Head Temples - Kōgaku-ji). The name was changed to Kōgaku-ji in the 16th century through the petitioning of General [[Takeda Shingen]]. In 1782 much of the original temple complex was destroyed in a fire, and after it was declared the head temple of the Kogaku-ji branch it was fully restored in 1908. Kōgaku-ji governs eight sub-temples and fifty temple affiliates.&lt;ref name="Yiqiao Gu"&gt;Yiqiao Gu, 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Head Temples&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G(012).JPG|thumb|First page of the [[Codex Boernerianus]] with lacuna in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:1-4]]
A '''lacuna'''{{refn|group=Note|From [[Latin]] ''lacūna'' ("ditch, gap"), literally "little ''lacus''" ("lake, basin").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|lacuna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|lacuna}}, {{L&amp;S|lacus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}&amp;nbsp;'''lacunae''' or '''lacunas''') is a gap in a [[manuscript]], [[inscription]], text, painting, or a musical work. A manuscript, text, or section suffering from gaps is said to be "lacunose" or "lacunulose". Some books intentionally add lacunas to be filled in by the owner (e.g., "The _____ played with the _____ in the _____."), often as a game or to encourage children to create their own stories.

Weathering, decay, and other damage to old manuscripts or inscriptions are often responsible for lacunae&amp;mdash;words, sentences, or whole passages that are missing or illegible. [[Palimpsests]] are particularly vulnerable. To reconstruct the original text, the context must be considered. In [[papyrology]] and [[textual criticism]] this may lead to competing reconstructions and interpretations. Published texts that contain lacunae often mark the section where text is missing with a bracketed ellipsis. For example, "This sentence contains 20 words, and [...] nouns," or, "Finally, the army arrived at [...] and made camp."

==Famous examples==
* A famous [[Old English]] example of a lacuna is in the manuscript [[British Library MS Cotton Vitellius A. xv]], the poem [[Beowulf]]:
::hyrde ich thæt [... ...On]elan cwen. '''(Fitt 1, line 62)'''
:This particular lacuna is always reproduced in editions of the text, but many people have attempted to fill it, notably editors Wyatt-Chambers and Dobbie, among others, who accept the verb "waes" (''was''). Malone (1929) proposed the name [[Yrse]] for the unnamed queen, as that would alliterate with [[Onela]]. This is still hotly debated amongst editors, however.&lt;ref&gt;G. Jack, "Beowulf: A Student Edition", [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford: 1994. Pp.31-32, footnote 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another notable lacuna is the eight-leaves-long [[Great Lacuna]] in the ''[[Codex Regius]]'', the most prominent source for [[Norse mythology]] and early Germanic heroic legends. Parts of it survived in independent manuscripts and in prose form in the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''.
* In [[Minuscule 69|Codex Leicester]] the text skips from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 10:45 to 14:17 without a break; possibly a scribe rewrote it from a defective manuscript.

[[File:LieroGameplay.png|thumb|right|256px|Screenshot of Liero. The player is using the ninja rope to hang from a clump of dirt while shooting at the enemy with rockets.]]

'''''Liero''''' is a [[video game]] for [[MS-DOS]], first released by [[Finland|Finnish]] programmer Joosa Riekkinen in 1998. The game has been described as a [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] version of ''[[Worms (game)|Worms]]'' (a turn-based [[Artillery game]]).&lt;ref name="Hotu"/&gt; ''Liero'' is [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for [[earthworm]] and is pronounced {{IPA-fi|liero|}}. Inspired itself by the earlier game ''MoleZ'',&lt;ref name="molez"/&gt; Liero provided inspiration for the later game ''[[Soldat (video game)|Soldat]]''.

==Gameplay==
In ''Liero'', two worms fight each other to death for score (or [[Glossary_of_video_game_terms#frag|frag]]s) using a choice of five weapons from a total of 40 in a two-dimensional map. Most of the terrain, except for indestructible rocks, may be dug or destroyed by explosions. In addition to the weaponry, each player has a ninja rope which can be used to move faster through the map. This grappling hook-like device substitutes for jetpacks and can even latch onto the enemy worm to drag him closer to his foe.

While playing, there are health power-ups to heal your worm. It is also possible to replace one of your five weapons by picking up bonuses. Before playing, you can select certain weapons to be available only in bonuses, in the entire game, or completely disabled.

Unlike most side-scrolling deathmatch games, the weapons in ''Liero'' have infinite ammo. Key factors include the reload rate of each weapon and how fast they shoot, whereas in most others include how much ammo a gun sports and how frequent more ammo for that gun can be found. ''Liero'' depends all on timing and swift maneuverability.

The gameplay mode can be [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]], Game of Tag or [[Capture the flag#Software games|Capture the Flag]]. It can be played by two human players simultaneously in [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] or in a single player mode against the game's [[artificial intelligence]], although the game's popularity is derived mostly from the fast-paced player-vs.-player action it provides.

==Development history==

=== Original Liero by Joosa Riekkinen ===
Joosa Riekkinen developed Liero as DOS game with the first version released in 1998. Liero was inspired by the previous [[Freeware]] game MoleZ, and took many weapons and sounds from its precursor.&lt;ref name="molez"&gt;[http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=MoleZ Liero Wiki: MoleZ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324194207/http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=MoleZ |date=March 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Liero's latest version was 1.33, which was released in 1999.&lt;ref name="official Liero wiki"&gt;[http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero official Liero wiki] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121184806/http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero |date=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero_1.33 official Liero wiki about Liero 1.33] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326152656/http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero_1.33 |date=March 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the author lost the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] [[source code]] in a [[hard disk]] crash, and due to the lack of backup, no new "classic" versions have been released since.&lt;ref name="official Liero wiki"/&gt;

===Community developments ===
Despite this, and with the author's approval, the ''Liero'' community has distributed several altered (or [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hack]]ed) versions of the game through the LieroCDC, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero#Modability official Liero wiki about modability] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121184806/http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero#Modability |date=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merge ===
In 2009, "classic" Liero was officially merged&lt;ref&gt;See the changes.txt file in Liero 1.34 or newer.&lt;/ref&gt; with the OpenLiero project upon the release of Liero 1.34 (not to be confused with the [[total conversion]] by that name). The new versions are released by Gliptic, although Joosa Riekkinen endorses them as official. The original Liero data and binary files by Joosa Riekkinen were released available under the [[WTFPL]] [[Software license|license]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liero.be/download/liero-1.36-bundle.zip license.txt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305140145/http://www.liero.be/download/liero-1.36-bundle.zip |date=2016-03-05 }} on www.liero.be ''"The original Liero data and binary files are copyright 1998 Joosa Riekkinen They are, unless otherwise stated, available under the WTFPL license: {{cite web |url=http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/668YoS4r0?url=http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/ |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }} The LIERO.EXE binary contains the SMIX sound library: {{cite web |url=http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~brodskye/smix/smix.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502152155/http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~brodskye/smix/smix.html |archivedate=2016-05-02 |df= }} The author of SMIX has stated that it is available under a BSD-3-Clause license, with a request for donations for use in commercial products.

Liero's last release was version 1.36, release September 3, 2013.&lt;ref name="TIG136"/&gt; This version is compatible with almost any OS but lacks network gaming (unlike some of the remakes).

It is an unofficial sequel to ''Liero'', and is the most popular of all the Liero clones.&lt;ref name="bigdownload"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/09/04/freeware-friday-openlierox/|work=Big Download|publisher=Game Daily|title=Freeware Friday: OpenLieroX|author=James Murff|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130215051/http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/09/04/freeware-friday-openlierox/|archivedate=2015-01-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanthrax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanthrax.com/news_details.asp?NewsID=01381|title=OpenLieroX review|work=LANThrax|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105040840/http://www.lanthrax.com/news_details.asp?NewsID=01381|archivedate=2016-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tigsource.com/articles/2008/05/14/multiplayer-on-one-keyboard-6-lier-um-yeah Liero review with side note about OpenLieroX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202054332/http://tigsource.com/articles/2008/05/14/multiplayer-on-one-keyboard-6-lier-um-yeah |date=2010-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero_Xtreme Liero Xtreme entry in official Liero wiki]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121184852/http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero_Xtreme |date=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eGamer about OpenLieroX"&gt;[http://egamer.co.za/2009/07/egamer-on-some-great-minigames/ eGamer about OpenLieroX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112104734/http://egamer.co.za/2009/07/egamer-on-some-great-minigames/ |date=2012-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It features [[online play]], fully customizable weapons, levels and characters. Liero Xtreme was created in [[C++]] by Jason 'JasonB' Boettcher, an [[Australia]]n programmer.&lt;ref name="Lanthrax"/&gt; With its source release on April 10, 2006, a new project has become available on October 24, 2006, known as '''''OpenLieroX''''',&lt;ref name="Lanthrax"/&gt; while the development of the original LieroX project has stopped. At the time of writing (May 6, 2009), OpenLieroX has tripled in code size&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ohloh.net/p/6596/analyses/latest Ohloh statistics of OpenLieroX]&lt;/ref&gt; and has many new features.&lt;ref name="bigdownload"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.root.cz/clanky/openlierox-nebezpecni-cervici/ Czech review of OpenLieroX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183331/http://www.root.cz/clanky/openlierox-nebezpecni-cervici/ |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlierox.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openlierox/doc/ChangeLog?view=markup Change log of all OpenLieroX releases]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is based on a [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] setting, where multiple players face off in a closed [[Level (computer and video games)|level]]. Each player is equipped with five weapons selected out of all the weapons allowed, and with a ''ninja rope'' that allows the player to move in any direction. Players begin with a set amount of lives, and whilst the game records the number of kills, the [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing]] is usually considered the winner. Liero Xtreme also allows team deathmatches, which has made it common for players to form [[Clan (computer gaming)|clans]]. OpenLieroX runs on Windows, on MacOSX, on Linux and on FreeBSD.

The first release announcement of Liero Extreme was made on October 14, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050826034655/http://liero.suddenlaunch2.com/index.cgi?board=LSeq&amp;action=display&amp;num=1034607561 Webarchiv of Liero Extreme original release post of Jason Boettcher]&lt;/ref&gt; LieroX has become very famous over the time. On February 14, 2006, ''Jason Boettcher'' stopped the LieroX development for good. The last version he released was 0.62b, which had many new features, but suffered from crashes and various errors, and did not catch on within the community which continues to play the 0.56b version. Before leaving the community, he released the [[source code]] of the even older version 0.55b under the [[Zlib License|zlib license]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716235955/http://www.thegaminguniverse.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28565 Original post by Jason Boettcher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151017081758/http://openlierox.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openlierox/doc/original_source_release/?pathrev=3042 Notes of original source release]&lt;/ref&gt; Development of LieroXtreme is now in hands of Karel Petranek and Albert Zeyer, used the source code to create OpenLieroX, which is compatible with the popular 0.56b version, but has multiple new features and bugfixes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlierox.sourceforge.net Official OpenLieroX homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003121123/http://openlierox.sourceforge.net/ |date=2009-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michał Futer took care of the new frontend. Currently the majority of players play OpenLieroX.

As a customizable game, it allows players and developers to [[Scripting language|script]] their own [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]]. Different mods have different sets of unique weapons, and may also differ in player gravity and movement. The default mod is ''Liero 1.0'', also called ''Classic'', which is roughly equal to the basic setting in original Liero. On top of this, several player-created mods are included in the standard game packs, some of which are more popular than the default setting. Similarly to Liero, the default level is ''Dirt Level'', consisting of diggable terrain with some indestructible rock. The default level is comparatively rarely played compared to more complex player-created levels.

The game interface allow players to modify factors of the game such as which weapons in a mod are allowed, and how fast they reload and many other parameters which have huge impact on the game play.

===NiL===
[[File:Nil.png|right|thumb|Screenshot of NiL]]
'''''NiL''''' ([[recursive acronym]] for ''NiL Isn't Liero'') is a [[Video game clone|clone]] of '''Liero''', which runs on [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and is released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. NiL is not limited to two players, like the original ''Liero'' is. It has support for an infinite{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} number of players over a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] network. It was met with considerable enthusiasm in the Linux gaming community.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/04/12/linux.net.games.idg/index.html Open-source, networkable shooter has Linux gamers buzzing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053224/http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/04/12/linux.net.games.idg/index.html |date=2017-12-22 }} by Lee Anderson, April 12, 2000, [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was initiated by Flemming Frandsen in winter [[1999 in video gaming|1999]] after he had stumbled across Liero, which he liked so much that he decided to reimplement it under [[Linux]]. He abandoned the project five months later, due to being too busy for it. NiL was dead until the beginning of [[2004 in video gaming|2004]] when Christoph Brill, found out about the project and took over as maintainer. Thereafter Daniel Schneidereit joined the project as well, but soon left. Other contributors included Nils Thuerey, Harri Liusvaara, David Hewitt and Phil Howlett.

Development proceeded slowly as the project's [[source code]] became almost unmaintainable and NiL was lacking developers. By mid-2005 Alexander Kahl joined development, convinced Christoph to start over and re-think the whole concept of NiL, as the other Liero clone Gusanos already existed at that time. Development seems to have stopped around mid-2006.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===OpenLieroX===
OpenLieroX is a remake of classic Liero, built from scratch in a new engine. It adds many features to the game, such as modding support, custom sprites, maps, and weapons, and online and lan play. The game also supports more than two players at once.

==Modification==
''Liero'' is a versatile game in terms of modification. All of its 40 weapons can be completely replaced with new ones that can be given different images and [[sound effects]] from the original set. The images of the worms themselves can be transformed into completely different characters, although their movement animations are less flexible regarding modification. The maps can be given permanent terrain other than rocks alone. Destroyable terrain can also be colored more than simply plain dirt. The AI can be modified to be harder or easier. Nearly the whole game can be converted into something entirely different, except for the main aspect having to do with slaughtering another player/AI.

==Reception and usage==

In 2006 Liero received a TopDog award from [[Home of the Underdogs]].&lt;ref name="Hotu"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060614110741/http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?name=Liero Liero] on [[Home of the Underdogs|HOTU]] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
''OpenLieroX'' has been positively reviewed by multiple gaming news sites.&lt;ref name="bigdownload"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanthrax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eGamer about OpenLieroX"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tigsource.com/articles/2008/05/14/multiplayer-on-one-keyboard-6-lier-um-yeah Liero review with side note about OpenLieroX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202054332/http://tigsource.com/articles/2008/05/14/multiplayer-on-one-keyboard-6-lier-um-yeah |date=2010-02-02 }} on tigsource.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero_Xtreme Liero Xtreme entry in official Liero wiki] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121184852/http://comser.liero.org.pl/wiki/index.php?title=Liero_Xtreme |date=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[Derek Yu]]'s webpage TIGSource reviewed Liero v1.36 favorably.&lt;ref name="TIG136"&gt;[https://www.tigsource.com/2014/02/14/liero-1-36/ liero-1-36] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720004552/https://www.tigsource.com/2014/02/14/liero-1-36/ |date=2016-07-20 }} on TIGsource.com (2014-02-14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling Liero a "masterpiece", Liero was selected for a collection of 100 classical Finnish games, which were presented on the opening of the [[Finnish Museum of Games]] in [[Tampere]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aamulehti.fi/kulttuuri/muistatko-viela-nama-suomalaiset-klassikkopelit-nama-100-paasevat-tampereen-tulevaan-pelimuseoon-24144926/ Muistatko vielä nämä suomalaiset klassikkopelit?

==Social Change Work==

===HIV/AIDS Advocacy===

====Centers for Living====
In response to the HIV/AIDS crises in the 1980s, Marianne founded the Los Angeles and Manhattan Centers for Living, which served as a refuge and non-medical support for people with HIV/AIDS. There they could connect with a variety of psychological and emotional resources, as well as community of support. She has said of that time that "there was so much love, because there was nothing to hold onto but love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marianne Williamson Aims to Defeat Henry Waxman, and Save Washington's Soul |url=https://www.laweekly.com/news/marianne-williamson-aims-to-defeat-henry-waxman-and-save-washingtons-soul-4316162 |date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Project Angel Food====
In 1989, Marianne launched [[Project Angel Food]] to build off the work of the Centers for Living. Originally launched to support HIV/AIDS patients, Project Angel Food expanded its outreach and currently cooks and delivers more than 12,000 meals each week, free of charge, to the homes of men, women and children affected by various life-threatening illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Project Angel Food's Angel Awards benefit, featuring Charo and Cheyenne Jackson, raises $650,000 | url=http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-project-angel-food-angel-awards-20180820-htmlstory.html |publisher=LA Times |date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's food and nutrition services, including medically tailored meals and nutritional counseling, help underserved people throughout Los Angeles County who are too sick to shop or cook for themselves. In 2017, Project Angel Food  served its 11 millionth meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Project Angel Food serves 11 millionth meal |url=http://www.losangelesblade.com/2017/11/28/project-angel-food-serves-11-millionth-meal/ |publisher=Los Angeles Blade |date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women’s advocacy===
Williamson has worked on behalf of women’s empowerment issues for decades. In 1993 she published her #1 NYT bestseller, A Woman’s Worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BEST SELLERS: July 11, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/books/best-sellers-july-11-1993.html |publisher=New York Times |date=1993-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher’s Weekly said of the book: “Williamson gives sound, empowering advice on relationships, work, love, sex and childrearing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Woman's Worth |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-679-42218-1 |publisher=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Marianne launched a series of Sister Giant conferences, trainings and events to support individuals – particularly women – who want to increase their efficacy as activists and/or run for office. Of the initiative she has said, “I want to be a cheerleader for women who have never even considered running for office or being involved in a campaign, but who in the quietness of their hearts might think, ‘Why not me?’” The events have focused on how to better address many social issues, including: child poverty, low levels of female representation in office, campaign finance reform, high levels of mass incarceration, among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marianne-williamson_b_1759887 |title= Gabrielle Bernstein Interviews Marianne Williamson: Sister Giant |work= Huffington Post |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Sister Giant |url= http://sistergiant.com/history-of-sister-giant/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Healing the Soul of America''===
In 1997 Williamson published her book ''Healing the Soul of America'' (hardcover originally titled ''The Healing of America'') and began a more robust political engagement. In this book, Williamson laid out plans to “transform the American political consciousness and encourage powerful citizen involvement to heal our society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Healing the Soul of America - 20th Anniversary Edition |url=http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Healing-the-Soul-of-America-20th-Anniversary-Edition/Marianne-Williamson/9781982101565 |website=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote in the book, “It is a task of our generation to recreate the American [[politeia]], to awaken from our culture of distraction and re-engage the process of democracy with soulfulness and hope. Yes, we see there are problems in the world. But we believe in a universal force that, when activated by the human heart, has the power to make all things right. Such is the divine authority of love: to renew the heart, renew the nations, and ultimately, renew the world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How To Heal Yourself And The World Around You |url=http://www.oprah.com/own-super-soul-sunday/book-excerpt-healing-the-soul-of-america-by-marianne-williamson/all#ixzz5QRNlTT8a |website=Oprah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia Holt of the San Francisco Chronicle called it “A huge and wondrous surprise....The Healing of America somehow makes us proud to be Americans, because every hope for democracy seems newly within our grasp.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BOOKS -- The Spiritual Side Of U.S. Politics / Williamson urges rethinking of roles |url=https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/BOOKS-The-Spiritual-Side-Of-U-S-Politics-2825611.php |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=1997-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 20th anniversary edition was published in 2018.

===Peacebuilding===
In 2004, Marianne co-founded [[Peace Alliance|The Peace Alliance]], a non-profit grassroots education and advocacy organization.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Poverty===
For years Marianne was a member of the Board of Directors and remains a public supporter of [[Results (organisation)|RESULTS]], an organization aiming to create the political will to end hunger and poverty around the world. It lobbies public officials, does research, and works with the media and the public to addresses the causal issues of poverty. RESULTS has 100 U.S. local chapters and works in six other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turning Compassion into a Political Force |url=https://www.results.org/events/IC_2012_Marianne_Williamson |website=Results.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love America Tour===
Starting in the winter of 2018, Marianne began touring the United States as part of her ''Love America Tour'', discussing how she believes "a revolution in consciousness paves the way to both personal and national renewal." About the tour she shared: “Our own disconnection from the political process, lack of knowledge of how our system operates, lack of understanding of our history, and confusion about many of the issues that confront us now, have led in too many cases to a dangerous emotional disconnection between our country and ourselves.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marianne Williamson bringing her 'Love America' tour to Detroit |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/05/15/marianne-williamson-bringing-love-america-tour-detroit/610713002/ |publisher=Detroit Free Press |date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tour Dates |url=http://sistergiant.com/tour-dates/ |website=Sistergiant.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===2014 US House campaign===

Williamson ran for the seat of [[California's 33rd congressional district]] in [[United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2014|2014]]. On her motivation for running, she has stated: “America has gone off the democratic rails. A toxic brew of shrinking civil liberties and expanded corporate influence are poisoning our democracy.“ Her core message was that “humanitarian values should replace economic values as the ordering principle of our civilization.” &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140225002934/http://www.marianneforcongress.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent elected and public officials endorsed her campaign, including: Frmr. Governors [[Jennifer Granholm]] and [[Jesse Ventura]]; Frmr, Congressmembers [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[Alan Grayson]]; and [[Van Jones]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marianne Williamson |url=http://mwfc-timwayne.nationbuilder.com/endorsements}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alanis Morissette]] wrote and performed her campaign theme song, entitled ''Today''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alanis Morissette cuts campaign song for Calif. candidate |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/205332-alanis-morissette-cuts-campaign-ad-for-long-shot-candidate |publisher=The Hill |date=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She campaigned on a broad array of progressive issues, including: greater access to high-quality education and free college; child poverty; economic justice; climate change &amp; renewable energy; campaign finance reform; universal health care; criminal justice reform; ending perpetual war and increasing investments in peacebuilding; women’s reproductive rights; and LGBTQ equality among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marianne Williamson, New-Age Guru, Seeks Congressional Seat |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/us/politics/marianne-williamson-new-age-guru-seeks-congressional-seat.html |publisher=New York Times |date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Issues |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226020125/http://www.marianneforcongress.com:80/issues |website=Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marianne Williamson Aims to Defeat Henry Waxman, and Save Washington's Soul |url=https://www.laweekly.com/news/marianne-williamson-aims-to-defeat-henry-waxman-and-save-washingtons-soul-4316162 |publisher=LA Weekly |date=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She finished fourth out of 16 candidates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marianne Williamson, Hollywood's Favorite New Age Guru, Backs Bernie Sanders for President |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marianne-williamson-hollywoods-favorite-new-792820 |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 14,335 votes for 13.2% of the vote. Williamson said of the process and its outcome: “This conversation of a politics of conscience, a politics of the heart, is much bigger than any one woman winning a congressional seat. And if that woman loses, the conversation goes on. My losing the congressional seat is small; what’s big is the larger conversation… you impact the ethers, and that energy goes somewhere.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oprah to Marianne Williamson: "How Important Was the Win for You?" |url=http://www.oprah.com/own-super-soul-sunday/oprah-to-marianne-williamson-how-important-was-the-win-video#ixzz5W1Tzz8SN |website=Oprah.com |accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2020 presidential campaign===

On August 2, 2018, [[The Guardian]] reported that she was exploring the possibility of a [[United States presidential election, 2020|presidential run in 2020]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/02/marianne-williamson-new-age-author-looking-into-presidential-run?CMP=share_btn_tw&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2018, Williamson announced that she was forming an [[exploratory committee]] for a presidential run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marianne Williamson on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/marwilliamson/status/1063229938679996417 |website=Twitter |language=en|quote=Announcing the formation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run in 2020.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29692">'''New Sincerity''' (closely related to and sometimes described as synonymous with [[post-postmodernism]]) is a trend in [[music]], [[aesthetics]], [[literary fiction]], [[film criticism]], [[poetry]], [[literary criticism]] and [[philosophy]]. It generally describes creative works that expand upon and break away from concepts of [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[irony]] and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], representing a partial return to [[modernism]]. Its usage dates back to the mid-1980s; however, it was popularized in the 1990s by [[United States|American]] author [[David Foster Wallace]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;David Foster Wallace, [http://jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Iain|date=2015-05-27|title=(New) Sincerity in David Foster Wallace's "Octet"|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00111619.2014.899199|journal=Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction|volume=56|issue=3|pages=299–314|doi=10.1080/00111619.2014.899199|issn=0011-1619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
"New Sincerity" was used as a collective name for a loose group of [[alternative rock]] bands, centered in [[Austin, Texas]] in the years from about 1985 to 1990, who were perceived as reacting to the ironic outlook of then-prominent music movements like [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]]. The use of "New Sincerity" in connection with these bands began with an off-handed comment by Austin punk rocker/author [[Jesse Sublett]] to his friend, local music writer [[Margaret Moser]]. According to author Barry Shank, Sublett said: "All those new sincerity bands, they're crap."&lt;ref name="Shank"&gt;Barry Shank, [https://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=9780819562760 ''Dissonant Identities: The Rock'N'Roll Scene in Austin, Texas''] ([[Wesleyan University Press]], 1994) ({{ISBN|9780819562760}}), p. 148–149 &amp; p.271 n.84. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=v79of-KXnfgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=crap&amp;pg=RA1-PA171#v=snippet&amp;q=%22all%20those%20new%20sincerity%20bands%22&amp;f=false excerpt available] at [[Google Books]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Sublett (at his own website) states that he was misquoted, and actually told Moser, "It's all new sincerity to me... It's not my cup of tea."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100122071814/http://jessesublett.wordpress.com/the-skunks-the-band-that-blasted-austin-out-of-the-1970s/ "Jesse's Music Bio"] at [http://jessesublett.wordpress.com/ ''Jesse Sublett's Little Black Book''] (retrieved September 18, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In any event, Moser began using the term in print, and it ended up becoming the catch phrase for these bands.&lt;ref name="Shank" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Blackstock, [http://www.nodepression.net/blogs/peter/2008/01/_is_it_worth_the_admission.html "'is it worth the admission....'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204134302/http://www.nodepression.net/blogs/peter/2008/01/_is_it_worth_the_admission.html |date=2008-12-04 }}, ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' blog post dated January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regarding [[Jesse Sublett]] and his band, [[The Skunks]], ''see'' Ken Lieck, [http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A79685 "Young, Loud, and Cheap: The Skunks, the Band That Broke Austin Out of the Seventies"], ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', December 8, 2000, ''and'' Jesse Sublett, ''Never the Same Again: A Rock 'N' Roll Gothic'' (Ten Speed Press, 2004), {{ISBN|978-1-58008-598-4}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=-6yPxcrGqfMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Jesse%20Sublett&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false excerpts available] at [[Google Books]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationally, the most successful "New Sincerity" band was [[The Reivers (band)|The Reivers]] (originally called Zeitgeist), who released four well-received albums between 1985 and 1991.

==In film criticism==
Critic Jim Collins introduced the concept of "new sincerity" to film criticism in his 1993 essay entitled “Genericity in the 90s: Eclectic Irony and the New Sincerity”. In this essay he contrasts films that treat genre conventions with "eclectic irony" and those that treat them seriously, with "new sincerity". Collins describes&lt;blockquote&gt;
the 'new sincerity' of films like ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989), ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' (1990), and ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), all of which depend not on hybridization, but on an "ethnographic" rewriting of the classic genre film that serves as their inspiration, all attempting, using one strategy or another, to recover a lost "purity", which apparently pre-existed even the Golden Age of film genre.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Collins, “Genericity in the 90s: Eclectic Irony and the New Sincerity” in Jim Collins, Hilary Radner and Ava Preacher Collins, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=oDwTPU8l2RQC ''Film Theory Goes to the Movies''] (New York: Routledge, 1993) ({{ISBN|0415905761}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-90576-3}}), p. 242, 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other critics have suggested "new sincerity" as a descriptive term for work by American filmmakers such as [[Wes Anderson]], [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Todd Louiso]], [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Charlie Kaufman]], [[Zach Braff]], and [[Jared Hess]],&lt;ref&gt;Brannon M. Hancock, [http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol9No2/HancockCommunity.htm "A Community of Characters – the Narrative Self in the Films of Wes Anderson"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724015633/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol9No2/HancockCommunity.htm |date=2008-07-24 }}, ''The Journal of Religion and Film'', vol. 9, no. 2 (October 2005), citing Mark Olsen, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1069/is_1_35/ai_53705833/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 "If I Can Dream: The Everlasting Boyhoods of Wes Anderson"], ''[[Film Comment]]'', 35/1 (January/February 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and filmmakers from other countries such as [[Michel Gondry]], [[Lars von Trier]], the [[Dogme 95]] movement, [[Aki Kaurismäki]], and [[Pedro Almodóvar]].&lt;ref name="Yurchak"&gt;Alexei Yurchak, "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today", in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H.

"&lt;ref name="Yurchak" /&gt;

==In literary fiction and criticism ==
In response to the hegemony of metafictional and self-conscious irony in contemporary fiction, writer [[David Foster Wallace]] predicted, in his 1993 essay "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a new literary movement which would espouse something like the New Sincerity ethos:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The next real literary “rebels” in this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of anti-rebels, born oglers who dare somehow to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse and instantiate single-entendre principles. Who treat of plain old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew self-consciousness and hip fatigue. These anti-rebels would be outdated, of course, before they even started. Dead on the page. Too sincere. Clearly repressed. Backward, quaint, naive, anachronistic. Maybe that’ll be the point. Maybe that’s why they’ll be the next real rebels. Real rebels, as far as I can see, risk disapproval. The old postmodern insurgents risked the gasp and squeal: shock, disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism, anarchism, nihilism. Today’s risks are different. The new rebels might be artists willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the “Oh how banal”. To risk accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Of overcredulity. Of softness. Of willingness to be suckered by a world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above imprisonment without law. Who knows."&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was further examined on the blog ''Fiction Advocate by Mike Moats:''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fictionadvocate.com/2012/09/19/the-infinite-jest-liveblog-what-happened-pt-2/|title=The Infinite Jest Liveblog: What Happened, Pt. 2|last=Mike|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The theory is this: ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' is Wallace’s attempt to both manifest and dramatize a revolutionary fiction style that he called for in his essay “E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction.” The style is one in which a new sincerity will overturn the ironic detachment that hollowed out contemporary fiction towards the end of the 20th century. Wallace was trying to write an antidote to the cynicism that had pervaded and saddened so much of American culture in his lifetime.  He was trying to create an entertainment that would get us talking again."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his 2010 essay "David Foster Wallace and the New Sincerity in American Fiction", Adam Kelly argues that Wallace's fiction, and that of his generation, is marked by a revival and theoretical reconception of sincerity, challenging the emphasis on authenticity that dominated twentieth-century literature and conceptions of the self.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Adam Kelly.

==In philosophy==
"New sincerity" has also sometimes been used to refer to a philosophical concept deriving from the basic tenets of [[performatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Eshelman, [http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0602/perform.htm "Performatism, or the End of Postmodernism"] in ''Anthropoetics'' 6 (2000/2001). See also his book, ''Performatism or the End of Postmodernism''. Davies Group: Aurora, Colorado 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen as one of the key characteristics of [[metamodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Timotheus Vermeulen &amp; Robin van den Akker, [http://www.aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677 "Notes on metamodernism"] in ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture'' 2 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Related literature includes Wendy Steiner's ''The Trouble with Beauty'' and [[Elaine Scarry]]'s ''On Beauty and Being Just''. Related movements may include [[post-postmodernism]], [[New Puritans]], [[Stuckism]], the [[Kitsch movement]] and [[remodernism]], as well as the [[Dogme 95]] film movement led by [[Lars von Trier]] and others.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==As a cultural movement==
"The New Sincerity" has been espoused since 2002 by radio host [[Jesse Thorn]] of [[Public Radio International|PRI]]'s ''[[The Sound of Young America]]'' (now ''Bullseye''), self-described as "the public radio program about things that are awesome". Thorn characterizes New Sincerity as a cultural movement defined by dicta including "Maximum Fun" and "Be More Awesome". It celebrates outsized celebration of joy, and rejects irony, and particularly ironic appreciation of cultural products. Thorn has promoted this concept on his program and in interviews&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kharakh, [http://gothamist.com/2006/11/02/jesse_thorn_ame.php "Jesse Thorn, America's Radio Sweetheart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929115220/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/02/jesse_thorn_ame.php |date=2008-09-29 }} in [[Gothamist]], posted November 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis McCafferty, [http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070114/070114tech.html "Top podcast picks: Favorites from experts in their category"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[USA Weekend]], January 14, 2007.

Solomon, ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p.258 n.3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]]. ("In the United States, the term 'new sincerity' has been popularized since 9/11 by some youth media (for example, by Jesse Thorn, the host of a popular music program ''Sound of Young America'', on New York's National Public Radio station WNYC").)&lt;/ref&gt; A typical explication of Thorn's concept is this 2006 "Manifesto for the New Sincerity":&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is The New Sincerity? Think of it as irony and sincerity combined like [[Voltron]], to form a new movement of astonishing power. Or think of it as the absence of irony and sincerity, where less is (obviously) more. If those strain the brain, just think of [[Evel Knievel]]. Let's be frank. There's no way to appreciate Evel Knievel literally. Evel is the kind of man who defies even fiction, because the reality is too over the top. Here is a man in a red-white-and-blue leather jumpsuit, driving some kind of rocket car. A man who achieved fame and fortune jumping over things. Here is a real man who feels at home as [[Spider-Man|Spidey]] on the cover of a comic book. Simply put, Evel Knievel boggles the mind. But by the same token, he isn't to be taken ironically, either. The fact of the matter is that Evel is, in a word, awesome. . . . Our greeting: a double thumbs-up. Our credo: "Be More Awesome". Our lifestyle: "Maximum Fun". Throw caution to the wind, friend, and live The New Sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Thorn, [http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2006/02/manifesto-for-new-sincerity.html "A Manifesto for The New Sincerity"], February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a September 2009 interview, Thorn commented that "new sincerity" had begun as "a silly, philosophical movement that me and some friends made up in college" and that "everything that we said was a joke, but at the same time it wasn’t all a joke in the sense that we weren’t being arch or we weren’t being campy. While we were talking about ridiculous, funny things we were sincere about them."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Valania, [http://www.phawker.com/2009/09/15/qa-with-jesse-thorn-americas-radio-sweetheart/ "Q&amp;A: With Jesse Thorn, America’s Radio Sweetheart"], ''Phawker'', September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorn's concept of "new sincerity" as a social response has gained popularity since his introduction of the term in 2002. Several point to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent wake of events that created this movement, in which there was a drastic shift in tone. The 1990s were considered a period of artistic works ripe with irony, and the attacks shocked a change in the American culture. Graydon Carter, editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', published an editorial a few weeks after the attacks claiming that "this was the end of the age of irony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/2001/09/25/irony_lives/ | title = Irony is dead! Long live irony! | first = David | last = Beers | date = September 25, 2001 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | work = [[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan D. Fitzgerald for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' suggests this new movement could also be attributed to broader periodic shifts that occur in culture.&lt;ref name="atlantic 2012"/&gt;

As a result of this movement, several cultural works, including many identified above, were considered elements of "new sincerity",&lt;ref name="atlantic 2012"/&gt; but this was also seen to be a mannerism adopted by the general public, to show appreciation for cultural works that they happened to enjoy. Andrew Watercutter of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' saw this as having being able to enjoy one's [[guilty pleasure]]s without having to feel guilty about enjoying it, and being able to share that appreciation with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2010/09/new-sincerity/ | title = Sincerely Ours: Glee‘s Success Cements Age of Geeky ‘New Sincerity’ | first = Angela | last = Watercutter | date = September 21, 2010 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example of a "new sincerity" movement is the [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|brony fandom]], generally adult and primarily male fans of the 2010 animated show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' which is produced by [[Hasbro]] to sell its toys to young girls. These fans have been called "internet neo-sincerity at its best", unabashedly enjoying the show and challenging the preconceived gender roles that such a show ordinarily carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | title = Curious about Bronies? | url = http://www.cbc.ca/q/blog/2011/12/07/curious-about-bronies/ | format = [[Adobe Flash]] | date = 2011-12-07 | accessdate = 2011-12-07 | publisher = [[CBC Radio]] | medium = Radio broadcast | first = Jian | last = Ghomeshi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired brony"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/ | title = My Little Pony Corrals Unlikely Fanboys Known as 'Bronies' | first= Angela| last = Watchcutter | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-06-09 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variants==

===Russia===
In Russia, the term ''new sincerity'' (''novaya iskrennost'') was used as early as the mid-1980s&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Epstein]], "On the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity", in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 457, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA457,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; or early 1990s by dissident poet [[Dmitry Prigov]] and critic [[Mikhail Epstein]], as a response to the dominant sense of absurdity in late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[post-Soviet]] culture.&lt;ref name="Yurchak n0"&gt;Alexei Yurchak, "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today", in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H. Solomon, eds., ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p. 258–259, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Epstein's words, "Postconceptualism, or the New Sincerity, is an experiment in resuscitating "fallen", dead languages with a renewed pathos of love, sentimentality and enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Epstein]], "A Catalogue of New Poetries", in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 146 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This conception of "new sincerity" meant the avoidance of cynicism, but not necessarily of irony. In the words of Professor [[Alexei Yurchak]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref name="Yurchak n1"&gt;[http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/users/alexei-yurchak Alexei Yurchak biography] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] Department of Anthropology website (retrieved February 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; it "is a particular brand of irony, which is sympathetic and warm, and allows its authors to remain committed to the ideals that they discuss, while also being somewhat ironic about this commitment".&lt;ref name="Yurchak n1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yurchak, at p.259 n.6, further explains this contrast in terms of [[Susan Sontag]]'s comment that a good writer should "Be serious. By which I meant: never be cynical. And which doesn't preclude being funny." (Citing Sontag as quoted in Jenny Diski, "Seriously Uncool", ''[[London Review of Books]]'' 29, no. 6 (March 22, 2007).)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays New Sincerity is being contraposed not to Soviet literature, but to [[postmodernism]]. [[Dmitry Vodennikov]] has been acclaimed as the leader of the new wave of Russian New Sincerity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/2006/8/vo9.html |title=Журнальный зал.

===In American poetry===
Since 2005, poets including Reb Livingston, Joseph Massey, Andrew Mister, and Anthony Robinson have collaborated in a [[blog]]-driven poetry movement, described by Massey as "a ‘new sincerity’ brewing in American poetry—a contrast to the cold, irony-laden poetry dominating the journals and magazines and new books of poetry".&lt;ref&gt;Katy Henriksen, [http://www.econoculture.com/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=414&amp;Itemid=45 " Drunk Bunnies, The New Sincerity, Flarf: How Blogs are Transforming Poetry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110223025/http://econoculture.com/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=414&amp;Itemid=45 |date=2007-11-10 }}, ''EconoCulture'', January 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets named as associated with this movement, or its tenets, have included [[David Berman (musician)|David Berman]], [[Catherine Wagner]], [[Dean Young (poet)|Dean Young]], [[Matt Hart (poet)|Matt Hart]], [[Miranda July]],&lt;ref name="htmlgiant"&gt;http://htmlgiant.com/haut-or-not/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-the-new-sincerity/ Jameson, A.D.

'''''On the Sublime''''' (Περì Ὕψους Perì Hýpsous) is a [[Roman Greece|Roman-era Greek]] work of [[literary criticism]] dated to the 1st century AD. Its author is unknown, but is conventionally referred to as '''Longinus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɒ|n|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Λογγῖνος}} ''Longĩnos'') or '''Pseudo-Longinus'''. It is regarded as a classic work on [[aesthetics]] and the effects of good writing. The treatise highlights examples of good and bad writing from the previous millennium, focusing particularly on what may lead to the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

The author's identity has been debated for centuries. The oldest surviving manuscript, from the 10th century, indicates the original author was named "Dionysius or Longinus", which was later misread as "Dionysius Longinus". Subsequent interpretations have attributed the work to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1st century) or [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] (c. 213–273 AD), though neither is now widely accepted.

==Authorship ==
The author is unknown. In the 10th-century reference manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 2036), the heading reports "Dionysius or Longinus", an ascription by the  medieval [[copyist]] that was misread as "by Dionysius Longinus." When the manuscript was being prepared for printed publication, the work was initially attributed to [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] (c. 213–273 AD). Since the correct translation includes the possibility of an author named "Dionysius", some have attributed the work to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a writer of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Grube"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grube|first=G.M.A|title=On Great Writing (On the Sublime) |publisher=The Liberal Arts Press|location=New York|year=1957|isbn=978-0-87220-080-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There remains the possibility that the work belongs to neither Cassius Longinus nor Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but, rather, some unknown author writing under the [[Roman Empire]], likely in the 1st century. The error does imply that when the [[codex]] was written, the trails of the real author were already lost. Neither author can be accepted as the actual writer of the treatise. Dionysius maintained ideas which are absolutely opposite to those written in the treatise; with Longinus, there are problems with chronology.

Among further names proposed, are Hermagoras (a rhetorician who lived in Rome during the 1st century AD), [[Aelius Theon]] (author of a work which had many ideas in common with those of ''On the Sublime''), and Pompeius Geminus (who was in epistolary conversation with Dionysius).

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] wrote under Augustus, publishing a number of works. Dionysius is generally dismissed as the potential author of ''On the Sublime'', since the writing officially attributed to Dionysius differs from the work ''On the Sublime'' in style and thought.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Andrew Russell|title='Longinus' on the Sublime|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassius Longinus===
Credited with writing a number of literary works, Longinus was disciple of [[Plotinus]], and considered "the most distinguished scholar of his day." He received his education at Alexandria and then went to Athens to teach. He later moved to Asia Minor, where he achieved the position of advisor to [[Zenobia]], the queen of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Longinus. (1851, Jul 01). Robert Merry's Museum (1841-1851), 22, 179. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/135926705&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longinus. 9 Vol. Detroit: The Gale Group Inc, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius is a dubious possibility for author of the treatise because he wrote in the 3rd century, and no literature later than the 1st century AD is mentioned (the latest is [[Cicero]], who died in 43 BC){{clarify|date=April 2017|Last citations are 1st C AD by Cicero who died 1st C BC?}} and the work is now usually dated to the early 1st century AD. The work ends with a dissertation on the decay of oratory, a typical subject for the time when authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Petronius]] and [[Quintilian]], who also dealt with the subject, were alive.  Cassius was executed by Aurelian, the Roman emperor who conquered Palmyra in 273 AD were on charges of conspiring against the Roman state. This was most likely because of what he had written for Queen Zenobia of Palmyra while she was still in power. Longinus is reported to have written answers for the Queen, which were used in response to Aurelian, the man who would soon rise to power as the Roman emperor.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt;

==Contents==
''On the Sublime'' is both a treatise on [[aesthetics]] and a work of literary criticism. It is written in an epistolary form and the final part, possibly dealing with public speaking, has been lost.

The treatise is dedicated to Posthumius Terentianus, a cultured Roman and public figure, though little else is known of him. ''On the Sublime'' is a compendium of literary exemplars, with about 50 authors spanning 1,000 years mentioned or quoted.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=William Rhys|title=Longinus on the Sublime|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the expected examples from [[Homer]] and other figures of Greek culture, Longinus refers to a passage from ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'', which is quite unusual for the 1st century:

{{quote|A similar effect was achieved by the lawgiver of the Jews—no mean genius, for he both understood and gave expression to the power of the divinity as it deserved—when he wrote at the very beginning of his laws, and I quote his words: "God said,"—what was it?—"Let there be light, and there was. Let there be earth, and there was."|''On the Sublime'' 9.9}}

Given his positive reference to Genesis, Longinus has been assumed to be either a Hellenized Jew or readily familiar with the Jewish culture.&lt;ref name="Leitch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Vincent B.|title=The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism|publisher=Norton|year=2001|pages=135–154|isbn=978-0-393-97429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Longinus emphasizes that, to be a truly great writer, authors must have "moral excellence".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; In fact, critics speculate that Longinus avoided publication in the ancient world "either by modesty or by prudential motives".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Moreover, Longinus stresses that transgressive writers are not necessarily shameless fools, even if they take literary risks that seem "bold, lawless, and original".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; As for social subjectivity, Longinus acknowledges that complete liberty promotes spirit and hope; according to Longinus, "never did a slave become an orator".&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Hugh |author2=Abraham Mills |title=From Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|publisher=T. Zell|year=1866|edition=2nd|pages=950–979}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, too much luxury and wealth leads to a decay in eloquence—eloquence being the goal of the [[sublimity|sublime]] writer.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

===The sublime===
Longinus critically applauds and condemns certain literary works as examples of good or bad styles of writing.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Longinus ultimately promotes an "elevation of style"&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; and an essence of "simplicity".&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brody|first=Jules|title=Boileau and Longinus|publisher=E. Droz|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote this famous author, "the first and most important source of sublimity [is] the power of forming great conceptions."&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt; The concept of the [[sublimity|sublime]] is generally accepted to refer to a style of writing that elevates itself "above the ordinary". Finally, Longinus sets out five sources of sublimity: "great thoughts, strong emotions, certain figures of thought and speech, noble diction, and dignified word arrangement".&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt;

The effects of the Sublime are: loss of rationality, an alienation leading to identification with the creative process of the artist and a deep emotion mixed in pleasure and exaltation. An example of sublime (which the author quotes in the work) is a poem by [[Sappho]], the so-called ''Ode to Jealousy'', defined as a "Sublime ode". A writer's goal is not so much to express empty feelings, but to arouse emotion in her audience.&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

In the treatise, the author asserts that "the Sublime leads the listeners not to persuasion, but to ecstasy: for what is wonderful always goes together with a sense of dismay, and prevails over what is only convincing or delightful, since persuasion, as a rule, is within everyone's grasp: whereas, the Sublime, giving to speech an invincible power and [an invincible] strength, rises above every listener".&lt;ref&gt;''On the Sublime'' 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this statement, one could think that the sublime, for Longinus, was only a moment of evasion from reality. But on the contrary, he thought that literature could model a soul, and that a soul could pour itself out into a work of art. In this way the treatise becomes not only a text of literary inquiry, but also one of ethical dissertation, since the Sublime becomes the product of a ''great soul'' ({{lang|grc|μεγαλοφροσύνης ἀπήχημα}}, ''megalophrosunēs apēchēma''). The sources of the Sublime are of two kinds: inborn sources ("aspiration to vigorous concepts" and "strong and enthusiastic passion") and acquirable sources (rhetorical devices, choice of the right lexicon, and "dignified and high composition").&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

===Decay of rhetoric===
The author speaks also about the decay of oratory, as arising not only from absence of personal freedom but also from the corruption of morals, which together destroy that high spirit which generates the Sublime. Thus the treatise is clearly centred in the burning controversy which raged in the 1st century AD in Latin literature. If [[Petronius]] pointed out excess of rhetoric and the pompous, unnatural techniques of the schools of eloquence as the causes of decay, [[Tacitus]] was nearer to Longinus in thinking&lt;ref name="Grube"/&gt; that the root of this decadence was the establishment of Princedom, or Empire, which, though it brought stability and peace, also gave rise to censorship and brought an end to freedom of speech. Thus oratory became merely an exercise in style.

===Misleading translations and lost data===
Translators have been unable to clearly interpret the text, including the title itself. The "sublime" in the title has been translated in various ways, to include senses of elevation and excellent style. The word [[sublimity|sublime]], argues Rhys Roberts, is misleading, since Longinus' objective broadly concerns "the essentials of a noble and impressive style" than anything more narrow and specific. Moreover, about one-third of the treatise is missing;&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Longinus' segment on similes, for instance, has only a few words remaining.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Matters are further complicated in realizing that ancient writers, Longinus' contemporaries, do not quote or mention the treatise in any way.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

===Limitations of the writing===
Despite Longinus' critical acclaim, his writing is far from perfect. Longinus' occasional enthusiasm becomes "carried away" and creates some confusion as to the meaning of his text. Furthermore, 18th-century critic [[Edward Burnaby Greene]] finds Longinus, at times, to be "too refined".&lt;ref name="Greene" /&gt; Greene also claims that Longinus' focus on hyperbolical descriptions is "particularly weak, and misapplied."&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Occasionally, Longinus also falls into a sort of "tediousness" in treating his subjects.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; The treatise is also limited in its concentration on spiritual transcendence and lack of focus on the way in which language structures determine the feelings and thoughts of writers.&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt; Finally, Longinus' treatise is difficult to explain in an academic setting, given the difficulty of the text and lack of "practical rules of a teachable kind."&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

===Writing style and rhetoric===
Despite its faults, the treatise remains critically successful because of its "noble tone," "apt precepts," "judicious attitude," and "historical interests".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; One of the reasons why it is so unlikely that known ancient critics wrote ''On the Sublime'' is because the treatise is composed so differently from any other literary work. Since Longinus' rhetorical formula avoids dominating his work, the literature remains "personal and fresh," unique in its originality. Longinus rebels against the popular rhetoric of the time by implicitly attacking ancient theory in its focus on a detailed criticism of words, metaphors, and figures. More explicitly, in refusing to judge tropes as entities unto themselves, Longinus promotes the appreciation of literary devices as they relate to passages as a whole.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Essentially, Longinus, rare for a critic of his time, focuses more on "greatness of style" than "technical rules."&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Despite his criticism of ancient texts, Longinus remains a "master of candor and good-nature".&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Edward Burnaby|title=Critical Essays: 1770|year=1973|isbn=978-0-85417-911-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the author invents striking images and metaphors, writing almost lyrically at times.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; In general, Longinus appreciates, and makes use of, simple diction and bold images.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

As far as the language is concerned, the work is certainly a unicum because it is a blend of expressions of the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek]] to which are added elevated constructions, technical expressions, metaphors, classic and rare forms which produce a literary pastiche at the borders of linguistic experimentation.

===Influences===
In reading ''On the Sublime'', critics have determined that the ancient philosopher and writer Plato is a "great hero" to Longinus.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Not only does Longinus come to Plato's defense, but he also attempts to raise his literary standing in opposition to current criticisms. Another influence on the treatise can be found in Longinus' rhetorical figures, which draw from theories by a 1st-century BC writer, [[Caecilius of Calacte]].&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

==Historical criticism and use of ''On the Sublime''==
*10th century - The original treatise, before translation, is copied into a medieval manuscript and attributed to "Dionysius or Longinus."&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt;
*13th century - A Byzantine rhetorician makes obscure references to what may be Longinus' text.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt;
*16th century - The treatise is ignored by scholars until it is published by [[Francis Robortello]] in [[Basel]], in 1554, and Niccolò da Falgano, in 1560.&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt; The original work is attributed to "Dionysius Longinus" and most European countries receive translations of the treatise.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;
*17th century - Sublime effects become a desired end of much [[Baroque]] art and literature, and the rediscovered work of "Longinus" goes through half a dozen editions in the 17th century. It is [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s 1674 translation of the treatise into French that really starts its career in the history of criticism. Despite its popularity, some critics claim that the treatise was too "primitive" to be truly understood by a "too civilized" 17th-century audience.
*18th century - [[William Smith (scholar)|William Smith's]] 1739 translation of ''Longinus on the Sublime'' established the translator and once more brought the work into prominence. Longinus' text reaches its height in popularity.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; In England, critics esteem Longinus' principles of composition and balance second only to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' and Immanuel Kant's ''Critique of the Power of Judgment''&lt;ref&gt;Clewis, Robert R. (2009). ''The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; owe a debt to Longinus' concept of the [[sublimity|sublime]], and the category passes into intellectual discourse. As "Longinus" says, "The effect of elevated language upon an audience is not persuasion but transport," a fitting sentiment for Romantic thinkers and writers who reach beyond logic, to the wellsprings of the Sublime. At the same time, the Romantics gain some contempt for Longinus, given his association with the "rules" of classical poets. Such contempt is ironic, given the widespread influence of Longinus on the shaping of 18th-century criticism.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;
*19th century - Early in the 19th century, doubts arise to the authorship of the treatise. Thanks to Italian scholar Amati, Cassius Longinus is no longer assumed to be the writer of ''On the Sublime''.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Simultaneously, the critical popularity of Longinus' work diminishes greatly; though the work is still in use by scholars, it is rarely quoted. Despite the lack of public enthusiasm, editions and translations of ''On the Sublime'' are published at the end of the century.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt;
*20th century - Although the text is still little quoted, it maintains its status, apart from Aristotle's ''Poetics'', as "the most delightful of all the critical works of classical antiquity."&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Also see [[Neil Hertz]]'s essay on Longinus in his book, ''The End of the Line.'' Hertz is in part responding to [[Thomas Weiskel]]'s book ''The Romantic Sublime'', probably the most influential recent account of British and German Romantic attitudes towards the Sublime of both Burke and Longinus.&lt;ref name="Hertz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertz|first=Neil|title=The End of the Line|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-231-05708-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiskel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Weiskel|author2=Portia Williams Weiskel |title=The Romantic Sublime|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1976|isbn=978-0-8018-1770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Quinney treats the attractions grim demystification in analyzes of Longinus, particularly Weiskel's.&lt;ref name="Quinney2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quinney|first=Laura|title=Weiskel's Sublime and the Impasse of Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Culler has an appreciation of Hertz on Longinus in "The Hertzian Sublime."&lt;ref name="Culler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|title=The Hertzian sublime|journal=[[MLN]]|volume=120|issue=5|pages=969–985|doi=10.1353/mln.2006.0007|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anne Carson]] and [[Louis Marin (philosopher)|Louis Marin]] have occasion to discuss Longinus as well and [[Harold Bloom]] and William J. Kennedy have significant accounts of his work. [[William Carlos Williams]] also uses three lines from the work as an epigraph to the Prologue to [[Kora in Hell]].&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Anne|title=Conjunctions|year=2001|pages=96–104|chapter=Foam: (Essay with Rhapsody) On the Sublime in Longinus and Antonioni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marin|first=Louis|author2=Nicolas Poussin |author3=Catherine Porter |title=The Sublime Poussin|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8047-3477-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=William J.|author2=Brenda Deen Schildgen |title=The Rhetoric Canon|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1997|chapter=Interest in the Canon: Kant in the Context of Longinus and Adorno|isbn=978-0-8143-2632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German film director [[Werner Herzog]] claims to have an affinity with the work of Longinus, in a talk entitled "On the Absolute, the Sublime and Ecstatic Truth", presented in Milan. Herzog says that he thinks of Longinus as a good friend and considers that Longinus's notions of illumination has a parallel in some moments in his films. He quotes from Longinus: "For our soul is raised out of nature through the truly sublime, sways with high spirits, and is filled with proud joy, as if itself had created what it hears."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5903">'''Peter Schöttler''' (born 15 January 1950 in [[Iserlohn]]) is a [[German people|German]] historian working in France and Germany. He was a research director at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] in Paris and teaches now at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]],&lt;ref name="NZZ" /&gt; where he has held an honorary professorship since 2001.

Schöttler was born in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], but grew up in [[Brussels]], thus becoming bi-lingual. He studied at [[Ruhr-Universität Bochum]],&lt;ref name="NZZ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Schöttler - akademischer Aussenseiter|date=2005|url=http://www.nzz.ch/articleDBOPY-1.187899|publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; close to his birthplace, and then in [[Paris]] at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]]. In history he was a student of [[Hans Mommsen]] in Bochum and [[Michelle Perrot]] in Paris; he studied philosophy under [[Louis Althusser]]. He has been an interpreter and translator of the work of major 20th century historians, notably [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]], co-founders of the journal ''[[Annales.

At the 1998 ''[[Deutscher Historikertag]]'' Schöttler, [[Götz Aly]] and [[Michael Fahlbusch]] were involved in the debate concerning the role of German historians during the [[Third Reich]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11926">'''Philosophy of sex''' is an aspect of applied [[philosophy]] involved with the study of [[human sexual behavior|sex]] and [[love]]. It includes both [[ethics]] of phenomena such as [[prostitution]], [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual identity]], the [[age of consent]], [[homosexuality]], and conceptual analysis of concepts such as "what is sex?" It also includes questions of sexuality and sexual identity and the [[Ontology|ontological]] status of [[gender]]. Leading contemporary philosophers of sex include [[Alan Soble]] and [[Judith Butler]].

Contemporary philosophy of sex is sometimes informed by Western [[feminism]]. Issues raised by feminists regarding gender differences, sexual politics, and the nature of sexual identity are important questions in the philosophy of sex.

*What is the function of sex?
*What is [[romantic love]]?
*Is there an essential characteristic that makes an act sexual?
*Are some sexual acts good and others bad? According to what criteria? Alternatively, can consensual sexual acts be immoral, or are they outside the realm of ethics?
*What is the relationship between sex and biological reproduction? Can one exist without the other?
*Are sexual identities rooted in some fundamental ontological difference (such as biology)?
*Is sexuality a function of gender or biological sex?

==History of the philosophy of sex==

Throughout much of the history of Western philosophy, questions of sex and sexuality have been considered only within the general subject of ethics. There have, however, been deviations from this pattern out of which emerge a tradition of speaking of sexual issues in their own right.

The ''Society for the Philosophy of Sex and Love'' is a professional group within the membership of the [[American Philosophical Association]].

==Sexual desire==
Moral evaluations of sexual activity are determined by judgments on the nature of the sexual impulse. In this light, philosophies fall into two camps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/s/sexualit.htm Alan Soble. Internet encyclopedia of philosophy: Philosophy of Sexuality]&lt;/ref&gt;

A negative understanding of sexuality, such as from [[Immanuel Kant]], believes that sexuality undermines values, and challenges our moral treatment of other persons.
Sex, says Kant, "makes of the loved person an Object of appetite".&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. Lectures on Ethics, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;
In this understanding, sex is often advised only for the purpose of procreation. Sometimes [[sexual celibacy]] is considered to lead to the best, or most moral life.&lt;ref&gt;St. Paul's praising, in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 7, sexual celibacy as the ideal spiritual state.&lt;/ref&gt;

A positive understanding of sexuality – such as from [[Russell Vannoy]], [[Irving Singer]] – sees sexual activity as pleasing the self and the other at the same time.

== Putative perversions ==
{{Main|Paraphilia}}

[[Thomas Nagel]] proposes that only sexual interactions with mutual [[sexual arousal]] are natural to human sexuality. Perverted sexual encounters or events would be those in which this reciprocal arousal is absent, and in which a person remains fully a subject of the sexual experience or fully an object.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel's "Sexual Perversion," pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positivistic animism''' [[hypothesis]] states that some [[animism|animistic]] [[memes]] belonging to determined [[culture]] and [[natural environment]] can be confirmed by [[positivism]]. These memes are therefore called positivistic animistic memes and can easily evolve towards [[Evolutionary Stable Strategy]] within the structure of simple and new [[memeplexes]], if dissociated from the original [[memeplex]].

The distinction between positivistic animistic memes and non positivistic [[animistic]] memes can only be done through scientific experimentation.

The main hypothesis for this theory is that there is the possibility that local animistic cultures carry memes that have positivistic properties.

Following this hypothesis, the following premises for the postulated theory are:

In a determined culture, local animism has memes that replicate knowledge gathered through trial and error over millennia – i.e. positivistic memes – these memes are by definition scientifically acquired and provable for that determined environment.

Modern science can study animistic practices and replicable components (memes) of a determined culture – it is possible to extricate animistic memes, and distinguish which ones are possible to prove scientifically, thus are positivistic memes for that specific local environment and which memes are purely derived from mysticism or have been carried in from different environments.

As conclusion, by extricate animistic memes from local memeplexes and disseminate the positivistic animistic memes associated to different and simple memeplexes, it is possible to act as an evolutionary force over the memes and memeplex.

If the theory is right, the dissemination of Positivistic Animism Memes will be done at minimum cost and effort and will facilitate the assimilation of memeplexes that are exterior to the culture as there is cultural ownership and identity over some memes that are part of the new memeplex. This theory provides a way of replacing obsolete memeplexes that hinder de development of society in the new globalised world. However, and because it requires the thorough and systematic study of culture and its memeplexes, will always store the information that these obsolete memeplexes contain.

Possible applications of positivistic animism:

If proven true, this theory can have applications in a wide range of natural and social sciences, and can be an interface between a scientific elite and illiterate populations. This theory can also prevent the loss of ancient positivistic knowledge and preserve live cultures in face of globalization.

For example, the application of this theory can foster a strong cultural sense that is likely to be both environmental sensitive and sustainably reproduced.

As most indigenous cultures nowadays are under enormous pressure of [[globalization]], the Positivistic Animist Theory can give a way to preserve positivistic cultural elements alive in cultures. The study and recording of all components of culture, positivistic or not, is nevertheless of the utmost importance, as the positivistic properties are specific for a time and a place.

This theory is still in its phase of inception and has not being proved. The first step to test this theory is the identification of local animistic memes in a determined culture, and test if these memes are positivistic or not. The memes found positivistic can be then disseminated through communication channels and its acceptance in local culture should be tracked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6595">The '''''Prabhu Linga Leelai '''''  Venpaas  in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] written by [[Siva Prakasar]] also called as 'Siva anuputhi selvar, 'Karpanai Kalangiyam', 'Thurai mangalam Sivaprakasar'. He compiled more than thirty original works and few more translation works from Kannada and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.in/2011_02_01_archive.html|title=Arunachala and Ramana Maharshi: February 2011|publisher=sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.in|accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Those  poems  were compiled as Venpa, Viruthan, Kalithurai, Agaval… It's a translation work. Prabhulinga Leelai, the work that the following translation comes from, chronicles the life and deeds of Allama Prabhu, a 12th-century Lingayata saint and teacher. There are two traditions regarding AllamaPrabhu's life. One sees himas a manifestaion of Siva Himself who came to the world to teach the path of freedom.

==The Original Version==
"Prabhu Linga Leelai" is a 15th-century Lingayata work, written in Kannada and comprising 1,111 verses. It was originally composed when a Lingayata scholar,&lt;ref name="davidgodman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidgodman.org/tamilt/prabhulinga.shtml|title=Prabhulinga Leelai|publisher=davidgodman.org|accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chamarasa, was challenged to produce a work that was greater than either the
Mahabharata or the Ramayana by vaishnava courtiers headed by arch rival Kumaravyasa. Shortly afterwards the troubled Chamarasa had a divine dream
in which Virabhadra, the son of Siva, asked him
to write a long poem on the Lingayata saints of the 12th century. Chamarasa subsequently composed the entire Prabhulinga Leelai
in eleven days. The book is based on the life and spiritual experiences of Allama Prabhu and his coequal Sharanas. The poet laureate presented it at the court of his king Deva Raya II where it was approved
by both the monarch and the vaishnava scholars who had challenged him.&lt;ref name="ebookezz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebookezz.com/allama-prabhu-in-kannada/|title=Allama prabhu in kannada - free eBooks download|publisher=ebookezz.com|accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poet==
Siva prakasar, [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].&lt;ref name="lisindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisindia.net/tamil/tamil_lite.html|title=Tamil Literature|publisher=lisindia.net|accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a Sage, Tamil Poet lived around  at the end of the 17th century. This great work was translated into Tamil by one Thuraimangalam Sivaprakasa Swamigal, in the 17th century. The author of the Tamil version, Siva prakasa Swamigal, had a strong connection with Tiruvannamalai. His father, Kumaraswami Desikar, used to come to Arunachala from Kanchipuram every year for the Deepam
festival. It is said that his three sons, of whomSivaprakasa Swamigal was the eldest, were all born by the grace of
Arunachala. When Sivaprakasa Swamigal grew up, he had a Guru in Tiruvannamalai —also called Sivaprakasa —whom he visited regularly. On his first Pradakshina of Arunachala, Sivaprakasa Swamigal composed Sonasaila Malai, a hundred-verse poem in praise of Arunachala.

==Last Days==
Sivaprakasa Swamigal died when he was  thirty-two.

==Bhagavan Ramana mentioned Prabhu Linga Leelai==
Bhagavan Ramana has mentioned about this work on many occasions and these are recorded in Talks, At the Feet of Bhagavan, and  Crumbs from His Table. Two of its verses are the source of Verse 20, of Sad Darsanam, Supplement. Bhagavan's compositions (Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham verse 20), and the chapter entitled 'Gorakkar Gati', part of which is translated here, was narrated by Bhagavan in Crumbs from his Table (pp.&amp;nbsp;36–39). A synopsis of the ma in story of this chapter —
the meeting between AllamaPrabhu and Gorakkar —also appears in
Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, Talk 334

Gorakkar is a saint whose samadhi is situated 6&amp;nbsp;km from Nagapattinam of Tamil Nadu and can be accessed by buses traversing from Nagapattinam to Vedaranyam. People throng the site during Amavasya and Poornima. It is informed that the transformation of DNA of human soul happens by the physical presence of oneself there in the Samadhi by the Hindu Saints. One can feel the bliss on reaching the Sea around and near the Samadhi, which cannot be explained in words as the Messengers like Gorakkar who bring the presence of God to the world and they are beyond Nama Swaroopa beyond words and pictures that can be grasped by common mind.

==Verses and Explanation==
Sivaprakasa Swamigal follows this tradition in Prabhulinga Leelai. The other version of his life, which is found in a fifteenth-century biography by Harihara, describes a more normal upbringing in the family of a temple drummer. Whatever the truth of the matter, there is general agreement that he was one of the most eminent saints, poets and Gurus of the Lingayata school. More details of
his life will be given in the notes to the verses.

| Verse 29:

All the scriptures declare that those who do not unite
with the band of devotees,
who, with the virtuous qualities as their support,
never swerve from the pure truth, can never unite,
with the One who bears an eye on His forehead.
What profit can accrue, so to speak, to one
who poses no initial capital?

(This speaks about Satsangh, which is also one of the themes of
Meykandar's Siva Jnana Bodha Sutrams.)

|Verse 42:

Was there ever a body born that was able to avoid death?
If you throw a stone into the sky,
is there any possibility that it will not fall back down?
Effects, however significant and enduring, will pass away,
But that which does not undergo death,
and is known as the Cause, that endures always! &lt;br/&gt;

'''Roger Stephen Crisp''' (born 23 March 1961)&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web |title= Crisp, Roger, 1961- |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n90641267.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 24 July 2014 |quote= CIP t.p. (Roger Crisp, University College, Oxford) data sheet (b. 3-23-61) }}&lt;/ref&gt; is fellow and tutor in [[philosophy]] at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St. Anne’s College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/people/profile/details/roger-crisp.html Profile page: Roger Crisp, St. Annes, Oxford University.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He holds the university posts of [[Professor]] of [[Moral Philosophy]] and Uehiro Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy.  His work falls principally within the field of [[ethics]], in particular [[metaethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[applied ethics]].  In addition, he is chairman of the Management Committee of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/nstaff.htm Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011071241/http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/nstaff.htm |date=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Originally from [[Brentwood, Essex]], Crisp began his higher education at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St. Anne’s College, Oxford]] in 1979, where he read [[Literae Humaniores]].  He was amongst the first male cohort to study at this previously all-female college.  He was taught by, amongst others, [[Margaret Howatson]], [[Gabriele Taylor]], [[Iris Murdoch]], and [[Peter Derow]].  In 1983 he commenced the [[B.Phil.]], and from 1985 until 1988 he worked on his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]], writing his thesis on [[utilitarianism]].

==Career==

In 1986 Crisp began his first academic post, as a junior lecturer in [[philosophy]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; he returned to St. Anne’s for two years beginning 1987 as a lecturer in [[philosophy]], before taking up a lecturing post at [[Hertford College, Oxford]] in 1988-1989. 1989-1991 saw Crisp move to [[University College, Oxford]], as a [[British Academy]] [[Research Fellow]] and Honorary [[Junior Research Fellow]].  Finally, Crisp returned once more to St. Anne’s in 1991, to take up a permanent post as Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy, succeeding [[Gabriele Taylor]].  For the first time in his career, Crisp temporarily left Oxford and spent the academic year 2010-2011 at [[Boston University]] to explore his interest in the moral philosophy of [[Henry Sidgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=1283&amp;id=56485 Boston University, news.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably Crisp’s most significant work to date has been ''Reasons and the Good'' ([[Clarendon Press]], 2006), in which he advances some novel approaches to the oldest questions in ethics.  The central claim of this work is that a fundamental issue in normative ethics is what ultimate reasons might underlie our actions; Crisp argues that the best exposition of such reasons will not employ moral concepts.  So far, ''Reasons and the Good''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crisp | first = Roger | title = Reasons and the good | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780199290338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been very well received.

Crisp is currently editing an Oxford Handbook on the History of Ethics.  Other major works include a translation of [[Aristotle|Aristotle’s]] ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Crisp | first1 = Roger | title = Aristotle: Nicomachean ethics | publisher = Cambridge University Press: Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy | location = Cambridge, U.K. New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780521635462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Routledge Guidebook to [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] on [[Utilitarianism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crisp | first = Roger | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Mill on utilitarianism | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415109789 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger T. Ames''' (born 12 December 1947) is a Canadian-born philosopher, translator, and author. He is Humanities Chair Professor at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]], and a Berggruen Fellow.&lt;ref name="UH Faculty Webpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.edu/phil/people/emeriti-faculty/|title=Emeriti Faculty - Department of Philosophy|website=Hawaii.edu|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made significant contributions to the study of Chinese and comparative philosophy, in which he emphasizes the importance of understanding Chinese philosophy on its own terms rather than through the lens of Western philosophy.

== Biography ==
Roger Ames was born in [[Toronto]], Canada, and raised in England and [[Vancouver]]. He is married with two sons. He received his bachelorʻs degree from the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) where he studied philosophy and Chinese language. While attending UBC, he took the opportunity to spend one academic year at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], his first exposure to China. After graduating from UBC, he began his graduate work at [[National Taiwan University]] (1970–1972), where he studied with Yang Youwei (楊有維). He returned to UBC to finish his master's degree (1973), then he spent two years living in Japan. In 1975, he began his Ph.D. at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS) at the University of London, where he studied under the tutelage of [[D. C. Lau]]. He completed his Ph.D. thesis in 1978, titled ''The "Chu Shu" chapter of the Huai-Nan-Tzu: The sources and orientation of its political thought''.&lt;ref name="SOAS Research Online"&gt;[https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/view/type/thesis.html] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he accepted an offer for an assistant professorship from the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]], and he remained there until he retired in 2016. He is currently Humanities Chair Professor at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China.

== Accomplishments ==
While a member of the faculty at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (UHM), Ames joined Eliot Deutsch, already a prominent academic and advocate of Chinese and comparative philosophy, and others to continue the tradition begun by Charles A. Moore and Wing-Tsit Chan to establish UHM as the hub for non-Western and comparative philosophy and intellectual exchange in the United States. Ames became the editor of the academic journal ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'' in 1987, the editor of the book review publication ''[[China Review International]]'', the editor and co-editor (with David L. Hall) of the "Chinese Philosophy and Culture" Series as well as (with Paul J. D'Ambrosio) the "Translating China" series with State University of New York Press.&lt;ref name="SUNY Press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunypress.edu/l-49-series.aspx|title=SUNY Press - Series|website=Sunypress.edu|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as Director for the Center for Chinese Studies at UHM and Co-Director (with Peter D. Hershock) for the Asian Studies Development Program (ASDP), and as Director and Co-Director of the East-West Philosophers' Conferences, the largest gathering of non-Western and comparative philosophers, with as many as 300 presenters, held in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2011, and 2016.

Ames has been a visiting professor at [[National University of Singapore]] and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and a Fulbright Professor at [[Wuhan University]] and Peking University. He has received many awards, including the Confucian Culture Award at the 2013 World Congress of Confucianism in Beijing, &lt;ref name="Roger Ames wins Confucius Culture Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://manoa.hawaii.edu/kaunana/roger-ames-wins-confucius-culture-award/|title=Roger Ames wins Confucius Culture Award - Kaunana|website=Menoa.hawaii.edu|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Huilin Culture Award  from Beijing Normal University in China in 2016.&lt;ref name="Roger Ames wins Huilin Culture Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2016/03/15/uh-manoa-professor-roger-ames-recognized-for-expertise-on-chinese-philosophy/|title=UH Mānoa Professor Roger Ames recognized for expertise on Chinese philosophy|website=University of Hawaiʻi System News|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Role-taking theory''', or social perspective taking, is the [[Sociology|sociological]] theory that one of the most important factors in facilitating [[social cognition]] in children is the growing ability to understand others’ feelings and perspectives, an ability that emerges as a result of general cognitive growth.&lt;ref name=Shaffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=D.R.|title=Social and personality development|year=2008|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|location=Belmont, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this process requires that children come to realize that others’ views may differ from their own.&lt;ref name=J1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=D.W.|title=Cooperativeness and social perspective taking|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1975|volume=31|pages=241–244|doi=10.1037/h0076285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Role-taking ability involves understanding the [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] (i.e. relating to moods, emotions, and attitudes) aspects of another person's point of view and differs from [[Perspective-taking|perceptual perspective taking]], which is the ability to recognize another person's visual point of view of the environment.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  Furthermore, albeit some mixed evidence on the issue, role taking and perceptual perspective taking seem to be functionally and developmentally independent of each other.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;

Selman|Robert Selman]] is noted for emphasizing the importance of this theory within the field of cognitive development.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  He argues that a matured role taking ability allows us to better appreciate how our actions will affect others,&lt;ref name=[3]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|title=The relation of role taking to the development of moral judgment in children|journal=Child Development|year=1971b|volume=42|pages=79–91|doi=10.2307/1127066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and if we fail to develop the ability to role take, we will be forced to erroneously judge that others are behaving solely as a result of external factors.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  One of Selman's principal additions to the theory has been an empirically supported developmental theory of role taking ability.

Social cognitive research on children's thoughts about others’ perspectives, feelings, and behaviors has emerged as one of the largest areas of research in the field.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; Role taking theory can provide a theoretical foundation upon which this research can rest and be guided by and has relations and applications to numerous other theories and topics.

==Selman's theory of role-taking development==
[[Robert L. Selman|Selman]] developed his developmental theory of role taking ability based on four sources.&lt;ref name=[4]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|author2=Byrne, D.F. |title=A structural-developmental analysis of levels of role taking in middle childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1974|volume=45|pages=803–806|doi=10.2307/1127850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first is the work of Feffer &lt;ref name=[5]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|title=The cognitive implication of role-taking behavior|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1959|volume=27|pages=152–168|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1959.tb01826.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[6]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|title=Developmental analysis of inter-personal behavior|journal=Psychological Review|year=1971|volume=77|pages=197–214|doi=10.1037/h0029171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Feffer and Gourevitch,&lt;ref name=[7]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|author2=Gourevitch, V. |title=Cognitive aspects of role-taking in children|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1960|volume=28|pages=383–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1960.tb01627.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which related role taking ability to Piaget's theory of social decentering and developed a projective test to assess children's ability to decenter as they mature.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The second is the research of Flavell, which studied children's growing abilities to judge other people's conceptual and perceptual perspectives.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The third is the developmental ideas of differentiation, whereupon one learns to distinguish his/her perspective from the perspectives of others, and integration, the ability to relate one's perspective to the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The final source of influence comes from Selman's own previous research where he assessed children's ability to describe the different perspectives of characters in a story.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

One example of Selman's stories is that of Holly and her father.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Children are told about Holly, an avid 8-year-old tree climber. One day, Holly falls off a tree, but does not hurt herself. Holly's father sees this and makes Holly promise that she will stop climbing trees, and Holly promises. Later, however, Holly and her friends meet Shawn, a boy whose kitten is stuck in a tree. Holly is the only one amongst her friends who can climb trees well enough to save Shawn's kitten, who may fall at any moment, but she remembers the promise she made with her father. Selman then goes on to ask children about the perspectives of Holly and her father, and each stage is associated with typical responses.

===Stages===
'''Level 0: Egocentric Role Taking''' (ages 3–6, roughly)&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

This stage is characterized by two lacking abilities.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The first is the failure to distinguish perspectives (differentiation).&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  More specifically, the child is unable to distinguish between his perspective, including his perspective on why a social action occurred, and that of others. [1] The second ability the child lacks is relating perspectives (integration).&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, children tend to respond that Holly will save the kitten and that the father will not mind Holly's disobedience because he will be happy and he likes kittens. In actuality, the child is displaying his/her inability to separate his/her liking for kittens from the perspectives of Holly and her father.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 1: Subjective role taking''' (ages 6–8, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

Children now recognize that they and others in a situation may have different information available to them, and thus may differ in their views.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In other words, children have matured in differentiation.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The child still significantly lacks integration ability, however: he/she cannot understand that his views are influenced by the views of others, and vice versa, ad infinitum.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In addition, the child believes that the sole reason for differing social perspectives is because of different information, and nothing else.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, when asked if the father would be angry if he found out that Holly climbed the tree again, children might respond, “If he didn’t know why she climbed the tree, he would be angry. But if he knew why she did it, he would realize that she had a good reason,” not recognizing that the father may still be angry, regardless of her wanting to save the kitten, because of his own values, such as his concern for his daughter's safety.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 2: Self-reflective role taking''' (ages 8–10, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

The child's differentiation ability matures at this age enough so that he/she understands that people can also differ in their social perspectives because of their particularly held and differing values and set of purposes.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In turn, the child is able to better put him/herself in the position of another person.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In terms of integration, the child can now understand that others think about his/her point of view too.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  This allows the child to predict how the other person might react to the child's behaviour.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  What is still lacking, however, is for the child to be able to consider another person's point of view and another person's point of view of the child simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, when children are asked if Holly will climb the tree, they will typically respond, “Yes. She knows that her father will understand why she did it.” This indicates the child is considering the father's perspective in light of Holly's perspective; however, when asked if the father would want Holly to climb the tree, children typically respond that he would not. This shows that the child is solely considering the father's point of view and his worry for Holly's safety.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 3: Mutual role taking''' (ages 10–12, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In this stage, the child can now differentiate his/her own perspective from the viewpoint likely for the average member of the group.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In addition, the child can take the view of a detached third-person and view a situation from that perspective.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In terms of integration, the child can now simultaneously consider his/her view of others and others’ view of the child, and the consequences of this feedback loop of perspectives in terms of behaviour and cognition.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In describing the result of the Holly dilemma, the child may take the perceptive of a detached third party, responding that “Holly wanted to get the kitten because she likes kittens, but she knew that she wasn’t supposed to climb trees. Holly’s father knew that Holly had been told not to climb trees, but he couldn’t have known about [the kitten].” &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 4: Societal role taking''' (ages 12–15+, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

The adolescent now considers others’ perspectives with reference to the social environment and culture the other person comes from, assuming that the other person will believe and act in accord to their society's norms and values.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

When asked if Holly deserves to be punished for her transgression, adolescents typically respond that Holly should not as her father should understand that we need to humanely treat animals.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

==Evidence for Selman's Stages==
Three studies have been conducted to assess Selman's theory, and all three have shown support for his developmental outline of role taking ability progression. Selman conducted the first study of his own theory using 60 middle-class children from ages 4 to 6.&lt;ref name=[8]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|title=Taking another's perspective: Role-taking development in early childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1971a|volume=42|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1971.tb03765.x|pages=1721–1734}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this experiment, the children were asked to predict and explain their predictions about another child's behaviour in a certain situation. The child participants were given situational information not available to the child they were making behavioural and cognitive predictions about. Results implied a stage progression of role taking ability as a function of age, as theorized by Selman.&lt;ref name=[8] /&gt;

In a second assessment of the theory, Selman and Byrne interviewed 40 children, ages 4, 6, 8, and 10, on two socio-moral dilemmas.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  Children were required to discuss the perspectives of different characters in each dilemma, and results again showed that role taking ability progressed through stages as a function of age.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

The third study assessing Selman's theory was a 5-year longitudinal study of 41 male children on their role taking ability.&lt;ref name=[9]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurucharri|first=C.|author2=Selman, R.L. |title=The development of interpersonal understanding during childhood, preadolescence, and adolescence: A longitudinal follow-up study|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=924–927|doi=10.2307/1129129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results showed that 40 of the 41 children interviewed followed the stages as outlined by Selman and none skipped over a stage.&lt;ref name=[9] /&gt;

==Relation to other topics==

===[[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]]===
[[Jean Piaget]] stressed the importance of play in children, especially play that involves role taking.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  He believed that role taking play in children&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; promotes a more mature social understanding by teaching children to take on the roles of others, allowing them to understand that different people can have differing perspectives.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In addition, Piaget argued that good solutions to interpersonal conflicts involve compromise which arises out of our ability to consider the points of view of others.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;
Two of Piaget's fundamental concepts have primarily influenced role taking theory. The first is [[egocentrism]], the mode of thinking that characterizes preoperational thinking, which is the child's failure to consider the world from other points of view.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The second is decentration, the mode of thinking that characterizes operational thinking, which is the child's growing ability to perceive the world with more than one perspective in mind.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In Piagetian theory, these concepts were used to describe solely cognitive development, but they have been applied in role taking theory to the social domain.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

====Evidence for a relation between Piaget's theory and role-taking ability====

Evidence that Piaget's cognitive theories can be applied to the interpersonal aspects of role taking theory comes from two sources. The first is empirical evidence that children's ability to role take is correlated to their IQ and performance on Piagetian tests.&lt;ref name=[10]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pellegrini|first=D.S.|title=Social cognition and competence in middle childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1985|volume=56|pages=253–264|doi=10.2307/1130192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondly, the two theories have been conceptually linked in that Selman's role taking stages correspond to Piaget's cognitive development stages, where preoperational children are at level 1 or 2, concrete operators are at level 3 or 4, and formal operators are at level 4 or 5 of Selman's stages.&lt;ref name=[11]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keating|first=D.|author2=Clark, L.V. |title=Development of physical and social reasoning in adolescence|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1980|volume=16|pages=23–30|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.16.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given this relation, Feffer &lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt; and Feffer and Gourevitch &lt;ref name=[7] /&gt;  have argued that social role taking is an extension of decentering in the social sphere. Selman has argued this same point, also noting that the growth of role taking ability is brought on by the child's decreased egocentrism as he/she ages.&lt;ref name=[8] /&gt;

===[[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]===
[[Lawrence Kohlberg]] argued that higher moral development requires role taking ability.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;  For instance, Kohlberg's conventional level of morality (between ages 9 and 13, roughly), involves moral stereotyping, empathy-based morality, alertness to and behaviour guided by predicted evaluations by others, and identifying with authority, all of which require role taking.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;

====Evidence for a relation between Kohlberg's stages of moral development and role-taking ability====

Selman tested 60 children, ages 8 to 10, on Kohlberg's moral-judgment measure and two role taking tasks.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;  He found that the development of role taking, within this age range, related to the progression into Kohlberg's conventional moral stage. A retest a year later confirmed Kohlberg's argument, and in general, it was shown that higher moral development at the conventional stage requires children's achieved ability at this age to reciprocally deal with their own and others’ perspectives.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;
Mason and Gibbs found that moral judgment development, as measured by Kohlberg's theory, consistently related to role taking opportunities experienced after childhood in adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref name=[12] /&gt;  This finding supported Kohlberg's view that moral progress beyond his third stage necessitates contact with other perspectives, namely those of entire cultures or political groups, which individuals are likely to encounter as they become adolescents and adults and thus meet many different people in school and the workplace.&lt;ref name=[12]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=M.G.|author2=Gibbs, J.C. |title=Social perspective taking and moral judgment among college students|journal=Journal of Adolescent Research|year=1993|volume=8|pages=109–123|doi=10.1177/074355489381008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation between Kohlberg’s stages, Piaget’s theory, and Selman’s theory===
Kohlberg and Piaget both emphasized that role taking ability facilitates moral development.&lt;ref name=[12] /&gt;  Kohlberg argued that cognitive and role taking development are required but not sufficient for moral development.&lt;ref name=[13]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=L.J.|title=Cognitive and Perspective-taking Prerequisites for Moral development|journal=Child Development|year=1980|volume=51|pages=131–139|doi=10.2307/1129599}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, he maintained that Piaget's cognitive developmental stages underlie Selman's role taking stages, which are subsequently fundamental to his own moral developmental stages.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; This predicts that cognition develops first, followed by the corresponding role taking stage, and finally the corresponding moral stage, and never the other way around.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

Conceptually, the three processes have been tied together by Walker.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; His reasoning is that cognitive development involves the progressive understanding of the environment as it is. Role taking is a step upon this, which is the recognition that people each have their own subjective interpretation of the environment, including how they think about and behave towards other people. Moral development, the final step, is the grasping of how people should think and behave towards one another.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

Evidence in support of this view comes first from three reviews which showed moderate correlations between Selman's role taking theory, Piaget's cognitive developmental stages, and Kohlberg's moral developmental stages.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; More evidence comes from Walker and Richards's finding that moral development to Kohlberg's stage 4 occurred only for those who already had early basic formal operations according to Piaget's developmental theory, and not for those in an earlier stage.&lt;ref name=[14]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=L.J.|author2=Richards, B.S. |title=Stimulating transitions in moral reasoning as a function of stage of cognitive development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1979|volume=15|pages=95–103|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.2.95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Paolitto's attempts to stimulate moral development worked only for subjects who already attained the corresponding role taking stage.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Previous research has also shown that short role taking treatments, such as exposing subjects to the role taking reasoning of subjects in one stage higher, can lead to moral development.&lt;ref name=[14] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[15]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keasey|first=C.B.|title=Experimentally induced changes in moral opinions and reasoning|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=26|pages=30–38|doi=10.1037/h0034210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[16]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tracy|first=J.J.|author2=Cross, H.J. |title=Antecedents of shift in moral judgment|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=26|pages=238–244|doi=10.1037/h0034432}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more general demonstrations of this argument, Faust and Arbuthnot and other researchers have shown that moral development is most probable for subjects with higher cognitive development.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[17]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faust|first=D.|author2=Arbuthnot, J. |title=Relationship between moral and Piagetian reasoning and the effectiveness of moral education|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1978|volume=14|pages=435–436|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.14.4.435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a direct investigation of Kohlberg's necessary but not sufficient argument, Walker tested the hypothesis that only children who had attained both beginning formal operations and role taking stage 3 could progress to Kohlberg's moral stage 3.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; 146 grade 4-7 children participated in this study, and the results strongly supported the hypothesis, given that only children who had the beginning formal substage of cognitive development and role taking stage 3 progressed to moral stage 3.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Further support came from the study's demonstration that a short role playing treatment stimulated progress in moral reasoning in a 6-week follow-up retest.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Krebs and Gilmore also directly tested Kohlberg's necessary but not sufficient argument of moral development in 51 children, ages 5–14, for the first three stages of cognitive, role taking, and moral development.&lt;ref name=[18]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=D.|author2=Gillmore, J. |title=The relationship among the first stages of cognitive development, role-taking abilities, and moral development|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=877–886|doi=10.2307/1129124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results generally supported Kohlberg's view, but not as strongly, given that it was only demonstrated that cognitive development is a prerequisite for role taking development, and not for moral development.&lt;ref name=[18] /&gt; Based on these results, researchers have suggested that moral education programs underlain by Kohlberg's theory must first ensure that the prerequisite cognitive and role taking abilities have developed.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

===[[Prosocial behavior]]===
Role taking ability and prosocial behaviours and feelings have been argued to be related.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Evidence for this claim has been found from many sources. Underwood and Moore have found that perceptual, affective, and cognitive perspective taking are positively correlated with prosocial behaviour.&lt;ref name=[19]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Underwood|first=B.|author2=Moore, B. |title=Perspective-taking and altruism|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1982|volume=91|pages=143–173|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.91.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children trained to improve their role taking ability subsequently become more generous, more cooperative, and more apprehensive to the needs of others in comparison to children who received no role taking training.&lt;ref name=[20]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chalmers|first=J.B.|author2=Townsend, M.A. |title=The effects of training in social perspective taking on socially maladjusted girls|journal=Child Development|year=1990|volume=61|pages=178–190|doi=10.2307/1131057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[21]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iannotti|first=R.J.|title=Effect of role-taking experiences on roletaking, empathy, altruism, and aggression|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1978|volume=14|pages=119–124|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.14.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has also shown that people who are good at role taking have greater ability to sympathize with others.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[22]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S |title=Brazilian adolescents’ prosocial moral judgment and behavior: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, the picture is clear: prosocial behaviour is related to role taking ability development and social deviance is linked to egocentrism.&lt;ref name=[23]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chandler|first=M.J.|title=Egocentrism and anti-social behavior: The assessment and training of social perspective-taking skills|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1973|volume=9|pages=326–332|doi=10.1037/h0034974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To study one reason for the link between role taking ability and prosociality,  grade 2 children found to be either high or low in role taking were instructed to teach two kindergartners on an arts and crafts task. 16 measures of prosocial behaviour were scored, and high and low role takers diverged on 8 of the measures, including several helping measures, providing options, and social problem solving. Analysis of the results showed that low role takers helped less than high role takers not because of a lack of wanting to help, but because of their poorer ability in interpreting social cues indicating the need for help.&lt;ref name=[24]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudson|first=L.M.|author2=Forman, E.A. |author3=Brion-Meisels, S. |title=Role taking as a predictor of prosocial behavior in cross-age tutors|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=1320–1329|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1982.tb04171.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, low role takers tended to only be able to recognize problems when they were made plainly obvious.&lt;ref name=[24] /&gt;

Role taking has also been related to [[empathy]]. Batson had participants listen to an interview of a woman going through hardship.&lt;ref name=[25]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C.D.|author2=Early, S. |author3=Salvarani, G. |title=Perspective taking: Imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1997|volume=23|pages=751–758|doi=10.1177/0146167297237008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then instructed participants to imagine how she feels, or, to imagine how they would feel in her situation, and found that both conditions produced feelings of empathy. Schoenrade has found the same result, where imagining how a person in distress feels or how one would feel in that person's situation produces feelings of empathy.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;

Finally, many theorists, including Mead, [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[Solomon Asch|Asch]], Heider, Deutsch, Madsen, and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] have theorized a relationship between cooperation and role taking ability.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  In one study, children's predisposition to cooperate was shown to strongly correlate with their affective role taking ability.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  Other researchers have also shown an indirect relationship between cooperation and role taking capacity.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;&lt;ref name=[26]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=H.H.|author2=Stahelski, A. J. |title=Social interaction basis of cooperators' and competitors' beliefs about others|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1970|volume=16|pages=66–91|doi=10.1037/h0029849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Social skills|Social functioning]]===
A child's ability to function in social relationships has been found to depend partially on his/her role-taking ability. For instance, researchers found that children poor in role-taking ability had greater difficulty in forming and sustaining [[Social relation|social relationships]], as well as receiving lower peer nominations.&lt;ref name=[27]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|author2=Jacquette, D. |author3=Lavin, D.

Better functioning in the interpersonal domain is particularly shown in the relation between role-taking ability and social problem solving ability. Role playing has been shown to improve male teenagers’ handling of social problem tasks.&lt;ref name=[30]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=D.T.|author2=Serafica, F.

S. |title=Perspective-taking and self-other overall: Fostering social bonds and facilitating social coordination|journal=Group Process &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2005|volume=8|pages=109–124|doi=10.1177/1368430205051060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training children on role taking ability can improve interpersonal functioning as well. In one study, preschoolers were made to role play interpersonal conflicts using puppets.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Their task at the end was to discuss alternative solutions to the problems and how each solution would affect each character.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Over the 10 weeks that the preschoolers participated in this role playing, their solutions became less [[Aggression|aggressive]] and their classroom [[Adjustment (psychology)|adjustment]] became better.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Moreover, the use of role reversal in interpersonal problem situations has been found to stimulate cooperation, help participants better understand each other and each other's arguments and position, elicit new interpretations of the situation, change attitudes about the problem, and improve perceptions about the other person's efforts at solving the issue, willingness to compromise and cooperate, and trustworthiness.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  As a result of this research, it has been suggested that one way to improve cooperative skills is to improve affective role taking abilities.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt; 
 
Role taking can also work to decrease [[prejudice]] and [[Stereotype|stereotyping]].&lt;ref name=[34]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C.D. |author2=Polycarpou, M.

==Applications==

===[[ADHD|ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)]]===
Children with ADHD struggle in their social environments, but the social-cognitive reasons for this are unknown.&lt;ref name=[40]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marton|first=I.|author2=Wiener, J. |author3=Rogers, M. |author4=Moore, C. |author5=Tannock, R. |title=Empathy and social perspective taking in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|year=2009|volume=37|pages=107–118|doi=10.1007/s10802-008-9262-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have indicated a difference between children with and without ADHD on their role taking ability, wherein children with ADHD have lower role taking ability, lower role taking use, and slower role taking development than children without ADHD.&lt;ref name=[40] /&gt;  Given these results, it has been suggested that children with ADHD be trained on role taking to improve their social skills, including their often comorbid oppositional and conduct problems.&lt;ref name=[40] /&gt;

===[[Juvenile delinquency|Delinquency]] and [[Social skills|social-skills training]]===
The relationship between childhood and adolescent [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] and role taking is considerable. Burack found that maltreated children and adolescents with behavioural problems exhibited [[egocentrism]] at higher levels than non-maltreated children and adolescents who had progressed faster and more expectedly in their role taking development.&lt;ref name=[41]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burack|first=J.A.|author2=Flanagan, T. |author3=Peled, T. |author4=Sutton, H.

Chalmers and Townsend trained delinquent girls, ages 10–16, on role taking skills over 15 sessions, following which the girls demonstrated improved understanding of interpersonal situations and problems, greater empathy, more acceptance of individual differences, and exhibited more prosociality in the classroom.&lt;ref name=[20] /&gt;  The overall picture, then, is that role taking training can help delinquent youth and youth with conduct disorders &lt;ref name=[21] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[42]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=C.E.|title=The effects of sociodramatic play on problem solving behavior among culturally disadvantaged preschool children|journal=Child Development|year=1974|volume=45|pages=920–927|doi=10.2307/1128077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[43]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grizenko|first=N.|author2=Zappitelli, M. |author3=Langevin, J.

===[[Autism]]===
Several researchers have argued that the deficits in the social lives, [[communication]] ability, and [[imagination]] of autistic children are a result of their deficiencies in role taking.&lt;ref name=[47]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=E. |author2=Tarbox, J. |author3=O'Hora, D. |author4=Noone1, S. |author5=Bergstrom, R. |title=Teaching children with autism a basic component skill of perspective-taking|journal=Behavioural Interventions|year=2011|volume=26|pages=50–66|doi=10.1002/bin.320}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that autistic children's inability to role take prevents them from developing a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=[48]&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Mechanical, behavioural and intentional understanding of picture stories in autistic children | journal = [[British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 113&amp;ndash;125 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-835X.1986.tb01003.x | date = June 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-835X.1986.tb01003.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/1986_BC_etal_PictureStoriesInASChildren.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, role taking has been described as the theory of mind in action.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Failing to role take and failing to develop a theory of mind may lead autistic children to use only their own understanding of a situation to predict others’ behaviour, resulting in deficits in social understanding.&lt;ref name=[48] /&gt;

In support, two studies found shortcomings in role-taking ability in autistic children in comparison to controls.&lt;ref name=[48] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[49]&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found that lower ability in role taking related significantly with the lower [[Social competence|social competency]] in autistic children.&lt;ref name=[50]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oswald|first=D.P.|author2=Oilendick, T.H. |title=Role taking and social competence in autism and mental retardation|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=1989|volume=19|pages=119–127|doi=10.1007/bf02212723}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the autistic children in the study could not focus concurrently on different cognitions required for successful role taking and proficient social interaction.&lt;ref name=[50] /&gt; More specifically, Dawson and Fernald found that conceptual role-taking related most to the social deficits and severity of autism experienced by autistic children, while affective role taking was related only to the severity of autism.&lt;ref name=[51]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawson|first=G.|author2=Fernald, M. |title=Perspective-taking ability and its relationship to the social behavior of autistic children|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=1987|volume=17|pages=487–499|doi=10.1007/bf01486965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The main criticism of Selman's role-taking theory is that it focuses too much on the effect of [[cognitive development]] on role-taking ability and [[social cognition]], thereby overlooking the non-cognitive factors that affect children's abilities in these domains.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  For instance, social experiences, such as disagreements between close friends, have been found to foster role taking skills and social cognitive growth.&lt;ref name=[52]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=J.|author2=Aboud, F.E. |title=The resolution of social conflict among friends|journal=Child Development|year=1985|volume=56|pages=1009–1017|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00173.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, parental influence amongst sibling conflicts matters, as mothers who act as mediators to help solve sibling disagreements have been found to promote role taking skills and social cognitive maturation.&lt;ref name=[53]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=J.|author2=Ross, H. |title=Training parents to mediate sibling disputes affects children’s negotiations and conflict understanding|journal=Child Development|year=2007|volume=78|pages=790–805|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01033.x|pmid=17517005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the priest and scholar|the town named in his honor|Segundo Montes, Morazán}}
{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}
'''Segundo Montes''', S.J. ([[Valladolid]], [[Spain]], May 15, 1933 – [[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]], November 16, 1989) was a [[scholar]], [[philosopher]], [[educator]], [[sociologist]] and [[Jesuit]] [[priest]]. He was one of the victims of the [[1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador]].

==Biography==
Segundo Montes grew up in [[Valladolid]], [[Spain]], where he also went to secondary school until 1950. On August 15, 1950, he entered the [[novitiate]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Orduña]]. After a year there, he moved to [[Santa Tecla, El Salvador|Santa Tecla]] in El Salvador under the mentorship of [[Miguel Elizondo]], who described him as an adolescent who hit the football so hard against the wall of the [[Iglesia El Carmen]] that he rattled the roof tiles.

When he fulfilled his studies in the novitiate in 1952, he followed the steps of other [[Jesuit]] students in [[Central America]] and moved to [[Quito]] to study [[classics|classical]] [[humanities]] at the Catholic University. In 1954, he began studies in philosophy, fulfilling his [[licenciatura]] (licenciate) in 1957. He then returned to San Salvador to teach at the school [[Externado San José]]. In 1960, he returned to university to study [[theology]]. He started in [[Oña]], where he lived for a year. He later moved to [[Innsbruck]], where he completed the three remaining years of studies. He was ordained a priest July 25, 1963. He returned to Externado San José as a teacher and was naturalised as a Salvadoran citizen.

Segundo Montes spent most of his time in the school Externado San José or in [[Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas"]] (UCA). He worked for two periods in Externado; from 1957 to 1960 and 1966 to 1976. He taught physics for many years, and he was responsible for the laboratories in the school. He was a Prefect of Discipline and Administrative Director. In between 1973 and 1976, he was [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of Externado San José, which was precisely a moment when the school was going through a deep identity crisis. The consequences of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and the [[Episcopal Conference of Medellín]] had made Externado San José express a [[Option for the poor|preference for the poor]] and to prioritize education that contributed to modify the social differences in El Salvador. This sort of discourse was not well received by the Salvadoran [[elite]]s, who had been traditionally served by Externado San José. Segundo Montes handled this crisis in a constructive way. He was very popular among students and he had many friends. This changed, however, as the political environment in El Salvador became more polarized later in the 1970s. He was not singled out in [[propaganda|propagandistic]] government pamphlets against critical intellectuals until towards the end of his life, when his name started figuring in the lists of Jesuits who were accused of being revolutionaries. His name was commonly the third one after [[Ignacio Ellacuría]] and [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]].

Gradually Segundo Montes started assuming more responsibilities in UCA as a lecturer in social sciences. For a period, he worked as a [[Dean (education)|Dean]] in the [[Faculty (university)|Faculty]] of [[Natural Sciences]]. To prepare himself for [[academia]], he travelled to [[Spain]], and in 1978 he completed a [[PhD]] in [[Social Anthropology]] in [[Universidad Complutense]] in [[Madrid]]. His [[dissertation]] was about "[[compadrazgo]]" relationships in El Salvador. His [[field work]] included interviews that he performed on weekends in the western part of the country.

He returned to teach [[Sociology]] in UCA, and starting in 1980, he was the head of the Department of Political Sciences and Sociology. Between 1978 and 1982, he was a member of the editorial board in the [[academic journal]] ''[[Estudios Centroamericanos]]'' (ECA). He was also a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Boletín de Ciencias Económicas y Sociales]]'' and the journal ''[[Realidad Económico Social]]''. He was a regular contributor to these journals. He also gave many lectures for national institutes, colleges, worker's unions, cooperatives and political parties. He was also a member of the board of directors in UCA. He headed the team of [[lawyer]]s who put together UCA's law study program. Beginning in 1984, he headed the [[research]] project on Salvadoran refugees. Toward the end of the 1980s, he was the managing director of the human rights institution he founded: [[Instituto de Derechos Humanos de la UCA]] (IDHUCA), and before his death, he was preparing the program for the [[master's degree]] in sociology.

A prolific writer, Segundo Montes left behind a series of articles and books. From 1982 and onwards he wrote at least one book a year. He wrote mostly in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and so far none of his works originally in Spanish have been translated to [[English language|English]]. However, his research on refugees, displaced people and [[human rights]] made him well-known internationally. He visited [[Washington, D.C.]], on repeated occasions, to testify in the corresponding committees in the [[United States Congress]], to defend the rights of Salvadoran refugees. His last trip to Washington was in early November 1989. In one of the halls of Congress, the organisation [[CARECEN]] (an organisation for the assistance of refugees) granted him a prize for defending the rights of Salvadorans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Biografía Segundo Montes|curly=|url=http://www.uca.edu.sv/martires/segundob.html|work=[[Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas"]]|year=1992|accessdate=25 April 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social anthropology ==

Segundo Montes did research and wrote on [[social stratification]], [[land ownership]], the possibilities for democracy and the military. His work on these issues is still a dominant influence on the theoretical frameworks employed by researchers to analyse Salvadoran society. His work is referenced in studies of [[power distribution]] and the effects of emigration on Salvadoran society. His published articles included an analysis of economic, political, and other motives for Salvadoran emigration to the United States. It addressed claims by the United States government that Salvadoran immigrants were economic refugees who therefore did not qualify for [[political asylum]].&lt;ref name="jrs"&gt;Segundo Montes (1988). "Migration to the United States as an Index of the Intensifying Social and Political Crises in El Salvador", ''Journal of Refugee Studies'' 1988 1:107–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political implications of Montes' commitment to his ideas met strong opposition from the [[Conservatism|conservative]] religious and political forces in El Salvador. This opposition led to Montes' murder by the [[Salvadoran Army]] in 1989 at his residence in UCA along with five other fellow Jesuit priests (among them [[Ignacio Ellacuría]] and [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]]) and two employees. Their murders marked a turning point in the [[Salvadoran civil war]] (see [[History of El Salvador]]). It increased international pressures on the Salvadoran government to sign the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]] with the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s.

==Biography==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Adi Shankara]] - [[Raja Ravi Varma]] painting]]
Sengaku Mayeda was born on 1 April 1931 at [[Nagoya]], in the prefecture of [[Aichi]], in Japan.&lt;ref name="Embassy Bio" /&gt; He did his pre graduate studies at the College of General Education, in Tokyo and graduated with BA from the Department of Indian Philosophy and Buddhist Studies, Faculty of Letters, [[University of Tokyo]], in 1955.

Shiing-Shen Chern spent nearly a decade at the [[University of Chicago]] before moving to [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he co-founded the world-renowned [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] in 1982 and was the institute's founding director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/history|title=MSRI|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In memory of Shiing-Shen Chern, the [[International Mathematical Union]] established the [[Chern Medal]] in 2010 to recognize "an individual whose accomplishments warrant the highest level of recognition for outstanding achievements in the field of mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/chern/details/|title=International Mathematical Union (IMU): Details|last=the_technician|website=www.mathunion.org|access-date=2017-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825071850/http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/chern/details|archivedate=August 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early years in China ===
Chern was born in Xiushui County ([[:zh:秀水縣|秀水縣]]), [[Jiaxing]], in [[Zhejiang]] province. The year after his birth, China changed its regime from the [[Qing Dynasty]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. He graduated from Xiushui Middle School (秀水中學) and subsequently moved to [[Tianjin]] in 1922 to accompany his father. In 1926, after spending four years in Tianjin, Chern graduated from Fulun High School ([[:zh:扶輪中學|扶輪中學]]).&lt;ref name="Chern Tianjin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jiaxing.gov.cn/art/2008/10/28/art_93_1125.html |title=Shiing-Shen Chern |publisher=Jiaxing Culture |accessdate=Aug 22, 2010 |language=zh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725045157/http://www.jiaxing.gov.cn/art/2008/10/28/art_93_1125.html |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 15, Chern entered the Faculty of Sciences of the [[Nankai University]] in Tianjin, but had problems at the laboratory, so he studied mathematics, instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=72|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chern graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At Nankai, Chern's mentor was mathematician [[Jiang Lifu]], and Chern was also heavily influenced by the physicist [[Rao Yutai]], considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern Chinese [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

Chern went to [[Beiping]] (now Beijing) to work at the [[Tsinghua University]] Department of Mathematics as a teaching assistant. At the same time he also registered at Tsinghua Graduate School as a student. He studied [[projective differential geometry]] under [[Sun Guangyuan]], a [[University of Chicago]]-trained geometer and [[logician]] who was also from Zhejiang. Sun is another mentor of Chern who is considered a founder of modern Chinese mathematics. In 1932, Chern published his first research article in the Tsing Hua University Journal. In the summer of 1934, Chern graduated from Tsinghua with a master's degree, the first ever master's degree in mathematics issued in China.&lt;ref name="Chern Tianjin"/&gt;

[[Yang Chen-Ning]]'s father—[[Yang Ko-Chuen]], another Chicago-trained professor at Tsinghua, but specialising in [[algebra]], also taught Chern. At the same time, Chern was Chen-Ning Yang's teacher of undergraduate maths at Tsinghua. At Tsinghua, [[Hua Luogeng]], also a mathematician, was Chern's colleague and roommate.

In 1932, [[Wilhelm Blaschke]] from the University of Hamburg visited Tsinghua and was impressed by Chern and his research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A mathematician and his mathematical work: selected papers of S. S. Chern|editor=Chern, S. S.|editor2=Tian, G.|editor3=Li, Peter|year=1996|pages=48–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOfSa0sfJr0C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Europe ===
In 1934, Chern received a scholarship to study in the United States, but he wanted to study under well-known geometer Wilhelm Blaschke.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Co-funded by Tsing Hua and the Chinese Foundation of Culture and Education, Chern went to continue his study in mathematics in Germany with a scholarship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chern studied at the [[University of Hamburg]] and worked under Blaschke's guidance first on the geometry of webs then on the Cartan-[[Erich Kähler|Kähler]] theory. He obtained his ''Dr. rer.nat.'' (''[[Doctor of Science]]'', which is equivalent to PhD) degree in February, 1936.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Blaschke recommended Chern to study in Paris.

It was at this time that he had to choose between the career of algebra in Germany under [[Emil Artin]], and the career of geometry in France under [[Élie Cartan|Élie-Joseph Cartan]]. Chern was tempted by what he called the "organizational beauty" of Emil Artin's algebra, but in the end, he decided to go to France in September 1936.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=73|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent one year at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris.

In August 1936, Chern watched the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Berlin together with [[Hua Luogeng]] who paid Chern a brief visit. During that time, Hua was studying at the University of Cambridge in Britain.

In the summer of 1937, Chern accepted the invitation of Tsing Hua's University and returned to China.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was promoted to professor of mathematics at Tsing Hua. However, in August, the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] (near Beijing) happened and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] started, Tsing Hua was forced to move away from Beijing to west China.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=74|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three universities including Peking University, Tsing Hua, and Nankai formed the [[National Southwestern Associated University]] (NSAU), and relocated to [[Kunming]], Yunnan province. Chern never reached Beijing. In the same year, [[Hua Luogeng]] was promoted to professor of mathematics at Tsinghua.

In 1939, Chern married Shih-Ning Cheng, and the couple had two children by the names of Paul and May.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Short stay in the United States ===
In July 1943, Chern went to the United States, and worked at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] on [[characteristic class]]es in differential geometry. Shortly afterwards, he was invited by [[Solomon Lefschetz]] to be an editor of ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== First return to China ===
Chern returned to Shanghai in 1945 to help found the Institute of Mathematics of the [[Academia Sinica]], which was later moved to [[Nanking]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (then-capital of the Republic of China). Chern was the acting president of the institute. [[Wu Wenjun]] was Chern's graduate student at the institute.

In 1948, Chern was elected one of the first academicians of the Academia Sinica. He was the youngest academician elected (at age 37).

=== The United States ===
By the end of 1948, Chern returned to the United States because of the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He then returned to the IAS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1949, Chern became professor of mathematics at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Coincidentally, [[Ernest Preston Lane]], former Chair at UChicago Department of Mathematics, was the doctoral advisor of Chern's undergraduate mentor at Tsinghua—[[Sun Guangyuan]].

Chern moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1960.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He worked and stayed there until he became an emeritus professor in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Chern became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he was elected member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Chern Berkeley"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/12/06_chern.shtml |title = Renowned mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern, who revitalized the study of geometry, has died at 93 in Tianjin, China |format=shtml |date = December 6, 2004 |author = Robert Sanders, Media Relations |publisher = [[University of California, Berkeley|UC, Berkeley]] |accessdate = Aug 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Chern was a vice-president of [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS).

Chern retired from Berkeley in 1981. He founded the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI) in 1981 and served as the director until 1984. Afterward he became the honorary director of the institute. MSRI now is one of the largest and most prominent mathematical institutes in the world.&lt;ref name="Chern Berkeley"/&gt; [[Shing-Tung Yau]] was one of his PhD students during this period.

=== Short visits to China ===
The [[Shanghai Communiqué]] was issued by the United States and the People's Republic of China on February 27, 1972. The relationship between these two nations started to normalise, and American citizens were allowed to visit P.R.China. In September 1972, Chern visited Beijing with his wife.
During this period of time, Chern visited China 25 times, of which 14 were to his home province Zhejiang.

Chern founded the Nankai Institute for Mathematics (NKIM) at his alma mater Nankai in Tianjin. The institute was formally established in 1984 and fully opened in October 17, 1985. NKIM was renamed the [[Chern Institute of Mathematics]] in 2004 after Chern's death.

=== Final years and death ===
Based on Chern's advice, a mathematical research center was established in [[Taipei]], Taiwan, whose co-operational partners are [[National Taiwan University]], [[National Tsing Hua University]] and the Sinica Academia Institute of Mathematics.&lt;ref name="Chern TW"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mathland.idv.tw/history/chen.html |title=陳省身 (Shiing-Shen Chern) |publisher=mathland.idv.tw |accessdate=Aug 22, 2010 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chern was also a director and advisor of the [[Center of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University|Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University]] in [[Hangzhou]], Zhejiang.

From 2000 to his death, Chern lived in Tianjin, China. Chern died of heart failure at his home in Tianjin in 2004 at age 93.

==Research==
Chern's work extends over all the classic fields of differential geometry. It includes areas currently fashionable (the [[Chern–Simons theory]] arising from a 1974 paper written jointly with [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]]), perennial (the [[Chern–Weil theory]] linking [[curvature]] invariants to [[characteristic class]]es from 1944, after the [[Carl B. Allendoerfer|Allendoerfer]]&amp;ndash;[[André Weil|Weil]] paper of 1943 on the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]), the foundational ([[Chern class]]es), and some areas such as [[projective differential geometry]] and [[web (mathematics)|web]]s that have a lower profile. He published results in [[integral geometry]], [[value distribution theory of holomorphic functions]], and [[minimal submanifold]]s.

He was a follower of [[Élie Cartan]], working on the '[[theory of equivalence]]' in his time in China from 1937 to 1943, in relative isolation. In 1954 he published his own treatment of the [[pseudogroup]] problem that is in effect the touchstone of Cartan's geometric theory.  He used the [[moving frame]] method with success only matched by its inventor; he preferred in [[complex manifold]] theory to stay with the geometry, rather than follow the [[potential theory]].  Indeed, one of his books is entitled "Complex Manifolds without Potential Theory".  In the last years of his life, he advocated the study of [[Finsler geometry]], writing several books and articles on the subject.

==Family==
His wife, Shih-ning Cheng ({{zh|c=鄭士寧|p=Zheng Shining}}), whom he married in 1939, died in 2000. He also had a daughter, May Chu ({{zh|c=陳璞|p=Chen Pu}}), wife of the physicist [[Chu Ching-wu]], and a son named Paul ({{zh|陳伯龍|p=Chen Bolong}}).

==Transliteration and pronunciation==
Chern's surname is a common Chinese surname which is now usually spelt [[Chen (surname)|Chen]]. The unusual spelling "Chern" is a [[transliteration]] in the old [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] (GR) [[romanization]] for [[Mandarin Chinese]] used in the early twentieth-century China. It uses special spelling rules to indicate different tones of Mandarin, which is a [[tonal language]] with four tones.  The silent ''r'' in "Chern" indicates a [[Standard Mandarin#Tones|second-tone]] syllable, written "Chén" in [[pinyin]] but in practice often written by non-Chinese without the tonal mark.   In GR the spelling of his given name "Shiing-Shen" indicates a third tone for ''Shiing'' and a first tone for ''Shen'', which are equivalent to the syllables "Xǐngshēn" in [[pinyin]].

In English, Chern pronounced his name "Churn" ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ɜr|n}}), and this pronunciation is now universally accepted among English-speaking mathematicians and physicists.

It is edited by Ari Schulman, having previously been edited by co-founders Eric Cohen and Adam Keiper.

The journal’s name is taken from [[Francis Bacon]]’s utopian novella ''[[New Atlantis]]'', which the journal’s editors describe as a "fable of a society living with the benefits and challenges of advanced science and technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/about/why-we-are-called-the-new-atlantis|title=Why We Are Called ''The New Atlantis''|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in the inaugural issue states that the aim of the journal is "to help us avoid the extremes of euphoria and despair that new technologies too often arouse; and to help us judge when mobilizing our technological prowess is sensible or necessary, and when the preservation of things that count requires limiting the kinds of technological power that would lessen, cheapen, or ultimately destroy us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-new-politics-of-technology|title=The New Politics of Technology|last=Cohen|first=Eric|work=The New Atlantis |date=Spring 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[National Review]]'', editor Adam Keiper described ''The New Atlantis'' as being written from a "particularly American and [[conservative]] way of thinking about both the blessings and the burdens of modern science and technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Keiper|first=Adam|title=The New Atlantis Turns Ten|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/348857/new-atlantis-turns-ten-adam-keiper|newspaper=The Corner|date=May 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Atlantis'' authors and bioethicists publishing in other journals have also similarly referred to ''The New Atlantis'' as being written from a social conservative stance which utilizes religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-paradox-of-conservative-bioethics | title=The Paradox of Conservative Bioethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/st-francis-christian-love-and-the-biotechnological-future | title=St. Francis, Christian Love, and the Biotechnological Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings"/&gt;

==Subjects==
''The New Atlantis'' tends to publish views in favor of technological innovation but wary of certain avenues of development. For example, the journal has generally advocated nuclear energy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Energy|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/nuclear-energy|accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; space exploration and development through public-private partnerships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simberg|first=Rand|title=In Search of a Conservative Space Policy|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/in-search-of-a-conservative-space-policy|work=The New Atlantis|date=Fall 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including manned missions to Mars;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zubrin|first=Robert|title=The Human Explorer|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-human-explorer|work=The New Atlantis|date=Winter 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; biofuels;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biofuels|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/biofuels|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and genetically modified foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adler|first=Jonathan|title=How Not to Label Biotech Foods|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/how-not-to-label-biotech-foods|publisher=The New Atlantis|date=Summer 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it has expressed ambivalent or critical views about developments in [[synthetic biology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthetic biology|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/synthetic-biology|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and military technologies like [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer|first=P.W.|title=Military Robots and the Laws of War|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/military-robots-and-the-laws-of-war|publisher=The New Atlantis|date=Winter 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ofek|first=Hillel|title=The Tortured Logic of Obama's Drone War|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-tortured-logic-of-obamas-drone-war|work=The New Atlantis|date=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chemical weapons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Jonathan B.|title=The Future of Chemical Weapons|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-future-of-chemical-weapons|publisher=The New Atlantis|date=Fall 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cyberwarfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford|first=Christopher A.|title=The Trouble With Cyber Arms Control|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-trouble-with-cyber-arms-control|date=Fall 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles often explore policy questions on these and other issues, sometimes advocating particular policy outcomes, especially on health care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health care|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/health-care|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; environmental management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentalism|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/environmentalism|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/energy|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal has published widely on [[bioethics]], including issues such as [[stem cell research]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stem cell research|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/stem-cell-research|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[assisted reproduction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assisted reproductive technologies|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/assisted-reproductive-technologies|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cloning]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloning|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/cloning|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[assisted suicide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End of life|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/end-of-life|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[organ donation|organ and tissue donation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organ transplantation|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/organ-transplantation|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the purported [[Vaccine controversies|link between vaccines and autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicol|first=Caitrin|title=Shot in the Dark|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shot-in-the-dark|work=The New Atlantis|date=Fall 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[informed consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schulman|first=Ari N.|title=What is the Body Worth?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/what-is-the-body-worth|publisher=The New Atlantis|date=Spring 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles on these issues often highlight the potential for dangerous or degrading developments, including concerns over [[human dignity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human dignity|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/human-dignity|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many articles examining [[human enhancement]],&lt;ref name="thenewatlantis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhancement|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/enhancement|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[life extension]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agelessness|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/agelessness|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and historical precedents for abuse in [[eugenics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical eugenics|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/eugenics-historical|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[population control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary eugenics|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/eugenics-contemporary|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal also features broader philosophical reflections on science and technology, and tends to be skeptical of what its authors consider to be speculative overreach common in popular discussions. Examples include articles that have defended the existence of [[free will]] in light of developments in [[neuroscience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tallis|first=Raymond|title=How Can I Possibly Be Free?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/how-can-i-possibly-be-free|publisher=The New Atlantis|date=Summer 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioned the wisdom of using [[neuroimaging|brain scans]] in courtrooms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snead|first=Carter|title=Neuroimaging and Capital Punishment|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/neuroimaging-and-capital-punishment|publisher=The New Atlantis|date=Winter 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described how growing knowledge of [[epigenetics]] has undermined common claims about [[genetic determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbott |first=Stephen L. |title=Getting Over the Code Delusion |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/getting-over-the-code-delusion |publisher=The New Atlantis |date=Summer 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004025933/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/getting-over-the-code-delusion |archivedate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the journal has sometimes aired [[libertarianism|libertarian]] views about [[human enhancement]] and [[transhumanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=Ronald|title=The Case for Enhancing People|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-case-for-enhancing-people|publisher=The New Atlantis|date=Summer 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; its contributors generally tend to question whether technologies like [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artificial intelligence|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/artificial-intelligence|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friendly ai|"friendly" artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problem with 'Friendly' Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-problem-with-friendly-artificial-intelligence|publisher=The New Atlantis|author1=Keiper, Adam  |author2=Schulman, Ari N. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=Summer 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genetic enhancement]]&lt;ref name="thenewatlantis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic engineering|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/topic/genetic-engineering|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are possible or desirable.

The journal has also published widely on the interpersonal effects of the Internet and digital technology.

==Reception==
Writing for the National Review in a 2003 column, the conservative author Stanley Kurtz described ''The New Atlantis'' as influential on thinking about science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtz |first=Stanley |title=Brave New World of Dna? |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/64904/brave-new-world-dna/stanley-kurtz |newspaper=The Corner |date=May 29, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303042653/http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/64904/brave-new-world-dna/stanley-kurtz |archivedate=March 3, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Jonathan D.|title=Biotechnology and the New Right: Neoconservatism's Red Menace|journal=American Journal of Bioethics|date=October 2007|volume=7|issue=10|url=http://www.bioethics.net/articles/biotechnology-and-the-new-right-neoconservatisms-red-menace/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard John Neuhaus]], late editor of the conservative journal ''[[First Things]]'', wrote that ''The New Atlantis'' is "as good a publication as there is for the intelligent exploration of questions in bioethics and projections—promising, ominous, and fantastical—about the human future,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neuhaus|first=Richard John|title=A number of readers have..|url=http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2005/10/a-number-of-readers-have|newspaper=On the Square|date=October 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a writer in ''[[The American Conservative]]'' described the journal as a source "of fresh ideas on the Right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bramwell|first=Austin|title=Defining Conservatism Down|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/defining-conservatism-down/|newspaper=The American Conservative|date=August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[National Review]]'' columnist [[Jonah Goldberg]] described ''The New Atlantis'' as "a new and interesting magazine" that "seems to be trying to carve out the space for the government to stop the more offensive aspects of biotechnology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Jonah|title=Ones &amp; Zeroes Have Consequences|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/207235/ones-zeroes-have-consequences/jonah-goldberg#|newspaper=National Review|date=June 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the liberal bioethicist [[Jonathan D. Moreno]] has said that the journal offers "a very dark vision" about science and technology, but that it "makes an important point about the need to worry about the ends as well as means in science"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Point Counterpoint|journal=Science|date=2 November 2007|volume=318|issue=5851|pages=725|doi=10.1126/science.318.5851.725d}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that its "writers were young, smart, and had a good understanding of the political process and the making of public policy."&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Sam|title=Progress in Bioethics: Science, Policy, and Politics|year=2010|publisher=M.I.T. Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262517423|author2=Jonathan D. Moreno |editor=Sam Berger and Jonathan D. Moreno|page=xviii|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bioethicist [[Ruth Macklin]] criticized ''The New Atlantis'' as representative of a conservative movement in bioethics that is "mean-spirited, mystical, and emotional" and that "claims insight into ultimate truth yet disavows reason."&lt;ref name="Hastings"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macklin|first=Ruth|title=The New Conservatives in Bioethics: Who Are They and What Do They Seek?|journal=The Hastings Center Report|date=January–February 2006|volume=36|issue=1|pages=34–43|url=http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Publications/HCR/Detail.aspx?id=2890|doi=10.1353/hcr.2006.0013|pmid=16544839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal has particularly gained a reputation among the [[transhumanist]] movement for its criticism of human enhancement. [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]], a [[Techno-progressivism|techno-progressivist]] and at times director of organizations such as the [[World Transhumanist Association]] and the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], notes that the journal "has published influential attacks on artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, biotechnology, reproductive technology, and life extension." [[Natasha Vita-More]] has described it as a "journal known as a ring of bioconservatives bent on opposing the cyberculture," while the [[Extropy Institute]] has called it "a high-powered rallying point for the neo-Luddites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Vital Progress Summit|url=http://www.extropy.org/summitabout.htm|publisher=Extropy Institute|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prayer Wheels''' (Tibetan: ''mani ´khor lo'') are widely used in Tibet and areas where [[Tibetan culture]] is predominant.

==Hand prayer wheel==
The most common form of these objects are hand prayer wheels (Tibetan ''ma ni lag ´khor'' ) which consist of a metal cylinder and a handle which also serves as axis around which the cylinder can revolve, being set in motion by a small weight which is attached to it by a string or chain. The cylinder contains a paper roll on which Buddhist texts are printed. When the prayer wheel is spun in prayer, the mantras inside become potent with the person's intent.

==Other forms of prayer wheels==
Apart from hand prayer wheels there exist large size fixed prayer wheels which are often aligned around Buddhist shrines and are set in motion by pilgrims who circum-ambulate the building in a clockwise direction. Prayer wheels larger than human size are to be seen in separate rooms in [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temples and can also be set in motion by pilgrims. With the help of a small bell the number of revolutions can be counted. The cylinders of fixed prayer wheels are often inscribed with the formula “[[Om mani padme hum]]” (meaning “jewel in the lotus”) in ornamental Lantsa ([[Ranjana script|Ranjana]]) letters. 
Prayer wheels (perhaps more appropriately called “prayer mills”) which are set in motion by wind or water power are also known. They are used for prayer of Tibetan festival.

==Origin of prayer wheels==
Some experts believe that the prayer wheels evolved from revolving octagonal Chinese bookcases which  were first recorded in the 9th century CE. This assumption is supported by the existence of octagonal prayer wheels in [[Mongolia]].

The '''Tomb of Min Ziqian''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|闵|子|骞|墓}}|p=Mǐn Zǐqiān Mù}}) is a memorial to [[Min Sun]] ([[courtesy name]] Ziqian, 536 BCE-?&lt;ref name=analects&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wqym0cOd33MC&amp;pg=PA201 The Analects of Confucius By Confucius, Chichung Huang]&lt;/ref&gt;), a disciple of [[Confucius]] and the fourth of the [[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars|24 Confucian paragons of filial piety]].&lt;ref name=24paragons&gt;[http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~asia/24ParagonsFilialPiety.html The Twenty-Four Paragons of Filial Piety]&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial is located in [[Jinan]], the capital of [[Shandong]] Province, China. 
 
While the memorial is designed as a classical Confucian tomb with an ancestral temple, a [[spirit way]], and a burial mound, the actual burial place of Min Sun is not known.&lt;ref name=xinhua&gt;[http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.sd.xinhua.org/sdsq/2006-03/30/content_6610582.htm Min Ziqian: Shandong's Great Filial Son {{zh icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Only some of Min Sun's clothes may have been buried at the Jinan site.&lt;ref name=xinhua /&gt; Other places in [[Jiangsu]], [[Henan]], and [[Anhui]] also have tombs erected to commemorate Min Sun.&lt;ref name=xinhua /&gt;

[[Image:Tomb of min ziqian jinan spirit way 2009 07.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Spirit Way]] leading to the burial mound]]

The site also featured more than 30 old trees and more than 10 historical stone sculptures. The memorial sustained significant damage during the Cultural Revolution,&lt;ref name=sina /&gt;&lt;ref name=jnfdc.gov /&gt; when the ancestral hall was torn down, masonry was destroyed, and trees were cut down.&lt;ref name=sina /&gt; In September 1979, the memorial was identified as the first of Jinan's key historical sites deserving protection. At present, the site covers an area of only 60 (north–south) by 30 meters (east–west).&lt;ref name=jnfdc.gov /&gt; A project to restore the tomb began in 1999, but ran out of funds.&lt;ref name=jnwh.gov&gt;[http://www.jnwh.gov.cn/read.php%3FPid%3D495 Min Ziqian's tomb about to open after five-year renovation {{zh icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The tomb is located to the east of Min Ziqian Road, adjacent to the [[Jinan Baihua Park|Baihua Park]], formerly known as "[[Catkin]]s Park" in reference to the story about Min Ziqian's extraordinary [[filial piety]].

writer and philosopher, a leader of the Prussian Lithuanian national movement in [[Lithuania Minor]], and one of leaders of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical movement]] in [[East Prussia]].

==Biography==
The Storost family was for centuries living in [[East-Prussia]] and Wilhelm was born in the village [[Šilutė District Municipality|Jonaten]] ({{lang-lt|Jonaičiai}}), near [[Šilutė|Heydekrug]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. '''Wilhelm Storost''' was the name on his German passport, while '''Vilimas''' or '''Vilius Storostas'''&lt;!--Storostas su s jis pats vadinosi kaip nustatyta --&gt; was the literature Lithuanian form used by himself, his family, and other Lithuanians. "Vydūnas" was added to his surname as a pseudonym when he was about 40 years old. Storost was married to Klara Füllhase.

Storost was educated as teacher at the Präparandenanstalt in [[Pillkallen]] (1883–85) and at teacher seminar in [[Ragnit]] (1885–88). From 1888 to 1892 he was a teacher in Kinten (lit. Kintai), when he went to teach at a boys school in [[Tilsit]] until 1912 and taught German, French, English, Lithuanian and sports. In 1912 he left his teaching position in order to take up philosophical studies, which he took at the universities of [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]]. 1918/19 he taught Lithuanian at the Seminar for Oriental Languages in Berlin under the director [[Eduard Sachau]]. Back in Tilsit he dedicated himself to reestablishment of Lithuanian Culture, especially folks songs and rural traditions. He directed a choir and wrote songs as well as theater plays. From 1933 on he worked in Memel at the music school.

1932 he wrote a book ''Sieben Hundert Jahren Deutsch-Litauischer Beziehung'' (Seven Hundred Years of German-Lithuanian relations). His idea of understanding between folks groups did not please the Nazis and in 1933 the book was outlawed. 1938 he was shortly incarcerated, but because of protests released after two months.

Together with nearly all of the people of East Prussia he was expelled during Communist take-over and lived in a refugee camp for some time. He died in [[Detmold]], [[West Germany]]. His grand nephews, Jürgen Storost, recently explained, that Wilhelm Storost's answered his friend [[Viktor Falkenhahn]], that "his use of the pen name Vydunas was his chosen [[anthroposophic]] mission; that he did not want to be a "pavydūnas", but a "vydūnas" (one who wishes everyone everything good).
 
Vydūnas was active in the old Lithuanian pagan religion (see [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]]). However, he never declared the revival of the pagan religion as either his personal goal or a goal of Lithuanians, remaining a national leader but not a religious one. His moral influence transcended the confines of being a typical political leader or a writer at his time. He was compared by later biographers with national leaders in [[India]] of his time, such as [[Rabindranath Tagore]] or [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]] [[universalism]], not predefined with participating in any obligatory religious practice, was one of the leading ideas of his philosophy, and gained him later fame as a pioneer of both pagan revival and theosophy in [[Lithuania]].

Vydūnas was an ethical vegetarian, and wrote several essays about his ethical choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://animalrights.lt/pasisakymai-vydunas | title = Žymių žmonių pasisakymai apie gyvūnų išnaudojimą | publisher= Animal Rights Lithuania | accessdate=7 December 2008}} ''(in Lithuanian)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vydūnas was considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize by Lithuanian writers association.&lt;ref name=Bagonavicius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Laisvės ir literatūros hipostazės|journal=Mokslo Lietuva|year=2000|first=Arvydas|last=Genys|volume=|issue=4|url=http://ic.lms.lt/ml/206/laisves.htm|accessdate=7 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225452/http://ic.lms.lt/ml/206/laisves.htm|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vũ Trinh''' ({{lang-vi-hantu|武楨}}; 1759–1828) (pseudonames 萊山 and 蘭池漁者) was a well-known [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] in [[Tonkin]] and high-ranking [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] in both Le Trinh dynasty and Nguyen dynasty. Vũ Trinh was born in a noble family with many proficient Confucian scholars in Ngọc Quan hamlet, Lương Tài district, [[Bắc Ninh]]. His grandfather was [[Vũ Miên]]: Headmaster of [[Guozijian|Quốc Tử Giám]] and [[Grand chancellor (China)|Chancellor]]. He got title Giải nguyên (解元) ([[:vi:Giải nguyên|First laureate]]) in the interprovincial Confucian examination that was held every three years with small quantity of selected candidates when he was only 17, then became a mandarin. In his career path, at very young age (29 years old), he was promoted to be Vice [[Grand chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] (參知政事).

He declined the invitation of [[Ngô Thì Nhậm]], a great mandarin of Tay Son for a mandarin position. For this, he was mentioned in a poem written by Nguyễn Đề, stored in [[Qing dynasty]]'s Literature records:

'''次東山偶憶蘭溪漁者'''

東魯行車雨雪飛，

偶懷閒客釣魚磯。

二倫情誼心相合，

十載窮通命每違。

不審役形當世事，

何如拭目看時機。

首陽今日無人問，

也任夷齊採盡薇。

Along with being a mandarin, he was also a writer. His legacies were mostly written in Chinese.

{{wiktionary|wickedness|wicked}}
'''Wickedness''' is generally considered a synonym for [[evil]] or [[sin]]fulness.  Among theologians and philosophers, it has the [[Technical terminology|more specific meaning]] of evil committed [[Consciousness#In philosophy|consciously]] and of [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Ron |last= Rosenbaum |authorlink= Ron Rosenbaum | url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_spectator/2011/09/does_evil_exist_neuroscientists_say_no_.single.html | title= The End of Evil? | date= September 30, 2011 | publisher= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be considered the quality or state of being wicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wickedness|title=Definition of WICKEDNESS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term wickedness dates back to the 1300s and is derived from the words ''wicked'' and ''-ness''. Wicked is an extended form of the term wick meaning bad and is also associated with the Old English term ''wicca'' meaning wizard. There isn’t a corresponding verb to the term, but the term wretched is also associated with the term. The term -ness is a word forming element denoting action, quality or state and is typically added to an adjective or past participle to make it an abstract noun. It is an Old English term and also comes from the Proto-Germanic term ''in-assu'' and many other cognates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=wickedness|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As characterized by [[Martin Buber]] in his 1952 work ''Bilder von Gut und Böse'' (translated as ''Good and Evil: Two Interpretations''),&lt;!-- this is a quote of the characterization as opposed to a translation --&gt; "The first stage of evil is '[[sin]],' occasional [[wikt:directionlessness|directionlessness]]. Endless possibility can be overwhelming, leading man to grasp at anything, distracting and busying himself, in order to not have to make a real, committed choice. The second stage of evil is 'wickedness,' when caprice is embraced as a deformed substitute for [[will (philosophy)|genuine will]] and becomes characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Sarah |last= Scott| work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/buber/#SH2e | title= Martin Buber (1878—1965) | date= July 9, 2010 | publisher= [[University of Tennessee at Martin]] | issn= 2161-0002 &lt;!-- sic --&gt;| accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wickedness [[connotation|connotes]] [[wikt:blameworthiness|blameworthiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Garrath |last= Williams | work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/responsi/#H3 | title= Responsibility | date= March 9, 2009 | publisher= [[University of Tennessee at Martin]] | issn= 2161-0002 &lt;!-- sic --&gt;| accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wickedness and Power==
Throughout history power is typically seen to be a very dangerous and destructive element in people’s lives. It’s a canker to society or is wicked if you will. Some theorists believe that power itself is actually in fact morally neutral. It is the results of power that determine whether or not power is seen as good. The people in power are then also seen as not wicked in their nature, but rather the urgency for power and within the nature of it is what makes power seen as a wicked idea. Theorists believe that if men were the wicked ones in the equation then the solution to the issues at stake would be ethical improvement. In the end, it isn’t power or man that are wicked, but the results of power that cause it to be wicked.&lt;ref&gt;French, A. (1980). Thucydides and the Power Syndrome. Greece &amp; Rome, 27(1), 22-30. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2112/stable/642773&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==What Causes Someone to be Wicked==
There are two different types of wickedness that some people will argue. There is natural wickedness. This is the type of wickedness that is unpreventable such as earthquakes, tornadoes and other types of natural disasters. The second type of wickedness is moral wickedness. This type of wickedness is types of evil that are acted out by humans and can arguably be preventable. What causes the separation between the two is the response to both types of wickedness. During a natural disaster people tend to be sympathetic to the victims of the destruction. It’s this sympathy to the victims that classifies a natural disaster as a form of wickedness. In contrast, to moral wickedness where people will be sympathetic to the victim of the person who committed the wicked behavior. This distinguishes the person who committed the act as a wicked being. It is based on the modern consciousness of society that determines whether the act is considered wicked.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, Nancy (2010) Promoting and Producing Evil. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2094/lib/mccc/detail.action?docID=10447250&amp;p00=%22promoting+and+producing+evil%22&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy Metal and Wickedness==
Heavy Metal is a genre of music with lyrics that are dark and people consider to be satanic. It was introduced on Friday the 13th in February 1970 when Black Sabbath released Black Sabbath. Around this time period the Vietnam War was going on, the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy occurred, the death of Flower Power and the second Cold War was coming into play. These events influenced the lyrics of the songs that are considered heavy metal. While it may seem evil or a form of protest it is really up to interpretation over whether or not Heavy Metal is considered wicked and connected to the devil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Balmain, Collette. Drawmer, Lois (2009) Something Wicked This Way Comes. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2094/lib/mccc/detail.action?docID=10380355&amp;p00=%22something+wicked+this+way+comes%22&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wickedness and Witches==
It is believed that there are four different types of witches that occur within society. First there is the white witch, who is good with herbs and spices. The white witch is considered to be a type of good witch. Then there is the weak influencer. This type of witch uses their power to try to influence others, which can be considered both good and evil.Then there is the type of witch that projects evil onto others. This type of witch is the one that is considered to be wicked. Finally, there is the witch that springs from imagination. Depending on how the person who is imagining the witch sees the witch determines whether this witch is considered good or wicked. Some people speculate that we all are witches in the sense that we all influence people in some way, shape or form.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, E. (1976). Witches: Wise, Weak, or Wicked Women? Journal of Religion and Health, 15(2), 136-139. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2112/stable/27505341&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wickedness and Religion==
'''Buddhism'''

In the Buddhist religion, those who are wicked are sent to hell. This is typically seen as a Western idea, but it is visible in the Buddhist’s belief. There are 18 different hells and depending on the wicked behavior that is acted out determines which hell you will go to.

In the first hell whatever wicked behavior you have committed will be punished by forced nakedness, which is a horrendous punishment.

In the Burning Cauldron hell, those who have cooked meat are placed there.

In the Hell of Feces and Filth those who have eaten meat are detained here.

In the Hell of Cutting and Grinding if the person committed an act of taking a life they are placed here.

In the Freezing Hell those who did not keep feast days, didn’t do good deeds or didn’t follow the Buddhist way are placed here.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7199">'''William Thomas Valerio Fontaine''' (born '''William Thomas Fontaine'''; December 2, 1909&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; December 29, 1968) was an [[United States|American]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]]. Teaching at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1947 to 1967, he was an American Professor of philosophy in the [[Ivy League]]. He was [[African American]] and advocated for African American rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Early life and career ==
Fontaine was born in [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Pennsylvania]], an industrial town southwest of [[Philadelphia]]. His father worked in a steel mill on the [[Delaware River]]. Enrolling in [[Chester High School (Chester, Pennsylvania)|Chester High School]] at the age of 12, Fontaine graduated in the top third of his class. After his parents died in the 1930s, his aunt raised his younger siblings and funded their continued education.

In 1926 Fontaine enrolled in [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], a school about 30 miles west of Chester. He wrote poems and analytic essays for the school newspaper, in which he argued that African Americans needed to show "ability, aggressiveness, and cooperation" to succeed. He graduated first in his class in 1930.

Over the next six years, Fontaine taught Latin, history and government at Lincoln. He also pursued an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Philosophy from the nearby University of Pennsylvania, which he earned in 1932. He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Philosophy from Penn in 1936.

He worked as a professor of philosophy and history at [[Southern University]] in Louisiana from 1936 to 1942. Fontaine married an acquaintance from Philadelphia in 1936, Willabelle Hatton of [[Iva, South Carolina]]; they had two daughters, Jean and Vivian.

Fontaine returned to Penn in 1943 and audited graduate courses until 1946. Drafted during [[World War II]], he worked at [[Fort Holabird|Holabird Signal Depot]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. He taught basic education to illiterate soldiers.

Fontaine joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty in 1947 as a lecturer and was promoted to Assistant Professor two years later.

==Philosophy==
Influenced by [[emotivism|emotivist]] philosopher [[Charles Leslie Stevenson|C. L. Stevenson]], Fontaine called his own position a "modified ethical [[relativism]]". When a group desired a certain state of affairs, he argued, it might alter the attitudes fundamental to its ethical stance. For example, politicians offered employment to blacks during [[World War I]] not in order to achieve occupational racial equality, but to avert defeat by Germany. Blacks may not have been as interested in the latter, but they certainly were in the better jobs.

==Political views==
Raised in an unusually [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] household in Chester, Fontaine was a strong supporter of the [[New Deal]]. During the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] and later [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]] eras, Fontaine supported the presidential candidacy of socially liberal [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Governor of Minnesota|governor]] [[Harold Stassen]], who served as President of Penn from 1948 to 1953.
 
Fontaine was considerably more opposed to [[Communism]] than even to the [[racism]] in some Western democracies. As a result, he became a liberal [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] during the [[Cold War]]. He supported Presidents Truman, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], and [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] in their anti-Communist agendas. At the same time, he strongly supported the growing [[Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights]] movement.

Fontaine expounded his civil rights views in ''Reflections on Segregation, Desegregation, Power, and Morals'', published in 1967. While he supported racial equality, he argued that the growing [[Black Power]] movement contained the same intellectual defects that existed in white racism, in that it sought preferential treatment for blacks and the non-participation of whites in black life. Considered too unfocused by contemporaries, the text received no reviews until 40 years after its publication.

==Later life, travels, and Penn career==
Fontaine was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1949. After working only one half-time and two years of medical leave, he returned to his normal Penn position in 1955. He received an assistant professorship in 1956, tenure in 1957, and an associate professorship in 1963.

Interested in growing [[African nationalism]] in the era of [[decolonization]], Fontaine traveled worldwide to discuss [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] issues. In 1959, he attended [[Pope John XXIII]]’s address of thanks to those who promoted black culture. The next year, he traveled to [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]], where he celebrated the inauguration of his classmate, [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] as [[List of Governors-General of Nigeria|Governor General]]. Two years later, as secretary of the [[American Society of African Culture]], he attended a conference on [[socialism]] called by [[Senegal]]ese [[List of Presidents of Senegal|President]] [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]].

With the worsening of his tuberculosis, Fontaine finished ''Reflections'' in 1967 and went on indefinite medical leave. After being confined to an apartment for more than a year, he died on December 29, 1968.

==Legacy==
In his honor, the University of Pennsylvania established the Fontaine Fellowships in 1970, awarded to "provide the additional funds necessary to students from underrepresented minority groups to pursue full-time doctoral study".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1900s/fontaine_wm_t_v.html "William Thomas Valeria Fontaine (1909-1968)"], Penn Biographies, University Archives &amp; Record Center.&lt;/ref&gt;
