The '''Action of 14 April 1655''' took place at Porto Farina (now [[Ghar el-Melh]]) in northern [[Tunisia]], when an English fleet under [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] destroyed the vessels of several [[Barbary corsairs]]. It achieved little direct effect, although it was the first time that ships alone defeated shore fortifications.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Action==
Early in 1655, Blake sent a demand to the [[Bey of Tunis]] for the return of an English merchant ship and English prisoners, plus an indemnity and a future agreement but was refused. After sailing back and forth between [[Sardinia]], Tunis, and [[Sicily]] for nearly two months and sending the demands again, he arrived on 13 April at Porto Farina, where the Barbary ships had gathered for their intended voyage to the [[Dardanelles]] to help the Turks that season. The next day, his first division attacked the Barbary ships, boarding and burning them by 8 am, while his second division of larger ships attacked the forts, silencing them by 11 am. This was the first time that ships alone had defeated shore fortifications. English casualties were 25 killed and 40 wounded. The Bey still refused his demands, but Blake's attack helped the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in their battle against the Muslim states two months later at the [[Action of 21 June 1655]]. The Ottomans would improve Porto Farina's fortifications over the next decade.

[[File:Berlin - Bismarck-Nationaldenkmal1.jpg|thumb|Frontal view of the Bismarck Memorial]]
The '''Bismarck Memorial''' ({{lang-de|Bismarck-Nationaldenkmal}}) in the [[Großer Tiergarten|Tiergarten]] in [[Berlin]], is a prominent memorial [[statue]] dedicated to Prince [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Minister President of Prussia|Minister President]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the first [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] of the [[German Empire]]. It was sculpted by [[Reinhold Begas]]. It is one of 250 [[Bismarck monument|memorials to Bismarck]] worldwide.

This memorial in Berlin portrays Bismarck in his ceremonial garb as Chancellor standing above statues of:
*[[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], showing Germany's world power status at the end of the 19th century;
*[[Sigurd|Siegfried]], forging a sword to show Germany's strong industrial and military might; 
*[[Germania (personification)|Germania]] pinning underfoot a panther, symbolizing the suppression of discord and rebellion; 
*a [[sibyl]] reclining on a [[sphinx]] and reading the book of history.

The statue, along with the famous [[Berlin victory column]], were once located in front of the [[Reichstag building]] before they were moved in 1938 by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his project to recast Berlin as [[Welthauptstadt Germania]]. The statue weathered a marked amount of shrapnel damage during [[World War II]], but has survived largely intact to the present day. In fact, the move probably saved the monument from total destruction, as the old garden in front of the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] was completely obliterated in the war.

'''Chad''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Chad.ogg|tʃ|æ|d}}; {{lang-ar|تشاد}} {{transl|ar|Tashād}}; {{lang-fr|Tchad}} {{IPA-fr|tʃad|pron}}), officially the '''Republic of Chad''' ({{Lang-ar|جمهورية تشاد|links = no}} ''{{Transl|ar|Jumhūrīyat Tshād}}''; {{Lang-fr|République du Tchad|links = no}} {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "Republic of the Chad"), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[North Africa|north]]-[[central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Libya]] to the north, [[Sudan]] to the east, the [[Central African Republic]] to the south, [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]] to the southwest, and [[Niger]] to the west. It is the fifth largest country in Africa and the second-largest in Central Africa in terms of area.

Chad has several regions: a [[desert]] zone in the north, an arid [[Sahel]]ian belt in the centre and a more fertile [[Sudanian Savanna]] zone in the south. [[Lake Chad]], after which the country is named, is the largest [[wetland]] in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. The capital [[N'Djamena]] is the largest [[List of cities in Chad|city]].  Chad's official languages are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]]. Chad is home to over 200 different [[List of ethnic groups in Chad|ethnic]] and [[Languages of Chad|linguistic groups]]. The most popular religion of Chad is [[Islam in Chad|Islam]] (at 55%), followed by [[Christianity in Chad|Christianity]] (at 40%).

Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region. [[France]] conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of [[François Tombalbaye]]. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting [[The Tombalbaye Regime#Rebellion in Chad|civil war]] in 1965. In 1979 [[Transitional Government of National Unity|the rebels]] conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until [[Hissène Habré]] defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general [[Idriss Déby]]. Since 2003 the [[War in Darfur|Darfur crisis]] in Sudan has spilt over the border and [[Chadian Civil War (2005–2010)|destabilised the nation]], with hundreds of thousands of [[Sudanese refugees]] living in and around camps in eastern Chad. An uneven inclusion into the global political economy as a site for colonial resource extraction (primarily cotton and crude oil), a global economic system that does not promote nor encourage the development of Chadian industrialization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=347BAAAAIAAJ|title=Poverty and neoliberalism: persistence and reproduction in the global south|year=2007|last=Bush|first=Ray|isbn=9780745319605}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the failure to support local agricultural production has meant that the majority of Chadians live in daily uncertainty and hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_5HjgjpmmUC|title=Maldevelopment: Anatomy of a Global Failure|publisher=[[United Nations University Press]]|last=Amin|first=Samir|year=1990|isbn=9780862329310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBXF3IIcBwYC|title=Looting Africa: The Economics of Exploitation|last=Bond|first=Patrick|publisher=[[Zed Books]]|year=2006|isbn=9781842778111}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While many political parties are active, power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]]. Chad remains plagued by [[political violence]] and recurrent attempted [[coup d'état|coups d'état]]. 
Since 2003, [[petroleum|crude oil]] has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional [[cotton]] industry.

== History ==
{{main|History of Chad}}

In the 7th millennium BC, ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement, and the region experienced a strong population increase. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in Chad, mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collelo"&gt;S. Collelo, ''Chad''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Group of Kanem-Bu warriors.jpg|thumb|Group of Kanem-Bu warriors. The [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] controlled almost all of what is today Chad.|left]]

For more than 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and sedentary people. The region became a crossroads of civilizations. The earliest of these were the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], descendants of the Hyksos who conquered Ancient Egypt known for skills in designing weapons and artifacts, they are also known for their oral histories. After a century of rule, the Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]],&lt;ref name=Lange88&gt;D. Lange 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, [[Sultanate of Bagirmi]] and [[Wadai Empire]] emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region.&lt;ref name="Collelo"/&gt; These states, at least tacitly [[Islam in Africa|Muslim]], never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to [[Arab slave trade|raid for slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |title=Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=29 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |archivedate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chadian soldier of WWII.jpg|thumb|left|A Chadian soldier fighting for [[Free French Forces|Free France]] during [[World War II]]. The Free French Forces included 15,000 soldiers from Chad.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;]]

French colonial expansion led to the creation of the {{lang|fr|Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad}} in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8, 309&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonial Chad|French rule in Chad]] was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation compared to other French colonies.&lt;ref name="Decalo, pp. 8–9"&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the [[Sara people|Sara]] of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.&lt;ref name="Collelo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Decalo, pp. 8–9"/&gt;

After [[World War II]], France granted Chad the status of [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territory]] and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and a [[National Assembly (Chad)|Chadian assembly]]. The largest political party was the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] (PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, [[Sara people|Sara]] [[François Tombalbaye]], as its first [[Heads of state of Chad|president]].&lt;ref name="Collelo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT)]], began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity|civil war]]. Tombalbaye was [[1975 Chadian coup d'état|overthrown and killed]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917376,00.html "Death of a Dictator"], ''Time'', (28 April 1975). Accessed on 3 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by [[Hissène Habré]] took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

The disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France's position in the country. [[Libya]] moved to fill the power vacuum and became [[Chadian-Libyan conflict|involved in Chad's civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Libya's adventure [[Toyota War|ended in disaster]] in 1987; the French-supported president, [[Hissène Habré]], evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Pollack|Pollack, Kenneth M.]] (2002); ''Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948–1991''. Lincoln: [[University of Nebraska Press]]. {{ISBN|0-8032-3733-2}}, pp. 391–397&lt;/ref&gt;

Habré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence with thousands of people estimated to have been killed under his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Macedo, Stephen (2006); ''Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes Under International Law''. University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|0-8122-1950-3}}, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR20/004/2001/en "Chad: the Habré Legacy"].

[[File:Idriss Deby with Obamas (cropped)2014.png|thumb|Despite internal political opposition, coup attempts, and a civil war, [[Idriss Déby]] has continuously ruled Chad since 1990.]]
Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a [[Constitution of Chad|new constitution]] by [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 1996|referendum]], and in 1996, Déby easily won a [[Chadian presidential election, 1996|competitive presidential election]]. He won a [[Chadian presidential election, 2001|second term]] five years later.&lt;ref&gt;East, Roger &amp; Richard J. Thomas (2003); ''Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders''. Routledge. {{ISBN|1-85743-126-X}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petroleum|Oil]] exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a [[War in Chad (2005–present)|new civil war]] broke out. Déby [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 2005|unilaterally modified the constitution]] to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;IPS, "{{lang|fr|Le pétrole au cœur des nouveaux soubresauts au Tchad}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Déby won [[Chadian presidential election, 2006|a third mandate]] in elections that the opposition boycotted.

=== Climate ===
{{main|Climate of Chad}}
Each year a tropical weather system known as the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|intertropical front]] crosses Chad from south to north, bringing a [[wet season]] that lasts from May to October in the south, and from June to September in the Sahel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in local rainfall create three major geographical zones. The [[Sahara]] lies in the country's northern third. Yearly precipitations throughout this belt are under {{convert|50|mm|in}}; only the occasional spontaneous palm grove survives, and the only ones to do so are south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].&lt;ref name="UNHCHR"/&gt;

The Sahara gives way to a [[Sahel]]ian belt in Chad's centre; precipitation there varies from {{convert|300|to|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. In the Sahel, a steppe of thorny bushes (mostly [[acacia]]s) gradually gives way to the south to [[East Sudanian savanna]] in Chad's [[Sudan (region)|Sudanese]] zone. Yearly rainfall in this belt is over {{convert|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="UNHCHR"/&gt;

=== Wildlife ===
{{Main|Wildlife of Chad}}

[[File:African Bush Elephant Mikumi.jpg|thumb|An [[African bush elephant]].]]
Chad's animal and plant life correspond to the three climatic zones. In the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. Palms and [[acacia tree]]s grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing. As of 2002, there were at least 134 species of mammals, 509 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants), and over 1,600 species of plants throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flora&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pensoft.net/journal_home_page.php?journal_id=3&amp;page=article&amp;SESID=98556166bbcb445ae7ccd99343b1434e&amp;type=show&amp;article_id=4752&amp;issue_id=410&amp;ttar=da&amp;search=wildlife%20of%20chad&amp;IN=&amp;TIP=&amp;Image100_x=-678&amp;Image100_y=-48&amp;|title=The Flora of Chad: a checklist and brief analysis|accessdate=17 October 2013|publisher=Pensoft.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elephant]]s, [[lion]]s, [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[giraffe]]s, [[antelope]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[hyena]]s, and many species of [[snake]]s are found here, although most large carnivore populations have been drastically reduced since the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/userfiles/file/IBAs/AfricaCntryPDFs/Chad.pdf|format=pdf|title=

Extensive deforestation has resulted in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; one of the main reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.&lt;ref name=Our&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.our-africa.org/chad/geography-wildlife|title=Our Africa|accessdate=17 October 2013|publisher=Our Africa organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poaching is a serious problem in the country, particularly of elephants for the profitable [[ivory]] industry and a threat to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html |title=African Elephants Slaughtered in Herds Near Chad Wildlife Park |publisher=National Geographic |date=30 August 2006 |accessdate=17 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017173341/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is worsened by the fact that the parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/world/africa/central-africas-wildlife-rangers-face-deadly-risks.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1382003098-yauBx4MSdHcb4DxeUgSrUw|title=Rangers in Isolated Central Africa Uncover Grim Cost of Protecting Wildlife|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=31 December 2012|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Female genital cutting|Female genital mutilation]] is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among [[Arab]]s, [[Hadjarai]], and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the [[Sara people|Sara]] (38%) and the [[Toubou]] (2%).

=== Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Chad}}
[[File:Chadian delegation.jpg|thumb|A tribal delegation]]

Chad has more than 200 distinct ethnic groups,&lt;ref name="BGN"/&gt; which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to impose a national society, but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's people may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live.&lt;ref name="Collelo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

[[File:Toubou camel rider in northeastern Chad 2015.jpg|thumb|A [[Toubou people|Toubou]] man near rocky lands in north Chad]]
In the south live sedentary people such as the [[Sara people|Sara]], the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential [[social unit]] is the lineage. In the Sahel sedentary peoples live side-by-side with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly Toubous.&lt;ref name="Collelo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Chad}}

Chad's official languages are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]], but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to the important role played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, [[Chadian Arabic]] has become a [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref name="Collelo"/&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Chad}}

Chad is a religiously diverse country.

The majority of Muslims in the country are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam ([[Sufism]]). Its most common expression is the [[Tijaniyah]], an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements.&lt;ref name="pew128"/&gt; A small minority of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented [[Salafi movement]]s.&lt;ref name="US-DoS-IRFR-2006"/&gt;

Roman Catholics represent the largest Christian denomination in the country. Most Protestants, including the Nigeria-based "Winners' Chapel", are affiliated with various evangelical Christian groups. Members of the [[Bahá'í]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religious communities also are present in the country. Both faiths were introduced after independence in 1960 and therefore are considered to be "new" religions in the country.&lt;ref name="US-DoS-IRFR-2006"/&gt;

Chad is home to foreign missionaries representing both [[Christian]] and Islamic groups. Itinerant [[Muslim]] preachers, primarily from [[Sudan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Pakistan]], also visit. Saudi Arabian funding generally supports social and educational projects and extensive mosque construction.&lt;ref name="US-DoS-IRFR-2006"/&gt;

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of Chad}}

Chad's constitution provides for a strong executive branch headed by a president who dominates the political system.

Chad's legal system is based on [[law of France|French civil law]] and Chadian customary law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the [[Supreme Court of Chad|Supreme Court]] and the [[Constitutional Council of Chad|Constitutional Council]], have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.&lt;ref name="BGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNPACP"/&gt;

=== Parliament ===
The National Assembly makes legislation. The body consists of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet three times per year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] (MPS), which holds a large majority.&lt;ref name="BGN"/&gt;

=== Political parties ===

=== Corruption ===
Chad is listed as a [[failed state]] by the [[Fund for Peace]] (FFP). In 2007 Chad had the seventh highest score on the failed state index. Since then the trend has been upwards each year. Chad had the fourth highest score (behind Sudan) on the Failed State Index of 2012 and {{As of|2013|lc=y}}, is ranked fifth.&lt;ref name="fundforpeace.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/?q=fsi |title=2012 Failed State Index |work=[[Fund for Peace]] |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption is rife at all levels; [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] for 2005 named Chad (tied with [[Bangladesh]]) as the most corrupt country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4351076.stm|title=Worst Corruption Offenders Named|publisher=BBC News|date=18 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chad's ranking on the index has improved only marginally in recent years.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{main|Regions of Chad|Departments of Chad|Sub-prefectures of Chad}}
Since 2012 Chad has been divided into [[regions of Chad|23 regions]].&lt;ref name=statoids&gt;{{cite web |last=Law |first=Gwillim |url=http://www.statoids.com/utd.html |title=Regions of Chad |website=Statoids |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subdivision of Chad in regions came about in 2003 as part of the decentralisation process, when the government abolished the previous [[prefectures of Chad|14 prefectures]]. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. Prefects administer the [[departments of Chad|61 departments]] within the regions.&lt;ref name="circonscritions"&gt;"Tableau des codes des circonscritions – Ministère de l'Intérieur", April 2008. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The departments are divided into [[Sub-prefectures of Chad|200 sub-prefectures]], which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41595.htm Chad]".

=== Military ===
{{main|Military of Chad}}
The CIA World Factbook estimates the military budget of Chad to be 4.2% of GDP as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Given the then GDP ($7.095 bln) of the country, military spending was estimated to be about $300 million. This estimate however dropped after the end of the [[Civil war in Chad (2005–2010)]] to 2.0%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of GDP)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as estimated by the [[World Bank]] for the year 2011. There aren't any more recent estimates available for 2012, 2013.

==== Rebel groups ====
{{See also|Category:Rebel groups in Chad}}
There have been numerous rebel groups in Chad throughout the last few decades.
In 2007, a peace treaty was signed that integrated [[United Front for Democratic Change]] or '''FUC''' soldiers into the Chadian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Human Rights Watch |title=Early to War: Child Soldiers in the Chad Conflict |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6of6GZ1nUPAC&amp;pg=PA13 |year=2007 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Movement for Justice and Democracy in Chad]] or '''MDJT''' also clashed with government forces in 2003 in an attempt to overthrow President [[Idriss Déby]]. In addition, there have been various conflicts with [[Khartoum]]'s [[Janjaweed]] rebels in eastern Chad, who killed civilians by use of [[helicopter gunship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Eric (9 August 2008) [http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?page=imprimable&amp;id_article=28211 Victims of Genocide in Darfur: Past, Present, and Future – Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan].

=== Human rights ===
In Chad, [[LGBT rights in Chad|homosexual acts]] are illegal and can be punished by 15 to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/gay-rights/ The state of gay rights around the world]".

=== Land conflicts ===
In southern Chad, bitter conflicts over land are becoming more and more common. They frequently turn violent. Long-standing community culture is being eroded – and so are the livelihoods of many farmers.&lt;ref name=D+C&gt;{{cite news |title=Commercialisation is destroying community rules|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/land-conflicts-are-escalating-chad-farmers-suffering-most|author=Djeralar Miankeol|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=17 June 2017 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations' [[Human Development Index]] ranks Chad as the seventh poorest country in the world, with 80% of the population living below the poverty line. The [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] ([[Purchasing power parity]]) per capita was estimated as [[United States dollar|US$]]1,651 in 2009.&lt;ref name=imf2/&gt; Chad is part of the [[Bank of Central African States]], the [[Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa]] (UDEAC) and the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).&lt;ref name="ohada.com"&gt;

Chad's currency is the [[Central African CFA franc|CFA franc]]. In the 1960s, the [[Mining industry of Chad]] produced [[sodium carbonate]], or natron. There have also been reports of [[gold]]-bearing quartz in the [[Biltine Prefecture]]. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;&lt;ref name="BGN"/&gt;

[[File:Mao Women.jpg|thumb|Women in [[Mao, Chad|Mao]], where [[Utilities in Chad|water]] is provided by a water tower. Access to clean water is often a problem in Chad.]]
Over 80% of Chad's population relies on subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; The crops grown and the locations of herds are determined by the local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of [[sorghum]] and [[millet]]. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered [[oasis|oases]] support only some dates and legumes.&lt;ref name="Collelo"/&gt; Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WB1/&gt;

Before the development of oil industry, cotton dominated industry and the labour market had accounted for approximately 80% of export earnings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton remains a primary export, although exact figures are not available. Rehabilitation of [[Cotontchad]], a major cotton company weakened by a decline in world cotton prices, has been financed by France, the Netherlands, the European Union, and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD). The [[parastatal]] is now expected to be privatised.&lt;ref name="BGN"/&gt; Other than Cotton, [[Cattle]] and [[Gum Arabic]] are dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Africa/Chad-AGRICULTURE.html |title=Chad economic products |last= |first= |date=28 October 2016 |website=NationsEncyclopedia.com |access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Chad can maintain a semblance of stability foreign investments will eventually return, but even 24 years after the last successful coup that brought President Idris Deby to power, investors are still wary of investing in Chad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worlddiplomacy.org/Countries/Chad/InfoCha.html|title=Chad|publisher=www.worlddiplomacy.org|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humanitarian situation ===
{{Main|Human rights in Chad}}
According to the [[United Nations]], Chad has been affected by a [[humanitarian crisis]] since at least 2001. {{As of|2008}}, the country of Chad hosts over 280,000 refugees from the [[Sudan]]'s [[Darfur]] region, over 55,000 from the [[Central African Republic]], as well as over 170,000 [[internally displaced person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080313030132/http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/YSAR-7CGP7Z?OpenDocument ''Humanitarian Action in Chad: Facts and Figures – Snapshot Report''], UN, 6 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects.

== Media ==
{{Main|Media of Chad}}

Chad's television audience is limited to N'Djamena. The only television station is the state-owned Télé Tchad. Radio has a far greater reach, with 13 private radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndjamena.usembassy.gov/radio_stations.html Radio Stations | Embassy of the United States Ndjamena, Chad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717074012/http://ndjamena.usembassy.gov/radio_stations.html |date=17 July 2007 }}.

== Education ==
[[Education in Chad|Educators]] face considerable challenges due to the nation's dispersed population and a certain degree of reluctance on the part of parents to send their children to school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, and more than half of the population is illiterate. [[List of universities in Chad|Higher education]] is provided at the [[University of N'Djamena]].&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BGN"/&gt; At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= 50 Things You Didn't Know About Africa| work= [[World Bank]]| url= http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polsc325-4.1-50-Things-you-didnt-know-about-Africa.pdf| accessdate= 7 May 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130725192911/http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polsc325-4.1-50-Things-you-didnt-know-about-Africa.pdf| archive-date= 25 July 2013| dead-url= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can also be related to the issue of [[child labor]] as the report also stated that 53% of children aged 5 to 14 were working children, and that 30% of children aged 7 to 14 combined work and school. A more recent DOL [[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|report]] listed cattle herding as a major agricultural activity that employed underage children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/|title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its great variety of peoples and languages, Chad possesses a rich cultural heritage. The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the [[Chad National Museum]] and the [[Chad Cultural Centre]].&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; Six [[public holidays in Chad|national holidays]] are observed throughout the year, and movable holidays include the Christian holiday of [[Easter Monday]] and the Muslim holidays of [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], and [[Mawlid|Eid Milad Nnabi]].&lt;ref name="CCG"/&gt;

=== Music ===
The [[music of Chad]] includes a number of unusual instruments such as the ''kinde'', a type of bow harp; the ''[[kakaki]]'', a long tin horn; and the ''hu hu'', a stringed instrument that uses [[calabash]]es as loudspeakers. Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer whistles, [[balafon]]es, harps and ''kodjo'' drums; and the [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]] combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments.&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/chad/chad_eng.pdf |title="Chad: A Cultural Profile" |accessdate=19 June 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001212259/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/chad/chad_eng.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2006 |df= }} (PDF).

[[File:Tailor in Chad.jpg|thumb|A Chadian tailor sells traditional dresses.]]
The music group [[Chari Jazz]] formed in 1964 and initiated Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on ''sai'', a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy and a lack of legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{fr icon}} Gondjé, Laoro (2003); "[http://www.cefod.org/archives/spip.php?article231 {{lang|fr|La musique recherche son identité}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422134754/http://www.cefod.org/archives/spip.php?article231 |date=22 April 2014 }}", {{lang|fr|Tchad et Culture}} '''214'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuisine ===
{{See also|Chadian cuisine}}
[[Millet]] is the staple food throughout Chad. It is used to make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north this dish is known as ''alysh''; in the south, as ''biya''. Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as ''salanga'' (sun-dried and lightly smoked ''[[Alestes]]'' and ''[[Hydrocynus]]'') or as ''banda'' (smoked large fish).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/D7238E/D7238E03.htm Symposium on the evaluation of fishery resources in the development and management of inland fisheries]". CIFA Technical Paper No. 2. [[FAO]]. 29 November – 1 December 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Carcaje'' is a popular sweet red tea extracted from hibiscus leaves. Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink [[millet beer]], known as ''billi-billi'' when brewed from red millet, and as ''coshate'' when from [[Proso millet|white millet]].&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt;

=== Literature ===
{{See also|Chadian literature}}
As in other Sahelian countries, literature in Chad has seen an economic, political and spiritual drought that has affected its best known writers. Chadian authors have been forced to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse. Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction. Among the most internationally renowned writers are [[Joseph Brahim Seïd]], [[Baba Moustapha]], [[Antoine Bangui]] and [[Koulsy Lamko]]. In 2003 Chad's sole literary critic, [[Ahmat Taboye]], published his {{lang|fr|Anthologie de la littérature tchadienne}} to further knowledge of Chad's literature internationally and among youth and to make up for Chad's lack of publishing houses and promotional structure.&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Malo, Nestor H.

=== Film ===
The development of a Chadian film industry was hampered by the devastations of civil war and from the lack of [[movie theater|cinemas]], of which there is only one in the whole country. The first Chadian [[feature film]], the [[docudrama]] ''[[Bye Bye Africa]]'', was made in 1999 by [[Mahamat Saleh Haroun]]. His later film ''[[Abouna]]'' was critically acclaimed, and his ''[[Daratt]]'' won the Grand Special Jury Prize at the [[63rd Venice International Film Festival]]. The 2010 feature film ''[[A Screaming Man]]'' won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], making Haroun the first Chadian director to enter, as well as win, an award in the main Cannes competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Justin|date=23 May 2010|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118019731.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title='Uncle Boonmee' wins Palme d'Or|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Issa Serge Coelo]] directed Chad's two other films, ''[[Daresalam]]'' and ''[[DP75: Tartina City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Bambé, Naygotimti (April 2007); "[http://www.cefod.org/spip.php?article915 Issa Serge Coelo, cinéaste tchadien: ''On a encore du travail à faire''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530063045/http://www.cefod.org/spip.php?article915 |date=30 May 2013 }}", ''Tchad et Culture'' '''256'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Neil (23 March 2004) [http://www.jigsawlounge.co.uk/film/harouninterview.html An interview with Mahamet-Saleh Haroun, writer and director of Abouna ("Our Father")]. jigsawlounge.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5328462.stm Mirren crowned 'queen' at Venice]", BBC News, 9 September 2006.

'''[[European Union]] culture policies''' aim to address and promote the cultural dimension of [[European integration]] through relevant legislation and government funding.&lt;ref name="Schindler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schindler|first=Joerg Michael|authorlink=|title=Culture, Politics and Europe: en route to Culture-Related Impact Assessment|work=|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.culturalpolicies.net/web/files/222/en/Culture,_Politics_and_Europe-1.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policies support the development of cultural activity, education or research conducted by private companies, [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]'s and individual initiatives based in the EU working in the fields of [[film|cinema]] and [[audiovisual]], [[publishing]], [[music]] and [[crafts]]. 

The [[European Commission]] runs ''Culture Programme (2007-2013)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/our-programmes-and-actions/doc411_en.htm |title=European Commission - Culture |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union|EU]] funds other cultural bodies such as the [[European Cultural Month]], the [[Media Programme]],  the [[European Union Youth Orchestra]] and the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme. 

The EU awards grants to cultural projects (233 in 2004) and has launched a web portal dedicated to Europe and Culture, responding to the European Council's expressed desire to see the Commission and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by advanced technological means."&lt;ref name="Culture Portal"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Cultural heritage as a vehicle of cultural identity|work=|publisher=philatelism.com|date=2007-07-05|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/portal/activities/heritage/cultural_heritage_vehic_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
The [[Council of Europe]], which is distinct from the European Union (EU), first formalised cultural cooperation policy in Europe with its [[Cultural convention|European Cultural Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalpolicies.net/web/coe.php |title=Compendium: Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe |publisher=Culturalpolicies.net |date=1949-05-05 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, specific EU policy on cultural cooperation began between member states since its inclusion in the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Bozoki"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozoki|first=Andras|authorlink=|title=Cultural Policy and Politics in the European Union|work=|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.ecoc-doc-athens.eu/attachments/1249_Cultural%20Policy%20and%20Politics%20in%20the%20European%20Union_speech_Bozoki_Andras.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{expand section|date=March 2011}}

==Structure and strategies adopted==
A [http://ec.europa.eu/culture/annexes-culture/doc1232_en.htm cultural contact point (CCP)] is set up in each EU member state, and is responsible for aiding communication between the [[European Commission]]'s Cultural Programme and member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/annexes-culture/doc1232_en.htm |title=European Commission Website |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|date=March 2011}}

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport policies of the European Union}}
Sport is largely the domain of the member states, with the EU mostly playing an indirect role. Recently the EU launched an anti-doping convention. The role of the EU might increase in the future, if (for example) the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] were to be ratified by all member states.&lt;ref name="EUO Sport"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldirova|first=Renata|authorlink=|title=Brussels' first-ever move into sport area set to spark controversy|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007-07-11|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24455|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other policies of the EU have affected sports, such as the freedom of employment which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]], which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU nationality.&lt;ref name="BBC Boseman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fordyce|first=Tom|authorlink=|title=10 years since Bosman|work=|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-07-11|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of the European Union}}

The languages of the European Union are [[language]]s used by people within the member states of the [[European Union]]. They include the 23 official [[languages of the European Union]] plus many others. EU policy is to encourage all its citizens to be [[multilingualism|multilingual]]; specifically, it encourages them to be able to speak two languages in addition to their [[mother tongue]]. The reason for this is not only to promote easier communication between Europeans, but also to encourage greater [[toleration|tolerance]] and [[respect diversity|respect for diversity]]. A number of EU funding programmes actively promote language learning and [[linguistic diversity]]. The content of [[education|educational systems]] remains the responsibility of individual Member States. Further information can be found at [[language policy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/policy/index_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donald Croom Beatty''' (April 11, 1900 &amp;ndash; July 12, 1980) was an American aviator, explorer, and inventor.

Beatty was the son of Isaac Beatty, Jr and Hughie Duffee Beatty of [[Birmingham, Alabama]] (United States). He began his flying career as a teenager by soloing a small plane he constructed himself with a motorcycle engine at his grandfather's farm near [[Tarrant, Alabama|Tarrant]] on June 16, 1916. The flight ended with a crash landing. Not long afterward he designed and constructed a hand-powered submarine which he sank in [[Homewood, Alabama|Homewood]]'s Edgewood Lake.

After a year at [[Marion Military Institute]], Beatty got permission from his father to enlist in the [[United States Navy]] at age 17. He was sent to the Navy Radio School set up at [[Harvard University]]. In 1919 the [[United Fruit Company]] hired him to construct and install wireless (radio) telegraphy equipment along its steamer routes in Asia. He reportedly constructed the first voice radio station in mainland China during that engagement.

==Alabama radio and aviation==
After returning to Alabama, Beatty joined [[James Meissner]] and a few fellow aviators to form the "Birmingham Flying Club" in 1919 at their own "Roberts Field". The unit was recognized as the [[106th Air Refueling Squadron|135th Observation Squadron]], the state's first [[Air National Guard]] unit, on January 21, 1922. Beatty qualified as a military pilot at [[Maxwell Air Force Base|Maxwell Field]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] and, in 1924, was commissioned as a 1st Lieutenant in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].

In 1921 Beatty constructed Alabama's first experimental voice radio station, then called [[WAPI (AM)|WIAG]] on the second floor of the Matthews Electric building. He used the station to broadcast weather reports to the few receiver-equipped pilots in range and had his flying student and girlfriend Mary Alice Gatling play the piano in the broadcast booth (presumably the first live broadcast of music in Alabama). An improved radio circuit Beatty developed for the station was the subject of his first U. S. patent, awarded in 1922.

==South American expedition==
In 1929, Beatty recruited investors from Birmingham and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to back a trade delegation by air to [[South America]]. He would serve as director and pilot with Robb C. Oertel as co-pilot, Leslie Walker as navigator, and Martel Brett, a ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald|Birmingham Age-Herald]]'' reporter, as historian. Hopes for the flight, which were widely publicized, were dashed by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].

In 1931 Beatty re-launched his ambitions for an expedition to South America, adding the enticement of exploration of the interior of the continent to his plans. He secured the cooperation of Major Leslie Barbrook of the [[National Geographic Society]] and William Stirling, chief ethnologist for the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and approached [[J. P. Morgan]] for financing. With a $25,000 check in hand he and his wife attended the christening of the "Simon Bolivar" amphibious airplane at [[Roosevelt Field]] in [[New York City|New York]] on October 18 of that year.

Months of privation in the jungle were punctuated by careful movements across tribal boundaries into [[Ecuador]]. The group made the first photographs and motion-picture recordings of the native [[Jivaroan peoples|Jivaro (Shuar) people]], known then primarily as [[Headhunting|head-hunters]]. A miscommunication about the team's desire to record the shrinking of a [[Howler monkey]] head resulted, to their horror, in them witnessing the process performed on the head of their former packbearer, Sunga. Beatty occasionally used his radio equipment and Stirling used a kit of chemical substances to awe and frighten the natives. Eventually the expedition boarded rafts for the long journey down the [[Amazon River]].

In addition to their photographs, the expedition collected numerous artifacts and live animal specimens. A "tiger cub" ([[jaguar]]) sent by Beatty to his 6-year-old daughter was soon turned over to the [[Birmingham Zoo]] at [[Avondale, Birmingham, Alabama|Avondale Park]], where it was found to be particularly uncooperative with the public. The success of the expedition led to Beatty's induction as a "fellow" to both [[The Explorers Club]] of New York and the [[Royal Geographical Society]].

==Panagra==
[[Pan American-Grace Airways]] (Panagra) recruited Beatty to lead the search for a downed plane in the Andes. He piloted a [[Fairchild 71]] monoplane wearing an early pressurized flight suit for his hundreds of search flights over the mountains. The site was buried in snow throughout Beatty's search and finally found by prospecting natives after an unusually warm summer.

Nevertheless, his experience and the geographical and detailed flight information he recorded allowed Beatty to develop air routes and safety practices for commercial flights across the mountains. He implemented the first system for air-to-ground voice communications and his recommendation for pilots to report their grid-square location at 5-minute intervals was widely adopted and is credited with saving many lives. Another recommendation to vary routes seasonally to avoid dangerous climate conditions was also instrumental in making commercial flights viable in mountainous regions.

In 1933, while Beatty was piloting a Panagra passenger flight from Los Cerillos airfield in [[Santiago, Chile]] through the [[Uspallata Pass]], a sudden strong wind ([[Clear-air turbulence]]) carried the craft above 26,000 feet, setting an altitude record for a passenger flight in an unpressurized cabin. The passengers and crew used breathing tubes connected to oxygen tanks, but when the incident prolonged the flight, the oxygen was reserved for the crew only, causing the passengers to lose consciousness. The pass is sometimes called "Beatty Pass" in recognition of his development of the route.

In 1935 Beatty, piloting a [[Sikorsky S-43]], set a speed record for a flight between the continental United States and the [[Panama Canal Zone]].

In 1938 Beatty was forced to land a Panagra amphibious flight in the [[Pacific Ocean]] after his equipment was damaged by a lightning strike. He landed successfully and dropped anchor. After receiving fuel and supplies from another seaplane, he successfully took off in the rough seas and completed the flight.

==CAA and Consairway==
In 1939 Beatty returned to the United States as the appointed Senior Air Safety Investigator for the [[United States government role in civil aviation|Civil Aeronautics Authority]]. He reported for duty in [[Santa Monica, California]] on July 1, 1939 and made reports on all non-military aviation incidents in the western states.

Before [[World War II]], Beatty accepted an offer from [[Consolidated Aircraft]] of [[San Diego, California]] to direct its flight testing and delivery operations worldwide. The program he set up in 1941 between California and Australia was designated "Consairway" and, using precautionary protocols Beatty initiated, the civilian-manned program suffered no losses in its hundreds of flights across enemy-controlled seaways. Consairway rapidly expanded into a major ferrying operation which delivered flight crews and material to combat zones. Beatty invented the use of barometric readings to adjust flight paths en route over the Pacific, now a standard fuel conservation practice. His training of pilots from experience in mountainous terrain proved especially critical in the Pacific theater as air routes over the [[Himalayas]] were the only means of getting freight into China.

Meanwhile, Beatty himself relocated to [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]] to oversee Consolidated's modification of aircraft for leasing to European powers. In order to overcome a bottleneck in outfitting the [[Royal Air Force]] he established a [[Convair]] flight crew training facility in [[Bermuda]].

In 1944 Beatty left to work for the [[Platt-LePage Aircraft Company]] in [[Eddystone, Pennsylvania]]. He contributed to the top-secret development of the [[Platt-Le Page XR-1|XR-1 dual-rotor helicopter]], the first helicopter used by the United States Air Force.

==1940s inventions==
As his involvement at Platt-LePage waned, Beatty pursued numerous patents for new inventions, primarily relating to electronic circuits for communications. The first invention to go to market, however, was a type of highway signage that would indicate progress along the route and the expected travel time to the next destination city. His "Minute Maps", as they were called, were put into service on several routes in Alabama and the mid-Atlantic.

Beatty was awarded the first patent for a circuit to allow telephone callers to leave messages when calls were unanswered. The device, which utilized a wire recorder, was marketed as the "Tele-Mat" telecorder by the Pentron Corporation of [[Chicago, Illinois]], and sold for $250. Beatty's other telephone-related innovations included the first automated dialer and a hands-free telephone set.

==Hayes and GAALT==
Beatty signed on as the first employee of Birmingham's [[Hayes Aircraft Corporation]] in 1951 and was made head of the company's research and development in electronic equipment in 1958. While there he patented the "Gain-Adjusting Audio Level Terminator" (GAALT), a solid-state amplifier used to improve the [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] in electronic communications. The device was widely adopted, even appearing on the Kennedy Presidential Train. It was used by [[NASA]] for the [[Echo 1]] communications satellite launched on August 12, 1960 and has found its way into a wide range of orbiting and terrestrial signaling devices ever since. The [[Alabama Power Company]] even adapted the technology to allow for sending company signals through its power lines, eliminating the need for separate telephone communications (a parallel to its earlier adoption of Beatty's radio station.)

==Later life==
Beatty retired to his home in [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]], where he was surrounded by his Amazonian artifacts and other mementos of aviation and exploring. The OX-5 Aviation Pioneers named him their "Man of the Year" in 1973. Architect Fritz Woehle was given Beatty's permission to reconstruct the decor of his living room as part of an exhibit at the Birmingham Festival of Arts' 1975 Salute to [[Brazil]]. In 1978 he and his wife agreed to donate their nearly 300 Jivano artifacts to the Smithsonian Institution, which previously had only a small collection of Stirling's souvenirs from the 1930s expedition. The donation led to the couple being awarded the James Smithson Medal, the Smithsonian's highest honor.

Beatty suffered a stroke on his 80th birthday and died in Birmingham three months later. He was buried at [[Elmwood Cemetery (Birmingham, Alabama)|Elmwood Cemetery]].

Beatty was inducted into the Alabama Aviation Hall of Fame at the [[Southern Museum of Flight]] in 1982 and the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame in 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">The unified system of '''education in the Second Polish Republic''' was attempted in 1920,&lt;ref name=jaja/&gt; later superseded by the [[Jędrzejewicz reform]], named after [[Janusz Jędrzejewicz]],&lt;ref name=zos&gt;Z. Osiński, ''Janusz Jędrzejewicz. Piłsudczyk i reformator edukacji (1885-1951)'', Lublin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; approved by the [[Sejm]] in 1932. The resulting system was in force essentially until 1948, when it was superseded by the [[Communist state|Communist]] system of [[education in the Polish People's Republic]]. The Jędrzejewicz reform received controversial recognition. From one hand, it introduced [[compulsory education]] and unified credentials of various schools at their relative educational levels. On the other hand, it introduced a considerable degree of the interference of the state into the issues of [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name=jaja/&gt;

==Background==
At the moment of the [[Polish Independence Day|regaining of the independence]] by Poland in 1918 and the establishment of the [[Second Polish Republic]], its system of education was in disarray, mainly due to more than a century of [[partitions of Poland]] by [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Prussia|German]], and the [[Russian Empire]]s.&lt;ref name=jaja&gt;Jarosław Jastrzębski, "Reforma Jędrzejewicza w państwowym szkolnictwie akademickim II Rzeczypospolitej.

== Jędrzejewicz reform ==
{{main|Jędrzejewicz reform}}
The education reform was approved by the Sejm on March 11, 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU19320380389 Dz.U. 1932 nr 38 poz. 389] Ustawa z dnia 11 marca 1932 r. o ustroju szkolnictwa.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 1933 the reform was extended to encompass the [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;Ustawa z dnia 15 marca 1933 r. o szkołach akademickich – Dz.U. z 1933 r.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="886">'''European Commission of Human Rights''' was a special [[tribunal]].

From 1954 to the entry into force of Protocol 11 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], individuals did not have direct access to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]; they had to apply to the Commission, which if it found the case to be well-founded would launch a case in the Court on the individual's behalf. Protocol 11 which came into force in 1998 abolished the Commission, enlarged the Court, and allowed individuals to take cases directly to it.

'''Il Santo''' is an Italian novel written by [[Antonio Fogazzaro]] and published by [[Baldini &amp; Castoldi]] in 1905 in Milan. The novel is the third and last of a trilology in which ''[[The Little World of the Past|Piccolo Mondo Antico]]'' is the first and ''[[Piccolo Mondo Moderno]]'' is the second.&lt;ref name=CrawfordReview&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crawford, Virginia M.|title=A Saint in Literature|journal=The Fortnightly Review|volume=85|date=April 1906|pages=660–667|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924066518741;view=1up;seq=670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Fogazzaro was a devout and loyal Catholic, ''Il Santo'' was listed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Religious World.

==Plot summary==
As a sequel to ''Piccolo Mondo Moderno'', the novel takes up the story of
Piero Maironi.
{{blockquote|... his wife being in a lunatic asylum, Maironi, artist and dreamer, had fallen in love with a beautiful woman separated from her husband, Jeanne Dessalle who professed agnostic opinions. Recalled to a sense of his faith and his honour by an interview with his wife, who sent for him on his death-bed, he was plunged in remorse, and disappeared wholly from the knowledge of friends and relatives after depositing in the hands of a venerable priest, Don Giuseppe Flores, a sealed paper describing a prophet vision concerning his life that had largely contributed to his conversion. Three years are supposed to have passed between the close of ''Piccolo Mondo Moderno'' and the opening of ''Il Santo'', when Maironi is revealed under the name of Benedetto, purified of his sins by a life of prayer and emaciated by the severity of his mortifications, while Jeanne Dessalle, listless and miserable, is wandering around Europe with Noemi d'Arxel, sister to Maria Selva, hoping against hope for the reappearance of her former lover.&lt;ref name=CrawfordReview/&gt;}}

After a dramatic meeting with Jeanne Dessale, the reformed Maironi (now Benedetto) takes refuge as a monk in a religious community in the mountain village of Jenne and acquires a reputation among the peasants there as a saint who sometimes works miracles of healing. Bendetto calls for a thorough reform of Christian spirituality and thought. Benedetto/Maironi's program of spiritual reform is developed by Fogazzaro from ideas of the Italian philosopher [[Antonio Rosmini]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Polet, ''Patrimoine littéraire européen'' Vol. 12 - ''Mondialisation de l'Europe (1885–1922)'', De Boeck, Brruxelles, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Benedetto forms with Don Clemente and Professor Giovanni Selva (in whom the critic Jean Lebrec recognizes [[Friedrich von Hügel]], a close friend of Fogazzaro&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Joseph Malègue]], romancier et penseur'', H.Dessain et Tolra, Paris, 1969, p. 228, Jean Lebrec cites in support of his opinion the work of Jean Steinmann, ''Friedrich von Hügel, son œuvre et ses amitiés'', Aubier, Paris, 1962, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;) the nucleus of a latter-day [[Cénacle]] who call themselves ''Le Catacombe''.

{{blockquote|Jeanne, his temptress of past years, he keeps sternly at a distance—one interview indeed she forces upon him, but she never enters his presence again until he is in the agony of death.&lt;ref name=CrawfordReview/&gt;}}

Benedetto goes to Rome and works among the poor of the Trastevere and Testaccio quarters, but then gains notoriety and becomes enmeshed in clerical and anti-clerical politics. Eventually Benedetto meets with Pope Pius X.
{{blockquote|... With all due deference he dilates on what he terms the four evil spirits of the Church of the present day: the spirit of falsehood, the spirit of domination among the priesthood, the spirit of avarice, and the spirit of rigidity. To all of this the Pope listens as the most paternal of fathers, and as one oppressed by the intolerable burden of office, and gravely points out the obstacles in the way of reform.&lt;ref name=CrawfordReview/&gt;}}

==Criticism==
{{blockquote|In ''Il Santo'', Piero Maironi intends to evangelize the contemporary world, but, as always happens with Fogazzaro's characters, he fails. The reigning social order is never seriously challenged and the renewal that he, like his author, calls for never takes place. In the end, Fogazzaor's characters are fanciful figures, unable to integrate into everyday life. Social order always triumphs, while justice is postponed to a future known only to divine providence, and possibly only to be found in the next world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Marrone, Gaetana|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies: A-J|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2007|chapter=''Antonio Fogazzaro (1842–1911)'' by Alfredo Sgroi|pages=743–747|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_Italian_Literary_Studies.html?id=69ey6Z-05fMC&amp;pg=PA743}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas, I.P.''), '''ICNF''', is the responsible governmental body for the [[nature]] and [[forest]] policies, including the management of [[Protected Areas]] and State managed national, municipal and communal forests of mainland [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name="ICNFWho"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nature Conservation &amp; Biodiversity: ICNF Presentation |url=http://portal.icn.pt/ICNPortal/vEN2007/O+ICNB/Quem+Somos/Apresenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o+do+ICNB/?res=1366x768 |location=Lisbon, Portugal |editor=ICNF |publisher=Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas |accessdate=21 October 2013 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ICNF was formed in 2012 by the merging of the Autoridade Florestal Nacional (and the Fundo Florestal Permanent) with the ''Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e Biodiversidade'' (''Institute for Nature Conservation and Biodiversity''), under Decree-Law 135/2012 (29 June 2012).&lt;ref name="ICNFMission"&gt;{{cite web |title=Missão |url=http://www.icnf.pt/portal/icnf |location=Lisbon, Portugal |editor=ICNF |publisher=Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas |accessdate=21 October 2013 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Institute for Nature Conservation and Forestry is a public institute, indirectly administrated by the Portuguese State, endowed with administrative and financial autonomy and its own assets.&lt;ref name=ICNFMission/&gt;

The ICNF's mission is to propose, monitor and ensure the implementation of policies in the fields of nature conservancy and forests, to promote the conservation, sustainable use, appreciation, and enjoyment of the natural heritage.&lt;ref name=ICNFMission/&gt; It is also in charge of the promotion and sustainable development of forest resources, to allow increased competitiveness along the forestry-to-industry chain, but also to defend hunting resources and fishing and aquaculture on inland waters.&lt;ref name=ICNFMission/&gt;

'''Intelsat 15''', also known as '''IS-15''', is a [[communications satellite]] owned by [[Intelsat]]. Intelsat 15 was built by [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]], on a [[GEOStar-2|Star-2.4]].&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat15 /&gt; It is located at 85°&amp;nbsp;E longitude on the [[geostationary orbit]]. It was launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] to a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]] on 30 November 2009 by a [[Zenit-3SLB]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref name=nasagsfc-nssdcaintelsat15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nasagsfc-nssdcaintelsat15orbit /&gt; It has 22 active [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]], plus eight spares. Five of those transponders are owned and operated by [[SKY Perfect JSAT Group]] under the name '''JCSAT-85'''.&lt;ref name=jsat-book2012whoweare /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat15 /&gt;

==Satellite description==
'''Intelsat 15''' is a [[3 axis stabilized spacecraft|3 axis stabilized]] [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]] based on the [[GEOStar-2|Star-2.4]] [[satellite bus]]. It weighted {{convert|2484|kg|abbr=on}} at launch, had a dry mass of {{convert|1227|kg|abbr=on}}, and a design life 15 years.&lt;ref name=orbitalatk-intelsat15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-intelsat15 /&gt; It had a power availability dedicated to the payload of 4.6&amp;nbsp;kW, due to its [[Multi-junction solar cell|Multi-junction]] [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]] [[solar cell]]s. It also had two 4840&amp;nbsp;[[watt hour]] [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-ion batteries]] for surviving the solar eclipses.&lt;ref name=orbitalatk-intelsat15 /&gt;

The satellite used a [[Bipropellant rocket|bipropellant]] propulsion system with a [[BT-4 (rocket engine)|IHI BT-4]] [[Liquid Apogee Engine]] for [[Geostationary transfer orbit|orbit circularization]] and thrusters and [[reaction wheel]]s for [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]] and [[attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]].&lt;ref name=orbitalatk-intelsat15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat15 /&gt; It was filled with enough propellant for 15 years, but due to the efficient launch and transfer 17 are expected.&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat15 /&gt;

Its payload is composed two {{convert|2.3|m|abbr=on}} deployable dual grid reflectors, plus one {{convert|1.4|m|abbr=on}} deck mounted reflector. They are fed by 22 active [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]], plus eight spares. Intelsat uses 17 transponders, which have a bandwidth of twenty 36&amp;nbsp;MHz [[transponder equivalent]]s.&lt;ref name=orbitalatk-intelsat15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat15 /&gt; Its footprint is arranged in a Russia beam and a Middle East beam.&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat15 /&gt; [[SKY Perfect JSAT Group]] owns five physical transponders under the name '''JCSAT-85''', four have a bandwidth of 36&amp;nbsp;MHz and the other one has 72&amp;nbsp;MHz. JSCAT-85 footprint is arranged in two beams, West IOR Beam, covering middle East and the Arabic Sea, and East IOR Beam, covering the Eastern Asia coast and Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=jsat-book2012whoweare /&gt;&lt;ref name=jsat-jcsat85 /&gt;

== History ==
On April 2, 2007, [[JSAT Corporation]] (now [[SKY Perfect JSAT Group]]) announced an agreement to purchase a payload consisting of five [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]] on the yet to be built '''Intelsat 15'''. Intelsat and JSAT had already collaborated on the [[Horizons-1]] and [[Horizons-2]] satellites. The satellite, also known as '''IS-15''', would provide services to the Asia-Pacific, Indian Ocean and Middle East regions from the 85°E longitude on the [[geostationary orbit]], where it would replace [[Intelsat 709]]. It would have 22 [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] transponders in total and a design life of 15 years.&lt;ref name=jsat-pr20070402 /&gt; The JSAT payload would be known as JCSAT-85.&lt;ref name=jsat-jcsat85 /&gt;

On May 1, 2007, [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] (now [[Orbital ATK]]) announced that it had been awarded a contract to manufacture Intelsat 15. It would be based on the [[GEOStar-2|STAR-2]] [[satellite bus]], generate 4.6&amp;nbsp;kW of power for its 22-transponder K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band payload and had an expected launch date of early 2009.&lt;ref name=orbitalsciences-pr20070501 /&gt;

On February 26, 2008, [[Sea Launch]] announce a contract with Intelsat to launch two satellites manufactured by Orbital Corporation, Intelsat 15 and [[Intelsat 16]]. The contract was itself a renegotiation for repurpose two already existing reservation by Intelsat with Sea Launch for two satellites to these new spacecrafts. They were expected to be launched by the [[Land Launch]] service, which used [[Zenit-3SLB]] rockets from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan, during 2009.&lt;ref name=sealaunch-pr20080228 /&gt;

Between October 27 and November 5, 2009 Intelsat 15 was processed in the Baikonur Cosmodrome. On November 6, it was filled with propellant.&lt;ref name=rscenergia-landlaunchchron06 /&gt; On November 24, 2009, JSAT announced that the launch of Intelsat 15 was expected on November 29 at 1:00&amp;nbsp;UTC.&lt;ref name=jsat-pr20091124 /&gt; But during the launch attempt on November 29, the automatic prelaunch issued an abort command.&lt;ref name=jsat-pr20091130 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rscenergia-landlaunchchron06 /&gt; But the launch committee agreed to make a second attempt on the next day.&lt;ref name=rscenergia-landlaunchchron06 /&gt;

On November 30, 2009, at 21:00&amp;nbsp;UTC, the Zenit-3SLB successfully launched Intelsat 15, from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 45]]. After a six and a half our mission, the [[Blok D|DM-3SLB]] successfully separated the spacecraft and at 03:28&amp;nbsp;UTC, first signals from spacecraft were received.&lt;ref name=sealaunch-pr20091130 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jsat-pr20091201/&gt; The launch put the satellite with margins of its planned [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]] with a [[perigee]] of 10,286&amp;nbsp;km, an [[apogee]] of 35,790&amp;nbsp;km and a 12° inclination to the Equator.&lt;ref name=rscenergia-landlaunchchron06 /&gt;

'''Io''' is a particle of a [[title]] used mainly by [[Romania]]n royalty from both [[Moldavia]] and [[Walachia]], preceding their names and the complete list of titles, in all their documents (written or engraved), since the formation of the respective principalities up to the [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty in the 19th century. 

First used by the [[Asăneşti|Assenid]] kings, the particle is the abbreviation of name ''Ioan'' (English: John, Latin: Ioannes), which comes from the original Hebrew Yohanan, meaning "God has favoured". Thus, in this context, the particle has the meaning "By the grace of God" (see [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]]), rather than alluding to an actual name of John. It was always spelled with a Latin I and a Greek omega (in both Latin and Cyrillic documents). In some Latin accounts it was replaced by "Iohannes".

'''Kulig''' (sleigh rides) is an old [[Poland|Polish]] winter tradition dating back to the days of the [[szlachta]] (nobility).

The kulig was a [[sleigh]] ride party organized among the Polish aristocracy. A cavalcade of horse-pulled sleighs and sleds went from one manor house to another, entertained everywhere with hearty meals followed by dancing.

Nowadays Kulig rides are a popular tourist attraction in the Polish [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra mountains]], advertised and practiced in places such as [[Zakopane]]. However, this practice is often borderline illegal and dangerous for passengers and horses alike. Since they provide significant profits Kulig rides are organized no matter what the weather conditions and even out of season. Horses are forced to pull overloaded sleighs - it is not uncommon that the number of passengers exceeds the capacity of the sleigh itself. What is worse - sometimes sleighs are being pulled not on snow, but on mud, stone and even asphalt. There have been numerous reports of Kulig rides causing horses to die out of exhaustion or accidents due to bad terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tvs.pl/informacje/kon-kuligu-wisle-przewrocil-sie-umarl-dzialo-sie-oczach-turystow-wideo-zdjecia/|title=Koń podczas kuligu w Wiśle przewrócił się i umarł!

'''Meryle Joy Reagon''' is an American [[civil rights movement]] activist born in 1942. In June 1961, she participated in a [[Freedom Ride]] from [[Montgomery, Alabama]] to [[Jackson, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=CRDL&gt;{{cite web|title=Reagon, Meryle Joy|url=http://crdl.usg.edu/people/r/reagon_meryle_joy/|website=Civil Rights Digital Library|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also known as the husband of another Freedom Rider, [[Frederick Leonard (activist)|Frederick Leonard]] and sister of [[Cordell Reagon]].

== Involvement in Freedom Ride on June 2, 1961 ==
Reagon was a 19 year old [[Tennessee State University]] student when she participated in a [[Freedom Ride]] from [[Montgomery, Alabama]] to [[Jackson, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=CRDL /&gt;

The [[Freedom Ride]] began at 7:30am which was two and a half hours before Judge Johnson's ruling.&lt;ref name=RAYMOND&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arsenault|first1=Raymond|title=Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice, PDF eBook Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice|date=2 November 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199792429|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of [[Freedom Riders]] was led by [[SNCC]] veteran, [[Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson|Ruby Doris Smith]].

The '''Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting''', sometime abbreviated BEPS multilateral instrument, is a multilateral convention of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] to combat [[tax avoidance]] by [[multinational corporation|multinational enterprises]] (MNEs) through prevention of [[Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] (BEPS). The BEPS multilateral instrument was negotiated within the framework of the [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|OECD G20 BEPS project]] and enables countries and jurisdictions to swiftly modify their bilateral tax treaties to implement some of the measures agreed.&lt;ref name="OECD Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/multilateral-convention-to-implement-tax-treaty-related-measures-to-prevent-beps.htm|title= Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS|work=OECD|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The substance of the tax treaty-related BEPS measures (under BEPS Actions 2, 6, 7 and 14) was agreed as part of the Final BEPS Package. Accordingly, the negotiation on the text of the BEPS multilateral instrument was focused on how the BEPS multilateral instrument would need to modify the provisions of bilateral or regional tax agreements in order to implement those BEPS measures.&lt;ref name=Statement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/explanatory-statement-multilateral-convention-to-implement-tax-treaty-related-measures-to-prevent-BEPS.pdf |title=Explanatory statement to the MLI|accessdate=23 July 2018|work=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BEPS multilateral instrument was adopted on 24 November 2016 and signed on 7 June 2017 by 67 jurisdictions for the first signing ceremony.&lt;ref name=Parties/&gt;. As of July 2018, 83 jurisdictions have signed the BEPS multilateral instrument, covering more than 1,400 bilateral tax treaties. It entered into force on 1 July 2018, among the first jurisdictions that ratified it.&lt;ref name=Parties/&gt;

==Functioning==
The BEPS multilateral instrument looks to "prevent treaty abuse, improve dispute resolution, prevent the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status and neutralise the effects of hybird mismatch arrangements"&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/MLI-frequently-asked-questions.pdf |title=FAQ on the MLI|accessdate=23 July 2018|work=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The BEPS multilateral instrument does not function in the same way as an amending protocol to a single existing treaty, which would directly amend the text of the existing tax treaty. Instead, it applies alongside the existing tax treaties. As stated in the Explanatory Statement&lt;ref name=Statement/&gt; of the BEPS multilateral instrument this reflects the ordinary rule of treaty interpretation, as reflected in Article 30(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, under which an earlier treaty between parties that are also parties to a later treaty will apply only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.With one convention, the signatory countries can achieve a work that would have taken decades otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxinsights.ey.com/archive/archive-articles/multilateral-instrument--no-time-for-beps-fatigue.aspx|title=Multilateral instrument: no time for BEPS fatigue|accessdate=24 July 2018|work=EY Tax Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the purpose of the BEPS multilateral instrument, which is to swiftly implement the tax treaty-related BEPS measures, the BEPS multilateral instrument also enables all parties to meet 2 of the 4 minimum standards which were agreed as part of the Final BEPS package&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-presents-outputs-of-oecd-g20-beps-project-for-discussion-at-g20-finance-ministers-meeting.htm|title=Press Release of the BEPS Project|accessdate=25 July 2018|work=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Given, however, that each of those minimum standards can be satisfied in multiple different ways, and given the broad range of countries and jurisdictions involved in the development of the BEPS multilateral instrument, the BEPS multilateral instrument gives flexibilities with respect to ways of meeting it while remaining consistent with its purpose.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; The BEPS multilateral instrument also provides flexibility by allowing to opt out of provisions which do not reflect a BEPS minimum standard. &lt;ref name=Statement/&gt; 

==Parties==
A list of parties to the convention is shown below. Including these parties, 83 jurisdictions have signed it, but not deposited their instrument of ratification.&lt;ref name=Parties/&gt;

The '''Ngondo''' is an annual water-centered festival held by the [[Sawa (ethnic group)|Sawa]] (coastal peoples) in [[Douala]], [[Cameroon]]. The highlight of the festival is a ceremony of the [[jengu]] cult. The ceremony is held at a beach on [[Wouri River|Wouri Bay]], during which a devotee enters the water to visit the underwater kingdom of the miengu (plural for jengu). According to tradition, the devotee can remain underwater for hours, and emerge with his clothing appearing completely dry. Children are not allowed to attend the ceremony. Ngondo was banned by the government of Cameroon in 1981, but reinstated in 1991.

The '''price–specie flow mechanism''' is a model developed by Scottish economist [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) to illustrate how [[trade imbalance]]s can be self-correct and adjust under the [[gold standard]]. Hume expounded his argument in ''[[Of the Balance of Trade]]'', which he wrote to counter the [[Mercantilist]] idea that a nation should strive for a positive [[balance of trade]] (i.e., greater exports than imports). In short, the "increase in domestic prices due to the gold inflow would discourage exports and encourage imports, thus automatically limiting the amount by which exports would exceed imports".&lt;ref name="econlib"&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hume|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Hume.html|website=Library of Economics and Liberty|publisher=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume first elaborated on the mechanism in a 1749 letter to [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref name="studies"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Robert W. McGee|title=The Economic Thought of David Hume|journal=Hume Studies|date=1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=184–204|url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v15n1/mcgee/mcgee-v15n1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argument ==

Hume argued that when a country with a gold standard had a positive balance of trade, gold would flow into the country in the amount that the value of exports exceeds the value of imports. Conversely, when such a country had a negative balance of trade, gold would flow out of the country in the amount that the value of imports exceeds the value of exports. Consequently, in the absence of any offsetting actions by the [[central bank]] on the quantity of money in circulation (called [[sterilization (economics)|sterilization]]), the money supply would rise in a country with a positive balance of trade and fall in a country with a negative balance of trade. Using a theory called the [[quantity theory of money]], Hume argued that countries with an increasing money supply would see [[inflation]] as the prices of goods and services rose while countries with a decreasing money supply would experience [[deflation]] as the prices of goods and services fell.&lt;ref name="uneasy"&gt;{{cite news|title=What’s Wrong with the Price-Specie-Flow Mechanism? Part I|url=https://uneasymoney.com/2017/07/07/whats-wrong-with-the-price-specie-flow-mechanism-part-i/|accessdate=8 February 2018| work=Uneasy Money|date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher prices would, in the countries with a positive balance of trade, cause exports to decrease and imports to increase, which will alter the balance of trade downwards towards a neutral balance. Inversely, in countries with a negative balance of trade, the lower prices would cause exports to increase and imports to decrease, which will heighten the balance of trade towards a neutral balance. These adjustments in the balance of trade will continue until the balance of trade equals zero in all countries involved in the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard, [https://mises.org/library/david-hume-and-theory-money David Hume and the Theory of Money"], Mises Daily Articles, 27 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The price–specie flow mechanism can also be applied to a state's entire balance of payments, which accounts not only for the value of net exports and similar transactions (i.e., the [[current account]]), but also the [[financial account]], which accounts for flows of financial assets across countries, and the [[capital account]], which accounts for non-market and other international [[Financial transaction|transactions]]. But under a [[gold standard]], transactions in the financial account would be conducted in gold—or [[currency]] convertible into [[gold]]—which would also affect the quantity of money in circulation.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

== Criticisms ==
* Trading data from the era of the gold standard tends not to corroborate with the theory.
* the theory ignores the effect of paper/bank/credit money, and assumes that all money is gold. In practice, bank money can more than compensate for shortages of specie, so price levels need not be affected by a shortage of specie

'''''Project Fame''''' was a pan-African version of the international talent/reality show ''[[Star Academy]]''. Held in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] from June to August 2004, the show had 16 African contestants - 9 of which were South African - groomed for stardom, with the weakest being eliminated on a weekly basis; the top three received record deals and the winner got a lot more prizes. 

The contestants were eliminated in the following way: the Board (judges) place four contestants on probation, the teachers save one, the other contestants save another and viewers save a third, thereby eliminating the last contestant. As the show progressed, the number of contestants placed on probation rose to five resulting in two contestants being eliminated. The last five remaining contestants' fates were determined by viewers' votes.

An East African version; ''[[Tusker Project Fame]]'' (season 1) began on 1 October – 17 December 2006. It continues to run each year and the latest is ''Tusker Project Fame season 4'' which ended on 6 December 2010, and won by Ugandan [[Davis Hillary Ntare]].

The show can be described as ''[[Idols (South Africa)|Idols]]'' meets ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' as the contestants' daily activities were recorded 24 hours a day.

'''''San Telmo''''' ("Saint [[Peter Gonzalez]]" or "Saint [[Erasmus of Formiae]]") was a Spanish 74-gun [[ship of the line]], launched in 1788.

In 1819 the ''San Telmo'' commanded by Captain Joaquín de Toledo y Parra was the flagship of a Spanish naval squadron under Brigadier [[Rosendo Porlier y Asteguieta]]  bound for [[Callao]] (Peru) to reinforce colonial forces there fighting the independence movements in [[Spanish America]]. Damaged by severe weather in the [[Drake Passage]], south of [[Cape Horn]], it sank in September 1819.

The 644 officers, soldiers and seamen lost on board the ''San Telmo'' were the first known people to die in [[Antarctica]], as parts of her wreckage were found months later by the early sealers visiting [[Livingston Island]]. Indeed, if somebody of the ''San Telmo'' survived to set foot there they would have been the [[history of Antarctica|first known person in history to reach Antarctica]].

[[San Telmo Island]] off the north coast of [[Livingston Island]] is named after the ship.

The '''Snow Leopard Conservancy''' ('''SLC''') was founded in 2000 by Dr Rodney Jackson, a leading expert on [[snow leopard]]s (''Panthera uncia'') and their [[habitat]]. The conservancy works to engage and incorporate local communities in protecting snow leopards in [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Russia]] and [[India]]. SLC is a [[non-profit]] organization with headquarter in [[Sonoma, California]] and [[Ladakh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Snow Leopard Conservancy works with local people to not only find a way for them to live harmoniously with snow leopards but also to become their guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; SLC has done this by creating alternative-income projects, such as tourist [[homestay]] lodging and [[eco-tourism]]. Other means of working with local herding populations is to protect livestock by building predator-proof corrals and providing conservation education and training for children in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region.

SLC also conducts research to better understand the behaviors and habitat needs of snow leopards. This is done using remote camera traps, [[fecal]] [[DNA]] sampling and [[GPS]]-[[satellite]] collars to study movements and corridor analysis to find areas to target for conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Timothy Paul Lovejoy''' (born 28 March 1968) is an English [[television presenter]], best known for hosting Saturday morning [[association football|football]] programme ''[[Soccer AM]]'' with [[Helen Chamberlain]] for over a decade. He presents ''[[Sunday Brunch]]'' on [[Channel 4]] and ''BT Sports Panel'' on Saturday mornings on the [[BT Sport]] channel.

== Career ==

===Early career===
Lovejoy began his television career as a covering [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] for [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]]. He then joined [[Planet 24]], working as a researcher for ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'' before going on to produce the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakerscorner.co.uk/file/fc73c9835e6c3d3a53947e9793f8aa01/lovejoy-tim.html Tim Lovejoy Biography] Speakers Corner&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Marson's book celebrating fifty years of ''[[Blue Peter]]'' also comments that Lovejoy auditioned as a presenter in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===''Soccer AM''===
{{Main|Soccer AM}}
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2011}}
Lovejoy began hosting and producing football show ''[[Soccer AM]]'' on [[Sky UK|Sky Television]] in 1996, with [[Helen Chamberlain]]. He remained on the show for eleven years.

Following the success of ''Soccer AM'', Lovejoy became a radio [[disc jockey|DJ]], joining [[Radio X (United Kingdom)|Xfm]] before moving to [[Virgin Radio]], where he briefly presented a Sunday-afternoon show. He also hosted ''Tim Lovejoy and the Allstars'', a show similar to ''[[TFI Friday]]'', on [[Sky 1]], where he chatted with celebrities, between performances from a variety of bands.

In 2006, Lovejoy was appointed as the co-host of the car show ''[[Fifth Gear]]'' on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] for one series.

Lovejoy announced on 5 June 2007 that he would be leaving ''Soccer AM'' after eleven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2095733,00.html |title = Lovejoy to leave Soccer AM |accessdate =5 January 2008|author = Dowell, Ben |date =5 June 2007|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' |work = MediaGuardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-''Soccer AM''===
Following his departure from ''Soccer AM'', Lovejoy joined [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] as the Wednesday night host of its football phone-in show ''[[6-0-6]]'' though he was dropped in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/26/radio.bbc |title = Lovejoy to host Five Live phone-in |accessdate=5 January 2008|author = Plunkett, John |date =26 June 2007|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' |work = MediaGuardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also presented the UK edition of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]]'s [[Major League Soccer]] magazine show ''[[David Beckham's Soccer USA (UK TV Series)|David Beckham's Soccer USA]]''

In 2008, Lovejoy launched an internet TV channel called [[Channel Bee]]. As of 20 November 2009, the website has been taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MediaGuardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/jul/07/leavingskywasthedaymylif |title=Tim Lovejoy: Leaving Sky was the day my life changed |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Lovejoy guest presented an episode of ''[[Blue Peter]]'' 12 years after auditioning for the show. A clip of Lovejoy's original audition was shown during the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published Tuesday, 16 Feb 2010, 10:37 GMT |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a203485/lovejoy-to-guest-present-blue-peter.html |title=Lovejoy to guest present 'Blue Peter' |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2010-02-16 |accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Lovejoy made a cameo appearance as a news reporter in the comedy feature  ''[[Being Sold]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Lovejoy participated in the 2011 series of ''[[Celebrity MasterChef]]''.

===''Something for the Weekend''===
{{Main|Something for the Weekend (TV programme)|l1=Something for the Weekend}}
From 2006 until 2012, Lovejoy  co-presented the Sunday morning TV programme ''[[Something for the Weekend (TV programme)|Something for the Weekend]]'' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]],  opposite chef [[Simon Rimmer]] and various female co-hosts including  [[Louise Redknapp]] (previous co-hosts include [[Amanda Hamilton]] and [[Caroline Flack]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Something for the Weekend|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v85g|publisher=BBC2 website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show centred on cookery, with celebrity guests assisting in the preparation of easy recipes, and viewers encouraged to make the same dishes at home. It also had regular segments on cocktails, gadgets, and 'guess the year' based on old pop and news clips.

It was reported in January 2012 that the show, which in 2011 ran as a 46 × 90-minute series, had fallen foul of the BBC's Delivering Quality First cuts because of its unfortunate scheduling on BBC 2 during the day, despite consistently high ratings. The show ended in March, and an online campaign was launched to save the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Paul |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-01-09/campaign-to-save-something-for-the-weekend-attracts-celebrity-support |title=Campaign to save Something for the Weekend attracts celebrity support |publisher=Radio Times |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sunday Brunch'' and ''Daily Brunch''===
{{Main|Sunday Brunch}}
On 25 March 2012, Lovejoy and Rimmer began hosting a new show for [[Channel 4]], ''[[Sunday Brunch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/n|title=cookerymedia/2012/feb/16/something-for-the-weekend-channel-4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/tim-lovejoy-and-simon-rimmer-to-join-channel-4-for-sunday-brunch |title=Tim Lovejoy and Simon Rimmer to join Channel 4 for Sunday Brunch – Channel 4 – Info – Press |publisher=Channel 4 |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series started one week after the final episode of ''Something for the Weekend''.

In 2014, Lovejoy and Rimmer presented a short-lived spin-off series called ''[[Daily Brunch]]'', airing Monday to Fridays from 10{{nbsp}}am. The show lasted for just eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a599825/sunday-brunch-spinoff-show-daily-brunch-announced.html#~oRgNrhOGIRHGGF|title=Sunday Brunch to get daily spinoff|date=29 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BT Sport===
In August 2013, Lovejoy began hosting the Saturday morning ''BT Sports Panel'' (''BTSP'') show of predictions, previews and reviews — a format similar to his former ''Soccer AM'' days.

==Books==
The two other books are linked to his TV series; ''Lazy Brunch'', 'co-authored' with chef [[Simon Rimmer]] (Quadrille Publishing, London, 2008) and ''Something for the Weekend: 60 fabulous recipes for a Lazy Brunch'', also co-authored with Rimmer (Quadrille Publishing, London, 2009). His name is also associated with two DVDs on football: ''Lovejoy and Redknapp's Best Of Football'' (2007) and ''Tim Lovejoy's Football Managers Uncut – A Guide to the Game's Greatest Gaffers'' (2008).

His book ''Lovejoy on Football'' was not critically well received. [[Taylor Parkes]] in monthly football magazine ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'' described it as "tedious in the extreme ... Hopelessly banal and nauseatingly self-assured, smirkingly unfunny ... There’s something sinister here, too: beamingly positive, thrilled by wealth, too pleased with himself to ask awkward questions."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Parkes, [[When Saturday Comes]], 250, Dec. 2007 [http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/145/29/ No Love No Joy]&lt;/ref&gt; Ally Ross of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' compared the number of photos Lovejoy included of himself in the work (38) to [[Nelson Mandela]]'s autobiography, ''[[Long Walk to Freedom (book)|Long Walk To Freedom]]'' (8).&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 26 November 2008 [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article5232268.ece?token=null&amp;offset=48&amp;page=5 The 50 Worst Famous Football Fans]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Podcast ==
In 2017 Lovejoy launched ''Dear Lovejoy'', originally an agony uncle podcast, but later evolving into a series of interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/dear-lovejoy/id1196671475?mt=2|title=Dear Lovejoy by Dear Lovejoy on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lovejoy married Jade in 2002 and has twin girls from the marriage, born in 2002. Lovejoy was in a relationship with English netball player [[Tamsin Greenway]]. She gave birth to the couple's first child together, a daughter,on 22 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Digital Spy]] |title=Tim Lovejoy and girlfriend Tamsin Greenway have baby daughter |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a483569/tim-lovejoy-and-girlfriend-tamsin-greenway-have-baby-daughter.html |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Lovejoy announced that this relationship had ended.

In 2009, Lovejoy was named by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as the 49th most eligible bachelor in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=14 Jun 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5531303/Britains-top-50-most-eligible-bachelors.html |title=Telegraph list of most eligible bachelors |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-06-14 |accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] on 27 April 2015 aboard a [[Falcon 9 v1.1]] rocket, the satellite operates at 52°E in the [[geostationary orbit]] and has an anticipated service life of 15 years.&lt;ref name=thales20150428&gt;{{cite web |title=TurkmenAlem52E/MonacoSAT launch a success! |url=https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/space/magazine/turkmenalem52emonacosat-launch-success |publisher=[[Thales Alenia Space]] |date=28 April 2015 |accessdate=1 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 52°E position is controlled by the [[Principality of Monaco]] and the satellite includes 12 [[transponder]]s that are referred to and commercialised as MonacoSAT as well as the 26 transponders referred to as TürkmenÄlem.&lt;ref name=whatismonacosat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssi-monaco.com/?page_id=3237 |title=What Is MonacoSAT |publisher=Space Systems International - Monaco |access-date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite is operated by the [[Turkmenistan National Space Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.trend.az/capital/it/2082344.html |title=Turkmenistan to launch first space satellite in 2014 |publisher=En.trend.az |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Launch of Falcon 9 carrying TurkmenAlem52E (17139094400).jpg|thumb|left|Launch of Falcon 9 carrying TürkmenÄlem 52°E / MonacoSAT]]
In 2009, Space Systems International - Monaco (SSI-Monaco) signed a license agreement with the Monaco government for the development and use of the 52°E orbital position for the MonacoSAT project. In November 2011, the [[Ministry of Communications (Turkmenistan)|Turkmenistan Ministry of Communications]] signed agreements with Thales Alenia Space to build the first TurkmenSpace satellite of the Turkmenistan NSSC (National System of Satellite Communications) programme, and with SSI-Monaco to use the 52°E position, including the right for SSI-Monaco to use 12 Ku-band transponders on the satellite as MonacoSAT. In July 2013, global satellite operator [[SES S.A.|SES]] and SSI-Monaco signed an agreement for SES to commercialise the 12 MonacoSAT transponders and integrate MonacoSAT into the SES fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=SES |date=July 4, 2013 |url=http://lv.ses.com/4233325/news/2013/15559071 |title= SES AND SSI-MONACO SIGN MONACOSAT COLLABORATION AGREEMENT |accessdate = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite was originally intended to be launched on a Chinese [[Long March 3B]] rocket but [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] prevented some US made parts being exported to China for the launch, and so in June 2013 it was switched to a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9 v1.1]] launcher,&lt;ref name="gunter"&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/turkmenalem-52e.htm TürkmenÄlem 52E / MonacoSat] Gunter's Space Page. Accessed January 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and planned for late 2014/early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/06/22/spacex-to-launch-turkmenistan-satellite-originally-to-be-launched-by-china/ |title=SpaceX To Launch Turkmenistan's First Satellite |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch was initially scheduled for 21 March 2015 but this was delayed to study a problem with a helium pressurisation system on the Falcon 9 rocket, and a new launch date was set for no earlier than 24 April 2015.&lt;ref name=zgn20150323/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/03/21/spacex-swaps-order-of-next-two-falcon-9-launches/&lt;/ref&gt; SpaceX clarified the reason for the delay: "the issue wasn’t with the [helium] bottles themselves, but rather other bottles from a similar lot that failed testing at the company’s assembly plant. We identified a potential condition that could be shared with those on board the Thales vehicle."&lt;ref name=zgn20150323&gt;{{cite news |title=SpaceX Clarifies Reason For TurkmenAlem52E Launch Delay |url=http://www.zerognews.com/2015/03/23/spacex-clarifies-reason-for-turkmenalem52e-launch-delay/ |accessdate=25 March 2015 |work=ZeroG News |date=2015-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent launch on 27 April 2015 successful positioned the satellite at 52°E.

==Coverage==
The TürkmenÄlem 52°E / MonacoSAT satellite has 38 Ku-band transponders providing coverage in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia&lt;ref name=turkgov20131217/&gt; with three [[downlink]] beams:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ses.com/network/satellites/374 MonacoSAT] SES. Accessed January 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

* The West beam is centred on Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan with 53 dbW power providing reception on dishes down to about 50&amp;nbsp;cm. The beam extends at lower powers north east across Russia, north across Scandinavia to [[Svalbard]] and west across Europe to the Atlantic with a second high power lobe over France and southern UK.
* The East beam is also centred on Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan with a slightly reduced power (52 dBW) and extends west across central and northern Europe with a second 52 dBW lobe over north west France.
* The MENA beam is centred on the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa (Libya) with a maximum power of 51 dBW, and extends as far south as Sudan and Ethiopia.

==MonacoSAT==
The MonacoSAT payload of 12 Ku-band transponders commercialised by SES provides capacity for [[Direct-broadcast satellite|DTH]] broadcasting over the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to resources for trunking and data services in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia.

'''Xlejli Tower''' (formerly spelt '''Shilejli Tower''', {{lang-mt|Torri tax-Xlejli}} or ''Torri Xulliela''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassar Pullicino|first1=Joseph|title=The Order of St. John in Maltese folk-memory|journal=Scientia|date=October–December 1949|volume=15|issue=4|page=156|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2015(1949)4(Oct.-Dec.)/01.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417173522/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2015(1949)4(Oct.-Dec.)/01.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  also known as '''Bettina Tower''', is a [[tower]] in [[Gudja]], Malta. It was probably built as a [[watchtower]] since it has views over a large area of land. The age of the tower is not known, and it could date back to the Roman or medieval periods, or possibly a later reconstruction. The tower is now located in the grounds of [[Palazzo Dorell]], and it is closed to the public.

==History==
Its date of construction is not known, but it might have Roman origins. According to {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis de Boisgelin|fr|3=Pierre-Marie-Louis de Boisgelin de Kerdu}}, the historian of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]], an urn full of Roman [[copper]] medals was found at the tower. The tower also has a round shape, similar to other [[Punic-Roman towers in Malta]].&lt;ref name=lecrac/&gt;&lt;ref name=mahoney&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahoney|first=Leonardo|date=1994|editor=Henry Frendo and Oliver Friggieri|title=Malta Culture and Identity|chapter=Architecture|url=https://www.bdlbooks.com/culture/3326-malta-culture-and-identity.html|publisher=Books Distributors Limited|page=131|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the remains of an old and round building are those of a [[watchtower]]. The Xlejli Tower was built in the parametres of these remains in an architectural style to appear as a ‘ruined’ tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahoney|first=Leonard|date=1996|title=5000 Years of Architecture in Malta||url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=zf0pAQAACAAJ&amp;dq=5,000+years+of+architecture+in+Malta+Castellania&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5m5KVlqfSAhWEfhoKHd46BzkQ6AEIGTAA|publisher=Valletta Pub.|isbn=9789990958157|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest reference to the tower dates back to 1570, when it was described as a lookout tower built in the 12th or 13th century. The tower was almost definitely built as a [[watchtower]], since it has views of the southern part of Malta, stretching from [[Bengħisa]] to the [[Grand Harbour]].&lt;ref name=lecrac&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Jimmy|title=Xlejli Tower, Bettina Palace|url=http://lecrac.blogspot.com.mt/2014/10/xlejli-tower-bettina-palace.html|website=Le Crac: Buildings of the Order of St.John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, at the Convent and in the provinces|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226013407/http://lecrac.blogspot.com.mt/2014/10/xlejli-tower-bettina-palace.html|archivedate=26 December 2015|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the [[Palazzo Dorell]] was built close to the tower, and the latter was included in its grounds within a large walled garden. Since then, the tower has been closed for the public. The palace was the property of Marquees Bettina Testaferrata Dorell, and she restored the tower and decorated its interior. Due to this, it also became known as ''Bettina Tower'' after her.&lt;ref name=lecrac/&gt; She had actually named it&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Shirley Jackewicz (2001), [https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=t-kVAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=xlejli+tower&amp;dq=xlejli+tower&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTm7Cz5frJAhUFXRoKHR0fDkwQ6AEIJTAC "Malte"], Random House Incorporated, {{ISBN|9780847822867}}, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Xlejli'', which has a literal meaning of "tacked together" in old [[Maltese language|Maltese]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambry, D.; Trumb, David H. (1978), [https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=Zy0QAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=xlejli+tower&amp;dq=xlejli+tower&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTm7Cz5frJAhUFXRoKHR0fDkwQ6AEIGzAA "Country Life, Volume 165"], 1979, Nagel Publishers, {{ISBN|9782826307112}}, p. 844.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources suggest that though the foundations of the old tower were retained on site, the present tower was built within the remains around 1780.&lt;ref name=mahoney/&gt;
In [[World War II]], a bomb fell close to the tower, destroying a statue.&lt;ref name=lecrac/&gt; The bomb also destroyed an entire orchard.&lt;ref name=mahoney/&gt; The tower is built of Maltese limestone and purposely used shiny pieces of glass, with an appearance of a ruined tower( hence the name).&lt;ref name=mahoney/&gt;
