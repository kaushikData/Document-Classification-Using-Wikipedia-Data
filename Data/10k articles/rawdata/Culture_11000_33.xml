      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5161">{{Nihongo|'''''Aburatorigami'''''|あぶらとり紙}} is a traditional Japanese facial oil [[blotting paper]]. The direct translation of the term is "oil removal paper". As the term implies, ''aburatorigami'' absorbs excess oil, thereby eliminating shine from the face.
''Aburatorigami'' has traditionally been used by [[kabuki]] actors and [[geisha]] to keep makeup looking fresh throughout performances. In modern times it has been growing in popularity for everyday use amongst women for its various skincare and makeup benefits.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;

''Aburatorigami'' also works well to keep the balance of water and oil in the skin and prevents skin problems.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;

==Production==
Traditional ''aburatorigami'' is made from only the finest grade of the blotting paper [[abaca]] leaf, rather than [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] or [[rice paper]]. Although sometimes known as [[Manila hemp]], [[Cebu hemp]], or [[Davao hemp]], the abaca plant is not related to true [[hemp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=abaca|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/331/abaca|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Philippine_Fiber_Industry_Development_Authority|Philippine Bureau of Fiber and Inspection Service]] defines a total of 15 grades of abaca, the highest of which are derived from the leaf sheaths located closest to the center of the abaca stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogt|first=Kristina|title=Forests and Society: Sustainability and Life Cycles of Forests in Human Landscapes|year=2007|publisher=CAB International|location=USA|isbn=978-1-84593-098-1|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aburatorigami'' is essentially a by-product from a traditional craft process that is deeply rooted in [[Japanese culture]], effectively using material that might otherwise be thrown away.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Iles, Alastair Assistant Professor of Science, Technology &amp; Environment at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;  After ''aburatorigami'' is used, it can be [[compost]]ed and degraded naturally back into the earth. No oil-based chemicals are used in its production. As a result, aburatorigami has relatively low [[environmental impact]].&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;

==History==
''Aburatorigami'' was discovered for its oil-absorbing qualities several hundred years ago but was effectively present as a by-product of the [[gold leaf]] making process over a thousand years ago in [[Kyoto]]. Originally called ''hakuuchi-gami'', gold leaf artisans in [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]] used this specialty paper to protect the gold during the vigorous goldbeating technique.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;
[[File:Gold Beating Process.jpg|thumb|Goldbeating]]
During the [[Heian period]] (794-1192 AD), the demand was extremely high as gold was used in decorating temples and in providing the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] and the nobility with high-quality furnishings and crafts. Thus, much hakuuchi-gami was taken to Kyoto as wrapping for delicate gold leaf.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

During the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) rumors quickly spread throughout Kyoto that “Hakuuchi-gami makes you feel just like you’ve taken a bath!” People were surprised to see how much oil was absorbed by only a piece of thin paper, which was then thrown away. This was the moment when ''aburatorigami'' was born.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

== Usage ==
During the [[Edo period]], [[Minamiza]], the first [[Kabuki]] theater of Japan, was built in Kyoto in 1610. The kabuki actors, like [[geisha]], were especially grateful to have a product that would help keep their thick makeup on while absorbing excess oil and sweat, for their performances in non-air-conditioned theaters.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; As a result, the culture of aburatorigami began to flourish in Kyoto.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

''Aburatorigami'' were given to Japanese geisha in Kyoto, as a small present by the gold artisans who would linger around the [[teahouses]], the exclusive establishments also known as [[Ochaya]]. Geisha wore thick white foundation with limited time to touch up their makeup during performances. Geisha would also use ''aburatorigami'' to prepare and set their makeup, as they would commonly entertain for hours.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

Although descriptions of Aicha Kandicha vary from region to region within Morocco, she is generally though to live near water sources, and is said to use her beauty to seduce local men and then madden or kill them.

==Features==
Nearly all accounts of Aicha Kandicha identify her home as a nearby body of water. In [[Tangier]], this is thought to be the sea; in [[Tetouan]] it is the [[Martil river]], in [[Fes]] it is a drainage canal, and among the [[Beni Ahsen]] it is the [[Sebou river]]. There is also general agreement that she primarily preys upon young men, whom she entices with her beauty or by posing as their wives. More localized beliefs about Aicha Kandicha, such as those of the Beni Ahsen, include that she is afraid of steel knives and needles and that she has a husband (or male associate) known as Hammu Qayyu. In more southern regions of Morocco, including [[Doukkala]], she is instead called "Kharaja."&lt;ref name="westermarck1926" /&gt;

In the traditions of the Buffi [[Sufi]] order, Aicha Kandicha is only one of a number of female jinn with the given name Aicha, each of whom have different personalities. The Buffis believe her to wear black garments, have camel-like feet, cause pregnant women who see her to miscarry, and cause people she [[Spirit possession|possesses]] to bray or bark like animals.&lt;ref name="maruf2007"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 978-90-04-16099-6| last = Maʻrūf| first = Muḥammad| title = Jinn Eviction as a Discourse of Power: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Modern Morrocan Magical Beliefs and Practices| date = 2007| pages=106–107 | url=https://books.google.co.ma/books?id=9CdtKnHA6PsC}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Names that may be synonymous with Aicha Kandicha elsewhere—including "Sudanese Aicha" (''ʿayša s-sudaniya'') and "Aicha of the Sea" (''ʿayša l-bəḥriya'') -- are seen by the Buffis as unique entities.

==Origins==
[[Edvard Westermarck]] claimed that Aicha Kandicha's name is "distinctly of Eastern origin," co-identifying her with the temple harlot [[Qetesh]] in [[ancient Canaanite religion]] and tying her to the cult of the fertility goddess [[Astarte]]. Westermarck suggests that [[Colonies in antiquity#Phoenician colonies|Phoenician colonies]] in North Africa first introduced Kandicha, who was later folded into Islamic traditions while maintaining her licentious nature and association with aquatic environments. He also proposes that her associate Hammu Qayyu may be inspired by the Carthaginian fertility god [[Baal Hammon|Hammon]].&lt;ref name="westermarck1926" /&gt;

An alternate proposal is that Kandicha was derived from a real historical figure, namely a Moroccan "countess" (''contessa'') from [[el Jadida]] who helped resist the [[Moroccan–Portuguese conflicts|Portuguese]] by seducing soldiers, who were then killed by Moroccan fighters lying in wait.&lt;ref name="douider2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0151-1874| issue = 81| pages = 75–81| last = Douider| first = Samira| title = Deux mythes féminins du Maghreb : la Kahina et Aïcha Kandicha| journal = Recherches &amp; Travaux| accessdate = 2017-11-26| date = 2012-12-30| url = https://recherchestravaux.revues.org/547?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zamane"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Aicha Kandicha, la légende et le démon| website = Zamane| accessdate = 2017-11-26| url = http://zamane.ma/fr/aicha-kandicha-la-legende-et-le-demon-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Aicha Kandicha has been referenced in a number of Moroccan cultural works, including books, films, and songs.&lt;ref name="douider2012" /&gt; One example is the [[Gnawa music|Gnawa]] tune ''Lalla Aicha''.

In [[Māori mythology]], '''''Arawa''''' was one of the great [[Māori migration canoes|ocean-going, voyaging canoes]] that was used in the migrations that settled [[Aotearoa]].  

The [[Te Arawa]] confederation of [[Māori people|Māori]] [[iwi]] and [[hapu]] (tribes and sub-tribes) based in the [[Rotorua]] and [[Bay of Plenty]] areas of [[New Zealand]] trace their ancestry from this waka.&lt;ref name=ara&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-arawa "Te Arawa"], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Construction of the canoe==
A large tree was felled and from this the waka which came to be known as ''[[Te Arawa]]'' was formed.  The men who turned this log into a beautifully decorated canoe were Rata, Wahieroa, Ngaahue and Parata.  "Hauhau-te-rangi" and "Tuutauru" (made from New Zealand [[Pounamu|greenstone]] brought back by Ngaahue) were the adzes they used for this time-consuming and intensive work.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, 1967, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, the waka was given the name ''Ngaa raakau kotahi puu a Atua Matua'' (also known as ''Ngaa raakau maatahi puu a Atua Matua'').

The waka was completed and berthed in Whenuakura Bay while Tama-te-kapua, in his capacity as [[rangatira]] (chief) of the canoe, set about trying to find a [[tohunga]] (priest) for the journey.  [[Ngātoro-i-rangi]] and his wife Kearoa were tricked by Tama-te-kapua to board the canoe to perform the necessary appeasement incantations to the gods prior to the canoe's departure.  However, while they were on board, Tama-te-kapua signalled his men to quickly set sail, and before Ngātoro-i-rangi and his wife could respond they were far out to sea.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, 1967, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voyage to Aotearoa==
One of the more dramatic stories pertaining to the voyage to [[Aotearoa]] occurred because Tama-te-kapua became desirous of Kearoa.  Ngātoro-i-rangi noticed the glint in Tama-te-kapua's eye and took precautions to protect his wife during the night while he was on deck navigating by the stars.  This was done by tying one end of a cord to her hair and holding the other end in his hand.  However, Tama-te-kapua untied the cord from Kearoa's hair and attached it to the bed instead.  He then made love to her, following this pattern over a number of nights.  One night however, he was nearly discovered in the act by Ngātoro-i-rangi, but just managed to escape.  In his haste he forgot the cord.  Ngātoro-i-rangi noticed this and therefore knew that Tama-te-kapua had been with Kearoa.  He was furious and, in his desire to gain revenge, raised a huge whirlpool in the sea named ''Te korokoro-o-te-Parata'' ("The throat of Te Parata").  The waka was about to be lost with all on board but Ngātoro-i-rangi eventually took pity and caused the seas to become calm (Steedman, pp 99-100). 

One incident that occurred during this drama was that all the [[Sweet potato|kūmara]] carried on the waka were lost overboard, save for a few that were in a small [[kete (basket)|kete]] being clutched by Whakaotirang.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, 1967, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the calming of the seas, a shark (known as an '''arawa''') was seen in the water.  Ngātoro-i-rangi immediately renamed the waka '''Te Arawa''', after this shark, which then accompanied the waka to Aotearoa, acting in the capacity of a kai-tiaki (guardian).

The ''Arawa'' waka then continued on to Aotearoa without incident, finally sighting land at Whangaparaoa where feather headdresses were foolishly cast away due to greed and due to the beauty of the [[pohutukawa]] bloom. Upon landfall, an argument took place with members of the ''Tainui'' canoe over a beached whale and the ownership thereof. Tama-te-kapua again resorted to trickery and took possession of it despite rightful claim of the Tainui. The canoe then travelled north up the coast to the [[Coromandel Peninsula]], where Tama-te-kapua first sighted the mountain Moehau, a place he was later to make home.  Heading south again, it finally came to rest at [[Maketu]], where it was beached and stood until being burnt by Raumati of [[Taranaki (iwi)|Taranaki]] some years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, 1967, pp 17–18, 47)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some items of note that were brought to Aotearoa on the ''Arawa'', other than the precious kūmara saved by Whakaotirangi, was a  tapu kōhatu (stone) left by Ngātoro-i-rangi on the island Te Poito o te Kupenga a Taramainuku just off the coast of [[Cape Colville]].  This stone held the [[Mauri (life force)|mauri]] to protect the Te Arawa peoples and their descendants from evil times (Stafford, 1967, p17). In addition, the waka brought over two gods, one called Itupaoa, which was represented by a roll of [[tapa cloth|tapa]], and another stone carving now possibly buried at [[Mokoia Island]], Lake [[Rotorua]].&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, 1967, pp 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary audience===

Ask A Biologist materials are free and open to anyone with access to the [[World Wide Web|World-Wide-Web]]. The question portion of the program serves primarily students, grades pre[[K–12 (education)|K-12]], as well as their teachers and parents. In addition, lifelong learners are encouraged to use the website materials.

===History===

Ask A Biologist was launched late in 1997 in the School of Life Sciences, with an early version&lt;ref name="rc1"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Early Ask A Biologist Web Page
|accessdate=January 12, 2009
|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990222162859/http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/askabiologist/
|archivedate=February 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewable on the [[Internet Archive]] a.k.a. The WayBackMachine. Initially, the site consisted solely of a question submission form, a feature that remains one of its core activities.

By 2001, the site had grown to over 1,000 pages of content, including articles about current research, profiles of scientists, an image gallery, mystery images, puzzles, coloring pages, quizzes, and science activities.

In 2003, the website released the Virtual Pocket Seed Experiment, the first of several data sets that could be used in and outside of the classroom. The experiment was based on the classic seed germination experiment, but included the feature of time-lapse animation of various seed experiments.

In 2004, a second data set was released, in cooperation with [[Audubon International|Audubon]] Arizona. The Virtual Bird Aviary, included the majority of bird species found in the Southwest United States including more than 400 vocal recordings and companion [[Spectrogram|sonograms]], bird images, text descriptions, and range maps.

In 2005, the website was peer reviewed by the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT), earning a "five out of five star" rating.&lt;ref name="rc2"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Ask A Biologist
|date= 2005 |accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=MERLOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2006, the website introduced the Mysterious World of Dr. Biology a [[Comics in education|comic book]] adventure. The activity encouraged students to piece together a mystery. Students reconstructed a chain of events in the Dr. Biology laboratory and field site, writing their own narrative for the story.

Early in 2007, Ask A Biologist became one of the early content channels on [[iTunes]] U with its audio [[podcast]] of the same name. Hosted by Dr. Biology, the program was soon listed as one of five great courses by Macworld.&lt;ref name="rc3"&gt;{{cite web

|title=The iPod study buddy: Five Great Courses
|date=September 2007 |accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the guest scientists interviewed on the show included [[biologist]]s and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning authors [[Edward O. Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler]], as well as [[physicist]] and writer [[Paul Davies]].
 
In 2008, the audio podcast program introduced a co-host contest&lt;ref name="rc4"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewMaterial.htm?id=80436
|title=At the head(phones) of their class: Elementary school students win K-12 podcast contest
|accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; that offered students in the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metro area the opportunity to meet and interview working scientists.

In 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) funded the redesign of the Ask A Biologist website including the addition of [[Web 2.0]] tools as part of the [[National Science Digital Library]] (NSDL).

In 2010, Ask A Biologist released its new website developed using a Web content management tool [[Drupal]] and adding Web 2.0 options. The new content management expanded website features including translations of content into French and Spanish and an improved interface for audio streaming. The website was officially accessioned by the NSDL in September.

In 2011 two new sections were added to the website. Body Depot is a collaborative project with the [[Arizona Science Center]] funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). PLOSable is a project that links plain language and kid-friendly reviews to primary source publications in journals of the [[Public Library of Science]].

[[Image:Brosen city bicycle.jpg|thumb|right|Style of bicycle popular for urban commuting]]

'''Bicycle culture''' can refer to a mainstream culture that supports the use of [[bicycle]]s or to a [[subculture]].  Although "bike culture" is often used to refer to various forms of associated [[fashion]], it is erroneous to call fashion in and of itself a culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snob|first=Bike|title=Bike Snob: Systematically &amp; Mercilessly Realigning the World of Cycling [Hardcover]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cycling culture refers to cities and countries which support a large percentage of [[utility cycling]].  Examples include [[Bicycling in Denmark|Denmark]], the [[Cycling in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], Germany, Belgium (Flanders in particular), Sweden, China, Bangladesh and Japan. There are also towns in some countries where bicycle culture has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of [[Ílhavo Municipality|Ílhavo]], in [[Portugal]]. North American cities with strong bicycle cultures include [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]],&lt;ref&gt;http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/ACS_report_final_forweb_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[San Francisco]], [[Boston]], [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gptn.org/ |title=Great Plains Trails Network &amp;#124; Jogging, Biking, Walking, Horseback Riding Trails &amp;#124; Lincoln |publisher=Gptn.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], and the [[Twin Cities]].

A city with a strong bicycle culture usually has a well-developed [[cycling infrastructure]], including segregated [[bike lane]]s and extensive facilities catering to urban bicycles, such as [[Bicycle stand|bike rack]]s.

== Advocacy and activism subcultures ==
In some cities and countries, [[transportation infrastructure]] is focused on automobiles, and large portions of the population use cars as their only local mechanical transport. [[Bicycling advocates]] include those who advocate for an increase in population-wide commuting, acceptance of cycling, and legislation and infrastructure to promote and protect the safety and rights of cyclists.

Cycling advocacy often aims to improve community bike infrastructure, including aspects such as [[bike lane]]s, parking facilities, and access to public transportation.

Within the cycling community, activism may take many forms, and may include creative and practical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furness|first=Zack|title=One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include bike-related music, bike-related films, organized bike rides (often noncompetitive—i.e. [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] and [[World Naked Bike Ride]]), [[art bike]]s displays, printed-word materials (such as blogs, zines and magazines, stickers, and [[spoke card]]s), and the publication and distribution of books (such as: [[Thomas Stevens (cyclist)|Thomas Stevens]]'s  ''Around the World on a Bicycle'', [[Mark Twain]]'s essay "Taming the Bicycle" and [[H. G. Wells]]'s novel ''[[The Wheels of Chance]])''. There are hundreds of [[bicycle cooperative]]s offering spaces for cyclists to replace their own bikes and socialise.

=== Examples ===
[[Image:Moving by bike.jpg|thumb|Cyclists in [[Portland, Oregon]], move the contents of a house to demonstrate how bikes can be used for large tasks|alt=Cyclists pull covered trailers in the rain]]
Many cities contain [[subculture]]s of [[bicycle]] enthusiasts that include racers, [[bicycle messenger]]s, bicycle transportation activists, mutant bicycle fabricators, [[bicycle mechanic]]s, and [[bicycle commuter]]s.  Some such groups are affiliated with [[activism]] or [[counterculture]] groups.  These hybrid groups often organize activities such as competitive cycling, fun rides, protests, and [[civil disobedience]], such as [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]]. Some groups work to promote bicycle transportation ([[community bicycle program]]); others fix bicycles to give to children or the homeless ([[Bikes Not Bombs]]). There are also feminist groups of women of color who promote the empowerment of women through their rides such as [[Ovarian Psycos]].

Bicycle magazines and organizations give awards to cities for being "[[bicycle friendly]]". Examples include [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Austin]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Seattle]], and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]—all cities that promote bicycle culture.

[[Midnight Ridazz]] is a group of bicycle enthusiasts who ride every second Friday of the month in [[Los Angeles]], California to inspire more people to ride bicycles. Rides often exceed 1,000 cyclists. Similar midnight rides such as the Midnight Mystery rides of Portland and Victoria, the bi-monthly Midnight Mass of [[Vancouver BC]], and similar rides across the US and Europe have been growing in popularity.

== Mainstream bike cultures ==

Cycling is the norm in countries like Denmark and the Netherlands. In Denmark, 16 percent of all trips are made by bike—and as much as 50 percent of urban populations cycle to work and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cycling-embassy.dk/facts-about-cycling-in-denmark/statistics/|title=Facts about Cycling in Denmark - Cycling Embassy of Denmark|website=Cycling Embassy of Denmark|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/green-living/bicycle-culture/copenhageners-love-their-bikes/|title=Copenhageners love their bikes - The official website of Denmark|website=denmark.dk|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Amsterdam, Netherlands, 63 percent of Dutch people ride their bikes every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/media-centre/city-hall/dossier-cycling/cycling-facts-and-figures|title=Cycling facts and figures {{!}} I amsterdam|website=www.iamsterdam.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong cycling infrastructure helps encourage cycling in these cities, and so cycling is the fastest, most convenient way to get from one place to another.
[[File:Cycling Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Cycling in [[Amsterdam]] is the most common form of transit.]]
Mainstream bike cultures are characterized by notions of function over form. In mainstream bike cultures, there is less of a differentiation between cyclists and the rest of the population. People of all demographics cycle regularly, and most are less concerned about cycling attire and bike performance. It is not uncommon to see people cycle in business attire or on an old rusty bike.

In the 1890s, two drifters, Purvis ([[David Arquette]]) and Buddy ([[Sid Haig]]), are making a living robbing and killing travelers. Spooked by the sound of approaching horses, they hide in the hills and encounter a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] burial site. Buddy is killed by an arrow, and Purvis escapes.

Eleven days later, Purvis arrives in the small town of Bright Hope and buries his stolen belongings. Chicory ([[Richard Jenkins]]), the town's backup deputy, spots him and reports to Sheriff Franklin Hunt ([[Kurt Russell]]). At the town's saloon, Hunt confronts Purvis. When asked his name, Purvis hesitates before giving the name "Buddy" in an attempt to hide his identity. Sheriff Hunt shoots Purvis in the leg when he tries to escape. Hunt sends John Brooder ([[Matthew Fox]]), a local educated man and known womanizer who witnesses the shooting, to fetch the town's doctor. Meanwhile, foreman Arthur O'Dwyer ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]) rests at home with a broken leg. His wife Samantha ([[Lili Simmons]]), the doctor's assistant, tends to his wound. As the doctor is drunk, Brooder calls Samantha and escorts her to the jail to treat Purvis's wound. Leaving Samantha with Purvis and his deputy Nick ([[Evan Jonigkeit]]), Hunt and the others return home. That night, at a stable house, a stable boy is murdered by unseen attackers.

The murder is reported to Hunt, who investigates the scene and finds the horses missing. The jail is empty and only an arrow is left behind. Hunt sends for a local Native American man, whom he calls "the professor" ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), to examine the arrow, and informs Arthur of the news. At the saloon, the "professor" links the arrow to a [[Cave dweller|troglodyte]] clan. He tells Hunt of the clan's dwelling place, "Valley of the Starving Men", and warns him that they are a group of [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] savages. Certain that Samantha, Nick, and Purvis had been captured by them, Hunt prepares to go after them with Arthur. Chicory and Brooder volunteer to accompany them.

Days into their ride, two strangers stumble across their camp. Fearing they are scouts for a raid, Brooder kills them and they set up a cold camp elsewhere to avoid being attacked. During the night, a group of raiders ambushes them, injure Brooder's horse and steal the rest. Brooder, wounded by an attacker, regretfully puts down his horse. After a day of walking, a fight breaks out between Brooder and Arthur, exacerbating Arthur's broken leg. Chicory sets his leg and leaves him behind to recover, while he, Hunt, and Brooder move on.

At the valley, the three men are injured by a volley of arrows. After killing two attackers, Hunt and Chicory retreat, leaving Brooder, who is seriously injured and demands to be left behind. Brooder kills one attacker before being killed himself. The attackers capture Hunt and Chicory and imprison them in their cave. The men find Samantha, and an injured Nick, imprisoned in a nearby cage. They inform Hunt that the tribesmen have already killed and eaten Purvis. They witness Nick removed from his cell, stripped, brutally [[Scalping|scalped]], and [[Dismemberment|bisected alive]], then consumed. Samantha estimates the number of hostile cannibals to be around twelve (reduced to nine earlier by Hunt's posse).

Hunt realizes he has some [[Laudanum|opium tincture]] he confiscated from Arthur earlier to prevent him from overusing it. They lure several tribesmen to drink it, however only one drinks a fatal dose, and only one becomes unconscious. Meanwhile, Arthur wakes up, follows the men's trail and discovers the valley. He kills two tribesmen and notices an object embedded in their windpipes. After cutting one out, he realizes it is like a whistle. He blows on it, luring another tribesman close, then kills him.

In the cave, realizing two of their men were poisoned, the leader grows angry. He and another tribesman pull Hunt from his cell, cut open his abdomen and shove the hot opium flask into the wound. The leader then takes Hunt's rifle and shoots him in the arm and abdomen. Arthur arrives and kills one of the tribesmen, while Hunt kills the leader with one of the tribe's bone tomahawks. Arthur frees Samantha and Chicory, while a mortally wounded Hunt stays behind with his rifle. He prepares to kill the surviving cannibals when they return, to prevent them from terrorizing Bright Hope. As the three leave the cave, they see two pregnant females, who are blinded and have all their limbs amputated.

On their journey out, Arthur blows the tribesman's whistle, and with no response, they continue to exit. At a distance from the cave, they hear three gunshots, implying that Sheriff Hunt had killed the remaining males of the tribe. Chicory acknowledges the gunshots with a half-hearted smile and tosses aside the stone he had been carrying. Tired, hurt, and with few supplies, the three begin the journey towards home.

'''Breitling SA''' ({{IPA-de|braɪtliŋ}}) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Luxury goods|luxury]] [[watchmaker]] based in [[Grenchen]], [[Switzerland]]. The company was founded in 1884 by [[Léon Breitling]] in [[Saint-Imier]]. Breitling is known for precision-made [[COSC certified chronometer|chronometers]] designed for [[aviator]]s.

==History==
[[File:Scott Carpenter inside Aurora 7.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]] wearing a ''Breitling Cosmonaute'' inside the ''[[Aurora 7]]'' spacecraft on May 24, 1962.]]
Breitling SA was founded in [[Saint-Imier]], [[Bernese Jura]] by Léon Breitling in 1884.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite web | title=Breitling SA: Private Company Information | work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7606770 | accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst Schneider bought the company from the founding Breitling family in 1979 and it was owned by the Schneider family until 2017. Ernst's son, Theodore Schneider, sold the majority stake (80%) in Breitling to [[CVC Capital Partners]] for over $870m. The Schneider family still retains 20% control of Breitling.&lt;ref name="FinTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Megaw|first1=Nicolas|title=CVC to take majority stake in Swiss watchmaker Breitling|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0f9ec346-8d8d-3bef-83bd-14845dcee8a6|website=Financial Times|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Breitling sourced [[Movement (clockwork)|movements]] from suppliers such as [[Valjoux]], [[ETA SA|ETA]], and Venus rather than producing movements in-house. In 2009 Breitling developed the B01, an in-house self-winding, column wheel chronograph movement, used in the [[Breitling Chronomat]] 01 and subsequently Navitimer 01.&lt;ref name="WatchAnalyzer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ivkovic|first1=Boris|title=Breitling Caliber 01 – An Automatic Chronograph Movement Intended for Industrial Production|url=http://www.watchalyzer.com/education/movements/breitling-caliber-01-automatic-chronograph-movement/|website=Watch Analyzer|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
The company fits [[certified chronometer]]s in all models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=COSC - An External Referee |first=Jonathan |last=Bues |work=WorldTempus |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2014-10-10 |url=http://en.worldtempus.com/article/insider/cosc-external-referee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watches are usually marketed towards either diving (SuperOcean) or aviation (Navitimer). Aviation models such as the Navitimer offer aviation functions largely as complications, since their function in aviation has largely been replaced by modern electronic instruments. The styling of Breitling watches is characterized by polished cases, bracelets and large watch faces which are designed to improve readability. Many models have an [[automatic watch|automatic winding]] mechanism that is purely mechanical (i.e. using no electronic components) and frequently have [[Complication (horology)|complications]].

In the 1940s, Breitling added a [[circular slide rule]] to the bezel of their chronograph models for use by aircraft pilots. This became the famous ''Navitimer'' model. During the 1950s and 1960s, a version of the Navitimer was offered by the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] with the AOPA logo on the dial. In 1961, [[Scott Carpenter]], one of the original [[astronauts]] in the [[Mercury space program]], approached Breitling with the idea of incorporating a [[24 hour watch|24-hour dial]] instead of the normal 12-hour dial. This was needed because of the lack of day and night during space travel. Breitling complied, and produced the 24-hour Navitimer which Carpenter wore on his 1962 space flight. Breitling then proceeded to produce the 24-hour version as the so-called ''Cosmonaute'' Navitimer - under both Breitling and AOPA logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breitling.com/en/models/navitimer/navitimer-cosmonaute/|title=Breitling Navitimer: 1 &amp; 8 Watches - Breitling|author=|date=|website=Breitling|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, the use of logos for military aviation customers had also expanded to include various unit logos on the Aerospace and Chronospace Auto models, primarily those of squadrons and usually part of a group purchase by the pilots and navigators/flight officers of that particular unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingsquadron.com/forums/topic/20388-viper-breitling-order/|title=Viper Breitling Order|author=|date=|website=Baseops Forums|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency===
The ''Breitling Emergency'' watch contains a radio transmitter for [[civil aviation]] use which broadcasts on the [[Aircraft emergency frequency|121.5 MHz distress frequency]] and serves as a backup for [[Emergency Locator Transmitter|ELT]]-type airborne beacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganapati |first=Priya |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/10/steve-fossett-n/ |title=Fossett Was Not Wearing a Breitling Emergency Watch, Says Watchmaker &amp;#124; Gadget Lab |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For military users, the ''Emergency'' has a miniaturized transmitter operating on the 243.0&amp;nbsp;MHz military aviation emergency frequency. Under normal conditions&amp;mdash;flat terrain or calm seas&amp;mdash;the signal can be picked up at a range of up to 90 nautical miles (167&amp;nbsp;km) by search aircraft flying at 20,000 feet (6,000 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/the-digital-man/ESQ0505MAHBDIGITAL_48 |title=Time Saver |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |first=Barry |last=Sonnenfeld |authorlink=Barry Sonnenfeld |date=2005-05-01 |accessdate=2013-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713070723/http://www.esquire.com/features/the-digital-man/ESQ0505MAHBDIGITAL_48 |archivedate=2014-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 February 2009, the [[Cospas-Sarsat]] Satellite System has not monitored the 121.5/243.0&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency; however, the signal transmitted by the ''Emergency'' was never strong enough to be picked up by satellite, and Breitling has announced that, as these frequencies will still be monitored by aviation, particularly during the localization phase of a rescue attempt, there are no plans to modify the signal's frequency.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Reuters reported that in January 2003 two British pilots, [[Squadron Leader]] Steve Brooks and [[Flight Lieutenant]] Hugh Quentin-Smith, crashed their helicopter in Antarctica and were rescued after activating their Breitling Emergency transmitter watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven |last=Morris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/28/stevenmorris |title=Explorers or boys messing about?

The ''Emergency'' is available for customers who do not hold a pilot's licence, but they must sign an agreement stating that they will bear the full costs of a rescue intervention should they trigger the distress beacon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The model was heavily advertised by the ''[[Breitling Orbiter 3]]''&amp;mdash;both [[Brian Jones (aeronaut)|Brian Jones]] and [[Bertrand Piccard]] were wearing the ''Emergency''. Breitling sponsored the Orbiter 3 project, which in 1999 became the first balloon to completely orbit the Earth without landing. A commemorative Orbiter 3 version of the Emergency watch was subsequently produced, with a production run of 1,999.

===Emergency II===
In April 2013, Breitling announced a new version of the Emergency watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/29/breitling-releases-the-emergency-ii-a-watch-that-can-save-you-if-youre-trapped-on-the-island |title=Breitling Releases the Emergency II, a Watch That Can Save You If You’re Trapped on the Island|work=TechCrunch |first=John |last=Biggs |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This upgrade transmits on the 121.5&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency, but adds the 406.04&amp;nbsp;MHz signal that is [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|monitored by satellites]]. It has a separate, rechargeable battery for the transmitter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">[[Image:2012-01-26 Gernersgades Kaserne 1.JPG|thumb|300px|The building seen from Borgergade]] 
'''Bygningskulturens Hus''' ([[English language|English]] House of Architectural Heritage), the former '''Søetatens Pigeskole''' (English: The Naval Girls' School), is a listed [[Historicism (art)|Historicist]] building now serving as a centre for historic architecture and cultural heritage in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It is located in [[Borgergade]], next to [[Nyboder]].

==History==
Originally known as ''Søetatens Pigeskole'' (English: The Naval Girls' School), the school was founded by the Naval Ministry (''Marineministeriet''), to improve the education of the daughters of [[Royal Danish Navy|Navy]] personnel, such as sailors and craftsmen. The architect Bernhard Seidelin was charged with the design of the building, which was inaugurated in 1859. It was conveniently sited next to [[Nyboder]] but also served those from [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Nyholm]]. The school was intended for 450 girls aged from six to 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indenforvoldene.dk/borgergade%20111.html|title=Borgergade 111|language=Danish|publisher=indenforvoldene.dk|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school only existed for just over ten years. It was then converted into a naval cadet academy (''Søetatens Kadetskole''). The later [[Frederik IX of Denmark|Frederik IX]] was a student there for several years. The installation existed until shortly after [[World War II]] and was also known as Gernersgade Barracks. During the [[Occupation of Denmark|Occupation]], the barracks was a target in [[Operation Safari]], which disarmed and dissolved the Danish Army and Navy. At 4 in the morning, the gate was blown open and German soldiers stormed the building, opening machine gun fire against the doors. Two Danish soldiers were killed and five wounded.

[[Realdania|Realea]] (now Realdania Byg) acquired the building in 2003. It was subsequently put through a comprehensive refurbishment which adapted it to its current use.

==Architecture==
[[Image:2012-01-26 Gernersgades Kaserne 2.JPG|thumb|300px|The building from Gernersgade]] 
The Naval Girls' School is a four-wing building constructed in yellow brick to a typical [[Historicism (art)|Historicist]] design. It is on all sides decorated with [[lesene]]s and [[Lombard bands]]. The front on Borgergade is strictly symmetrical with a central projection topped by a triangular pediment. The building is pulled back from the street and surrounded by a wall in the same yellow brick. Its gate is located to the left of the main entrance, breaking with the overall symmetry of the complex, unlike what is seen in the original renders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realdaniabyg.dk/projekter/soeetatens-pigeskole/baggrund |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412103024/http://www.realdaniabyg.dk/projekter/soeetatens-pigeskole/baggrund |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-12 |title=Bygningskulturens Hus - Baggrund |language=Danish |publisher=Realdania Byg |accessdate=2013-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is centered on a large gym hall with an open gallery. The interior is richly decorated with wood carvings and reliefs created to designs by the sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].

==Activities==
The activities include minor conferences, meetings, workshops and public lectures. A number of organisations are based in the building:
* Bygningskultur Danmark
* BYFO Bygnings Frednings Foreningen
* By &amp; Land (Landsforeningen for Bygnings- og Landskabskultur)
* Bygherreforeningen

[[Islamabad]] ([[Urdu]]: اسلام آباد کی ثقافت) is the capital city of the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] that has a modern culture by synchronising itself with other capitals around the globe. Islamabad lies in a province of its own called [[Islamabad Capital Territory]].

==Tourism==
[[File:Faisal Maseet.JPG|thumb|Faisal Mosque]] 
[[Faisal Mosque]] is an important cultural landmark of the city and that attracts many tourists daily. Faisal Mosque built in 1986, was named after the Saudi Arabian King, [[Faisal bin Abdul Aziz]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.urdumania.com/world-in-urdu/shah-faisal-mosque-the-biggest-mosque-in-pakistan.php &lt;/ref&gt; It also serves the purpose of accommodating 24,000 Muslims that pray at this mosque.  Faisal Mosque that is designed by the Turks and financed by the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] includes calligraphy of Quranic Versus along the walls of the mosque. 

One of the landmarks for tourists is the [[Pakistan Monument]] built in 2007 located in Islamabad. This tourist attraction represents the patriotism and sovereignty of Pakistan. The design is shaped as a dome with petal-shaped walls that are engraved with arts portraying Pakistan’s other tourist landmarks such as the [[Badshahi Mosque]], [[Minar-e-Pakistan]] and [[Lahore Fort]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.travelersguide360.com/index.php/lets-visit-pakistan-national-monument-and-museum-in-islamabad-pakistan-4164/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407072049/http://www.travelersguide360.com/index.php/lets-visit-pakistan-national-monument-and-museum-in-islamabad-pakistan-4164/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of Pakistan on National Monument.JPG|thumb|The Pakistan Monument]]

Islamabad holds some of Pakistan's most prestigious museums such as [[Lok Virsa Museum]], Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage [[Shakarparian]] Park and prominent galleries such as the [[National Art Gallery, Pakistan|National Art Gallery]] and Gallery 6.

The Islamabad Museum contains many relics and artifacts dating back to the [[Gandhara]] period of the region, an intriguing fusion of Buddhist and Graeco-Roman styles. The living culture of Islamabad and Pakistan is best explored at [[Lok Virsa Museum]], as well as the Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage in [[Shakarparian]] Park.

Islamabad is built upon civilization and architecture that ranges from the 10th Century to the modern era. As Islamabad is situated on the [[Potohar Plateau]], the remains of civilization descending from stone-age era include the Acheulian and the Soanian traditions and these are tourist landmarks. Islamabad has an array of historic landmarks that reflect the Hindu civilization that dates back to the 16th Century with examples such as [[Saidpur, Islamabad|Saidpur]]. Saidpur that is situated in Islamabad has progressed from a village to a sacred place that includes temples where the Hindu Mughal Commanders worshipped.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.islamabadthecapital.com/culture-of-islamabad/ &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margalla Hills National Park]] is located in the North sector of Islamabad and is in close proximity to the [[Himalayas]]. The National Park includes of picturesque valleys and scenic hills that include various wildlife such as [[Himalayan goral]], Barking deer and [[leopards]]. Flanked by wildlife and vegetation, Margalla Hills National Park also includes accommodation and camping grounds for tourists.

==Cuisine==

Islamabad is home to many diplomats, government officials and foreign workers and is reflected in their cuisine. Islamabad celebrates food festivals through its ethnic groups with examples such as the Food Festival 2011, Austrian Food Festival 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/embassy/islamabad/activities/2013/austrian-food-festival-2013.html &lt;/ref&gt; and Swiss Food Festivals.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://pakobserver.net/201311/03/detailnews.asp?id=222562 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082251/http://pakobserver.net/201311/03/detailnews.asp?id=222562 |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Pakistan is known for its diverse, traditional food options such as [[Nihari]], [[Halwa Poori]], [[Dal|Daal]], [[Chapli Kebab]], Islamabad's cuisine has further developed as they now have foreign franchises such as [[McDonald's]], [[KFC]], [[Hardees]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[T.G.I. Friday's|TGI Fridays]],Cinnamon Café and China Grill. Fast food chains are as common as traditional food outlets in Islamabad.

==Entertainment==
[[File:Front Door-National Art Gallery Islamabad.JPG|Entrance of the National Art Gallery in Islamabad|thumb]]
Islamabad is frequently mentioned and referred to in popular culture and fiction. The 2010 movie ''[[Slackistan]]'' is notably based on young teenagers living in Islamabad.&lt;ref&gt; http://perezhilton.com/tag/slackistan/#.Uzz9XNy25uY &lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
[[File:De architectura.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1521 [[Italian language]] edition of ''De architectura'', translated and illustrated by [[Cesare Cesariano]]]]
[[File:De Architectura027.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Manuscript of Vitruvius; parchment dating from about 1390]]
'''{{lang|la|De architectura}}''' ('''''On architecture''''', published as '''''Ten Books on Architecture''''') is a treatise on [[architecture]] written by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[architect]] and military engineer [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] and dedicated to his patron, the emperor [[Caesar Augustus]], as a guide for [[Caesar Augustus#Building projects|building projects]]. As the only treatise on architecture to survive from antiquity, it has been regarded since the Renaissance as the first book on architectural theory, as well as a major source on the canon of classical architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Kruft, Hanno-Walter. ''A History of Architectural Theory from Vitruvius to the Present'' (New York, Princeton Architectural Press: 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a variety of information on Greek and Roman buildings, as well as prescriptions for the planning and design of military camps, cities, and structures both large (aqueducts, buildings, baths, harbours) and small (machines, measuring devices, instruments).&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius. ''Ten Books on Architecture'', Ed. Ingrid Rowland with illustrations by Thomas Noble Howe (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press: 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Vitruvius published before the development of cross vaulting, domes, concrete, and other innovations associated with Imperial Roman architecture, his ten books are not regarded as a source of information on these hallmarks of Roman building design and technology.&lt;ref&gt;See William L. MacDonald, ''The Architecture of the Roman Empire: An Introductory Study'' (New Haven, Yale University Press: 1982): 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and contents==
Probably written between 30 and 15 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Directory GmbH|url=http://www.vitruvius-pollio.com/|publisher=Vitruvius-pollio.com|accessdate=03-09-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it combines the knowledge and views of many antique writers, both Greek and Roman, not only on architecture but on the arts, natural history and building technology. Vitruvius cites many authorities throughout the text, often praising Greek architects for their development of temple building and the orders (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), and providing key accounts of the origins of building in the primitive hut.

Though often cited for his famous "triad" of characteristics associated with architecture—utilitas, firmitas and venustas (commodity, firmness and delight)--the aesthetic principles that influenced later treatise writers were outlined in Book III. Derived partially from Latin rhetoric (through Cicero and Varro), Vitruvian terms for order, arrangement, proportion, and fitness for intended purposes have guided architects for centuries, and continue to do so today. The Roman author also gave advice on the qualifications of an architect (Book I) and on types of architectural drawing.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: Vitruvius: ''On Architecture'', edited and translated into English by Frank Granger (Cambridge, Harvard University Press: 1931-34).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten books or scrolls are organized as follows:

''De architectura'' – ''[[s:Ten Books on Architecture|Ten Books on Architecture]]''
{{numbered list|style=upper-roman|
|[[Urban planning|Town planning]], [[architecture]] or [[civil engineering]] in general, and the qualifications required of an [[architect]] or the [[civil engineer]]
|[[Building material]]s
|[[Roman temple|Temples]] and the [[orders of architecture]]
|''continuation of book III''

|Water supplies and [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]]
|Sciences influencing architecture – [[geometry]], [[measurement]], [[astronomy]], [[History of sundials|sundial]]
|Use and construction of [[machines]] – [[Roman siege engines]], [[water mill]]s, drainage machines, [[Roman technology]], [[Hoist (device)|hoisting]], [[pneumatics]]
}}
Roman architects were skilled in engineering, art, and craftsmanship combined. Vitruvius was very much of this type, a fact reflected in ''De architectura''. He covered a wide variety of subjects he saw as touching on architecture. This included many aspects that may seem irrelevant to modern eyes, ranging from mathematics to astronomy, meteorology, and medicine. In the Roman conception, architecture needed to take into account everything touching on the physical and intellectual life of man and his surroundings.

Vitruvius, thus, deals with many theoretical issues concerning architecture. For instance, in Book {{roman|2}} of ''De architectura'', he advises architects working with bricks to familiarise themselves with pre-Socratic theories of matter so as to understand how their materials will behave. Book {{roman|9}} relates the abstract [[geometry]] of [[Plato]] to the everyday work of the [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]. [[Astrology]] is cited for its insights into the organisation of human life, while [[astronomy]] is required for the understanding of [[sundial]]s. Likewise, Vitruvius cites [[Ctesibius|Ctesibius of Alexandria]] and [[Archimedes]] for their inventions, [[Aristoxenus]] ([[Aristotle]]'s apprentice) for music, [[Agatharchus]] for theatre, and [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] for architecture.

===Buildings===
[[File:Greekhse1.jpg|right|thumb|Greek house plan by Vitruvius]]
Vitruvius sought to address the ethos of architecture, declaring that quality depends on the social relevance of the artist's work, not on the form or workmanship of the work itself. Perhaps the most famous declaration from ''De architectura'' is one still quoted by architects:  "Well building hath three conditions: firmness, commodity, and delight."  This quote is taken from Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s version of 1624, and is a plain and accurate translation of the passage in Vitruvius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#3.2 (I.iii.2)]: but English has changed since then, especially in regard to the word "commodity", and the tag is usually misunderstood. A modern interpretation of Wotton's English might render it thus: "The ideal building has three elements; it is sturdy, useful, and beautiful."

Vitruvius also studied human proportions (Book {{roman|3}}) and his ''canones'' were later encoded in a very famous drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (''Homo Vitruvianus'', "[[Vitruvian Man]]").

==Roman technology==
[[File:ballista.gif|thumb|left|A Roman Ballista]]

[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]]]]
''De architectura'' is important for its descriptions of many different machines used for engineering structures, such as hoists, [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, and [[pulleys]], as well as war machines such as [[catapult]]s, [[ballistae]], and [[siege engine]]s.  Vitruvius also described the construction of sundials and [[water clock]]s, and the use of an [[aeolipile]] (the first [[steam engine]]) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).

===Aqueducts and mills===
Books {{roman|8}}, {{roman|9}}, and {{roman|10}} of ''De architectura'' form the basis of much of what is known about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France.  Numerous such massive structures occur across the former empire, a testament to the power of [[Roman engineering]].  Vitruvius' description of Roman aqueduct construction is short, but mentions key details especially for the way they were surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed.

His book would have been of assistance to [[Frontinus]], a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many [[aqueducts of Rome]]. Frontinus wrote ''[[De aquaeductu]]'', the definitive treatise on 1st-century Roman aqueducts, and discovered a discrepancy between the intake and supply of water caused by illegal pipes inserted into the channels to divert the water. The Roman Empire went far in exploiting water power, as the set of no fewer than 16 [[water mill]]s at [[Barbegal]] in France demonstrates. The mills ground grain in a very efficient operation, and many other mills are now known, such as the much later [[Hierapolis sawmill]].

===Materials===
Vitruvius described many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as [[stucco]] painting. [[Cement]], [[concrete]], and [[lime (material)|lime]] received in-depth descriptions, the longevity of many Roman structures being mute testimony to their skill in building materials and design.

Vitruvius advised that [[lead]] should not be used to conduct drinking water, clay pipes being preferred.  He comes to this conclusion in Book {{roman|8}} of ''De architectura'' after empirical observation of the apparent laborer illnesses in the [[plumbum]] foundries of his time. In 1986, the United States banned the use of lead in plumbing due to lead poisoning's neurological damage. However, much of the water used by Rome and many other cities was very hard, and coated the inner surfaces of the pipes, so [[lead poisoning]] was unlikely.
[[File:VitruviusTenBooksMHMorgan1914p295.gif|thumb|right|Design for an Archimedean water-screw]]
Vitruvius related the famous story about Archimedes and his detection of adulterated gold in a royal crown. When Archimedes realized the volume of the crown could be measured exactly by the displacement created in a bath of water, he ran into the street with the cry of [[Eureka (word)|''"Eureka!"'']], and the discovery enabled him to compare the density of the crown with pure gold. He showed the crown had been alloyed with silver, and the king was defrauded.

===Dewatering machines===
[[File:Archscrew2.jpg|left|thumb|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]
[[File:WaterwheelsSp.jpg|right|thumb|Sequence of drainage wheels found in Spanish mine]]
Vitruvius described the construction of the [[Archimedes' screw]] in Chapter 10, although did not mention Archimedes by name.  It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and dewater mines. Other lifting machines mentioned in ''De architectura'' include the endless chain of buckets and the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water have been discovered in old mines such as those at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain and [[Dolaucothi]] in west Wales. One of the wheels from Rio Tinto is now in the [[British Museum]], and one from the latter in the [[National Museum of Wales]]. The remains were discovered when these mines were reopened in modern mining attempts. They would have been used in a vertical sequence, with 16 such mills capable of raising water at least {{convert|96|ft|abbr=out}} above the water table. Each wheel would have been worked by a miner treading the device at the top of the wheel, by using cleats on the outer edge. That they were using such devices in mines clearly implies that they were entirely capable of using them as [[water wheels]] to develop power for a range of activities, not just for grinding wheat, but also probably for sawing timber, crushing ores, [[fulling]], and so on.

===Force pump===
[[Ctesibius]] is credited with the invention of the [[force pump]], which Vitruvius described as being built from [[bronze]] with valves to allow a head of water to be formed above the machine. The device is also described by [[Hero of Alexandria]] in his ''Pneumatica''. The machine is operated by hand in moving a lever up and down. He mentioned its use for supplying fountains above a reservoir, although a more mundane use might be as a simple fire engine. One was found at [[Roman Silchester]] or [[Calleva Atrebatum]] in England, and another is on display at the [[British Museum]]. Their functions are not described, but they are both made in bronze, just as Vitruvius specified.

Vitruvius also mentioned the several [[automaton]]s [[Ctesibius]] invented, and intended for amusement and pleasure rather than serving a useful function.

===Central heating===
[[File:Hypocaustum.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa: The part under the ''[[exedra]]'' is covered.]]
Vitruvius described the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the [[hypocaust]], a type of [[central heating]] where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of [[public bath]]s and [[villa]]s. He gave explicit instructions on how to design such buildings so [[fuel efficiency]] is maximized; for example, the ''[[caldarium]]'' is next to the ''[[tepidarium]]'' followed by the ''[[frigidarium]]''. He also advised using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture, which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he did not suggest it himself, his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel likely were used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger ''thermae'', such as the [[Baths of Diocletian]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla]].

===Surveying instruments===
That Vitruvius must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or ''[[chorobates]]'', which he compared favourably with the ''[[groma surveying|groma]]'', a device using [[plumb line]]s. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He described the ''[[Surveyor's wheel|hodometer]]'', in essence a device for automatically measuring distances along roads, a machine essential for developing accurate itineraries, such as the [[Peutinger Table]].

===Sea level change===
In Book {{roman|4}} Chapter 1 Subsection 4 of ''De architectura'' is a description of 13 [[Athenian]] cities in [[Asia Minor]], "the land of [[Caria]]", in present-day Turkey. These cities are given as: [[Ephesus]], [[Miletus]], [[Myus]], [[Priene]], [[Samos]], [[Teos]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], [[Chius]], [[Erythrae]], [[Phocaea]], [[Clazomenae]], [[Lebedos]], [[Malta#History|Melite]], and later a 14th, [[Smyrna]]eans. Myus, the third city, is described as being "long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage".  This sentence indicates, at the time of Vitruvius's writing, it was known that sea-level change and/or land subsidence occurred. The layout of these cities is in general from south to north so that it appears that where Myrus should be located is inland. If this is the case, then since the writing of ''De architectura'', the region has experienced either soil rebound or a sea-level fall. Though not indicative of sea-level change, or speculation of such, during the later-empire many Roman ports suffered from what contemporary writers described as 'silting'. The constant need to dredge ports became a heavy burden on the treasury and some have speculated that this expense significantly contributed to the eventual collapse of the empire. Roman salt works in Essex County, England, today are located at the five-metre contour, implying this was the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilman, Paul |title="Securing a Future for Essex's Past" Heritage Conservation Planning Division, Essex County Council England|publisher=Esri.com|url=http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/1099/essex.html|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Survival and rediscovery==
Vitruvius' work is one of many examples of Latin texts that owe their survival to the palace ''[[scriptorium]]'' of [[Charlemagne]] in the early 9th century. (This activity of finding and recopying classical [[manuscript]]s is part of what is called the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].) Many of the surviving manuscripts of Vitruvius' work derive from an existing manuscript that was written there, [[British Library]] manuscript Harley 2767.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8557&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=2767 |title=Details of an item from the British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2003-11-30 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These texts were not just copied, but also known at the court of Charlemagne, since his historian, bishop [[Einhard]], asked the visiting English churchman [[Alcuin]] for explanations of some technical terms.  In addition, a number of individuals are known to have read the text or have been indirectly influenced by it, including: Vussin, [[Hrabanus Maurus]], [[Hermann of Reichenau]], [[Hugo of St. Victor]], Gervase of Melkey, [[William of Malmesbury]], Theoderich of St. Trond, [[Peter the Deacon|Petrus Diaconus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Filippo Villani]], [[Jean de Montreuil]], [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Giovanni de Dondi]], Domenico di Bandino, [[Niccolò Acciaioli]] bequeathed copy to the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence]], [[Bernward of Hildesheim]], and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Many copies of ''De architectura'', dating from the 8th to the 15th centuries, did exist in manuscript form during the [[Middle Ages]] and 92 are still available in public collections, but they appear to have received little attention, possibly due to the obsolescence of many specialized Latin terms used by Vitruvius {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and the loss of most of the original 10 illustrations thought by some to be helpful in understanding parts of the text.

Vitruvius' work was "rediscovered" in 1414 by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Poggio Bracciolini]], who found it in the Abbey of [[St Gallen]], Switzerland. He publicized the manuscript to a receptive audience of [[Renaissance]] thinkers, just as interest in the classical cultural and scientific heritage was reviving.
[[File:De Architectura030.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', illustration in the edition of ''De architectura'' by Vitruvius; illustrated edition by Cesare Cesariano (1521)]]

The first printed edition (''editio princeps''), an ''[[incunabula]]'' version,  was published by the [[Verona|Veronese]] scholar [[Fra Giovanni Sulpitius]] in 1486 (with a second edition in 1495 or 1496), but none were illustrated. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Fra Giovanni Giocondo]] produced the first version illustrated with [[woodcut]]s in [[Venice]] in 1511. It had a thorough philosophical approach and superb illustrations.

Translations into Italian were in circulation by the 1520s, the first in print being the translation with new illustrations by [[Cesare Cesariano]], a Milanese friend of the architect [[Bramante]], printed in [[Como]] in 1521. It was rapidly translated into other European languages{{spaced ndash}}the first German version was published in 1528{{spaced ndash}}and the first French versions followed in 1547 (but contained many mistakes). The first Spanish translation was published in 1582 by Miguel de Urrea and Juan Gracian. The most authoritative and influential edition was publicized in French in 1673 by [[Claude Perrault]], commissioned by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1664.

The first English translation followed in 1692, although [[John Shute (architect)|John Shute]] had drawn on the text as early as 1563 for his book ''The First and Chief Grounds of Architecture''. The 1692 translation was an abridgment based on the French version of Claude Perrault.  English-speakers had to wait until 1771 for a full translation of the first five volumes and 1791 for the whole thing. Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s 1624 version ''The Elements of Architecture'' was more of a free adaptation than a literal translation, while a 1692 translation was much abbreviated. Thanks to the art of printing, Vitruvius' work had become a popular subject of [[hermeneutics]], with highly detailed and interpretive illustrations, and became widely dispersed.

==Impact==
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|''Vitruvian man'', Leonardo da Vinci, (c. 1485-90)]]
The rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the [[Renaissance]], prompting the rebirth of Classical architecture in subsequent centuries. Renaissance architects, such as [[Niccoli]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]], found in ''De architectura'' their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a [[scientific discipline]] as well as emphasising the skills of the [[artisan]].  [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s  best known drawing, ''the [[Vitruvian man]]'', is based on the concepts of proportion developed by Vitruvius.

The English architect [[Inigo Jones]] and the Frenchman [[Salomon de Caus]] were among the first to re-evaluate and implement those disciplines that Vitruvius considered a necessary element of architecture: arts and [[science]]s based upon number and [[proportion (architecture)]]. The 16th-century architect [[Palladio]] considered Vitruvius his master and guide, and made some drawings based on Vitruvius' work before conceiving his own architectural precepts.

===Astrolabe===
The earliest evidence of use of the [[stereographic projection]] in a machine is in ''De architectura'' which describes an anaphoric clock (it is presumed, a clepsydra or [[water clock]]) in Alexandria. The clock had a rotating field of stars behind a wire frame indicating the hours of the day. The wire framework (the spider) and the star locations were constructed using the stereographic projection. Similar constructions dated from the 1st to 3rd centuries have been found in Salzburg and northeastern France, so such mechanisms were, it is presumed, fairly widespread among Romans.

'''Declarations of financial interests''' are a means of making [[conflict of interest]]s
of people in public office known and to reduce them by making them public.

== European Parliament ==
[[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are required to declare their financial interests or assets that could create a situation of conflict in the performance of their duties.

As in a majority of the Member States, Members of the European Parliament have an obligation to declare their financial interests at the moment of taking office as well as orally when a Member has an interest in one of the issues being debated at a sitting.

Members of the European Parliament are also required to update their declaration of financial interests every year. Their declarations are included in the public register kept by the Quaestors. The register is public and may be consulted by anyone in Parliament's three places of work ([[Strasbourg]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Brussels]]) via the [[Internet]] on the MEP's page in the online register.

In vote on March 11, 1999, about the report A4-0070/99 (Corbett, Gutiérrez Diaz, Palacio Vallelersundi) was adopted, numerous changes to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament designed to enable Parliament to adjust to the workings of the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] have been adopted:

MEPs voted to tighten the rules relating to the declaration of financial interests. The rule thus stipulates that the names of members who have not completed the register within the due time limit will be published in the minutes after due warning. The rule then goes on to state ''"if the member continues to refuse to submit the declaration after the infringement has been published,The President shall take action in accordance with Rule 124 to suspend the member concerned."''

The original proposal to oblige members to declare all benefits above .100 was not approved, but another amendment designed to exclude members not completing the register from office in the Parliament did go through as did the amendment obliging chairmen of [[intergroup]]s and other unofficial grouping to declare all forms of financial or secretarial support.

The '''Deity Figure from Rarotonga''' is an important wooden sculpture of a male god that was made on the [[Pacific]] island of [[Rarotonga]] in the [[Cook Islands]]. The idol was given to English missionaries in the early nineteenth century as the local population converted to [[Christianity]]. It was eventually bought by the [[British Museum]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/w/wooden_figure.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Provenance==
The wooden figure was made on the island of Rarotonga in the late eighteenth century or early nineteenth century. After Captain [[James Cook]]'s first sighting of the archipelago in 1773, Europeans began to visit the Cook Islands in the early nineteenth century as part of the [[colonisation]] of territories in the Pacific. This went hand-in-hand with mass conversion of the population to [[Christianity]]. At that time British [[missionaries]] were very active in the area and this idol was probably given up to the [[London Missionary Society]] after 1827, when they set up a mission on Rarotonga. The LMS initially loaned their important collection of [[Oceanic art|Polynesian]] sculptures to the British Museum but later sold it to the national collection in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=502629&amp;partId=1&amp;place=11728&amp;plaA=11728-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The small statue of the god is carved from highly polished ironwood (''[[Casuarina equisetifolia]]''). Shown standing upright, small [[anthropomorphic]] figurines are carved in high relief around the chest and arms. [[Coir]] bindings along the arm cover remains of a cloth and feathers that would have once been worn by the deity. The exact meaning and name of this masculine [[Cult image|idol]] remains unknown but, based on its artistic style (particularly the distinctive formation of the eyes), it has been attributed to a workshop on the island of Rarotonga. Only one other similar figure, from the [[George Ortiz]] collection, is known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgeortiz.com/ortiz_test/indexv.asp?itemid=v274 George Ortiz Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the late medieval religious movement, see [[Devotio Moderna]]. See also [[Devotion (disambiguation)]].''
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''''devotio''''' was an extreme form of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|votum]]'' in which a [[Roman general]] vowed to sacrifice his own life in battle along with the enemy to [[chthonic]] gods [[do ut des|in exchange for]] a victory. The most extended description of the ritual is given by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]], regarding the self-sacrifice of [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|Decius Mus]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy 8.9; for a brief introduction and English translation of the passage, see [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=APcX1KKHF9wC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=devotio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=22#v=onepage&amp;q=devotio&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BC, ''devotio'' could mean more generally "any prayer or ritual that consigned some person or thing to the gods of the underworld for destruction."&lt;ref&gt;James B. Rives, "Magic, Religion, and Law: The Case of the ''{{ill|Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiis|it|Lex Cornelia Sullæ de sicariis et veneficis}}''," in ''Religion and Law in Classical and Christian Rome'' (Franz Steiner, 2006), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The invocation==
Livy preserves the prayer formula used for making a ''devotio''. Although Livy was writing at a time when the religious innovations of [[Augustus]] were often cloaked in old-fashioned [[pietas|piety]] and appeals to [[mos maiorum|tradition]], archaic aspects of the prayer suggest that it is not an invention, but represents a traditional formulary as might be preserved in the official [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|pontifical books]]. The attending ''[[College of Pontiffs|pontifex]]'' even dictates the wording. The syntax is repetitive and disjointed, unlike prayers given literary dress during this period in the poetry of [[Ovid]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Klinghardt, "Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion." ''Numen'' 46 (1999), pp. 4, 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The deities invoked — among them the [[Capitoline Triad|Archaic Triad]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], and [[Quirinus]] — belong to the earliest religious traditions of Rome. Livy even explains that he will record the archaic ritual of ''devotio'' at length because "the memory of every human and religious custom has withered from a preference for everything novel and foreign."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 8.11.1: ''omnis divini humanique moris memoria abolevit nova peregrinaque omnia praeferendo''; Andrew Feldherr, ''Spectacle and Society in Livy's History'', (University of California Press, 1998), p. 41, note 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer is uttered by [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]], the [[Roman consul|consul]] of 340 BC, during the [[Samnite Wars]]. He vows to offer himself as a sacrifice to the infernal gods when a battle between the Romans and the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] has become desperate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''[[College of Pontiffs|pontifex]]'' instructed him to don the ''[[toga praetexta]]'', to [[Capite velato|veil his head]] and, with one hand held out from under his toga touching his chin, to stand on a spear laid under his feet and speak as follows: '[[Janus]], Jupiter, [[Mars (mythology)#Mars Pater|Mars Pater]], Quirinus, [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], [[Lares]], divine [[Novensiles]],&lt;ref&gt;That the ''novensiles'' would appear in such a list at all, and before the ''indigetes'', is surprising if they are "new," one of the explanations for the ''nov-'' element of their names. See Robert Schilling, "Roman Gods," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), pp. 70–71; Beard, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'', p. 158; Roger D. Woodard, ''Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006), pp. 7–8; William Francis Allen, "The Religion of the Ancient Romans," in ''Essays and Monographs'' (Boston, 1890), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Di indigetes|divine Indigetes]], gods whose power extends over us and over our enemies, divine [[Manes]], I pray to you, I revere you, I beg your favour and beseech you that you advance the strength and success of the [[SPQR|Roman people]] … As I have pronounced in these words … I devote the [[Roman legion|legions]] and [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] of the enemy along with myself, to the divine Manes and to [[Terra (mythology)|Earth]].'&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 8.9.6; for the full passage with introduction and note, see Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 2,  p. 157 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xQd82l39KX4C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=%22before+leading+their+men+into+battle%22+intitle:sourcebook&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22before%20leading%20their%20men%20into%20battle%22%20intitle%3Asourcebook&amp;f=false online.] See also [[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "The Origin of the Goddess Venus," in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), p. 170, note 5; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both the Lares and the Manes are often regarded in ancient sources as the deified dead.

[[Macrobius]] says that the general who offers himself "touches the earth while saying [[Tellus (goddess)|Tellus]], and raises his hands toward heaven when pronouncing the name of Jupiter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 3.9.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Evocatio''==
Another ''votum'' that might be made in the field by a general was the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|evocatio]]'', a ritual by means of which the [[tutelary deity]] of the enemy, particularly that of a city under siege, might be induced to come over to the Roman cause by the promise of superior cult.

==Other ''devotiones''==
[[Tacitus]] refers to the magic charms uncovered in connection with the poisoning of [[Germanicus]] as ''devotiones'', indicating that the word had expanded its meaning to include other ritual acts in which an individual sought to harm and even kill another.&lt;ref&gt;Rives, "Magic, Religion, and Law," pp. 47, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiological Significance==
In the 1970s, an investigation was conducted by Indonesian physicians concerned about the high rates of Ekari people hospitalized for burns. The study revealed many Ekari people were suffering from [[neurocysticercosis]], caused by the [[pork tapeworm]], ''Taenia solium'', which had been previously unseen in Papua New Guinea. As a result, many had been suffering seizures while in close proximity to fires, injuring themselves in the process. Pigs infected with the tapeworms had been introduced to the island previously by the Indonesian Military.&lt;ref&gt;"How the West (Papua) Was Won." Cultural Survival. N.p., Dec. 1987.

An '''evil corporation''' is a [[wikt:trope|trope]] in [[popular culture]] that portrays a [[corporation]] as ignoring [[social responsibility]] in order to make money for its shareholders.&lt;ref name="allan"&gt;{{cite news | last=Allan | first=Angela | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/evil-corporation-trope/479295/ | title=How the 'Evil Corporation' Became a Pop-Culture Trope | work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=April 25, 2016 | accessdate=January 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Angela Allan writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', the notion is "deeply embedded in the landscape of contemporary culture—populating films, novels, videogames, and more." The [[science fiction]] genre served as the initial background to portray corporations in this [[dystopian]] light.&lt;ref name="allan" /&gt; Evil corporations can be seen to represent the danger of combining [[capitalism]] with larger [[hubris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=McHenry | first=Jackson | url=https://www.gq.com/story/mr-robot-e-corp | title=''Mr. Robot''{{'}}s Chilling Message: Every Corp Is E Corp | work=[[GQ]] | date=August 26, 2015 | accessdate=January 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In real life, too, corporations have been accused of being evil. To guard against such accusations, [[Google]] adopted the official motto "[[Don't be evil]]",&lt;ref name="allan" /&gt; which it later silently abandoned following an employee exodus in protest of a [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|military drone]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393|title=Google Removes 'Don't Be Evil' Clause From Its Code of Conduct|last=Conger|first=Kate|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/62225-google-drone-project-maven-letter.html|title=Google Employees Are Livid About Company's 'Evil' Military Partnership|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that "many food activists consider [[Monsanto]] to be ''the'' definitively evil corporation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Specter | first=Michael | url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-the-climate-corporation-sold-itself-to-monsanto | title=Why the climate corporation sold itself to Monsanto | journal=[[The New Yorker]] | date=November 4, 2013 | accessdate=January 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Debate over Corporate Social Responsibility'' wrote, "For many consumers, [[Wal-Mart]] serves as the evil corporation prototype, but record numbers shop at the stores for low prices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-last1=Kendall | author-first1=Brenden E. | author-last2=Gill | author-first2=Rebecca | author-last3=Cheney | author-first3=George | year=2007 | chapter=Consumer Activism and Corporate Social Responsibility: How Strong a Connection? | editor-last1=May | editor-first1=Steven K. | editor-last2=Cheney | editor-first2=George | title=The Debate over Corporate Social Responsibility | publisher=Oxford University Press | page=258 | isbn=978-0-19-517883-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, a committee of journalists and rights activists issues an annual "corporate raspberry award" known as Most Evil Corporation of the Year Award (also called the Black Company Award) to [[Black company (Japanese term)|a company "with a culture of overwork, discrimination and harassment"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kikuchi | first=Daisuke | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/23/national/social-issues/ad-giant-dentsu-declared-evil-corporation-year/ | title=Ad giant Dentsu declared Most Evil Corporation of the Year | work=[[The Japan Times]] | date=December 23, 2016 | accessdate=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First American''' is a [[fictional character]], a satirical [[superhero]] created by [[Alan Moore]] with [[Jim Baikie]] for his Wildstorm imprint [[America's Best Comics]], appearing in the [[anthology]] series ''[[Tomorrow Stories]]''.&lt;ref name= "baikie"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Rich |url= https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/12/30/jim-baikie-skizz-electric-warrior-first-american-dies-77/ |title=Jim Baikie, Creator Of Skizz, Electric Warrior And First American, Dies Aged 77 |work=[[Bleeding Cool]] |date=December 30, 2017 |accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First American's first appearance was in ''Tomorrow Stories'' #1.&lt;ref name= "tomorrow"&gt;{{cite news |last=Callahan |first=Tim |url= https://www.tor.com/2012/11/12/the-great-alan-moore-reread-tomorrow-stories-part-one/ |title=The Great Alan Moore Reread: ''Tomorrow Stories'', Part One |work=[[Tor.com]] |date=Nov 12, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

The First American is a slightly overweight middle-aged man who, despite his claims, has no superhuman powers.  Given his incompetence, he demonstrates below average physical abilities. His sidekick, the U.S. Angel or Joanie Jupiter, is a promiscuous young starlet (and former stripper) who greatly dislikes the First American and dreams of replacing him as "The Next American."

The tag line of the stories claim that he and U.S. Angel were "genetically engineered today for our nation's tomorrow." However a definitive origin or biography is difficult to piece together given the satirical nature of the stories and the fact that his incompetence borders on mental illness. In the 64-Page Giant it is shown that he is not the first First American, with ancestors/namesakes dating back to [[Christopher Columbus]] discovering [[Americas|America]]. According to his own muddled origin story he was born to a poor family somewhere in America during the [[Great Depression]]. He gained his powers through a series of bizarre events (a convoluted parody of the origins of [[Superman]], [[Spider-Man]], the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Batman]], [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and others).  Despite the paradox this presents F.A. also claims to be directly or indirectly responsible for all the major historical events of the 20th century.

[[File:Amplop hijau.jpg|thumb|Green envelopes in Indonesia (2016)]]
A '''green envelope''' (Malay: '''''sampul hijau''''' or '''''sampul duit raya''''') is a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] adaptation of the Chinese [[red envelope]] custom. During the festival of [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Islam in Malaysia|Muslims in Malaysia]], [[Islam in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Islam in Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia]] hand out money in green [[envelope]]s to guests who visit their homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://design-cu.jp/iasdr2013/papers/1893-1b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The colour [[Green#Green_in_Islam|green]] was chosen for its association with the [[Islamic paradise]]. The idea of handing out green envelopes is based on the Islamic concept of ''[[zakat]]'', where every Muslim is required to provide at least 2.5% of their wealth to the needy. However, Malays now hand out these green envelopes during ''Aidilfitri'' not only to their poor guests, but also to the [[middle class]] and to the [[upper class]]. The amount of money depends on how much the host can afford to give their guests.

The '''hermitage at Schaelsberg''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''kluis op de Schaelsberg'', [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]]: ''kloes op de Sjaatsberg'') is a monumental [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] in [[Schin op Geul]], in the municipality of [[Valkenburg aan de Geul]], [[Netherlands]]. Build in 1688 for the lords of nearby [[castle Schaloen]], the [[chapel]] and attached living space, housed a succession of 16 hermits from its foundation until 1930. The chapel and nearby [[stations of the cross]], added in 1843, are a [[Rijksmonument|national monument]]. Since 1758 a yearly procession, the ''Sjaasbergergank'', is held to the hermitage, and this procession is listed as national [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Located in a tourist area of [[South Limburg (Netherlands)|South Limburg]], it is a popular tourist attraction.

== Description ==
The hermitage is located on top of the Schaesberg hill, on the edge of the [[Schaelsbergerforest]]. It is a [[Rectangle|rectangular]] chapel, with a small living space attached, all made out of white painted [[marl]]. The chapel has a [[crow-stepped gable]] and [[flèche]], with on the north side a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[apse]], and on the south side a [[nave]]. Attached is a small living space, consisting of two rooms, with an upper floor and a basement. The lowest of these two rooms dates from the 15th century and was originally a hunting house of [[castle Schaloen]].&lt;ref name="church"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerkgebouwen-in-limburg.nl/kerken/schin-op-geul/kluis-op-de-schaesberg |title= Kluis op de Schaesberg |publisher= Church buildings in Limburg |language=Dutch |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East of the chapel are [[stations of the cross]], build in 1843. The stations are presented by 14 marl pedestals, each with a [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] containing a [[Lithography|lithograph]] image behind glass, all grouped in a circle surrounding a central shrine, which represents a symbolic grave, with on top the [[Arma Christi]].&lt;ref name="church" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kluis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dekluisvalkenburg.nl/ |title= De Kluis |publisher= De Kluis Valkenburg |language=Dutch |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the bottom of the Schaesberg hill, near a bridge across the river [[Geul]] to castle Schaloen, there are three small chapels dating from 1739, dedicated to saint [[Saint Roch|Roch]]. The central chapel has a cross on top with a statue representing [[Jesus]], while the outside chapels each have a statue on top, representing [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name="kluis" /&gt;

== History ==
The chapel was dedicated to saint [[Anthony of Padua]] in 1688 and was part of the saint Mauritius [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parish]] in [[Schin op Geul]]. From 1688 until 1930 a succession of 16 [[Franciscan]] and [[Carthusians|Carthusian]] hermits lived in the hermitage. 

== Monument ==
The chapel and nearby stations of the cross have been a [[Rijksmonument|national monument]] since 14 March 1967.&lt;ref name="Register"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=search&amp;sCompMonNr=36829 |title=Hermitage at Schaelsberg |publisher=Dutch monument registration |language=Dutch |accessdate=18 August 2014}} (Click on "36829" to view)&lt;/ref&gt; It has a sign stating it is a monument of the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. The province of Limburg officially does not have listed buildings, but it gives these signs to national monuments that get provincial financial support.&lt;ref name="monumentennl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumenten.nl/regionaal/provinciale-informatie/provincie/limburg |title= Monumentenzorg van de provincie Limburg |publisher= Monumenten.nl |language=Dutch |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is property of [[Vereniging Natuurmonumenten]] and maintained by the ''Sjaasbergergank foundation''.&lt;ref name="kluis" /&gt;

On the last Sunday of June a procession is held, the ''Sjaasbergergank''. This procession is listed as national [[intangible cultural heritage]].&lt;ref name="immaterieelerfgoed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immaterieelerfgoed.nl/traditions/details/12 |title= Sjaasbergergank Valkenburg |publisher= Nationale Inventaris Immaterieel Cultureel Erfgoed Koninkrijk Nederland |language=Dutch |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11520">'''Himbo''', a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''him'' and ''[[bimbo]]'', is a [[slang]] term for an attractive but vacuous man. The word was first used in 1988.&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/himbo Merriam Webster Dictionary], retrieved January 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term and the [[stereotype]] it describes have generated a range of commentary and reactions from writers, entertainers, linguists, and cultural analysts.

== Etymology and definitions ==

Several dictionaries cite 1988 as the first time the word himbo was used. By then, the word ''bimbo'', which earlier in the 20th century had been used for both males and females, was being used predominately for females, so himbo, a combination of "him" and "bimbo", was coined to refer specifically to males.&lt;ref name=Merriam /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=himbo Etymology online] retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'' cites a 1988 ''[[Washington Post]]'' description of a "macho himbo who strutted the Croisette wearing a 16 foot python like a stole around his shoulders and neck".&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor, The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', Routledge, Nov 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|Partridge]] defines himbo as "a man objectified by his good looks and presumed lack of intellectual qualities, a man who trades on this image, a gigolo".&lt;ref name=Partridge /&gt;

[[Merriam-Webster]]'s definition is "an attractive but vacuous man".&lt;ref name=Merriam /&gt;

Another slang dictionary emphasizes the sexual connotation of the word, describing it as "a male version of a bimbo, [[whore]] or [[slut]]", and using the example, "He's such a himbo he'd sleep with anything that has a pulse."&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Peckham, ''Urban Dictionary: Freshest Street Slang Defined'', Andrews McMeel Publishing, Apr 24, 2012, p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in popular culture==

===20th century===

In 1995, Sherry Sylvester of [[CNN]] interviewed male [[Hollywood]] celebrities about the use of the term 'himbo' and sexual objectification of men in entertainment and received a range of reactions. "There's a great word," said actor [[Keanu Reeves]]. "I love that. I read that and laughed my head off." [[Tom Selleck]] said he was "always flattered to be called a sex symbol" but [[Sylvester Stallone]] said he had fought "the stereotype that brawny means brainless" for years. [[David Charvet]] of ''[[Baywatch]]'' noted, "You find yourself doing a show for three years where you are sticking your chest out and your shoulders are back and you're holding in your stomach and you realize that that's so boring after awhile."&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Sylvester, "[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/hunks Hollywood Hunks-Just a Bunch of Himbos", CNN Los Angeles, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1994 interview, sociologist Michael Kimmel, who analyzes the himbo stereotype in his book ''Manhood in America: A Cultural History'', said there are two types of himbos, those created for women, like the model [[Fabio Lanzoni|Fabio]], or the actor [[Woody Harrelson]], and those created for men, like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] or [[Sylvester Stallone]]. The man's himbo, says Kimmel, is usually known for having some kind of prowess, like [[Charles Atlas]] or Stallone, whereas the woman's himbo is 'kinder and gentler' like Harrelson or, like Fabio, "a male [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]... famous for doing very little."&lt;ref name=Sentinel&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-06-16/lifestyle/9406140552_1_fabio-kimmel-white-men Susan Campbell, "Man As Object Becomes A Himbo", ''The Sun-Sentinel'', June 16, 1994], retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Kimmel, Manhood in America: A Cultural History Oxford University Press, 2012 -&lt;/ref&gt;

"You could legitimately call it a victory for men, that we now have men famous for doing nothing," Kimmel noted. He also observes that the origin of the himbo stereotype can be seen in mid 20th century television shows, whose audiences were primarily women, "that traditionally present Mother as the all-wise and Father as a bit of a bumbling idiot".&lt;ref name=Sentinel /&gt;

In her 1995 book, ''Beyond the Double Bind: Women and Leadership'', communications professor [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]]
uses bimbo and himbo as examples of 'linguistic reversal' which "creates a range of condemnation applicable to men that mirrors that for women."
"Each of these moves invites us to examine our presuppositions", she states, and "makes it less likely that language penalizing women will be taken for granted in future exchanges." Another example she cites is [[trophy wife]] and [[trophy husband]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Hall Jamieson, ''Beyond the Double Bind: Women and Leadership'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 1 Episode 8 of the TV series ''[[Oh, Grow Up]]'' was called "Himbo" (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/oh-grow-up/episode-8-season-1/himbo/100334/ TV Guide, 1999], retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===

In 2006, ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' editor [[Atoosa Rubenstein]] and psychologist [[Jeff Gardere|Jeff Gradere]] spoke on the [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today Show'']] about the "himbo cultural phenomenon". Rubenstein describes variations of himbos like the Hound Dog Himbo and the Socialite Himbo, and compares current actors to the different categories. ""The girls love [himbos] because they are malleable." she said. "As women become more successful, they want a guy who isn't going to take over their lives....they are the wave of the future." Gradere was more critical of the phenomenon, saying that boys trying to 'dumb down' or use their sexuality to get attention or financial support was no better than girls doing the same thing." "We understand the value of women taking on more masculine roles and men assuming what were once considered more traditional female roles. However, somewhere along the way, himbos have warped this idea and turned it into a free ride at the expense of women, which is disrespectful and manipulative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.com/news/girls-can-be-bimbos-can-guys-be-himbos-wbna13450344 Girls Can Be Bimbos, Can Guys Be Himbos? ''Today'', 2006], retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauren Bans of ''[[GQ Magazine]]'' discussed the rise of the himbo character in entertainment in her 2012 article, "Bimbos with Balls", noting the proliferation of "a new breed of buffed up hollow men" was replacing female bimbo characters in shows like ''[[New Girl]]'', ''[[Cougar Town]]'', and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'', as well as movies like ''[[Magic Mike]]'' and ''[[Showgirls]]''. Citing even earlier himbo appearances in ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', Bans theorizes that the 21st century has spawned a "Golden Age of himbodom", based on a new Hollywood vision of women as "crass sexual aggressors" who "need subjects to crassly sexually aggress".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gq.com/story/himbos-dumb-muscle-movie-characters-actors-magic-mike Lauren Bans, "The Rise of the Himbo: Bimbos with Balls," GQ, May 9, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter "Let's Hear it for the Boy Toy" of their book ''The Hookup Handbook: A Single Girl's Guide to Living It Up'', authors Jessica Rozler and Andrea Lavinthal describe a variety of himbo 'types' such as actors, bartenders, models, and personal trainers, as well as identifying features of different kinds of "Himbo Hookups", including The Beauty and The Beast Complex, the Sugar Mama, and so on.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jessica Rozler, Andrea Lavinthal, ''The Hookup Handbook: A Single Girl's Guide to Living It Up'', Simon and Schuster, Jun 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Christian Toto criticized the himbo trend as a kind of '[[Sexual objectification|reverse objectification]]' for men, setting a double standard in which it has become more acceptable for men to be sex objects than women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acculturated.com/himbo-problem Christian Toto,"The Rise of the Himbo and the Problem of Reverse Objectification," ''Acculturated.com'', August 11, 2016] retrieved January 24, 2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

Noreen Malone of ''[[The New Republic]]'' correlates the rise of the Himbo stereotype and its "ornamental masculinity" with the disappearance of opportunities for 'real expressions of manly manliness', especially for working class men, as well as to a shift in power dynamics between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Noreen Malone, [https://newrepublic.com/article/105754/noreen-malone-rise-himbo-why-playing-dumb-working-ryan-lochte The Rise of the Himbo, Why Playing Dumb Is Working For Ryan Lochte, ''New Republic'', August 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 episode of the TV series ''[[Freddie (TV series)|Freddie]]'' was called "Freddie the Himbo".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/freddie/episode-10-season-1/freddie-the-himbo/192253/ TV Guide, 2006], retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synonyms ==

Synonyms for himbo include ''bimboy'', ''mimbo'', [[Boy toy (sexual term)|boy toy]] and ''Blank Chuck''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles Jaffe, T''he Hamptons Dictionary: The Essential Guide to Class Warfare'', Red Wheel Weiser, Apr 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Thorne, ''Dictionary of Contemporary Slang'', A&amp;C Black, Feb 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jamaica|Jamaican]] version, according to ''Dancehall Dictionary'', which defines himbo as 'a young man paid for his sexual services by an older woman," is 'tadpole'.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Williams, Shawn Grant, ''Dancehall Dictionary: Learning to speak like a Jamaican'', Joan williams, Feb 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on [[hookup culture]] at [[Chico State University]], a presenter included himbo on a list of synonyms for 'sexually promiscuous man' that also included ''Casanova'', ''ladies man'', ''prostitute'', ''man hoe'', and ''Benedict''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rce.csuchico.edu/sites/default/files/online/wcmaterials/Hooking%20Up%20-%20Sex,%20Alcohol%20and%20Regret.pdf Anna Lind Thomas, ''Hooking Up, Alcohol Sex and Regret'', Chico State University], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[UK]] reader survey reported in the book ''Language, Power and Society'', himbo was offered as a synonym for [[toy boy]], along with other expressions like ''joy boy'', ''lap chap'', and ''boncubine''.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Thomas, Shân Wareing, ''Language, Society and Power: An Introduction'', Routledge, Sep 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have continued in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to use the original term "bimbo" when referring to someone as an unintelligent, vacuous, or brutish man, such as a reporter's description of [[Dan Quayle]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Hall, Beyond the Double Bind: Women and Leadership, Jamieson Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; or Stephen Richter's reflections on [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2015/08/12/donald_trump_is_the_true_bimbo_megyn_kelly_fox_news_and_a_lesson_in_sexism/ Stephen Richter,"Donald Trump is the True Bimbo", ''Salon.com'', August 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/donald-trump-outs-himself-as-bimbo/ Stephen Richter, "Donald Trump Outs Himself as a Bimbo," ''The Globalist'', April 4, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese imperial examinations'''&lt;!--chinese in infobox--&gt; were a [[civil service]] [[examination system]] in [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]] to select candidates for the state [[Civil service#China|bureaucracy]]. Imperial exams existed as early as the [[Han dynasty]], however they were only utilized as a means of recruitment for government office in the mid-[[Tang dynasty]], and remained so until its abolition in 1905. The exams were based on knowledge of the classics and literary style. The Confucian examination syllabus has been compared to the [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist education]] central to contemporary European government service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Berkshire Encyclopedia of China|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased reliance on the exam system was partially responsible for China's shift away from a [[military aristocracy]] to a [[gentry]] class of [[scholar-bureaucrats]]. Starting with the [[Song dynasty]], the system was regularized and developed into a roughly three-tiered ladder from local to provincial to court exams. The content was narrowed and fixed on texts of [[Neo-Confucian]] orthodoxy. By the [[Ming dynasty]], the highest degree, the ''[[#Degree types|jinshi]]'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:進士|進士]]}}), became essential for highest office. On the other hand, the initial degree, the ''[[shengyuan]]'' ([[wikt:生員|生員]]), became vastly oversupplied, resulting in holders who could not hope for office, yet were still granted social privilege. 

The Chinese examination system spread to neighboring Asian countries, such as [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] (though briefly) &lt;!-- please do not remove Japan, this imperial examination system existed in Japan, it was used during the eighth to tenth centuries, its subjects include xiucai, mingjing, jinshi, mingfa, as well as medicine and acupuncture.--&gt;and [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryūkyū]]. The Chinese examination system was introduced to the Western world in the reports of [[Europeans in Medieval China|European missionaries and diplomats]] and likely had an influencing the [[British East India Company]]'s introduction of similar methods to select prospective employees. Following the initial success in that company, the British government adopted a similar testing system for screening civil servants in 1855. Other European nations, such as France and Germany, followed suit. Modeled after these previous adaptations, the United States established its own testing program for certain government jobs after 1883.

Critics charged that the examination system stifled creativity and created officials who dared not defy authority, yet the system also continued to promote cultural unity. Wealthy families, especially from the merchant class, could opt into the system by educating their sons or purchasing degrees. In the 19th century, critics blamed the imperial system, and in the process its examinations, for China's lack of technical knowledge and its defeat by foreign powers.

==General history==
{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}
The imperial examination system in its classical manifestation is historically attested to have been established in 605, during the [[Sui dynasty]], when the emperor could call for tests to be administered. In the following [[Tang dynasty]], tests were used on a small scale until the examination system was extensively expanded during the reign of [[Wu Zetian]]:&lt;ref&gt;Paludin, 97&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of Wu's use of the testing system is still a matter for scholarly debate. However most government posts were still recruited through personal recommendation and connections to the court. It was not until the [[Song dynasty]] that most officials were recruited through examination. The Song emperors expanded both examinations and the government school system so that the number of those who passed the exams expanded to four to five times that of the Tang. Thus the system played a key role in the selection of the scholar-officials, who formed the elite members of society. During the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the system contributed to the narrowness of intellectual life and the autocratic power of the emperor. The system continued with some modifications until its 1905 abolition under the Qing dynasty. Other brief interruptions to the system occurred, such as at the beginning of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in the 13th century. The modern examination system for selecting civil servants also indirectly evolved from the imperial one.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd Ed., 2010), 145–147, 198–200,&lt;/ref&gt;

The operations of the examination system were part of the imperial record keeping system, and the date of receiving the ''jinshi'' degree is often a key biographical datum: sometimes the date of achieving ''jinshi'' is the only firm date known for even some of the most historically prominent persons in Chinese history. The regular higher level degree examination cycle was nominally decreed in 1067 to be 3 years. In practice both before and after this, the examinations were irregularly implemented for significant periods of time: thus, the calculated statistical averages for the number of degrees conferred annually should be understood in this context. The ''jinshi'' tests were not a yearly event and should not be considered so; the annual average figures are a necessary artifact of quantitative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Han dynasty===
Candidates for offices recommended by the prefect of prefecture were examined by the [[minister of ceremony]] and then presented to the emperor.&lt;ref name="Fu"&gt;Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics – Zhengyuan Fu&lt;/ref&gt; Some candidates for clerical positions would be given a test determine whether they could memorize nine thousand Chinese characters.&lt;ref name="Fu"/&gt; The imperial examinations during the [[Han dynasty]] did not offer a formal entry into government posts. Recruitment and appointment in the Han dynasty was primarily through recommendations by [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s and local officials. Recommended individuals were also primarily aristocrats. In theory, recommendations were based on a combination of reputation and ability but it's not certain how well this worked in practice. Oral examinations on policy issues were sometimes conducted personally by the emperor himself during Western Han times.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 165 BC [[Emperor Wen of Han]] introduced recruitment to the [[civil service examination|civil service through examinations]], however these did not heavily emphasize Confucian material. Previously, potential officials never sat for any sort of academic [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

While the examinations expanded under the Han, the number of graduates who went on to hold office were few. The examinations did not offer a formal route to commissioned office and the primary path to office remained through recommendations. Though connections and recommendations remained more meaningful than the exam, the initiation of the examination system by Emperor Wu had a cultural significance, as the state determined the most important examination material were Confucian. During the Han dynasty, these examinations were primarily used for the purpose of classifying candidates who had been specifically recommended. Even during the Tang dynasty the quantity of placements into government service through the examination system only averaged about nine persons per year, with the known maximum being less than 25 in any given year.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three Kingdoms era through the Sui dynasty===
Beginning in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (with the [[nine-rank system]] in the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Wei]]), imperial officials were responsible for assessing the quality of the talents recommended by the local elites. This system continued until it was abolished in 587 by [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] who created a system wherein every prefecture would supply three scholars a year.&lt;ref name="fu"&gt;{{cite book|title=Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics|last=Zhengyuan|first= Fu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 605 [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] established a new category of recommended candidates for the mandarinate (进士科). For the first time, an examination system was explicitly instituted for a category of local talents. However, the Sui dynasty was short-lived, and the system did not reach its mature development until afterwards.

===Tang dynasty and Wu interregnum===
[[File:Exam cells model.jpg|thumb|275px|A model of exam cells displayed at [[Guozijian (Beijing)|Beijing Imperial Academy]]]]

Over the course of the Tang dynasty (唐朝) and during the Zhou dynasty of the [[Wu Zetian]] interregnum, the examination system developed into a more comprehensive system, developing beyond the basic Sui process of qualifying candidates based on questions on policy matters and then followed by an interview.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 55&lt;/ref&gt; Oral interviews as part of the examination and selection system were theoretically supposed to be an unbiased process, but in practice favored candidates from elite clans based in the capitals of [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]] (speakers of solely non-elite dialects could not succeed).&lt;ref&gt;任立达，薛希洪，"中国古代官吏考选制度史" (''A History of the Examination Systems for the Chinese Imperial Mandarinate'')(青岛出版社, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Keay|first=John|title=China&amp;nbsp;— A History|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-00-722178-3}} p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil-service examination was institutionalized, where six categories were created. Eventually these became just one ''[[jinshi degree|jinshi]]'' degree.&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt; Although the number of candidates were sometimes as high as 2,000 a year, only 1 to 2 percent passed the test. At this point the exam became administered by the [[Ministry of Rites]].

A pivotal point in the development of imperial examinations arose with the rise of Wu Zetian.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Up until that point, the rulers of the Tang dynasty were all male members of the Li family (李氏). Wu Zetian was exceptional: a woman not of the Li family, she came to occupy the seat of the emperor in an official manner in the year of 690, and even beforehand she had already begun to stretch her power within the imperial courts behind the scenes. Reform of the imperial examinations to include a new class of elite bureaucrats derived from humbler origins became a keystone of Wu's gamble to retain power.

In 655, Wu Zetian graduated 44 candidates with the ''jìnshì'' degree (進士), and during one 7-year period the annual average of exam takers graduated with a ''jinshi'' degree was greater than 58 persons per year. Wu lavished favors on the newly graduated ''jinshi'' degree-holders, increasing the prestige associated with this path of attaining a government career, and clearly began a process of opening up opportunities to success for a wider population pool, including inhabitants of China's less prestigious southeast area.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Li family supporters were located to the northwest, particularly around the capital city of Chang'an. Wu's progressive accumulation of political power through enhancement of the examination system involved attaining the allegiance of previously under-represented regions, alleviating frustrations of the literati, and encouraging education in various locales so even people in the remote corners of the empire would work on their studies in order to pass the imperial exams, and thus developed a nucleus of elite bureaucrats useful from the perspective of control by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

In 681, a written test on knowledge of the Confucian classics was introduced, meaning that candidates were required to memorize these works and fill in the blanks on the test.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In 693, Wu Zetian's government further expanded the civil service examination system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paludan|first=Ann|title=Chronicle of the Chinese Emperors: The Reign-by-Reign Record of the Rulers of Imperial China|year=1998|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-05090-2}} p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; part of a policy to reform society and to consolidate power for her self-proclaimed "Zhou dynasty". Examples of officials whom she recruited through her reformed examination system include [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]], and [[Shen Quanqi]]. She introduced major changes in regard to the Tang system, increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test by allowing commoners and gentry previously disqualified by their non-elite backgrounds to attempt the tests. Successful candidates then became an elite nucleus of bureaucrats within her government.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime between 730 and 740, after the Tang restoration, a section requiring the composition of original poetry (including both ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'' and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'') was added to the tests, with rather specific set requirements: this was for the ''jinshi'' degree, as well as certain other tests. The less-esteemed examinations tested for skills such as mathematics, law, and calligraphy. The success rate on these tests of knowledge on the classics was between 10 and 20 percent, but for the thousand or more candidates going for a ''jinshi'' degree each year in which it was offered, the success rate for the examinees was only between 1 and 2 percent: a total of 6504 ''jinshi'' were created during course of the Tang dynasty (an average of only about 23 ''jinshi'' awarded per year).&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of the Tang restoration, the following emperors expanded on Wu's policies since they found them politically useful, and the annual averages of degrees conferred continued to rise; however with the upheavals which later developed and the disintegration of the Tang empire into the "[[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]", the examination system gave ground to other traditional routes to government positions and favoritism in grading reduced the opportunities of those taking the tests who lacked political patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically this period of fragmentation resulted in the utter destruction of old networks established by elite families that had ruled China throughout its various dynasties since its very conception. With the disappearance of the old aristocracy, Wu's system of bureaucrat recruitment once more became the dominant model in China, and eventually coalesced into the class of nonhereditary elites who would become known to the West as "mandarins," in reference to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the dialect of Chinese employed in the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-civil-service |title=Chinese civil service |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date= 19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song dynasty===
[[File:Palastexamen-SongDynastie.jpg|thumb|400px|The emperor receives a candidate during the Palace Examination. Song dynasty.]]

In the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) more than a hundred higher level examinations were held. Officials selected through the exams became dominant in the bureaucracy. The number of ''jinshi'' degrees also increased.&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt; Theoretically, the examinations were open to adult (at least in terms of literacy) Chinese males, with some restrictions. This included even individuals from the occupied northern territories.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 257 (Table 2, which shows 26 doctoral degrees awarded in 1184 to individuals from Occupied North China, and 1 in 1256)&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals moved from a low social status to political prominence through success in imperial examination. Examples include [[Wang Anshi]], who proposed reforms to make the exams more practical, and [[Zhu Xi]], whose interpretations of the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Four Classics]] became the orthodox [[Neo-Confucianism]] which dominated later dynasties. Two other prominent successful entries into politics through the examination system were [[Su Shi]] and his brother [[Su Zhe]]: both of whom became political opponents of Wang Anshi. Indeed, one of the major objectives of the examination system was to promote diversity of viewpoints and to avoid over-filling of offices with individuals of particular political or partisan alignment, as might occur with alternative, more biased methods, which could allow for active recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;de Bary (1960), 391&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the process of studying for the examination tended to be time-consuming and costly, requiring time to spare and tutors. Most of the candidates came from the numerically small but relatively wealthy land-owning [[scholar-official]] class.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, Jacques. (1962) ''Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250–1276''. Translated by H.M. Wright (Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0720-0}}, p. 65).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 937, by the decision of the Taizu Emperor of Song, the palace examination was supervised by the emperor himself. In 992, the practice of anonymous submission of papers during the palace examination was introduced; it was spread to the departmental examinations in 1007, and to the prefectural level in 1032. The practice of recopying the papers in order not to allow biases by revealing the candidate by his calligraphy was introduced at the capital and departmental level in 1105, and in the prefectures in 1037.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''A Cultural History of Civil Examinations in Late Imperial China'', 2000:14.
&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics indicate that the Song imperial government degree-awards eventually more than doubled the highest annual averages of those awarded during the Tang dynasty, with 200 or more per year on average being common, and at times reaching a per annum figure of almost 240.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Various reforms or attempts to reform the examination system were made during the Song dynasty, including by [[Fan Zhongyan]] and those by Wang Anshi. Fan's memorial to the throne actually initiated a process which lead to major educational reform through the establishment of a comprehensive public school system.&lt;ref&gt;de Bary (1960), 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuan dynasty (the Mongols)===
Governmental examinations ended with the defeat of the Song in 1279 by a disintegrating [[Mongol empire]]. After a period of turmoil, the part of the Mongol empire that was led by [[Kublai Khan]] established itself in China as the [[Yuan dynasty]]. One of Kublai's main advisers in this event was [[ Liu Bingzhong]], who wrote a memorial, among other things, recommending restoration of the examination system: however, this was not done.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai ended the imperial examination system, as he believed that Confucian learning was not needed for government jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy, Frey. History Alive!: The Medieval World and beyond. Palo Alto, CA: Teacher's Curriculum Institute, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Kublai was opposed to such a commitment to the Chinese language and to the Chinese scholars who were so adept, together with the accompanying ideology: he wished to appoint his own people without relying on an apparatus inherited from a newly conquered and sometimes rebellious country.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The discontinuation of the exams had the affect of reducing the prestige of traditional learning, reducing the motivation for doing so, as well as encouraging new literary directions not motivated by the old means of literary development and success.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988: 116, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination system was revived in 1315, with significant changes, during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Yuan|Emperor Renzong]]. The new examination system was one of regionalism with Mongol characteristics. The northern areas of Mongolia and its vicinity were favored, and a quota system (both for number of candidates and number of degrees awarded) which was based on the classification of the imperial population into four [[Race (human classification)|racially-based groups]] (or [[castes]] and/or [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]]) was instituted, the groups being Mongols, their non-Han allies ([[Semu|Semu-ren]]), Northern Chinese, and Southern Chinese, with further restrictions by province.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Under the revived and revised system the yearly averages for examination degrees awarded was about 21.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; As the degrees were arithmetically divided between the four "races" (although with further modification), rather than being proportionally based on either population or number of qualified candidates, this tended to favor the Mongols, Semu-ren, and North Chinese: the South Chinese were by far the greatest part of the population, the 1290 census figures recording some 12,000,000 households (about 48% of the total Yuan population), versus 2,000,000 North Chinese households, and the populations of Mongols and Semu-ren were both less.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions on candidates by the new quota system allowed only 300 candidates for each testing session of the three year examination cycle. The provincial restrictions resulted in a greater effect; for example, only 28 Han Chinese from South China were included among the 300 candidates, the rest of the South China slots (47) being occupied by resident Mongols or Semu-ren, although 47 "racial South Chinese" who were not residents of South China were approved as candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263, and note 17, page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ming dynasty===
[[Image:Portrait of Jiang Shunfu.jpg|right|thumb|220px|A 15th-century portrait of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] official [[Jiang Shunfu]]. The two [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] on his chest are a "[[Mandarin square]]" for a civil official of the first rank.]]
The [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) retained and expanded the system it inherited. Shortly after the inauguration of the dynasty, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] in 1370 declared that the exams should cover the [[Four Books]], discourses, and political analysis, accepting the Neo-Confucian canon put forth by [[Zhu Xi]] in the Song dynasty. But he firmly insisted on including the martial arts.
The curriculum at the [[Guozijian]] (National Academy){{which|date=August 2018}} emphasized law, mathematics, calligraphy, [[equestrianism|horse riding]], and archery in addition to Confucian classics required in the exams.&lt;ref name="Langlois988"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1=Frederick W. Mote|editor2=Denis Twitchett|author-first = Jack|author-last = Langlois| chapter = The Hung-wu Reign, 1368–1398| title=The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyhT9SZRLS8C&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=archery&amp;f=false|date=26 February 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24332-2|pages=122–}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor especially emphasized archery.&lt;ref name="Selby2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Selby|title=Chinese Archery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wY3sAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=yuanzhang+archery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI9c_n7b7MAhXkzoMKHcLRDCYQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yuanzhang%20archery&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-501-4|pages=267–}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The three levels of examination were created during this period, whose degrees were in order, ''[[shengyuan]]'' (elementary), ''[[juren]]'' (provincial), and ''[[jinshi degree|jinshi]]'' (metropolitan examination).&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt;

The Ming established Neo-Confucian interpretations as the orthodoxy guidelines and created what the historian [[Benjamin Elman]] called a "single-minded and monocular political ideology" that "affected politically and socially how literati learning would be interpreted and used." The imperial civil service system adopted this rigid orthodoxy at a time when commercialization and population growth meant that there was an inflation in the number of degree candidates at the lower levels. As a result, the higher and more prestigious offices were dominated by ''jinshi '' (Palace) degree-holders, who tended to come from elite families. The Ming thus started a process in which access to government office became harder and harder and officials became more and more orthodox in their thought. Near the end of the Ming dynasty, in 1600, there were roughly half a million licentiates in a population of 150 million, that is, one per 300 people; by the mid-19th century the ratio had shrunk to one civil licentiate for each 1,000 people.{{sfnb|Elman|2009| pp = 408–409}}

The social background of metropolitan graduates also narrowed as time went on. In the early years of the Ming dynasty only 14 percent of metropolitan graduates came from families that had a history of providing officials, while in the last years of the Ming roughly 60 percent of metropolitan exam graduates came from established elite families.

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:Xu Yang - Examination hall.jpg|thumb|250px|Examination hall, ''[[Prosperous Suzhou]]'' by [[Xu Yang (Qing dynasty)|Xu Yang]], 1759]]
The Qing dynasty largely adopted the Ming civil-service exam in the year of its establishment, 1644. The ''shengyuan'' degree holders were given some tax exemptions from the general public. During the Qing dynasty a total of 112 ''jinshi'' examinations were held within 261 years (1644–1905), averaging 2.3 years per exam and 102 ''jinshi'' degrees conferred a year.&lt;ref&gt;Ho 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], which attempted to overthrow the Qing dynasty in the middle of the 19th century, in 1853 admitted for the first time women as examination candidates. The exams administered by the Heavenly Kingdom differed from those administered by the Qing dynasty, in that they required knowledge of the [[Bible]]. [[Fu Shanxiang]] took the exam and became the first female [[zhuangyuan]] in Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Jiaqi (Grace Chor Yi Wong tr.) | last =Mao | chapter =Fu Shanxiang| pages =43–45| title =Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women | series = | volume = | editor =Ho Clara Wing-chug, ed.| location = Armonk, NY| publisher =Sharpe | year =1998 | isbn =0765600439|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uwPWtJ5WSQMC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Fu+Shanxiang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7BAdVeayl&amp;sig=5EUfk3kCuq0-LrJApSYZBwItt78&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e1zLU49ahqTIBMeFgvgO&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fu%20Shanxiang&amp;f=false|ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of the imperial examination system===
With the military defeats in the 1890s and pressure to develop a national school system, reformers such as [[Kang Youwei]] and [[Liang Qichao]] called for abolition of the exams, and the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] of 1898 proposed a set of modernizations. After the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the government drew up plans to reform under the name of [[New Policies]], then abolish the exams. On 2 September 1905, the throne endorsed a [[memorial to the throne|memorial]] which ordered that the old examination system be discontinued at all levels in the following years. The new system provided equivalents to the old degrees; a bachelor's degree, for instance, would be considered equivalent to the ''xiu cai''. The details of the new system remained to be worked out by the fall of the dynasty in 1911, but the end of the system meant the end of Confucianism as an official state ideology and of the [[scholar official]] as a legal group.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Franke, ''The Reform and Abolition of the Traditional Chinese Examination System'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: East Asian Research Center, 1968), 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General discussion of late imperial system==
Reformers charged that the set format of the "[[Eight-legged essay]]" stifled original thought and satirists portrayed the rigidity of the system in novels such as ''[[Rulin waishi]]''. In the twentieth century, the [[New Culture Movement]] portrayed the examination system as a cause for China's weakness in such stories as [[Lu Xun]]'s "[[Kong Yiji]]." Some have suggested that limiting the topics prescribed in examination system removed the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation, perhaps contributing to the [[Great Divergence]], in which China's scientific and economic development fell behind Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Yifu Lin, ''Demystifying the Chinese Economy'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. xiv, [http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/91807/frontmatter/9780521191807_frontmatter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the political and ethical theories of Confucian classical curriculum has been compared to the [[classical studies]] of [[Renaissance Humanism|humanism]] in European nations which proved instrumental in selecting an "all-rounded" top-level leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elman |first1=Benjamin A. |title=Berkshire Encyclopedia of China |date=2009 |publisher=Berkshire Publishing Group LLC |isbn=9780977015948 |pages=405 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; British and French civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on Greco-Roman classical subjects and general cultural studies, as well as assessing personal physique and character.

In [[late imperial China]], the examination system was the major mechanism by which the central government captured and held the loyalty of local-level elites. Their loyalty, in turn, ensured the integration of the Chinese state, and countered tendencies toward regional autonomy and the breakup of the centralized system.  The examination system distributed its prizes according to provincial and prefectural quotas, which meant that imperial officials were recruited from the whole country, in numbers roughly proportional to each province's population. Elite individuals all over China, even in the disadvantaged peripheral regions, had a chance at succeeding in the examinations and achieving the rewards and emoluments office brought.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, John King and Merle Goldman. (2006) ''China: A New History''. (Cambridge: MA; London: Harvard University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-674-01828-1}}), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination based civil service thus promoted stability and social mobility. The Confucian-based examinations meant that the local elites and ambitious would-be members of those elites across the whole of China were taught with similar values.  Even though only a small fraction (about 5 percent) of those who attempted the examinations actually passed them and even fewer received titles, the hope of eventual success sustained their commitment. Those who failed to pass did not lose wealth or local social standing; as dedicated believers in Confucian orthodoxy, they served, without the benefit of state appointments, as teachers, patrons of the arts, and managers of local projects, such as irrigation works, schools, or charitable foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, John King and Merle Goldman. (2006) ''China: A New History'' (Cambridge: MA; London: Harvard University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-674-01828-1}}), pp. 101–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of China===
{{See also|History of the Republic of China}}

After the fall of the Qing in 1911, Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the leader of the newly risen [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], developed similar procedures for the new political system through an institution called the [[Examination Yuan]], one of the five branches of government, although this was quickly suspended due to the turmoil in China between the two world wars, such as the warlord period and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]]. The [[Kuomintang]] administration revived the Examination Yuan in 1947 after the defeat of Japan. This system continues into present times in Taiwan along with the government itself after loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]].

==Taking the exams==
[[Image:Imperial examination cheating material.JPG|thumb|widthpx|"Cribbing Garment" worn as underwear into the examination]]

The examinations consisted of tests administered at the district, provincial, and metropolitan levels. Tight quotas restricted the number of successful candidates at each level—for example, only three hundred students could pass the metropolitan examinations. Students often took the examinations several times before earning a degree.

* Entry-level examinations were held annually and accessible to educated individuals from their early teenage years.  These were held locally and were collectively called '''''Tóngshì''''' ([[wikt: 童試|童試]], "Child Exam").  ''Háizi kǎoshì'' was broken down hierarchically into the '''''Xiànshì''''' ([[wikt:縣試|縣試]], "County Exam"), the '''''Fǔshì''''' ([[wikt:府試|府試]], "Prefectural exam") and '''''Yuànshì''''' ([[wikt:院試|院試]], "college exam").
* Provincial exams: '''''Xiāngshì''''' ([[wikt:鄉試|鄉試]], "township exam") were held every three years in provincial capitals.
* Metropolitan exams: '''''Huìshì''''' ([[wikt:會試|會試]], "conference exam") were held every three years in the national capital.
* Palace exams: '''''Diànshì''''' ([[wikt:殿試|殿試]], "court exam") were held every three years in the [[Forbidden City|Imperial palace]] and often supervised by the emperor himself.

Each candidate arrived at an examination compound with only a few amenities: a water pitcher, a [[chamber pot]], bedding, food (which he had to prepare himself), an [[inkstone]], [[inkstick|ink]] and [[ink brush|brushes]]. Guards verified a student's identity and searched for hidden printed materials.  In the Ming and Qing periods, each exam taker spent three days and two nights writing "[[eight-legged essay]]s"—literary compositions with eight distinct sections—in a tiny room with a makeshift bed, desk and bench. There were no interruptions during those three days, nor were candidates allowed any communication.  If a candidate died, officials wrapped his body in a straw mat and tossed it over the high walls that ringed the compound.&lt;ref&gt;Ichisada Miyazaki. ''China's Examination Hell: The Civil Service Examinations of Imperial China.'' (New York: Weatherhill,  1976. {{ISBN|0834801043}}), pp. 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense [[pressure to succeed]] meant that [[cheating]] and [[corruption in China|corruption]] were rampant, often outrunning strenuous attempts to prevent or defeat them. The Ming-dynasty ''[[Book of Swindles]]'' (c. 1617) contains an entire section of stories about "Corruption in Education", most of which involve swindlers exploiting exam-takers' desperate attempts to bribe the examiner.&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142–163.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to discourage favoritism which might occur if an examiner recognized a student's calligraphy, each exam was recopied by an official copyist.  Exact quotes from [[Four Books and Five Classics|the classics]] were required; misquoting even one character or writing it in the wrong form meant failure, so candidates went to great lengths to bring hidden copies of these texts with them, sometimes written on their underwear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew H. Plaks]],  [http://www.princeton.edu/~ealj/robe.htm  "Cribbing Garment" Gest Library]'''&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] holds an example of a Qing dynasty [[cheat sheet]], a handkerchief with 10,000 characters of Confucian classics in microscopically small handwriting.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85gAfiJGpVM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the imperial examination==
===Curriculum===
By 115 AD, a set curriculum had become established for the so-called First Generation of examination takers. They were tested on their proficiency in the "[[Six Arts]]":

* Scholastic arts: music, arithmetic, writing, and knowledge of the rituals and ceremonies in both public and private life.
* Militaristic: archery and horsemanship

The curriculum was then expanded to cover the "Five Studies": military strategy, civil law, revenue and taxation, agriculture and geography, and the [[Confucian classics]]. In this form, the examinations were institutionalized during the sixth century AD, under the [[Sui dynasty]]. These examinations are regarded by most historians as the first [[standardized tests]] based on merit.

===Degree types===
[[File:状元卷.JPG|thumb|Exam paper of Ming dynasty [[Zhuangyuan]] Zhao Bing-zhong in 1598 AD]]
[[File:陳悅記祖宅舉人竿.jpg|thumb|Stone flagpole planted at the examiner's abode indicating the jinshi imperial examination status]]
By the [[Ming dynasty]], the examinations and degrees formed a "ladder of success", with success generally being equated with being graduated as ''[[jinshi]]'', a degree similar to a modern Doctor of Literature degree, or [[PhD]]. Modifications to the basic ''jinshi'' or other degree were made for higher-placing graduates, similar to the modern [[Summa cum laude]]. The examination process extended down to the county level, and included examinations at the provincial and national levels. The highest level tests would be at the imperial court or palace level, of which the ''jinshi'' was the highest regular level, although special purpose tests were occasionally offered, by imperial decree:

* '''''Tongsheng''''' ([[wikt:童生|童生]], lit. "child student"),  an entry-level examinee who had passed the county/prefecture exams.
* '''''[[Shengyuan]]''''' ([[wikt:生員|生員]], lit. "student member"), also commonly called '''''xiucai''''' ([[wikt:秀才|秀才]], lit. "distinguished talent"), an entry-level [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] who had passed the college exam.  ''Xiucai'' enjoyed officially sanctioned social privileges such as exemption from [[Corvée|statute labour]], access into local government facilities and limited immunity against [[corporal punishment]]s.  They were further divided into three classes according to exam performance.
** '''''Linsheng''''' ([[wikt:廩生|廩生]], lit. "granary student"), the first class of ''shengyuan'', who were the best performers in the college exam, and got to receive government-issued rations and pay for their academic achievements.  The top performers within this class would get accepted into the [[Guozijian|Imperial Academy]] as '''gongsheng''' ([[wikt:貢生|貢生]], lit. "tribute student"), who will then be eligible to sit the provincial or even the national exam directly.
*** '''''Anshou''''' ([[wikt:案首|案首]], lit. "first on the desk"), the highest ranking ''linsheng'', and thus the top ''shengyuan'' who ranked first in college exam.
** '''''Zengsheng''''' ([[wikt:增生|增生]], lit. "expanded student"), the second class of ''shengyuan'', who performed less well than ''linsheng'' and enjoyed similar legal perks, but not the material allowance.
** '''''Fusheng''''' ([[wikt:附生|附生]], lit. "attached student"), the third class of ''shengyuan'' and considered substitute recruits outside the official quota of enrollment.  They were considered passable in exams but needed more improvements.
* {{anchor|juren}} '''''[[Juren]]''''' ([[wikt:舉人|舉人]], lit. "recommended man"), a qualified graduate who passed the triennial provincial exam.
** '''''Jieyuan''''' ([[wikt:解元|解元]], lit. "top escorted examinee"), the ''juren'' who ranked first in provincial exam.
* '''''Gongshi''''' ([[wikt:貢士|貢士]], lit. "tribute scholar"), a recognized scholarly achiever who passed the triennial national exam.
** '''''Huiyuan''''' ([[wikt:會元|會元]], lit. "top conference examinee"), the ''gongshi'' who ranked first in national exam.
* '''''[[Jinshi]]''''' ([[wikt:進士|進士]], lit. "advanced scholar"), a graduate who passed the triennial court exam.
** '''''Jinshi Jidi''''' ([[wikt:進士及第|進士及第]], lit. "distinguished ''jinshi''"), graduates ranked first class in the court exam, usually only the top three individuals were qualified for this title.
*** '''''[[Zhuangyuan]]''''' ([[wikt:狀元|狀元]], lit. "top thesis author"), the ''jinshi'' who ranked first overall nationwide.
*** '''''Bangyan''''' ([[wikt:榜眼|榜眼]], lit. "eyes positioned alongside"), the ''jinshi'' who ranked second overall just below ''zhuangyuan''.
*** '''''Tanhua''''' ([[wikt:探花|探花]], lit. "flower snatcher"), the ''jinshi'' ranked third overall.
** '''''Jinshi Chushen''''' ([[wikt:進士出身|進士出身]], lit. "''jinshi'' background"), the graduates who ranked second class in court exam, ranking immediately after the ''tanhua''.
** '''''Tong Jinshi Chushen''''' ([[wikt:同進士出身|同進士出身]], lit. "along with ''jinshi'' background"), graduates ranked third class in the court exam.

===Degree examinations===
Besides the regular tests for the ''jinshi'' and other degrees, there were also occasionally special purpose examinations, by imperial decree (''zhiju''). These decree examinations were for the purpose of particular promotions or to identify talented men for dealing with certain, specific, especially difficult assignments. During the Song dynasty, in 1061, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] decreed special examinations for the purpose of finding men capable of "direct speech and full remonstrance" (''zhiyan jijian''): the testing procedure required the examinees to submit 50 previously prepared essays, 25 on particular contemporary problems, 25 on more general historical governmental themes. In the examination room, the examinees then had a day to write essays on six topics chosen by the test officials, and finally were required to write a 3,000 character essay on a complex policy problem, personally chosen by the emperor, Renzong. Among the few successful candidates were the Su brothers, [[Su Shi]] and [[Su Zhe]] (who had already attained their ''jinshi'' degrees, in 1057), with Su Shi scoring exceptionally high in the examinations, and subsequently having copies of his examination essays widely circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 2000: page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Wu Zetian the imperial government created specialized military examinations for the selection of army officers as a response to the breakdown of garrison militias known as the [[Fubing system]].&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Zi. ''Pratique Des Examens Militaires En Chine.'' (Shanghai, Varietes Sinologiques. No. 9,  1896). [https://archive.org/details/pratiquedesexam00zigoog American Libraries Internet Archive Google Book (Searchable)].&lt;/ref&gt; The first formal military examinations were introduced in 702. Before the military exams, the participants who were from military families studied at military schools.&lt;ref name="Forges2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger V. Des Forges|title=Cultural Centrality and Political Change in Chinese History: Northeast Henan in the Fall of the Ming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YE6Va-Fe1coC&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4044-9|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful candidates were awarded military versions of Jinshi and Juren degrees: ''Wujinshi'' (武進士) and ''Wujuren'' (武舉人), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Zi.

The names of civil ''jinshi'' were carved in marble whereas military ''jinshi'' were not. Nevertheless, the civil and military elements of government were in Chinese political theory sometimes compared to the two wheels of a [[Chinese chariot|chariot]]; if either were neglected, government would not run smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, ''China's Examination Hell'' p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the military examinations had the same general arrangement as the regular exams, with provincial, metropolitan and palace versions of the exams. The ideal candidate was expected to master the same Confucian texts as the civilians, in addition to martial skills such as archery and horsemanship as well as [[Chinese military texts]], especially [[Sun Tzu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F3baSe8QlPUC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=military+examination+administered+scholar+gunpowder#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Military culture in imperial China|author=Nicola Di Cosmo|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=245|isbn=0-674-03109-1|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the entry level exam, for instance, which was conducted by the [[County magistrate (China)|district magistrate]], the candidate had to shoot three arrows while riding his horse toward the target, which was the shape of a person. A perfect score was three hits, a good score two, and one hit earned a pass. The candidate failed if he made no hits or fell from his horse. The higher levels were made up of more and more challenging exams until the highest level, conducted at the palace in the presence of the emperor, which included not only mounted archery, but bow bending, halberd brandishing, and weight lifting.&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, ''China's Examination Hell'' p. 102, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JR.1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic Wakeman, Jr.|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA1041#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04804-1|pages=1041–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the intention of raising more military officers through these examinations, rarely did famous generals and strategists ever arise from military degree holders. With some exceptions such as the Tang general [[Guo Ziyi]], the father of the founder of the Song dynasty [[Zhao Hongyin]], Ming generals [[Yu Dayou]] and [[Qi Jiguang]], and Qing general [[Wu Sangui]], graduates of the official military examinations have left few traces. Even in desperate times, the majority of distinguished military figures in Chinese history have come from civil degree holders. In total, 282 military metropolitan exams were held between their inception in 702 and abolishment in 1901. The practices of the Qing and Ming military exams was incorporated into physical education during the Republic of China.&lt;ref name="Morris2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew D.

Besides China, the military examinations were also a practice of certain Korean and Vietnamese dynasties.

===Examination procedures===
[[Image:Exam cells-large.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Examination hall with 7500 cells, [[Guangdong|Canton]], 1873.]]
By 1370, the examinations lasted between 24 and 72 hours, and were conducted in spare, isolated examination rooms; sometimes, however, it was held within cubicles. The small rooms featured two boards which could be placed together to form a bed or placed on different levels to serve as a desk and chair. In order to obtain objectivity in evaluation, candidates were identified by number rather than name, and examination answers were recopied by a third party before being evaluated to prevent the candidate's handwriting from being recognized.

In the main hall of the imperial palace during the Tang and Song Dynasties there stood two stone statues. One was of a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] and the other of [[Ao (turtle)|Ao]] (鳌), the mythical turtle whose chopped-off legs serve as pillars for the sky in Chinese legend. The statues were erected on stone plinths in the center of a flight of stairs where successful candidates (jinshi) in the palace examination lined up to await the reading of their rankings from a scroll known as the [[jinbang]] (金榜). The first ranked scholar received the title of Zhuàngyuán (狀元/状元), and the honor of standing in front of the statue of Ao. This gave rise to the use of the phrases ''"to have stood at Ao's head"'' (占鳌头 [Zhàn ào tóu]), or ''"to have stood alone at Ao's head"'' (独占鳌头 [Dú zhàn ào tóu]) to describe a Zhuàngyuán, and more generally to refer to someone who excels in a certain field.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Restrictions===
Some people were banned from taking the imperial exam, although this varied to some extent over history. Traditionally, Chinese society was divided into officials/nobility and commoners. The commoners were divided by class or status into 4 groups by occupation, ranked in order of prestige: scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 246&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath these in terms of prestige were the so-called "mean" people, with various regional names and attributes; but, boat-people, beggars, sex-workers, entertainers, slaves, and low-level government employees were all people included among the "mean" class: among other forms of discrimination, "mean" people were forbidden to serve as government officials or to take the imperial exam.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Susan Naquin |author2=Evelyn Sakakida Rawski |title=Chinese Society in the Eighteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=The+latter+category+included+remnants+of+aboriginal+groups+who+had+survived+Chinese+expansion+and+settlement+and+practitioners+of+occupations+that+included+prostitutes,+musicians,+actors,+and+some+yamen+employees+(gate+keepers#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20latter%20category%20included%20remnants%20of%20aboriginal%20groups%20who%20had%20survived%20Chinese%20expansion%20and%20settlement%20and%20practitioners%20of%20occupations%20that%20included%20prostitutes%2C%20musicians%2C%20actors%2C%20and%20some%20yamen%20employees%20(gate%20keepers&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-10-31 |type= |edition=reprint,  |series= |volume= |date= |year=1989 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-300-04602-2 |page=117 |pages= |at= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case for the caste of "degraded" outcasts in [[Ningbo]] city, where around 3,000 people, said to be [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] descendants, were barred from taking the Imperial Exams, among numerous other restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=min+degraded++class#v=onepage&amp;q=ningpo%20min%20degraded%20%20class%20descendants%20kin&amp;f=false|title=The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

Butchers and [[Wu (shaman)|sorcerers]] were also excluded at times.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 247&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants were generally restricted from taking the exams until the Ming and Qing dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 248&lt;/ref&gt; During Sui and Tang artisans were also restricted from official service; during the Song dynasty artisans and merchants were specifically excluded from the ''jinshi'' exam; and, in the Liao dynasty, physicians, diviners, butchers, and merchants were all prohibited from taking the examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 386 note 70, citing ''Liao-shih''.&lt;/ref&gt; At times, quota systems were also used to restrict the number of candidates allowed to take or to pass the imperial civil service examinations, by region or by other criteria.

==Cultural context==
{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}
Chinese traditional religion responded to concerns about the imperial examination system. The examination system was also influential on the contemporary literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucian rationalism===
From a certain viewpoint, the examination system represented the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] system in its most rationalist aspect. The test system was designed to achieve a society ruled by men of [[Confucianism#Meritocracy|merit]], as determined by an objective measure of the candidates' knowledge and intelligence. However, in actual operation, the examinations also included various religious, mythical, or irrational beliefs, which made the examination structure more complex than the Confucian ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–266 and Kracke, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate===
A less scientifically rational idea which had a significant role in the cultural context of the examination system involved traditional beliefs about fate: that cosmic forces predestine certain human affairs, and particularly that individual success or failure was subject to the will of [[Tian|Heaven]], or that the results of taking the tests could be influenced by the intervention of various deities.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zhong Kui===
[[Zhong Kui]], also known as Chung-kuei, was a deity associated with the examination system. The story is that he was a scholar who took the tests, and, despite his most excellent performance, he was unfairly deprived of the first-place prize by a corrupt system: in response, he killed himself, the act of suicide condemning him to be a [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghost]]. Many people afraid of traveling on roads and paths that may be haunted by evil spirits have worshiped Zhong Kui as a protective deity.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, 60 (picture, 58)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Strange Stories from the Examination Halls''===
Also known as ''Kechang Yiwen Lu'', the ''Strange Stories from the Examination Halls'' was a collection of stories popular among Confucian scholars of the Qing dynasty. The theme of many of the stories is that good deeds are rewarded by success in the examination halls, often by Heaven-inspired deities acting on karmic principles; and evil deeds result in failure, often under the influence of the ghosts of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 266–267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming taboo===
Some individuals were discriminated against because of their names, due to a [[naming taboo]]. For example, because the Tang dynasty poet [[Li He]]'s father's name sounded like the ''jin'', in ''jinshi'', he was discouraged from taking the tests.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, 286&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was that if Li He was called a ''jinshi'', it would be against the rule of etiquette that a son not be called by his father's name.

==Influence==

===Other countries===
====East====
The Chinese imperial examination system had extensive influence throughout East Asia. It was used as a model by both the [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] dynasties in Korea (see ''[[Gwageo]]'') until the country's [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|annexation by Japan]].  The examination was technically open to all, except [[Nobi]] who were not subject to taxes or army service. 

The Chinese system provided the framework for the [[Confucian examination system in Vietnam]] from the reign of the [[Lý dynasty]] Emperor [[Lý Nhân Tông]] (1075) until that of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] Emperor [[Khải Định]] (1919). 

Japan also used the system as a model in the [[Heian period]]; however, it affected only the minor nobility and was replaced by the hereditary system during the [[Samurai]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Haifeng, ''Influence of China’s Imperial Examinations on Japan, Korea and Vietnam'' -''Frontiers of History in China'', October 2007, Volume 2, Issue 4, pp 493–512
&lt;/ref&gt;

====West====
The imperial examination system attracted much attention and greatly inspired political theorists in the Western World, and one of the earliest Chinese institutions to receive foreign notice.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 251&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] and hence the reform of the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Civil Service in British India]].&lt;ref&gt;Ssu-yu Teng, "Chinese Influence on the Western Examination System", ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 7 (1942–1943):  267–312.&lt;/ref&gt; After Great Britain's successful implementation of systematic, open, and competitive examinations in India in the 19th century, similar systems were instituted in the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom]] itself, and in other Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 417&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
Some of the main outstanding questions regarding the imperial examinations are in regard to poetry. To what extent did the inclusion of poetry in the examinations influence the writing of poetry, for instance the proliferation of [[Tang poetry|poetry during the Tang dynasty]]?&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long history of debate on the usefulness of the procedure of testing the ability of the candidates to write poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 51&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tang dynasty, a poetry section was added to the examinations, requiring the examinee to compose a ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'' poem in the five-character, 12-line [[regulated verse]] form and a ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'' composition of 300 to 400 characters&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt; The poetry requirement remained standard for many decades, despite some controversy, although briefly abolished for the examination year 833–834 (by order of [[Li Deyu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58–59, who notes factual inaccuracy of the former belief that the poetry requirement was eliminated from 781–834&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Song dynasty]], in the late 1060s [[Wang Anshi]] removed the traditional poetry composition sections ([[regulated verse]] and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]''), on the grounds of irrelevancy to the official functions of bureaucratic office: on the other side of the debate, [[Su Shi]] (Dongpo) pointed out that the selection of great ministers of the past had not been obstructed by the poetry requirements, that the study and practice of poetry encouraged careful writing, and that the evaluation and grading of poetry was more objective than for the prose essays, due to the strict and detailed rules for writing verse according to the formal requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Mutoscope Reel Company''' was formed in the early 1920s to produce [[Mutoscope]] machines and the [[motion picture]] reels that the machines played, and continued to manufacture [[Penny arcade (venue)|arcade]] machines, including the [[claw machine]], until 1949.

==History==
The mutoscope was a [[peep show]]-style movie viewer that was first manufactured by the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph]] company, and is notable for being one of the first means by which motion pictures were exhibited. The company gradually changed its focus to motion picture production and projection, and by the early 1920s, had stopped production of both mutoscopes and the movie reels that were played by the machines. The company also produced arcade photo booths under the name of "Photomatic". These produced a souvenir 2-5/8" x 3-1/16" metal-framed photo with the credit on the back, "Taken by the Photomatic."

Rather than allowing the format, still popular in arcades and amusement areas, to disappear, [[entrepreneur]] William Rabkin was given permission to continue producing mutoscope reels and machines using the [[trademark]]ed name. By 1925, he had formed the International Mutoscope Reel Company for the purpose of manufacturing new movie reels to play on both the old mutoscope machines and the new ones that the company started selling. During the golden age of the penny arcade, the company produced a number of amusement machines, including fortune tellers and skill games, and may have been the first to market the claw machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,711649-1,00.html "Pin Game"], ''Time'', December 24, 1934,&lt;/ref&gt; The company went out of business in 1949.

'''Jim Radford''' is a British folk singer and songwriter, peace campaigner and political and community activist. He is also the youngest known participant in the [[invasion of Normandy|Allied invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944.

Jim Radford was a well-known figure in the British Peace Movement and anti-war campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s (particularly in the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and the British campaign against the USA's [[Vietnam War]]). He was also prominent in [[Direct Action]] Housing campaigns (e.g. the King Hill Hostel campaign of the mid 1960s, the [[Squatting in England and Wales|Family Squatting Associations]] in London in the late 1960s and early 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Ron; The Squatters (1973) Penguin:UK {{ISBN|0140523006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Helen and Sanderson, Mimi; The Unsung Sixties; 2004 (pp 1 to 18); Whiting &amp; Birch: {{ISBN|1861770448}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the occupation of [[Centre Point]] in Central London in 1974). He gained renewed prominence in 2014 when it was discovered by the [[BBC]] and the [[Royal British Legion]] that not only was he the youngest allied veteran of the Normandy invasion but that he had written a memorable song about his experiences as a young seaman on one of the Deep Sea Tugs that built the [[Mulberry Harbour]] at [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]] ([[Gold Beach]]) – and he could sing. Radford performed his song, ''The Shores of Normandy'', three times at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London in the 70th anniversary year of the invasion (2014) and two of these concerts were televised by the BBC (the BBC's own 70th anniversary commemoration event in June&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsVQMfxIfks |title=Jim Radford - The Shores of Normandy |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Legion Remembrance Day concert in November&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsjeIW0I46Q |title=Shores of Normandy - Jim Radford |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Jim Radford went to sea at fifteen when he sailed from his home-town of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in the East Riding of Yorkshire in the spring of 1944 as a [[Galley (kitchen)|galley boy]] on the ''[[Empire Larch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The story of how he managed to get a berth on an ocean going ship at fifteen, when this was supposedly prohibited by war-time regulations, is told in Radford's own words in the 2007 documentary film ''Mayday Tugs of War'' by US film-maker Robin Williams {{cite web|url=http://www.maydaytugsofwar.com/trailers/meetjimr.html |title=Mayday Tugs of War |publisher=Mayday Tugs of War |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Empire Larch'' was a Deep Sea Tug owned by the British [[Ministry of War Transport]]&lt;ref&gt;Dear, I. 'The Tattie Lads' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016), {{ISBN|978-1-8448-6401-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and engaged in war work (assembling the convoy of block-ships for Operation Corn Cob&lt;ref&gt;Operation 'Corn Cob' was an enormous maritime engineering operation involving the precise positioning and scuttling of dozens of 'blockships' to form breakwaters and provide calmer water on the invasion beaches. Two of these artificial breakwaters (at Omaha and Gold beaches) were then used to shelter the construction of [[Mulberry harbour]]s. The ''Empire Larch'' arrived at ''Gold Beach'' with part of this convoy on the evening of 6 June 1944 while fighting was still going on around the beachhead. See the section on Breakwaters in the Wikipedia [[Mulberry harbour]] page.&lt;/ref&gt;) in preparation for the invasion of France. He joined the Royal Navy on turning 18 and settled back on dry land in 1954, becoming an activist in various humanist, political and Peace Campaigns and helping to organise the first of the [[Aldermaston Marches]] in 1958 (later adopted by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]) and being invited to join the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]] shortly after its foundation in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/6910/ |author=Carroll, Sam|title='Fill the jails': identity, structure and method in the Committee of 100, 1960 – 1968 : Sussex Research Online|quotation=This DPhil thesis includes interviews with Radford and other activists of the time|website=Sro.sussex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired after a varied career which included time as an Engineering Worker, in [[Fleet Street]], as a Press Officer, as Warden (Director) of [[Settlement movement|Blackfriars Settlement]] in South London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk/ |title=Welcome to Blackfriars Settlement |website=Blackfriars-settlement.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as General Secretary of Manchester [[Council for Voluntary Service]] and in various roles in Community Work and Social Action initiatives. He is a regular attender and performer at maritime and folk music festivals around the UK and although he is best known for his sea-songs and shanties (sung a cappella) he also sings from an extensive repertoire of British and Irish (and some Australian) folk songs as well as political and protest songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offbeat.karoo.net/shantyman |title=Jim Radford |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825104922/http://www.offbeat.karoo.net/shantyman |archivedate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford also remains actively involved in the British section of the [[Veterans for Peace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veteransforpeace.org.uk/ |title=Veterans for Peace|website=Veteransforpeace.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0cjLndbzNw |title=Jim Radford in Los Angeles |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2015-08-04 |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://veteransforpeace.org.uk/2015/film-the-missing-peace/ |title=Film: The Missing Peace |website=Veteransforpeace.org.uk |date=2015-12-29 |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; organisation. In October 2015 Radford was appointed a Chevalier of the [[Légion d'Honneur]]&lt;ref&gt;'Folk singer gets France's top gong' South London Press, 21 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; by the French Republic "in recognition of... steadfast involvement in the Liberation of France during the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;Extract from the letter of citation from the French Consul which accompanied the medal&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first song Jim Radford wrote himself is also his most successful and best known, having been performed by him at two televised concerts at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].

Jim Radford is one of three brothers who all went to sea as teenagers and sailed as [[Merchant navy|Merchant Seamen]] during WWII (his eldest brother, 'Jack', qualified as a Radio Officer at just 17 and is thought to have been the youngest Merchant Navy Officer killed by enemy action in WWII when his ship, the ''SS Cree'', was torpedoed in November 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/662.html |title=Cree (British Steam merchant) - Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII |website=Uboat.net |date=1940-11-22 |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; just weeks after his eighteenth birthday). Radford's tribute song to the wartime Merchant Navy, "The Merchant Seaman", won the Festival on the Moor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalonthemoor.co.uk/ |title=Festival on the Moor |publisher=Festival on the Moor |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'best song award' in 2009.

The '''Latin Monetary Union''' ('''LMU''') was a 19th-century system that unified several [[Europe]]an [[Currency|currencies]] into a [[currency union|single currency]] that could be used in all the member states, at a time when most national currencies were still made out of [[gold]] and [[silver]]. It was established in 1865 and disbanded in 1927.  Many countries minted coins according to the LMU standard even though they did not formally accede to the LMU treaty.

==History==
[[File:LatinMonetaryUnion 1866-1914.svg|thumb|Overview of contractual states (red) and associated states (other colours) between 1866 and 1914.]]

The LMU adopted the specifications of the French gold franc, which had been introduced by [[Napoleon I]] in 1803 and was struck in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 40, 50 and 100 francs, with the 20 franc coin (6.45161g of .900 fine gold struck on a 21mm flan) being the most common. In the French system the gold franc was interchangeable with the silver franc based on an exchange ratio of 1:15.5, which was the approximate relative value of the two metals at the time of the law of 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Henry Parker |last= Willis |author-link= Henry Parker Willis |title= A History of the Latin Monetary Union: A Study in International Monetary Action |place= Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year= 1901 |page=1|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflatinmo00willuoft |accessdate= 12 June 2018|via= Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By treaty dated 23 December 1865,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96073g/f471.table [Traité (Recueil). 1864-1867&amp;#93;Recueil des traités de la France . Tome neuvième, pp. 453-458]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second French Empire|France]], [[Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], and [[Switzerland]] formed the Latin Monetary Union. They agreed to a combined gold and silver standard ([[bimetalism]]) with a gold-to-silver [[ratio]] of 15.5 to 1 as established in the French Franc. One LMU Franc represented 4.5 [[gram]]s of fine silver or 0.290322&amp;nbsp;gram of fine gold. 

The treaty required that all four contracting states strike freely exchangeable gold coins and silver coins according to common specifications. Before the treaty, for example, the fineness of the silver coins in the four states varied from 0.800 to 0.900.  The treaty required that the largest silver coin of 5 francs be struck 0.900 fine and the fractional silver of 2 francs, 1 franc, 50 centimes and 20 centimes all be struck at 0.835 fine.&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of 1865 Art. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement came into force on 1 August 1866.&lt;ref name="Polard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=John F. |year=2005 |title=Money and the Rise of the Modern Papacy: Financing the Vatican, 1850–1950 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-81204-6 |page=39  | url= https://books.google.com/?id=ppVxkjhwOKUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LMU served the function of facilitating trade between different countries by setting the standards by which gold and silver currency could be minted and exchanged. In this manner a French trader could accept Italian lire for his goods with confidence that it could be converted back to a comparable amount of francs.

Following the International Monetary Conference of 1867, the original four nations were joined by [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] on April 10, 1867.&lt;ref name="Henry Parker Willis 1901 p.81"&gt;Henry Parker Willis, A History of the Latin Monetary Union (U. Chicago Press 1901) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; Greece took advantage of a clause in the treaty that guaranteed admission of foreign states that agreed to abide by the treaty.  [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] also considered joining.  The discussions broke off unsuccessfully, but both countries nevertheless made an attempt to conform their currencies to the LMU standard.&lt;ref name="Henry Parker Willis 1901 p.81"/&gt;  [[Austria-Hungary]] refused to join the LMU because it rejected bimetallism, but signed a separate monetary treaty with France on December 24, 1867 whereby both states agreed to receive into their treasuries one another's gold coins at specified rates.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Parker Willis, A History of the Latin Monetary Union (U. Chicago Press 1901) p.83&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Austria-Hungary]] thereafter minted some but not all of its gold coins on the LMU standard, including the 4 and 8 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden (florin)]], which matched the specifications of the French 10 and 20 francs.

Other states later adopted the system without formally joining the treaty: The colonies of France (including Algeria) came under the scope of the treaty in 1865; Peru adopted the franc system by law of July 31, 1863; Colombia and [[Venezuela]] followed in 1871; the Grand Duchy of Finland adopted the system on August 9, 1877; [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] on November 11, 1878; and [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] on May 17, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Parker Willis, A History of the Latin Monetary Union (U. Chicago Press 1901) p.84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the [[Danish West Indies]] were also placed on this standard but did not join the Union itself. When [[Albania]] emerged from the [[Ottoman Empire]] as an independent nation in 1912, coins of the Latin Monetary Union from [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[Austria-Hungary]] began to circulate in place of the [[Ottoman Lira]]. Albania did not however mint its own coins, or issue its own paper money until it adopted an independent monetary system in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daggarjon.com/Currency_Albania.php  Daggar Jon's 'Coin and Currency']&lt;/ref&gt;

With the tacit agreement of [[Napoleon III of France]], [[Giacomo Antonelli]], the administrator of the Papal Treasury, embarked from 1866 on an ambitious increase in [[Papal mint|silver coinage]] without the prescribed amount of precious metal, equivalent to Belgium's total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= European Monetary Unification and the International Gold Standard (1865–1873) | last = Einaudi | first = Luca | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] | year= 2001 | isbn=0-19-924366-2 |page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polard"/&gt; The papal coins quickly became debased and excessively circulated in other union states,&lt;ref&gt;Not borne out by references in coin catalogues, e.g. Krause &amp; Mishler, Standard Catalog of World Coins, 19th century, which shows LMU standard finenesses for Papal States silver and gold coinage with no debasement&lt;/ref&gt; to the profit of the [[Holy See]], but Swiss and French banks rejected papal coins and the Papal States were ejected from the Union in 1870, owing 20 million lire.&lt;ref name="Polard"/&gt;

==Failure==

From the beginning, fluctuations in the relative value of gold and silver on the world market stressed the currency union. This is today recognized as an inevitable effect of a currency based on bimetalism when precious metal prices fluctuate. When the LMU was formed in 1865, silver was nearing the end of a period of high valuation compared to gold.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Parker Willis, A History of the Latin Monetary Union (U. Chicago Press 1901) p.85-86&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1873 the value of silver dropped significantly, followed by a sharp increase in silver imports in the LMU countries, particularly in France and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Parker Willis, A History of the Latin Monetary Union (U. Chicago Press 1901) p.116&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1873, the decreasing value of silver made it profitable to mint silver in exchange for gold at the Union's standard rate of 15.5 ounces to 1. Indeed, in all of 1871 and 1872 the French mint had received just 5,000,000 francs of silver for conversion to coin, but in 1873 alone received 154,000,000 francs. Fearing an influx of silver coinage, the member nations of the Union agreed in Paris on January 30, 1874, to limit the free conversion of silver temporarily. By 1878, with no recovery in the silver price in sight, minting of silver coinage was suspended absolutely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|chapter=Chapter XI}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1873 onwards, the Union was on a ''de facto'' [[gold standard]].  The law still permitted payment in silver, but custom demanded and enforced payment in gold.  The 5 franc silver pieces were "essentially upon the same footing as bank notes."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Parker Willis, A History of the Latin Monetary Union (U. Chicago Press 1901) p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate failure of the LMU was mostly due to outbreak of World War I, which led to the suspension of the Gold Standard throughout the international monetary system. Other issues had arisen, however. For example, some members, notably the Papal State's treasurer, Cardinal [[Giacomo Antonelli]], began to debase their currency. This meant he minted coins with an inadequate amount of silver and then [[Gresham's law|exchanged them for coins from other countries that had been minted correctly]]. More importantly, because new discoveries and better refining techniques increased the supply of silver, the fixed LMU exchange rate eventually overvalued silver relative to gold. German traders, in particular, were known to bring silver to LMU countries, have it minted into coinage then exchanged those for gold coins at the discounted exchange rate. These destabilizing tactics eventually forced the LMU to convert to a pure gold standard for its currency in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldcoin.org/gold-coins/the-latin-monetary-union-1865/691/ The Latin Monetary Union]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924366-2.pdf European Monetary Unification and the International Gold Standard (1865-1873), Oxford University Press 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808204706/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924366-2.pdf |date=2007-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', another major problem of the LMU was that it failed to outlaw the printing of paper money based on the bimetallic currency. [[Third French Republic|France]] and [[Italy]] exploited this weakness by printing banknotes to fund their own endeavours, effectively "forcing other members of the union to bear some of the cost of its fiscal extravagance by issuing notes backed by their currency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/80094624-e076-11e0-bd01-00144feabdc0.html |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |title=Eurozone: A nightmare scenario - Latin Lessons |date=September 16, 2011 }} note:free registration to FT is required to view the article&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of modern Greece|Greece]] also caused problems. According to the BBC, "its chronically weak economy meant successive Greek governments responded by decreasing the amount of gold in their coins,&lt;ref&gt;This also is not backed up by the coinage record.  Greece issued no silver or gold coins for circulation after 1884 (silver resumed in 1910), and all extant coins from the period in question (prior to 1884 and in 1910/11) are of LMU standard.  See Krause &amp; Mishler, Standard Catalog of World Coins, 19th-century &amp; 20th-century volumes (annual publications).&lt;/ref&gt; thereby debasing their currency in relation to those of other nations in the union and in violation of the original agreement". Greece was formally expelled from the Latin Monetary Union in 1908. It was readmitted in 1910, however.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17140379 |title=A Point of View: Making friends the shared currency way |work=BBC |accessdate=February 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the minting of new silver coinage ceased, the existing silver coins continued in circulation, and the fluctuations in the values of gold and silver, were something of a nuisance.{{Clarify|date=August 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The political turbulence of the early twentieth century which culminated in the [[World War I|First World War]] brought the Latin Monetary Union to its final end in practice, even though it continued ''[[de jure]]'' until 1927, when it came to a formal end.

The last coins made according to the standards (i.e., diameter, weight and silver fineness) of the Union were the Swiss half, one-franc, and two-franc pieces of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Krause &amp; Mishler, Standard Catalog of World Coins, 20th century.  The cupro-nickel ½, 1 and 2-franc coins made since 1968 were also still of LMU-standard weight and diameter, though no longer silver.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Austria still mints gold 4 and 8 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] (florin) gold coins to the LMU specifications for collectors and investors, and modern gold rounds to LMU standards are also commercially minted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.echtgeld.ch/en/gold.php|title=Buy Swiss Gold from Echtgeld AG|website=www.echtgeld.ch|access-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
A 2018 study in the ''[[European Review of Economic History]]'' found that the LMU had no significant effects on trade, except during the period 1865–1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timini|first=Jacopo|title=Currency unions and heterogeneous trade effects: the case of the Latin Monetary Union|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ereh/hex027/4797593|journal=European Review of Economic History|doi=10.1093/ereh/hex027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin Monetary Union inspired the [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]], established in 1873.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

[[File:Rolls Royce Phantom - Flickr - Alexandre Prévot (5) (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rolls-Royce Phantom VII]] is a [[luxury vehicle]]]]

In [[economics]], a '''luxury good''' (or '''upmarket good''') is a [[good (economics)|good]] for which [[demand (economics)|demand]] increases more than proportionally as [[income]] rises, and is a contrast to a "[[necessity good]]", where demand increases proportionally less than income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hal |last=Varian |authorlink=Hal Varian |title=Microeconomic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The word "luxury" originated from the Latin word “Luxus,” which means indulgence of the senses, regardless of cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Salehzadeh|first1= Reza|last2= Pool|first2= Javad|date= 19 Oct 2016|title= Brand Attitude and Perceived Value and Purchase Intention toward Global Luxury Brands|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/wicm20|journal= Journal of International Consumer Marketing|volume= 29|issue= 2|pages= 74-82|doi= 10.1080/08961530.2016.1236311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market characteristics==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2018}}
[[Image:Patek-Philippe MG 2586.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Patek Philippe]] is a luxury watch brand]]
[[File:Foie gras with sauternes.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Wine and [[foie gras]] ]]

Luxury goods are said to have high [[income elasticity of demand]]: as people become wealthier, they will buy more luxury goods. This also means, however, that should there be a decline in income its demand will drop. Income elasticity of demand is not constant with respect to income, and may change sign at different levels of income. That is to say, a luxury good may become a [[normal good]] or even an [[inferior good]] at different income levels, e.g. a wealthy person stops buying increasing numbers of [[luxury cars]] for his or her automobile collection to start collecting airplanes (at such an income level, the luxury car would become an inferior good).

Some luxury products have been claimed to be examples of [[Veblen good]]s, with a positive [[price elasticity of demand]]: for example, making a perfume more expensive can increase its perceived value as a luxury good to such an extent that sales can go up, rather than down.

Although the technical term luxury good is independent of the goods' quality, they are generally considered to be goods at the highest end of the market in terms of quality and price. Classic luxury goods include [[haute couture]] clothing, accessories, and luggage. Many markets have a luxury segment including, for example, [[automobile]], [[yacht]], [[wine]], [[bottled water]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[foods]], [[watches]], [[clothes]], [[jewelry]], and [[high fidelity]].

Luxuries may be services. The hiring of full-time or live-in [[domestic worker|domestic servants]] is a luxury reflecting disparities of income. Some financial services, especially in some brokerage houses, can be considered luxury services by default because persons in lower-income brackets generally do not use them.

Luxury goods often have special [[Luxury packaging]] to differentiate the products from mainstream competitors.

==Market trends==
The three dominant trends are the main factors that have accelerated the rapid growth of the industry, including the customer base and variations in the consumptions of different brands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seo|first1=Yuri|last2=Oliver|first2=Margo Buchanan|date=2015|title=Luxury branding: the industry, trends, and future conceptualisations|url=https://doi.org/10.1108/APJML-10-2014-0148|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics|volume=27(1)|pages=82-98|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three dominant trends in the global luxury goods market are [[globalization]], [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]], and [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Consolidation involves the growth of big companies and ownership of brands across many segments of luxury products. Examples include [[LVMH]], [[Richemont]], and [[Kering]], which dominate the market in areas ranging from luxury drinks to fashion and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/lvmh-kering-richemont-where-to-place-your-bets|title=LVMH, Kering, Richemont? Where to Place Your Bets.|date=2016-06-13|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global consumer companies, such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], are also attracted to the industry, due to the difficulty of making a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] in the mass consumer goods market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-28/procter-and-gamble-profits-from-high-end-products|title=Procter &amp; Gamble Cleans Up With Luxury Paper Towels|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customer base for various luxury goods continue to be more culturally diversified, and this presents more unseen challenges and new opportunities to companies in this industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Market size==

The luxury goods market has been on an upward climb for many years. Apart from the setback caused by the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], the industry has performed well, particularly in 2000. In that year, the world luxury goods market&amp;nbsp;– which includes drinks, fashion, cosmetics, fragrances, watches, jewelry, luggage, handbags&amp;nbsp;– was worth close to $170 billion and grew 7.9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yorku.ca/eresolver/?id=984257 “The World Market for Luxury Goods.” Global Market for Luxury Goods. Nov 1, 2001, March 5, 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has been the largest regional market for luxury goods and is estimated to continue to be the leading personal luxury goods market in 2013, with a value of 62.5 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Topic: Global Luxury Goods Industry|url = http://www.statista.com/topics/1110/global-luxury-goods-industry/|website = www.statista.com|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest sector in this category was luxury drinks, including premium [[whisky]], [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]], [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac]]. This sector was the only one that suffered a decline in value (-0.9 percent).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The watches and jewelry section showed the strongest performance, growing in value by 23.3 percent, while the clothing and accessories section grew 11.6 percent between 1996 and 2000, to $32.8 billion. North America is the largest regional market for luxury goods.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The largest ten markets for luxury goods account for 83 percent of overall sales, and include Japan, China, United States, Russia, Germany, Italy, France, United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain, and Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In 2012, [[Economy of China|China]] surpassed [[Economy of Japan|Japan]] as the world's largest luxury market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China bans television ads for bling|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/08/business/china-bans-luxury-product-ads/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's luxury consumption accounts for over 25% of the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.export-to-china.com/chinaWants/luxury|title=Export to China|work=export-to-china.com|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Economist Intelligence Unit]] published a report on the outlook for luxury goods in Asia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=AsiaLuxuryGoods Asia Luxury Goods]&lt;/ref&gt; which explores the trends and forecasts for the luxury goods market across key markets in Asia.

==Art history==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Ballbüchlein Griot KGM 66-142.jpg|thumb|Secular [[Rococo]] luxury or [[treasure binding]] for a book, using techniques from the making of gold boxes, in gold, [[mother of pearl]] and hardstone, Berlin, 1750–1760.  By this time such lavish bindings were unusual.]]
Though often verging on the meaningless in modern marketing, "luxury" remains a legitimate{{clarify|date=March 2018}} and current technical term in [[art history]] for objects that are especially highly decorated to very high standards and use expensive materials. The term is especially used for [[medieval]] [[manuscript]]s to distinguish between practical working books for normal use, and fully [[illuminated manuscript]]s, that were often bound in [[treasure binding]]s with metalwork and jewels. These are often much larger, with less text on each page and many illustrations, and if [[liturgical text]]s were originally usually kept on the [[Altar in the Catholic Church|altar]] or [[sacristy]] rather any library that the church or [[monastery]] who owned them may have had. Secular luxury manuscripts were commissioned by the very wealthy and differed in the same ways from cheaper books.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

"Luxury" may be used for other [[applied arts]] where both utilitarian and luxury versions of the same types of objects were made. This might cover metalwork, ceramics, glass, arms and armour, and a wide range of objects. It is much less used for objects with no function beyond being an artwork: paintings, drawings and [[sculpture]], even though the disparity in cost between an expensive and cheap work may have been as large.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Scope of the term==
With increasing "democratization" of luxury goods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wong |first=N. Y. |last2=Ahuvia |first2=A. C. |year=1998 |title=Personal taste and family face: Luxury consumption in Confucian and Western societies |journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=423–441 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6793(199808)15:5&lt;423::AID-MAR2&gt;3.0.CO;2-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  new product categories have been created within the luxury market,   called "accessible luxury" or "mass luxury". These are meant specifically for the [[middle class]], which sometimes called the "aspiring class" in this context. Because luxury has now diffused into the masses, defining the word has become more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pauravshukla.com/what-is-luxury |title=What is luxury? |publisher=Paurav Shukla |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing up to the modern day the long and generally very unsuccessful history of [[sumptuary law]]s designed to curb excessive personal consumption, in February 2013, the Chinese government banned advertisements for luxury goods on its official state radio and television channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ramy |last=Inocencio|title=China bans television ads for bling|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/08/business/china-bans-luxury-product-ads/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5|work=CNN|date=February 8, 2013|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic significance==
{{see also|positional good}}
Several manufactured products attain the status of "luxury goods" due to their design, quality, durability or performance that are remarkably superior to the comparable substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Doyle|first2=Stephen|editor1-last=Ozuem|editor1-first=Wilson|editor2-last=Azemi|editor2-first=Yllka|title=Designing Indulgent Interaction: Luxury Fashion, M-Commerce, and Übermensch|date=2018|publisher=IGI Global|location=1|isbn=9781522526971|pages=1-21|url=https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/chapter/191070|language=English|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, virtually every category of goods available on the market today includes a subset of similar products whose "luxury" is marked by better-quality components and materials, solid construction, stylish appearance, increased durability, better performance, advanced features, and so on. As such, these luxury goods may retain or improve the basic functionality for which all items of a given category are originally designed.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

There are also goods that are perceived as luxurious by the public simply because they play a role of [[status symbol]]s as such goods tend to signify the purchasing power of those who acquire them.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} These items, while not necessarily being better (in quality, performance, or appearance) than their less expensive substitutes, are purchased with the main purpose of displaying [[wealth]] or [[income]] of their owners.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} These kinds of goods are the objects of a socio-economic phenomenon called ''[[conspicuous consumption]]'' and commonly include [[luxury vehicle]]s, [[watch]]es, [[jewellery|jewelry]], [[designer clothing]], [[yacht]]s, as well as large residences, urban [[mansion]]s, and [[English country house|country houses]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Luxury brands==
[[File:Armani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Armani]] Collezioni is a luxury brand for clothing, while  Armani Exchange and Armani Jeans are accessible brands]]
A luxury brand or prestige brand is a [[brand]] for which a majority of its products are luxury goods. It may also include certain brands whose names are associated with luxury, high price, or high quality, though few, if any, of their goods are currently considered luxury goods.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[LVMH]] (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) is the largest luxury good producer in the world with over fifty brands, including [[Louis Vuitton]], the brand with the world's first [[fashion designer]] label.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The LVMH group made a profit of [[Euro|€]]2 billion on sales of €12 billion in 2003.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Other market leaders{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} include [[Richemont]] and [[Kering]] (previously named PPR).

A rather small group in comparison, the wealthy tend to be extremely influential.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Once a brand gets an "endorsement" from members of this group, then the brand can be defined as a true "luxury" brand. An example of different product lines in the same brand is found in the automotive industry, with "entry-level" cars marketed to younger, less wealthy consumers, and higher-cost models for older and more wealthy consumers.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The advertising expenditure for the average luxury brand is 5-15% of sales [[revenue]], or  about 25% with the inclusion of other communications such as [[public relations]], events and sponsorships.&lt;ref&gt;Okonkwo, Uché. [https://books.google.com/books?id=a_6CublRtYwC&amp;pg=PA145 Luxury fashion branding: trends, tactics, techniques ]. Page 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luxury department stores==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2018}}
Since the uprising of the 'luxury brand' in the 1800s, department stores dedicated to selling all major luxury brands have popped up in most major cities around the world. [[Le Bon Marche]] located in [[Paris]], [[France]] is credited for being one of the first of its kind, but also [[Neiman Marcus]], [[Selfridges]], [[Lane Crawford]], [[Isetan]], [[Fortnum &amp; Mason]], [[Lord &amp; Taylor]], [[Harvey Nichols]], [[Barneys New York]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[KaDeWe]], [[Harrods]] and [[Holt Renfrew]] are seen as some of the most influential and historical.

The '''Marie de' Medici Cycle''' is a series of twenty-four paintings by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] commissioned by [[Marie de' Medici]], widow of [[Henry IV of France]], for the [[Luxembourg Palace]] in Paris. Rubens received the commission in the autumn of 1621.  After negotiating the terms of the contract in early 1622, the project was to be completed within two years, coinciding with the marriage of Marie's daughter, [[Henrietta Maria]].  Twenty-one of the paintings depict Marie's own struggles and triumphs in life. The remaining three are portraits of herself and her parents.&lt;ref name="belkin173-5"/&gt; The paintings now hang in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

==Commission==
Much speculation exists on the exact circumstances under which Marie de' Medici decided to commission Rubens to paint "such a grandiose project, conceived in truly heroic proportions".&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 2"&gt;Saward, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; John Coolidge suggests the cycle may have even  been commissioned to rival another famous series of Rubens, ''The Constantine Tapestries'', which he designed in his studio at the same time as the first several paintings of the Medici Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that Rubens prepared a number of oil sketches, by the request of [[Louis XIII]], the son of Marie de’ Medici and successor to the throne, which may have influenced the Queen's decision to commission Rubens for the cycle by the end of the year 1621.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 2"/&gt; The immortalizing of her life, however, seems to be the most apparent reason for the Queen's choice to commission a painter who was capable of executing such a demanding task. Peter Paul Rubens had already established himself as an exceptional painter and also had the advantage of sustaining close ties with several important people of the time, including Marie de' Medici's sister, the wife of one of Rubens's first important patrons, the Duke of Gonzaga. The information about the commission in the contract Rubens signed is far from detailed and focuses mainly on the number of pictures in the cycle dedicated to the Queen's life, and is far less specific when it comes to the cycle praising her husband [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The contract stated that Rubens was to paint all the figures, which presumably allowed him to employ assistants for backgrounds and details.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marie de' Medici==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 095b.jpg|Maria de' Medici|thumb|upright]]
[[Marie de' Medici]] became the second wife to King [[Henry IV of France]] in a [[proxy marriage|marriage by proxy]] on 5 October 1600 by the power invested in her uncle, [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany]].&lt;ref name="belkin182"&gt;Belkin, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; When Henry was assassinated in 1610, [[Louis XIII]], his son and successor to the throne, was only eight years old. Louis' mother, Marie, acted as his regent as commanded by the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Salic law]] in case of an infant ruler. However, even after Louis came of age at thirteen in 1614, the queen continued ruling in his stead. In 1617, Louis XIII finally decided to take governing matters in his own hands at the age of fifteen and the queen was exiled to Blois.

Louis and his mother were not reconciled for over four years, and finally in 1621 Marie was permitted to return to Paris.  Upon her return, Marie focused on building and decorating the [[Luxembourg Palace]], an enormous undertaking in which [[Peter Paul Rubens]] played a key role.&lt;ref name="belkin173-5" /&gt; Rubens, then court painter to the [[Duchy of Mantua]] under [[Vincenzo I Gonzaga]],&lt;ref name="belkin42"&gt;Belkin, 42&lt;/ref&gt; had first met Marie at her proxy wedding in Florence in 1600.&lt;ref name="smith127"&gt;Smith, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1621, Marie de' Medici commissioned Rubens to paint two large series depicting the lives of herself and her late husband,  Henry IV, to adorn both wings of the first floor of the Luxembourg Palace.&lt;ref name="belkin173-5"&gt;Belkin, pp. 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt; The first series of 21 canvases depicts the life of Marie in largely [[allegory|allegorical]] terms, and was finished by the end of 1624, to coincide with the celebrations surrounding the wedding of her daughter, [[Henrietta Maria]] to [[Charles I of England]] on 11 May 1625.&lt;ref name="belkin175-6"&gt;Belkin, pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of paintings dedicated to the life of  Henry IV was never completed, although some preliminary sketches survive.&lt;ref name="belkin175-6"/&gt; (See [[#Henry IV Cycle]] below).  The fact that the Henry IV series was not realized can be attributed in part to Marie de' Medici being permanently banned from France by her son in 1631.  She escaped to Brussels, and later died in exile in 1642 in the same house that the Peter Paul Rubens's family had occupied more than fifty years prior.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin pp. 174-175&lt;/ref&gt;

While this cycle was one of Rubens's first great commissions, Marie de' Medici's life proved a difficult one to portray. Rubens had the task of creating twenty-one paintings about a woman whose life could be measured by her marriage to [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and the births of her six children, one of which died in infancy.&lt;ref name="belkin178"&gt;Belkin, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, women did not in general receive such laudatory tributes, although Rubens, if anyone, was well equipped for the job, having a great respect for "the virtues of the opposite sex", as seen in his commissions for the [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Archduchess Isabella]].&lt;ref name="belkin178"/&gt;  Furthermore, unlike her husband, Marie's life was neither graced with triumphant victories nor punctuated by vanquished foes.&lt;ref name="belkin178"/&gt;  Rather, implications of political scandal in her life made any literal depiction of the events far too controversial for Rubens to execute without incurring the disapproval from others in government.&lt;ref name="belkin179"&gt;Belkin, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;  Far from failing, Rubens demonstrated his impressive knowledge of [[classical literature]] and artistic traditions,&lt;ref name="belkin170"&gt;Belkin, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; by using allegorical representations to both glorify the mundane aspects and sensitively illustrate the less favorable events in Marie's life. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries iconography of the Christian world, as well as that of the Greek and Roman pantheon was understood by well-educated artists and citizens alike, and a familiar device used in artistry.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Rubens painted extravagant images of the Queen Mother surrounded by ancient gods and at times even deified her using these devices. The ambiguity of the figures was essentially used to depict Marie in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens's Medici commission was an inspiration for other artists as well, particularly the French painters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] (1684–1721) and [[François Boucher]] (1703–1770) who produced copies from the Medici cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rubens ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|Peter Paul Rubens|thumb|upright]]
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577–1640) was a highly influential artist in Northern Europe, widely believed to have played an important role in shaping the style and visual language of his time.  The overseer or creator of more than three thousand woodcuts, engravings and paintings in various mediums, Rubens's works include historical, religious and allegorical paintings, altarpieces, portraits and landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  He is particularly known for his portrayal of human figures, lush and richly colored fabrics and well-developed themes often derived from both Christian and classical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;   Rubens's studies of classical, Greek, and Latin texts influenced his career and set him apart from other painters during his time.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, Rubens studied under Flemish artists such as [[Otto van Veen]],&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; but his most notable influences come from the time he spent in Italy where he studied ancient sculpture and the works of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. It was during his time in Italy that he began to make copies of [[classical sculpture]], such as the [[Laocoon]], and collect drawings done by other artists.  However, the artist was also an avid collector of both reproductions and original works, not only from the masters of the Italian Renaissance, but more predominantly from his contemporaries.  Rubens owned more prints from his contemporary, [[Adriaen Brouwer]], than any other of his Italian influences or his own contemporaries, although it is suggested that Rubens's compassion and concern for Brouwer's career may have been the influential cause for his collection of Brouwer's work.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;  This record of visual history and the influences of his contemporaries, some who became lifelong friends of Rubens, would make an imprint on his art throughout his entire life.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 41-59&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rubens was commissioned to paint the Marie de' Medici cycle, he was quite possibly the most famous and skilled artist in Northern Europe, and was especially appreciated for his monumental religious works, commissioned by various councils and churches in the area.&lt;ref name="belkin170"/&gt; However, the Medici commission was welcomed by Rubens as an opportunity to apply his skills within a secular scene.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of Marie de' Medici's commission continued throughout the rest of Rubens's career. Not only did he further establish and publicize his skill, but also the similarities that exist in his later works, such as stylistic components and themes, undeniably reflect the Medici series.

==The Paintings==
[[File:Destiny of marie de medici.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''The Destiny of Maria de' Medici'']]
Originally the paintings were hung clockwise in chronological order, decorating the walls of a waiting room expanding from a royal apartment in Marie de' Medici's [[Luxembourg Palace]].&lt;ref name="smith127"/&gt; The paintings are now displayed in the same order in the Louvre.&lt;ref name="Belkin, p. 181"&gt;Belkin, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an additional claim that Marie had envisioned these paintings to be studied alternately, left to right, so the thoughtful viewer would have had to crisscross down the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Coolidge, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge also argues that Marie envisioned the subjects as falling into pairs, and further into groups. Therefore, Marie's visual biography was divided into three main chapters: childhood, life as a married queen, and the regency as a widow.&lt;ref name="Coolidge, 69"&gt;Coolidge, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of the paintings have the same height although they vary in width in order to fit the shape of the room they were intended for. The sixteen paintings that covered the long walls of the gallery measure about four meters tall by three meters wide, the three larger paintings at the end of the room are four meters high by seven meters wide.&lt;ref name="Belkin, p. 181"/&gt;

Originally the viewer would have entered the gallery from the southeast corner. The most visible works from this angle were ''The Coronation in Saint Denis'' and ''The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency.'' &lt;ref&gt;Coolidge, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;
The cycle began at the entrance wall, featuring images of Marie's childhood years and her marriage to [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]. Four of the images are devoted to the marriage, possibly because marriage at Marie's relatively advanced age of twenty-seven was quite rare for a woman at the time.&lt;ref name="belkin182"/&gt; This half ends with a depiction of Marie's coronation. The wall opposite the gallery's entrance presents an image of the assassination and assumption of Henry IV, as well as the proclamation of the widowed Marie's regency. From there, the second half of Rubens' cycle begins addressing the more controversial issues from Marie's reign. For example, both the altercation and reconciliation with her son [[Louis XIII]] are subjects Marie de' Medici commissioned Rubens to paint for this gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 181-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical period that encompassed the subject matter for the paintings was a time of political upheaval in which Rubens sought not to offend the reigning French monarch.  Rubens thus turned to mythological allusions, emblematic references, personifications of vices and virtues and religious analogies to veil an often unheroic or ambiguous reality.  Within this context Rubens' approach to 'historical truth' may appear selective or, worse, dishonest, but he was neither a historian in the modern sense, nor a journalist; the Medici cycle is not reportage, but rather poetic transformation.&lt;ref name="Belkin p. 179"&gt;Belkin p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

As a narrative source for the Marie de' Medici cycle Rubens used an ancient genera of writing in which ideal kingship, and good government were explored.  This genera of writing is called the [[Panegyric]].  Panegyric writings were usually written during an important political event, the birth of a prince for example, and were used to exalt the qualities and ancestry of a ruler.  A formal chronological structure is followed in Panegyric writings detailing the ancestry, birth, education and life of the individual.  Rubens followed this structure in his series of paintings about [[Marie de' Medici]].&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of Marie de' Medici Cycle was roughly 24,000 guilders for the 292 square meters, which calculates to about 82 guilders, or 1,512 dollars, per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;Downes, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

The first painting of the narrative cycle, ''The Destiny of Marie de' Medici'', is a twisting composition of the three [[Parcae|Fates]] on clouds beneath the celestial figures of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].

[[Parcae|The Fates]] are depicted as beautiful, nude goddesses spinning the thread of Marie de' Medici's destiny; their presence at Marie's birth assures her prosperity and success as a ruler that is unveiled in the cycle's subsequent panels.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp.22-25&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek and Roman mythology, one Fate spun the thread, another measured its length, and the third cut the thread.  In Rubens' depiction, however, the scissors necessary for this cutting are omitted, stressing the privileged and immortal character of the Queen's life.&lt;ref name="Thuillier, Jacques 1967"&gt;Thuillier, Jacques.  Rubens' Life of Marie de' Medici.  New York:  Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The last panel of the cycle, in accordance with this theme, illustrates Queen Marie rising up to her place as queen of heaven, having achieved her lifelong goal of immortality through eternal fame.&lt;ref name="Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 26-29"&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 26-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Early interpretations explained Juno's presence in the scene through her identity as the goddess of childbirth.  Later interpretations suggested, however, that Rubens used [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] to represent Marie de' Medici's alter ego, or avatar, throughout the cycle.  [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] accordingly signifies the allegory of Henry IV, the promiscuous husband.&lt;ref name="Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 26-29"/&gt;

===''The Birth of the Princess''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 045.jpg|''The Birth of the Princess, in Florence on 26 April 1573''|thumb|right|''The Birth of the Princess, in Florence on 26 April 1573''.]]
The cycle's second painting, ''The Birth of the Princess'', represents Medici's April 26, 1573 birth. Symbols and allegory appear throughout the painting. On the left, two [[putti]] play with a shield on which the Medici crest appears, suggesting that Heaven favored the young Medici from the moment of her birth. The river god in the picture's right corner is likely an allusion to the [[Arno River]] that passes through Florence, Marie's city of birth. The cornucopia above the infant's head can be interpreted as a harbinger of Marie's future glory and fortune; the lion may be seen as symbolic of power and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Matilde Battistini, Symbole und Allegorien&lt;/ref&gt; The glowing [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around the infant's head should not be seen as a reference to Christian imagery; rather, it should be read according to imperial iconography which uses the halo as an indication of the Queen's divine nature and of her future reign.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp.32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Though Marie was born under the [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] sign, [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] appears in the painting; it may be seen as a guardian of imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Education of the Princess''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 039.jpg|''The Education of the Princess''|thumb|left|''The Education of the Princess'']]
''Education of the Princess'' (1622–1625) shows a maturing [[Marie de' Medici]] at study. Her education is given a [[divine grace]] by the presence of three gods [[Apollo]], [[Athena]], and [[Hermes]]. [[Apollo]] being associated with art, [[Athena]] with wisdom, and [[Hermes]] the messenger god for a fluency and understanding of language.&lt;ref name="vandergriff"&gt;Vandergriff, ''The Life of Marie de' Medici''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermes]] dramatically rushes in on the scene and literally brings a gift from the gods, the [[caduceus]]. It is generally thought that Hermes endows the princess with  the gift of eloquence, to go along with the Grace's gift of beauty. However, the caduceus, which is seen in six other paintings in the cycle, has also been associated with peace and harmony. The object may be seen as foretelling of Marie's peaceful reign.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be interpreted that the combined efforts of these divine teachers represent  Marie's idyllic preparedness for the responsibilities she will obtain in the future, and the trials and tribulations she will face as Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that the three gods, more importantly, offer their guidance as a gift that allows the soul to be "freed by reason" and gain the knowledge of what is "good" revealing the divine connection between the gods and the future Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting displays an embellished Baroque collaboration of the spiritual and earthly relationships, which are illustrated in a theatrical environment.&lt;ref name="Smith, p 128"&gt;Smith, p 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as more than just static symbols the figures portrayed take an active role in her education. Also present are [[Charites|the three graces]], Euphrosyne, Aglaea, and Thalia giving her beauty.&lt;ref name="vandergriff"/&gt;

===''The Presentation of Her Portrait to Henry IV''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 048.jpg|thumb|right|''The Presentation of Her Portrait to Henry IV'']]
To fully appreciate and value this particular cycle piece and the collection as a whole, there is one historical principle to take into account.  This painting was created on the cusp of the age of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and, as such, one must remember royalty were considered above corporeal existence.  So from birth, Marie would have led a life more ornamental than mortal.  This painting of classical gods, along with allegorical personifications, aptly shows the viewer how fundamental this idea was.&lt;ref name="Held, p. 205"&gt;Held, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Tamino in ''The Magic Flute'', Henry IV falls in love with a painted image.  With [[Cupid|Amor]] the Cupid as his escort, [[Hymenaios]], the god of marriage, displays the princess Marie on canvas to her future king and husband.  Meanwhile, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] are sitting atop clouds looking down on Henry as they provide the viewer a key example of marital harmony and thus show approval for the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; A personification of France is shown behind Henry in her helmet, her left hand showing support, sharing in his admiration of the future sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Held, p. 205"/&gt; Rubens had a way of depicting France that was very versatile in gender in many of his paintings in the cycle.  Here France takes on an androgynous role being both woman and man at the same time. Frances's intimate gesture may suggest a closeness between Henry and his country. This gesture would usually be shared among male companions, telling each other's secret. The way France is also dressed shows how female she is on top revealing her breasts and the way the fabric is draped adding notions of classicism.  However her bottom half, most notably her exposed calves and Roman boots hints at a masculinity. A sign of male strength in the history of imagery was their stance and exposed strong legs.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p.493&lt;/ref&gt; This connection between the two show that not only are the gods in favor of the match, the King also has the well wishes of his people.

In negotiating the marriage between [[Marie de' Medici]] and Henry IV, a number of portraits were exchanged between the two.  The king was pleased with her looks, and upon meeting her was impressed even more by her, than with her portraits.  There was great approval of the match, as the pope and many powerful Florentine nobles had been advocates of the marriage and had worked at convincing the king of the benefits of such a union.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple were [[proxy marriage|married by proxy]] on October 5, 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens is able to coalesce these characters together into a single united front. He creates equality between all of the figures in the painting by cleverly balancing corporeal and ethereal space.&lt;ref name="Held, p. 205"/&gt;

===''The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 052.jpg|''the Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV''|thumb|left|''The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV'']] ''The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV'' (1622–25), Rubens depicts the [[proxy marriage]] ceremony of the Florentine princess Marie de' Medici to the King of France,  Henry IV  which took place in the cathedral of Florence on October 5, 1600. [[Pietro Aldobrandini|Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini]] presides over the ritual. As was often the case with royal weddings, the bride's uncle, the [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany]] stood in the King's place and is pictured here slipping a ring on his niece's finger. All the surrounding figures are identifiable, including the artist himself. Although he was present at the actual event twenty years earlier, as a member of the Gonzaga household during his travels in Italy, Rubens appears youthful and stands behind the bride, holding a cross and gazing out at the viewer. It is highly unlikely that Rubens actually had such a pronounced presence in this scene when it took place. Those who attended the ceremony for Marie include [[Christine of Lorraine|Grand Duchess Cristina of Tuscany]] and Marie's sister [[Eleonora de' Medici|Eleonora, Duchess of Mantua]]; and in entourage of Grand Duke are Roger de Bellegarde, Grand Esquire of France, and the Marquis de Sillery, who negotiated the marriage. As in other scenes in the Medici Cycle, Rubens includes a mythological element: the ancient god of marriage, [[Hymenaios]]  wearing a crown of roses, carries the bride's train in one hand and the nuptial torch in the other.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp.182-185&lt;/ref&gt; The scene takes place below a marble statue, which depicts [[God the Father]] mourning over the dead body of Christ, alluding to the Pieta sculpture by [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli|Baccio Bandinelli]] (1493–1560).

===''The Disembarkation at Marseilles''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 035.jpg|''The Disembarkation at Marseilles''|thumb|right|''The Disembarkation at Marseilles'']]
Having never been a particularly graceful event for anyone, disembarking a ship does not pose a problem for Rubens in his depiction of [[Marie de' Medici]] arriving in Marseilles after having been married to  Henry IV  by proxy in [[Florence]]. Rubens has again, turned something ordinary into something of unprecedented magnificence.  He depicts her leaving the ship down a gangplank (she actually walked up, not down, but was illustrated this way by Rubens to create a diagonal element).  She was accompanied by the Grand Duchess of Tuscany and her sister, the [[Duchess of Mantua]], into the welcoming, allegorical open arms of a personified France, wearing a helmet and the royal blue mantle with the golden [[fleur-de-lis]]. Her sister and aunt flank Marie while two trumpets are blown simultaneously by an ethereal Fame, announcing her arrival to the people of France. Below, [[Poseidon (mythology)|Poseidon]], three [[Nereids]], a sea-god and [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] rise from the sea, after having escorted the future Queen on the long voyage to procure her safe arrival in Marseilles.  To the left, the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the Medici can be seen above an arched structure, where a Knight of Malta stands in all of his [[regalia]].  It is melody and song as Rubens combines heaven and Earth, history and allegory into a symphony for the eyes of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, pp. 703-705&lt;/ref&gt;  On a side note, Avermaete discusses an interesting idea that is particularly present in this canvas.&lt;ref name="Avermaete, Roger 1968"&gt;Avermaete, Roger.

===''The Meeting of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV at Lyons''===
[[File:Rubens medici cycle meeting at Lyon.jpg|''The Meeting of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV at Lyons''|thumb|left|''The Meeting of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV at Lyons'']]
This painting allegorically depicts the first meeting of Marie and Henry, which took place after their nuptials by proxy. The upper half of the painting shows Marie and Henry as the mythological Roman gods [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. The representations are accompanied by their traditional attributes. Marie is shown as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (Greek [[Hera]]) identified by the peacocks and chariot. Henry is shown as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Greek [[Zeus]]) identified by the fiery thunderbolts in his hand and the eagle. The joining of the couple's right hands is a traditional symbol of the marriage union. They are dressed in the classical style, which is naturally appropriate to the scene. Above the two stands [[Hymen (mythology)|Hymen]] who unites them. A rainbow extends from the left corner, a symbol of concord and peace. The lower half of the painting is dominated by imagery of Lyons. Reading from left to right, we see the cityscape with its single hill. The lions pull the chariot (which is a pun on the name of the city), and in the chariot we see the allegorical figure of the city herself with a crown of her battlements: Lyons. Rubens needed to be very careful in the representation of the couple's first meeting because allegedly Henry was very much involved with a mistress at the time of the marriage. In fact, due to the king's other engagements their introduction was delayed, and it was not until midnight nearly a week after Marie arrived that Henry finally joined his bride.  By presenting him as Jupiter Rubens implies the promiscuity of the man and the deity. Simultaneously by placing King and Queen together he effectively illustrates the elevated status of the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Birth of the Dauphin at Fontainebleau''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 046.jpg|''The Birth of the Dauphin at Fountainebleau''|thumb|right|''The Birth of the Dauphin at Fountainebleau'']]
This painting depicts the birth of Marie de' Medici's first son, [[Louis XIII]]. Rubens designed the scene around the theme of political peace.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of the first male heir brings a sense of security to the royal family that they will continue to rule. In those times an heir was of the utmost importance, especially if Henry wanted to showcase his masculinity and discontinue with the pattern of the royal reproductive failure.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Katherine B.,''The Politics of Promiscuity: Masculinity and Heroic Representation at the Court of Henry IV''
French Historical Studies, Vol. 26, No. 2, Special Issue: French History in the Visual Sphere. (Spring, 2003), p.230&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''dauphin'' is French for dolphin, a term associated with princely royalty. Henry's promiscuity made difficult the production of a legitimate heir, and rumors circulated to the extent that Henry's court artists began to employ strategies to convince the country otherwise. One of these strategies was to personify Marie as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] or [[Minerva]]. By representing Marie as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], implying Henry as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the king is seen domesticated by marriage. The queen's personification as Minerva would facilitate Henry's military prowess and her own.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; As a Flemish painter Rubens includes a dog in the painting, alluding to fidelity in marriage. In addition to the idea of political peace Rubens also includes the personification of Justice, [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]]. The return of Astraea to earth is symbolic of the embodiment of continuing Justice with the birth of the future king. Louis is nursed by [[Themis]], the goddess of divine order, referring to [[Louis XIII]] birthright to one day become king. The baby is quite close to a serpent, which is a representation of Health.&lt;ref&gt;Wedgwood, C.V., p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  Rubens incorporates the traditional allegory of the cornucopia, which symbolizes abundance, to enhance the meaning of the painting by including the heads of Marie de' Medici's children who have yet to be born among the fruit. While Marie gazes adoringly at her son, Fecundity presses the cornucopia to her arm, representing the complete and bountiful family to come.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Consignment of the Regency''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 051.jpg|''The Consignment of the Regency''|thumb|left|''The Consignment of the Regency'']]
Throughout the depictions of Marie de' Medici's life, Rubens had to be careful not to offend either Marie or the king, [[Louis XIII]], when portraying controversial events. Marie commissioned paintings that truthfully followed the events of her life, and it was the job of Rubens to tactfully convey these images. More than once, the artistic license of the painter was curbed in order to portray Marie in the right light. In ''The Consignment of the Regency'',  Henry IV entrusts Marie with both the regency of France and the care of the dauphin shortly before his war campaigns and eventual death. Set within a grand Italian-style architectural setting, the theme is somewhat sobering. Prudence, the figure to the right of Marie, was stripped of her emblematic snake to lessen the chances any viewer would be reminded of Marie's rumored involvement in the King's assassination. The efficacy of the form is lost in order to ensure Marie's representation in a positive light. Other changes include the removal of the [[Moirai|Three Fates]], originally positioned behind the king calling him to his destiny, war, and death. Rubens was forced to remove these mythical figures and replace them with three generic soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Also worthy of note in this painting is the first appearance of the orb as a symbol of the "all-embracing rule or power of the state".&lt;ref&gt;Winner, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; This particular image appears to carry significant weight in Rubens's iconographic program for the cycle, as it appears in six (one quarter) of the twenty-four paintings of the cycle. This orb functions both as an allusion to the Roman ''orbis terrarum'' (sphere of earth) which signifies the domain and power of the Roman emperor, and as a subtle assertion of the claim of the French monarchy upon the imperial crown.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, pp. 70, 86&lt;/ref&gt; While Rubens was certainly aware of the inherent meaning of the orb and employed it to great effect, it appears that Marie and her counselors instigated its introduction into the cycle to add allegorical and political grandeur to the events surrounding Marie's regency.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, pp. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Coronation in Saint-Denis''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 049.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Coronation in Saint-Denis'']]
''The Coronation in Saint-Denis'' is the last scene on the North End of the West Wall, showing the completion of Marie's divinely assisted preparation.&lt;ref name="Smith, p 128"/&gt; It would be one of two paintings most visually apparent upon entrance into the gallery through the southeast corner. Rubens composes ''The Coronation in Saint-Denis'' for distanced viewing by employing accents of red. For example, the robes of two cardinals near the right edge. These accents also create a sense of unity with the neighboring work, ''Apotheosis of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency''.&lt;ref name="Coolidge, 69"/&gt;

This painting is a representation of an historical event in the life of the Queen where the King and the Queen were crowned at the [[basilica of Saint-Denis]] in [[Paris]]. Considered one of the principal paintings in the series along with the ''Apotheosis of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency'' both scenes also show Marie de’ Medici receiving the orb of state. She is conducted to the altar by the Cardinals Gondi and de Sourdis, who stand with her along with Mesieurs de Souvrt and de Bethune. The ceremony is officiated by Cardinal Joyeuse. The royal entourage includes the [[Louis XIII|Dauphin]], the [[François, Prince of Conti|Prince of Conti]] with the crown, the Duke of Ventadour with the scepter, and the Chevalier de Vendôme with the hand of Justice. The [[Louise Marguerite of Lorraine|Princess of Conti]] and the [[Henriette Catherine de Joyeuse|Duchess of Montpensier]] (mother of her future [[Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier|daughter in law]]) carry the train of the royal mantle. Above in the tribune appears Henry IV, as if to give sanction to the event. The crowd below in the basilica raise their hands in acclamation of the new Queen, and above, the classical personifications of [[Abundantia]] and a winged [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] shower the blessings of peace and prosperity upon the head of Marie by pouring the golden coins of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, her pet dogs are placed in the foreground of the painting.  Rubens inspiration for the blue coronation orb emblazoned with golden lilies was Guillaume Dupres’ presentation medal struck in 1610 at Marie's’ request portraying her as Minerva with Louis XIII as Apollo-Sol .&lt;ref name="ellenius71"&gt;Ellenius, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbolism carried the message that she was charged with the guidance of the young, soon-to-be king.&lt;ref name="ellenius71"/&gt;

===''The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 036.jpg|''The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency''|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency'']]
Sometimes also referred to as ''The Apotheosis of Henry IV'' and ''The Proclamation of the Regency'', this particular painting within the Medici Cycle as a whole, was placed originally by Rubens as a series of three.&lt;ref name="berger473"&gt;Berger, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt;  The other two having similar design measurements, it was consigned as the middle painting in a pseudo triptych of sorts as it adorned the halls of Marie de’ Medici's Palais du Luxembourg.

The painting is separated into two distinct, but related scenes: the elevation of  Henry IV to the heavens (his assassination on 14 May 1610 resulted in the immediate declaration of Marie as regent&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;) and the assumption of Marie to the crown.

On the left, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] are shown welcoming the assassinated King of France, as he ascends as a personified Roman sovereign, victoriously to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].&lt;ref name="Vlieghe, p. 49"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;   As with all of Ruben's allegorical paintings, these two figures are chosen for a reason. [[Jupiter]] is meant to be the King's celestial counterpart, while [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], who represents finite time, is an indication of the end of Henry's mortal existence.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; This particular theme, within the painting as a whole, has found other great masters receiving inspiration and fascination from Rubens' tormented figure of [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], the goddess of War, who lays disarmed below.  Post-Impressionist, [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) registered for permission to copy the goddess as many as ten times.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; It should be kept in mind that Rubens's energetic manner of placing all these allegorical themes is substantially resultant from classical coins as documented through communication with his friend and notable collector of antiquities, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.&lt;ref name="Vlieghe, p. 49"/&gt; The right side of the panel shows the succession of the new Queen, dressed in solemn clothing suited to a widow.  She is framed by a triumphal arch and surrounded by people at the court.
The Queen accepts an orb, a symbol of government, from the personification of France while the people kneel before her and this scene is a great example of the exaggeration of facts in the cycle.  Rubens stresses the idea of the Regency that was offered to the Queen, though she actually claimed it for herself the same day her husband was murdered.&lt;ref name="Thuillier, Jacques 1967"/&gt;

Worthy of note is a possible contemporary inspirational influence on Rubens for the right side of this painting.  Although originally started but may or may not have been finished in Rome, Caravaggio's ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'' may well have been an artistic influence on Rubens for the ''Proclamation of the Regency'' side of this painting, as the two works are highly corresponding in their presentation.  Through a causal nexus, this painting would have been available to Rubens and thereby plausible for its influence to exist within Rubens's own genius on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 475-476&lt;/ref&gt;
As a comparison, there are within each, two women upon a dais classical pillars, swathes of luxuriant cloth, genuflecting personages with arms extended, and allegorical figures present. In Rubens's painting, Minerva, Prudence, Divine Providence and France; in the Caravaggio, St Dominic, St Peter the Martyr, and a pair of Dominican monks.  Also present in each are ''objets importants'': rudder, globe, and rosaries.&lt;ref name="berger476"&gt;Berger, pp.476&lt;/ref&gt;  All these and more, combine to make a persuasive argument and show a certain artistically respectful nod from [[Rubens]] to [[Caravaggio]] as two contemporaries of the time.&lt;ref name="berger476"/&gt;

===''The Council of the Gods''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 042.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Council of the Gods'']] This painting commemorates Marie taking over the government as new regent, and promoting long-term plans for peace in Europe by way of marriages between royal houses.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, Wolf p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cupid]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] bind two doves together over a split sphere in the painting as a symbol of peace and love.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Marie hoped for her son, [[Louis XIII]], to marry the Spanish Infanta Anne and for her daughter Elizabeth to marry the future king of Spain, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], possibly resulting in an alliance between France and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p 80&lt;/ref&gt; To Marie de' Medici these unions were probably the most significant part of her reign, for peace in Europe was Marie's greatest goal.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Council of the Gods'' is one of the least understood paintings of ''Marie de' Medici cycle''. It represents the conduct of the Queen and the great care with which she oversees her Kingdom during her Regency.  For example, how she overcomes the rebellions and the disorders of the State. It also suggests that she perpetuated the policies and ideals of the late King in his life and in death.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The painting subjects are placed in a celestial setting which doesn't give way to a particular place, time or event. The scene is painted with a variety of mythological figures. This, along with its setting makes it difficult to figure out the subject matter of the work.  The mythological figures include [[Apollo]] and [[Pallas (Titan)|Pallas]], who combat and overcome vices such as Discord, Hate, Fury, and Envy on the ground and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], [[Hermes]], [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Flora]], [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], Pomono, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Cupid]], and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] above.&lt;ref&gt;Avermaete, Roger. ''Rubens and his times.''  Cranbury, New Jersey:  A.S. Barnes and Company, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mythological figures and celestial setting act as allegories for Marie's peaceful rule over France.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Regent Militant: The Victory at Jülich''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 043.jpg|thumb|left|''The Victory at Jülich''.]]
''The Victory at Jülich'' shows the only military event that the Queen participated in during her regency: the return of Jülich (or Juliers in French) to the Protestant princes.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 133"&gt;Saward, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Being a crossing of Ruhr, Juliers was of great strategic importance for France and thus the French victory was chosen to be the glorious subject of Rubens' painting.  The scene is rich with symbolism highlighting her heroism and victory.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 133"/&gt;  The Queen thrusts her arm high with an assembler's baton in hand.&lt;ref name="Millen and Wolf 155"&gt;Millen and Wolf 155&lt;/ref&gt; In the upper part of the image [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] appears crowning her with laurel leaves which is a symbol of victory. Also symbolizing victory is the imperial eagle which can be seen in the distance.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 133"/&gt; The eagle in the sky compels the weaker birds to flee.&lt;ref name="Millen and Wolf 155"/&gt; The Queen is accompanied by a womanly embodiment of what was once thought to be, Fortitude because of the lion beside her. However, the figure is Magnanimity, also referred to as Generosity, because of the riches held in her palm. One of the pieces in her hand is the Queen's treasured strand of pearls.&lt;ref name="Millen and Wolf 155"/&gt;     Other figures include Fame and the personification of Austria with her lion.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 133"/&gt; Fame in the right side of the painting pushes air through the trumpet so powerfully that a burst of smoke comes out.&lt;ref name="Millen and Wolf 155"/&gt; In the painting Marie de’ Medici is highly decorated and triumphant after the collapse of a city, she is depicted across a white stallion to demonstrate that, like the departed King  Henry IV, she could triumph over rivals in warfare.&lt;ref name="wedgwood116"&gt;Wedgwood, C.V., 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Exchange of the Princesses at the Spanish Border''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 037.jpg|"The Exchange of Princesses"|thumb|right|''The Exchange of Princesses'']]
''The Exchange of Princesses'' celebrates the double marriage of the [[Anne of Austria|Anna of Austria]] to [[Louis XIII of France]] and Louis XIII's sister, [[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Princess Elisabeth]], to future king of Spain, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] on 9 November 1615. France and Spain present the young princesses, aided by a youth who is probably Hymen. Above them, two [[putti]] brandish hymeneal torches, a small zephyr blows a warm breeze of spring and scatter roses, and a circle of joyous butterfly-winged putti surround Felicitas Publica with the caduceus, who showers the couple with gold from her cornucopia. Below, the river Andaye is filled with sea deities come to pay homage to the brides: the river-god Andaye rests on his urn, a nereid crowned with pearls offers a strand of pearls and coral as wedding gifts, while a triton blows the conch to herald the event.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp.137&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding, which was thought to secure peace between France and Spain, took place on a float midway across the Bidassoa River, along the French-Spanish border. In Ruben's depiction, the princesses stand with their right hands joined between personifications of France and Spain. Spain with a recognizable symbol of a lion on her helmet is on the left, whereas France, with fleur-de-lis decorating her drapery, is on the right.&lt;ref name="belkin186"&gt;Belkin, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Anna, at age fourteen the older of the two, turns back as if to take leave of Spain, while France gently pulls her by the left arm. In turn, Spain can be seen taking the thirteen-year-old Elisabeth by her left arm.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 186-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 040.jpg|''The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici''|thumb|left|''The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici'']]
This particular painting in the Marie de' Medici Cycle is noteworthy for its uniqueness in execution.  While the other paintings were completed at Rubens's studio in Antwerp, ''The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici'' was designed and painted entirely by Rubens on the spot to replace another, far more controversial depiction of Marie's 1617 expulsion from Paris by her son Louis. Completed in 1625, this is the final painting in the cycle in terms of chronological order of completion.&lt;ref name="belkin187"&gt;Belkin, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here Marie is shown in allegorical fashion as the personification of Justice itself and flanked by a retinue of some of the primary personifications/gods in the Greek and Roman pantheon. These have been identified as [[Cupid]], [[Minerva]], [[Prudence]], [[Abundantia|Abundance]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], and two figures of [[Pheme]], all indicated by their traditional attributes, all bestowing their bounties on the Queen. (Cupid has his arrow; Prudence carries a snake entwined around her arm to indicate serpent-like wisdom; Abundance also appears with her cornucopia, also a reference to the fruits of Marie's regency. Minerva, goddess of wisdom, bears her helmet and shield and stands near Marie's shoulder, signifying her wise rule. Saturn has his sickle and is personified as Time here guiding France forward. Fame carries a trumpet to herald the occasion.&lt;ref name="belkin189"&gt;Belkin, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;) These personifications are accompanied in turn by several allegorical figures in the guise of four putti and three vanquished evil creatures ([[Envy]], [[Ignorance]], and [[Vice]])&lt;ref name="belkin189"/&gt; as well as a number of other symbols that Rubens employed throughout the entire cycle of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this particular painting is one of the most straightforward in the series, there is still some minor dispute about its significance. Rather than accept this as a depiction of Marie as Justice, some hold that the real subject of the painting is the "return to earth of Astraea, the principle of divine justice, in a golden age."&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; They support this claim with a statement in Rubens's notes which indicates that "this theme holds no special reference to the particular reason of state of the French kingdom."&lt;ref name="winner86"&gt;Winner, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Certain symbolic elements, such as the wreath of oak leaves (a possible ''corona civica''), France being seen as a subjugated province, and the inclusion of Saturn in the scheme might all point to this interpretation and certainly would not have been lost on Rubens.&lt;ref name="winner86"/&gt; Fortunately, and perhaps solely due to the controversy surrounding this painting, Rubens mentioned its significance in a letter to Peiresc dated 13 May 1625.  It reads,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''I believe I wrote you that a picture was removed which depicted the Queen's departure from Paris and that, in its place, I did an entirely new one which shows the flowing of the Kingdom of France, with the revival of the sciences and the arts through the liberality and the splendour of Her Majesty, who sits upon a shining throne and holds a scale in her hands, keeping the world in equilibrium by her prudence and equity.''&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Considering the haste with which Rubens completed this painting, his lack of specific reference to a golden age in his letter, and the existence of several contemporary depictions of Marie as a figure of Justice, most historians are content with the simpler [[allegorical interpretation]] which is more consistent both with Rubens's style and the remainder of the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 166-7&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the original painting mentioned in the letter depicting Marie's departure from Paris was rejected in favor of ''The Felicity of the Regency'' due to the more innocuous subject matter of the latter.  Rubens, in the same letter, goes on to say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This subject, which does not touch on the particular political considerations ... of this reign, nor have reference to any individual, has been very well received, and I believe that had it been entrusted altogether to me the business of the other subjects would have turned out better, without any of the scandal or murmurings."&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, we can see evidence of the adaptability of Rubens' style which made his career so successful.  His willingness to fit his ideas with those of the patron equipped him with the perfect tools to be in charge of such a delicate and heavily anticipated subject.

===''Louis XIII Comes of Age''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 047.jpg|''Louis XIII Comes of Age''|thumb|right|''Louis XIII Comes of Age'']]
The painting ''Louis XIII Comes of Age'' represents the historical scene of the transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means.&lt;ref name="Millen"&gt;Millen p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that hang on the side of the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with what seems to be a trumpet.&lt;ref name="Millen" /&gt; Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying [[force (law)|Force]], [[Religion]], [[Justice]], and [[Concordia (mythology)|Concord]]. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.
The pairing of Marie with the figure of Force gives power to the image of the queen, while Marie's actual pose is more passive, showing very effectively her graceful acknowledgement of her son's authority henceforth.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen pp.490-491&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an interesting painting to examine within the context of the tense relationship between the young king and his mother.  Marie had clung to power past the end of her regency, until Louis seized power in 1617 and exiled her to Blois.  Rubens obviously would have known this and so chose to ignore the tension surrounding Marie's relationship with her son, instead emphasizing her poise in the transfer of power.

===''The Flight from Blois''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 041.jpg|''The Flight from Blois''|thumb|left|''The Flight from Blois'']]
The Flight from Blois is a depiction of Queen Marie escaping from confinement at Blois.  The Queen stands in a dignified manner, suggesting her poise in times of disarray, amongst a chaotic crowd of handmaidens and soldiers.  She is led and protected by a representation of France, and guided by illustrations of [[Night (mythology)|Night]] and [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]]. They are used literally to portray the actual time of the event and shield the queen from spectators as they illuminate her path.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Rubens painted a scene of the event in a more heroic nature rather than showing the accuracy of realistic elements. According to historical records of the Queen's escape, this painting is not truthfully reflecting the moment of the occurrence. Rubens did not include many of the negative aspects of the event, fearing that he would offend the Queen, which resulted in the paintings non-realistic nature.  The Queen Marie is depicted in a humble way, yet the illustration implies her power over the military.  She does not express any hardships she had gone through by the escape.  The male figures in foreground reaching for her are unknown.  The larger figures in the background represent the military, who were added to have a symbolic meaning of the Queen's belief in the command over military.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 178-181&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Negotiations at Angoulême''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 055.jpg|thumb|left|''The Negotiations at Angoulême'']]
In ''The Negotiations at Angoulême'', Marie de' Medici genially takes the olive branch from Mercury, the messenger god, in the presence of both of her priests, as she gives her consent to have discussions with her son concerning her clash to his governmental direction.&lt;ref name="wedgwood116"/&gt;  Rubens uses several methods to portray Queen Marie in precisely the light that she wanted to be seen, as her young son's guardian and wise advisor.  Enthroned on a pedestal with sculptures of Minerva's symbols of wisdom and two putti holding a laurel wreath to represent victory and martyrdom, the representation of Marie de’ Medici is quite clear.  Her humble, yet all-knowing gaze conveys the wisdom that she holds.  She is also placed compositionally in a tight and unified group with the cardinals, signifying a truthful side opposed to Mercury's dishonesty.  Rubens gave Mercury an impression untruthfulness by illustrating his figure hiding a caduceus behind his thigh.  The effect of the two groups of figures is meant to stress the gap between the two sides.  Rubens also added a barking dog, a common reference used to indicate or warn someone of foreigners who came with evil intention.  All of these symbols, Rubens displayed in this ambiguous and enigmatic painting to represent or "misrepresent" Marie de’ Medici in the manner that portrayed her as the prudent, yet caring and humble mother of a young and naïve monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 182-193&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, this painting is the most problematic or controversial, as well as the least understood out of the entire cycle. This image is of, once again, Marie claiming her of regal authority yet was nonetheless the first step towards peace between mother and son.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Queen Opts for Security''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 044.jpg|''The Queen Opts for Security''|thumb|right|''The Queen Opts for Security'']]
Rubens's ''The Queen Opts for Security'' represents Marie de' Medici's need for security through a depiction of the event when Marie de' Medici was forced to sign a truce in Angers after her forces had been defeated at Ponte-de-Ce. Though the painting shows Marie de' Medici's desire for security with the representation of the Temple of Security, the symbols of evil at bay, and the change of smoky haze to clarity, there is also underlying symbolism of unrest to the acceptance of the truce. The round shape of the temple, like those built by the ancients to represent the world, and has an Ionic order that is associated with Juno and Maria herself. The temple defines itself, by also including a plaque above the niche that says "Securitati Augustae" or For the Security of the empress.&lt;ref name="Millen, p. 197"&gt;Millen, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; She is shown with the snakes of the caduceus emblem having uneasy movement and the forced escorting of the queen by Mercury into the Temple of Peace give the feeling of a strong will not to be defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be debated that the painting is not really about peace or security, but really an unrelenting spirit that does not give into loss.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; As she is a divine power, she is heroically depicted in a classical setting using neoplatonic hierarchy and visual cues of light on her face.  These ultimately imply that this allegory of Marie de' Medici is an apotheosis.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the inclusion of two differently adorned personifications of Peace hints at the fact that Rubens wanted to confuse or excite the viewer to look deeper into this particular painting as a whole.&lt;ref name="Millen, p. 197"/&gt;

===''Reconciliation of the Queen and her Son''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 053.jpg|''Reconciliation of the Queen and her son''|thumb|left|''Reconciliation of the Queen and her son'']]
''The Return of the Mother to Her Son'' tenuously held an alternate title ''The Full Reconciliation with the Son after the Death of the High Constable'' until the temperament of the nation was assessed. The many headed hydra struck a fatal blow by [[Divine law|Divine Justice]] as witnessed by [[Divine Providence]], a theme based on a classical seventeenth century metaphor for insurrection. Here the monster is a stand in for the dead [[Louis XIII of France#Ascendancy of Charles de Luynes, 1617-21|Constable de Luynes]] who has met its demise at the hand of a feminine Saint Michael.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The death in 1621 of the falconer turned supreme commander may have improved the tensions between mother and son, but Conde, considered the most dangerous of Marie de’ Medici's foes quickly stepped in to fill the gap. Rubens’ deliberate vagueness would be consistent with his practice of generalizing and allegorizing historical facts especially in a painting about peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;  Marie, desiring vindication for the death of her close personal friend, [[Concino Concini]], would likely have intended a more direct personal allusion to Constable de Luynes, but Rubens preferring to keep to allegory, avoided specifics that could later prove embarrassing.&lt;ref name="mcgrath14"&gt;McGrath, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The artist chose the high road, relying on Ripa's visual vernacular, to portray a scene where virtues defeat vices and embrace peaceful reconciliation making little more than an allusion to a vague political statement.&lt;ref name="mcgrath14"/&gt;

It is not hard to imagine the much-maligned scapegoat Luyens as the one suffering divine punishment and being thrown into the pits of hell while assuming all the blame for the animosity between Louis XIII and his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;  In this painting, Louis XIII, represented as an adult, is depicted as Apollo. The hydra's death is not at the hand of Apollo as might be expected. Instead it is left to an Amazon-like vision of Providence/Fate.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  With the removal of the scales she carried in an earlier sketch that would have connected her to Louis XII, we are left with an entity who with no help from Louis, slays the adversary as he appears oblivious and unconcerned.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  Marie de’ Medici however, emerges as a loving mother, ready to forgive all evils and pain endured.

===''The Triumph of Truth''===
[[File:Rubens medici cycle triump of truth.jpg|thumb|right|''The Triumph of Truth]]
The last painting in the cycle, ''The Triumph of Truth'', is a purely allegorical depiction of King [[Louis XIII]] and his mother, the Queen, reconciling before heaven.&lt;ref name="thuillier"&gt;Saward, Susan. "The Golden Age of Marie de' Medici". Ann Arbor. UMI Research Press. 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen and [[Louis XIII]] are depicted floating in heaven, connected by the symbol of [[Concordia (mythology)|''concordia'']], which demonstrates her sons’ forgiveness and the peace that was reached between them.  Below, [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] raises [[Veritas]] to heaven which symbolizes truth being, "brought to the light", as well as the reconciliation between the Queen and her son.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations of Time and Truth occupy almost 3/4 of the lower canvas. The upper part of the canvas is filled with renderings of Marie and her son. In the composition, Marie is depicted as much larger than her son and occupies much more space.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Her larger, less obscured body is turned frontally on the picture plane, which emphasizes her importance. Her importance is further highlighted by her equal height to her son, the King.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Her son who is obscured in part by the Wing of Time, kneels before the queen and presents her with the token of amity, the clasped hands and flaming heart within a laurel crown.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Compositionally, Rubens gives the queen greater importance in this panel through the use of gestures and gazes. In the work, Truth gestures toward the Queen while Time looks toward her from below. Both figures ignore the King.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf&lt;/ref&gt; Rubens artfully projected both mother and son into the future, depicting them as more aged and mature than in the preceding panel (Peace is Confirmed in Heaven).&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf pp.220-221. "Heroic Deeds and Mystic Figures". Princeton. Princeton University Press. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this point that the Medici Cycle changes to the subject of the Queen Mother's reign.&lt;ref name="belkin186"/&gt; With the death of son Louis' court favorite, Charles d'Albert de Luynes, mother and son reconcile.  Marie receives ultimate vindication by being re-admitted to the Council of State in January 1622.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  This picture represents how time thus uncovers the truth in correspondence to the relationship between Marie and her son.&lt;ref name="thuillier"/&gt;

The final painting coincided with Marie's interest in politics after the death of her husband. She believed that diplomacy should be obtained through marriage and it is the marriage of her daughter [[Henrietta Maria]] to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] that rushed the completion of the Medici Cycle.&lt;ref name="belkin186"/&gt;

===''The Portraits of The Queen's Parents''===
The remaining three paintings are portraits of Marie de' Medici, her father Francesco I and her mother [[Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Johanna of Austria]]. On either side of the fireplace in the gallery are the portraits of the Queen's parents. The portrait of the Queen's father, Francesco I, is on the right and faces the passageway towards Marie de' Medici's private chambers. Francesco I is depicted wearing an ermine-lined mantle with a cross around his neck which represents the Tuscan order of Saint Stephen which his father founded. The portrait of the Queen's mother, [[Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Johanna of Austria]], is on the left at the place where visitors enter. She is shown wearing a gown of silver cloth with gold embroidery and wears nothing that suggests her esteemed background. The model, or overall design, for this portrait of Johanna of Austria goes back to a painting by Alessandro Allori that was then copied by Giovanni Bizzelli. Rubens must have seen these paintings and therefore influenced his own style for depicting the Queen's mother. Although, surprisingly, Ruben's version is considered even less remarkable than the models. This portrait of Johanna of Austria is overall an inexpressive image of a woman. He excluded the traditional 16th Century hieratic poise for a relaxed interpretation, where she wears regularized drapery and Rubens adorns her in that of the state of always being sick and weak. In contrast, no model for the portrait of the Queen's father is known, although it is questioned if he used ideas from one from Paris that, in which he wanted to convey the authoritative appearance of historical figures. Specifically, the statues of Fracesco and Ferdinando de Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, pp.24-25&lt;/ref&gt; The two portraits are stylistically very different, and even out of place, from the rest of the paintings in the gallery. These paintings of her parents in Marie de' Medici's reception hall look bleak in comparison to the portrait of Marie, where she is looking beautiful if not vain.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rubens made great use of allegorical images throughout most of the paintings in the gallery, the two portraits of the Queen's parents are compositionally straightforward and unremarkably executed. Moreover, they are considered to be far from "likenesses" of either sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, pp.23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry IV Cycle==
The original commission for the Marie de' Medici cycle included a corresponding gallery illustrating the life of Henry IV that was never completed, although Rubens began work soon after he completed the Marie de' Medici cycle.  The Henry cycle called for twenty-four monumental scenes of Henry's life depicting "the encounters he was engaged in, his combats, conquests, and sieges of towns with the Triumphs of said victories."&lt;ref name="Held, p. 123"&gt;Held, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Marie and Henry's separate wings were designed to meet in an arcade that would unite the two galleries. The paintings of each gallery would have been exhibited as an integrated pair, unifying all forty-eight scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that Rubens did not make any sketches for the Henry IV cycle while he was engaged with the first gallery. In one of his letters the artist describes the theme as "so large and magnificent that it would suffice for ten galleries". Judging by another statement of his on January 27, 1628, he did not engage much in sketching  before that date.&lt;ref&gt;Held, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Of the oil sketches executed later by him, only nine survive, along with five large unfinished canvasses. Most of the sketches represent actual battles in which Henry was involved,&lt;ref name="Sutton and Weiseman, p. 194"&gt;Sutton and Weiseman, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''The Capture of Paris.''

It is important to note that the reasons for not completing the Henry IV cycle had to do with the current political events of the time. [[Marie de' Medici]] was banished from Paris in 1631 as [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]] gained power over [[Louis XIII]].&lt;ref name="belkin192"&gt;Belkin, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the project was abandoned completely due to approval of the plans for the gallery being repeatedly delayed by the French court.&lt;ref name="Sutton and Weiseman, p. 194"/&gt; Richelieu, who now had full control of the cycle, refused to speak to Rubens about completing the Henry Gallery based on the falsehood that he was tending to affairs of the state.&lt;ref name="belkin192"/&gt; Richelieu's true motivations were most likely political. During this time, Rubens was in Madrid preparing for a diplomatic mission to London, working towards the rapprochement of Spain and England. The commissioned artist being active in an opposing political parties was cause for Richelieu to object.&lt;ref name="Held, p. 123"/&gt; He was thus actively seeking for an Italian artist to replace Rubens, which resulted in Rubens only sporadically continuing his work. After Marie's banishment in 1631, the project was to be completely abandoned,&lt;ref name="belkin192"/&gt; which seems a travesty seeing as Rubens was very optimistic about the project and its effects on his career; "I have now begun the designs of the other gallery which, in my judgment, because of the nature of the subject will prove to be more splendid than the first so that I hope I shall rather gain [in reputation] than decline."&lt;ref name="Held, p. 123"/&gt;
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - The Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre.JPG|''''|thumb|right|''The Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre'']]

An important sketch from the collection is the so-called ''Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre'' – a significant event for Henry IV's ascent to the throne. After the death of the duke of Anjou, brother of the childless King Henry III, the apparent heir was to be  Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV). However, when a [[papal bull]] denied him the throne and excommunicated him, Henry of Navarre protested, starting the [[War of the Three Henrys]]. When Henry III was also ostracized from Paris for initiating the murder of the duke of Guise, he met with Henry of Navarre to make peace and recognize him as rightful heir. Although Rubens depicted this reconciliation as taking place in a throne room, contemporary reports recorded that it was actually in a garden full of spectators. The sketch shows Henry of Navarre bowing down in Henry III's presence, which eyewitness accounts confirm was accurate. Rubens represented a putto taking the crown of Henry III, with the intention of placing it on the willing future Henry IV, although the actual transfer of power didn't occur until Henry III's assassination several months later (August 1, 1589). A page stands behind Henry of Navarre holding his personal badge: a white plumed helmet, while the dog at his feet represents fidelity. The two ominous figures behind Henry III most likely represent personifications of Fraud and Discord.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton and Wieseman, pp. 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

The Henry IV cycle was planned to be composed of scenes from the king's military career.  The violence of these images would contrast nicely with the relative peace and regal quality of the scenes in the Marie de' Medici cycle.&lt;ref name="Smith, p. 131"&gt;Smith, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Battle of Ivry'' on the East Wall of the gallery is a scene of Henry's most decisive battle to unify the city of Paris. Primarily gray, the sketch shows the king in crimson velvet to stand out in "the most famous of all the battles of Henry IV." He is shown in the center of the scene raising a flaming sword. His victorious army rushes in chaotically behind him; horses rearing and riders falling.&lt;ref&gt;Held, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; This painting corresponds to the ''Coronation'' painting in the Marie de' Medici cycle.&lt;ref name="Smith, p. 131"/&gt;

''The Triumphal Entry into Paris'' is the culminating point of the North End of the gallery. Being the king's last major battle fought, this served as an optimal location. Rubens wanted it to be at the end of the gallery as a "large and important" piece with an advanced state of execution.&lt;ref&gt;Held, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The painting shows Henry parading into Paris as a victorious Roman emperor holding an olive branch, the symbol of peace. However, because Henry never actually entered Paris in this fashion, the scene is supposed to represent only a symbolic triumph. Henry's action and setting (the buildings and a triumphal arch) were not really possible in Paris at this time, reassuring that the scene is not based on historical fact, but a classical metaphor and Henry's goal of remaining King of France.&lt;ref&gt;Held, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; This painting coincides with ''Apotheosis and Ascendancy'' in the Marie cycle.&lt;ref name="Smith, p. 132"&gt;Smith, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Clemency of Henry in Paris'' corresponds to the Olympian peace scene in the Marie cycle, with Henry's peace as earthly and Marie's as celestial.  Henry's painting, beginning the West Wall of the gallery, depicts the scenes following the capture of Paris.  Henry's army casts the rebels out of Paris by throwing them over a bridge into the river below.  In the left corner, however, the new ruler himself discusses clemency with a few advisers.&lt;ref name="Smith, p. 132"/&gt;

'''''Mr. X''''' is a 2015 Indian [[3D film|3D]] [[science fiction film|sci-fi]] [[vigilante film]] directed by [[Vikram Bhatt]], written by [[Shagufta Rafique]], and produced by [[Mukesh Bhatt]]. The film stars [[Emraan Hashmi]] and [[Amyra Dastur]]. The film revolves around a man who gains the power of invisibility, and becomes a [[vigilante]] to take revenge on those who have wronged him. The film released in both 2D and 3D on 17 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Mr-X-Trailer-Emraan-Hashmi-impresses-in-invisible-avatar/articleshow/46466235.cms|title=Mr X Trailer: Emraan Hashmi impresses in invisible avatar|newspaper=The Times of India|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film begins with the Anti Terrorist Department in the middle of an assignment. A terrorist takes a bus full of people on hostage. Raghuram "Raghu" Rathod ([[Emraan Hashmi]]) supported by the brave officer Siya Verma ([[Amyra Dastur]]) accomplish the operation. This could have almost killed Raghu who is engaged to Siya. After the operation Siya tells Raghu she cannot handle life's unpredictability and the thought of being away from him. He asks his hand in marriage and the two are betrothed. On the day before their marriage, the two are summoned by ACP Bhardwaaj ([[Arunoday Singh]]). There is a plot to kill the chief minister of the state and both are put to duty. Bhardwaaj hatches a plot such that Raghu is compelled to murder the CM. If he doesn't kill the CM, then a sniper will murder Siya who is on duty at another location. Left with no choice, Raghu murders the CM upon a confrontation from the latter's son Aditya. He tries to flee but gets cornered by Bhardwaaj and his man Tiwari. The three take Raghu to a run down factory and almost kill him there.

However, as luck would have it, Raghu doesn't die but is charred completely. He reaches out to Popo ([[Tanmay Bhat]]), his friend from office whose sister works at a lab. When there, his sisters explain to them that there is a severe case of radiation and there is no cure for it. There is an untested potion which he swallows but this causes a complete cell regeneration from the scratch which causes him to become invisible in all lights except black light and direct sun light.

Meanwhile, Siya begins believing that Raghu killed the CM and starts hating him. She plunges into more and more work to avoid feeling the pain of heartbreak. When Raghu regains his composure, he wants to kill those who landed him into a situation like that. The first on his target is Tiwari. After a drunken night when Tiwari is driving home, Raghu finds him and says that he will kill him in 24 hours. A very panicky Tiwari narrates this to his colleagues who don't take him seriously. Siya tries to protect him but fails when the invisible Raghu kills him. But Siya discovers Raghu. She tries to tap him via Popo but cannot as Raghu escapes from Siya's arrest.

Meanwhile, Raghu's next target is Aditya whose security is entrusted on Siya. Raghu after a long battle with Siya manages to kill him as well. But Siya is not willing to back down. When senior authorities give the responsibility of shooting down Mr. X in an encounter she backs out from it. Raghu gets drawn towards her love and the two spend a few special days with each other. The duo go for lunch to a quiet place and Raghu notices that the place is empty. Before he knows it, the place is attacked by the police and Raghu is arrested.

Raghu is taken to a dilapidated place by Bhardwaj who wants to make sure Raghu is dead this time. Meanwhile, Popo who attempts a suicide after being attacked by Bhardwaj who wanted to get more information on Raghu, tells Siya that Bhardwaj had hatched a plan to kill Raghu. Siya goes to the place where Raghu and Bhardwaj engage in a duel. Siya urges Raghu to let Bhardwaj free. She later tricks Bhardwaj into a nerving confession recorded on camera by her father Devraj ([[Bikramjeet Kanwarpal]]) and exposes him at a press conference. When Bhardwaj tries to kill Siya, Raghu kills him.

The movie concludes with Siya (presumably, having accepted Raghu with his condition) kissing her under a shower.

[[Image:Ctrl_alt_del_logo.jpg|right|250px]]
Project '''[[Project ctrl alt del|ctrl_alt_del]]''' was the first [[sound art]] festival realized in Turkey, in September 2003. It was a collaboration between NOMAD, Marres, Hedah, and [[Istanbul Technical University]] Center for Advanced Musical Studies (MIAM). All through the month of September 2003, several events were realized in two cities, [[Istanbul]] and [[Maastricht]]: (i) an introductory presentation, a CD launch, performances by two artists from the Netherlands and Turkey in Marres (Maastricht); (ii) a panel and workshop series at Istanbul Technical University, Faculty of Architecture and MIAM; (iii) a series of performances in Babylon, Istanbul during the opening of the 8th International [[Istanbul Biennial]]; (iv) a panel, and performance series at Marres; (v) an exhibition at Marres; (vi) an audio CD which was distributed in Europe through Lowlands, and the international distribution of  the CD-ROM was carried out by NOMAD. ctrl_alt_del aimed at introducing Turkey to sound-art via sound-art’s pioneering names, together with panels and workshops. More than 30 people from 16 different countries contributed to the project in 2003.

In 2005, ctrl_alt_del took place in the “positionings” section of the 9th International Istanbul Biennial. The project launched on September 16, 2005 with an opening night performance at Balans Music hall, then continued on the [[Bosphorus]], the [[Golden Horn]], Istanbul Technical University’s MIAM studios, laboratories, library and concert hall till September 22. The 2005 programme for the ctrl_alt_del project has been developed by Basak Senova, Emre Erkal, Erhan Muratoglu, Pieter Snapper, and Paul Devens. Can Karadogan was responsible for the logistics of ITU activities as the project coordinator and Nusin Odelli was in charge of editing of the printed material. 57 people from 12 countries participated in the project.

In 2007, ctrl_alt_del will be realized by NOMAD in coorporation with Istanbul Technical University – MIAM. This year, ctrl_alt_del will include Opening Concert, Performance Series (live), Workshops, Panels, Presentations, Open Call, Field Studies/Workshops, Exhibition, Radio Programmes, Publication and CD release. The theme of ctrl_alt_del 2007 will be “remote [[orienteering]]”. The theme is not only connected to the navigational systems but it is also about positioning oneself within interconnected social and political realities. The theme will also be processed with the issues of control. It will take place parallel to the 10th International Istanbul Biennial in September. The development team consist of Paul Devens (NL), Can Karadogan (TR), Basak Senova (TR), Eran Sachs (DE/IL), Erhan Muratoglu (TR), and Emre Erkal (TR).

'''''Nineteen Eighty-Four''''', also known as '''''1984''''', is a 1984 British [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[Science fiction|science fiction film]] written and directed by [[Michael Radford]], based upon [[George Orwell]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|novel of the same name]]. Starring [[John Hurt]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Suzanna Hamilton]], and [[Cyril Cusack]], the film follows the life of [[Winston Smith]], a low-ranking [[Civil service|civil servant]] in a post-disaster [[London]] ruled by [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]], a [[totalitarian]] superstate. Smith (Hurt) struggles to maintain his sanity and his grip on reality as the regime's overwhelming power and influence persecutes [[individualism]] and individual thinking on both a political and personal level.

The film, which features Burton's last screen appearance, is dedicated to him.&lt;ref name="tcmnotes"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/21950/1984/misc-notes.html | title= MISCELLANEOUS NOTES | publisher= Turner Classic Movies | accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Art Direction]], and won two [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]] for Best Film and Best Actor.

==Plot==
In a dystopian 1984, [[Winston Smith]] endures a squalid existence in the [[totalitarian]] superstate of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] under the constant surveillance of the [[Thought Police]]. The story takes place in [[London]], the capital city of the territory of [[Airstrip One]] (formerly "either England or Britain"). 

Winston works in a small office cubicle at the [[Ministry of Truth]], rewriting history in accordance with the dictates of [[Ingsoc|the Party]] and its supreme leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]. A man haunted by painful memories and restless desires, Winston keeps a secret diary of his private thoughts, thus creating evidence of his ''[[thoughtcrime]]''.

His life takes a major turn when he is accosted by a fellow [[Outer Party]] worker — a mysterious, bold-looking girl named [[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]] — and they begin an illicit affair. Their first meeting takes place in the remote countryside where they exchange subversive ideas before having sex. Shortly after, Winston rents a room above a [[pawn shop]] (in the less restrictive proletarian area) where they continue their liaison. Julia — a sensual, free-spirited young woman — procures contraband food and clothing on the black market, and for a brief few months they secretly meet and enjoy an idyllic life of relative freedom and contentment together.  

It comes to an end one evening, with the sudden raid of the Thought Police. They are both arrested and it's revealed that there is a [[telescreen]] hidden behind a picture on the wall in their room, and that the charmingly old-fashioned and seemingly sensitive proprietor of the pawn shop, Mr. Charrington, is a covert agent of the Thought Police. Winston and Julia are taken away to the [[Ministry of Love]] to be detained, questioned and "rehabilitated" separately. There  [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], a high-ranking member of the [[Inner Party]] whom Winston had previously believed to be a fellow thought criminal and agent of the resistance movement led by the archenemy of the Party, [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], systematically tortures him.

O'Brien instructs Winston about the state's true purpose and schools him in a kind of [[catechism]] on the principles of ''[[doublethink]]'' — the practice of holding two contradictory thoughts in the mind simultaneously. For his final rehabilitation, Winston is brought to [[Room 101]], where O'Brien tells him he will be subjected to the "worst thing in the world", designed specifically around Smith's personal phobias. When confronted with this unbearable horror — which turns out to be a cage filled with wild rats — Winston's psychological resistance finally and irretrievably breaks down, and he hysterically repudiates his allegiance to Julia. Now completely subjugated and purged of any rebellious thoughts, impulses, or personal attachments, Winston is restored to physical health and released.

In the final scene, Winston returns to the Chestnut Tree Café, where he had previously seen the rehabilitated thought criminals Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford (themselves once prominent but later disgraced members of the Inner Party) who have since been "vaporized" and rendered [[List of Newspeak words#Unperson|''unpersons'']]. While sitting at the chess table, Winston is approached by Julia, who was similarly "rehabilitated". They share a bottle of Victory Gin and impassively exchange a few words about how they have betrayed each other. They act indifferently towards each other. After she leaves, Winston watches a broadcast of himself on the large telescreen confessing his "crimes" against the state and imploring forgiveness from the populace.

Upon hearing a news report declaring the Oceanian army's utter rout of the enemy ([[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]])'s forces in North Africa, Winston looks at the still image of Big Brother that appears on the telescreen, then turns away and has tears in his eyes.

==Production==
In winter 1983, the director [[Michael Radford]] asked his producer to try for the rights to Orwell's novel, with low expectations that they were available.  It turned out that the rights were held by Marvin Rosenblum, a Chicago lawyer who had been trying on his own to get such a film produced.&lt;ref name="DenGeek"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/13281/the-den-of-geek-interview-michael-radford |title= The Den of Geek interview: Michael Radford | date= 8 April 2008 |publisher= [[Den of Geek]] | first= Simon|last= Brew| accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblum agreed to become an executive producer, and while producer Simon Perry raised the production money from [[Richard Branson]], Radford wrote the script, inspired by his idea to make a "science fiction film made in 1948."&lt;ref name="DenGeek"/&gt;  The script was finished in three weeks.&lt;ref name="DenGeek"/&gt;

For the role of [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], [[Paul Scofield]] was originally contracted to play the part, but had to withdraw after sustaining a broken leg while filming ''[[The Shooting Party]]''.&lt;ref name="DenGeek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4313352.stm| title= Obituary: Paul Scofield| date= 20 March 2008| publisher= [[BBC News]]| quote= He was to have been in ''The Shooting Party'' in 1983, but broke a leg and a couple of ribs in an accident on the first day of filming...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Sean Connery]] and [[Rod Steiger]] were all then considered.&lt;ref name="DenGeek"/&gt; Richard Burton, who was living in Haiti, joined the production six weeks into its shooting schedule&lt;ref name="DenGeek"/&gt; and insisted on his costume of a [[boiler suit]] being hand-made for him in [[Savile Row]].&lt;ref&gt;'In Conversation with Michael Radford', ''[[Sky Arts]]'' 2013-10-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=11308&amp;s=Interviews Andrew L Urban, "CLARK, AL – NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR", ''Urban Cinefile'', 22 Dec 2005] accessed 11 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Some internet sources claim that [[principal photography]] began on 19 March 1984 and ended in October 1984.&lt;ref name="tcmnotes"/&gt; However the film was released that same month, and a title card at the end of the film explicitly states, it "was photographed in and around London during the period April-June 1984, the exact time and setting imagined by the author."&lt;ref&gt;http://insidestory.org.au/nineteen-eighty-four-turns-sixty/&lt;/ref&gt; The budget was originally £2.5 million but this rose during filming and additional funds were required.&lt;ref&gt;Park, James. "Orwell that ends well." London: ''The Sunday Times'' 7 October 1984: 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radford and [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] [[Roger Deakins]] originally wanted to shoot the film in black and white, but the financial backers of the production, [[Virgin Films]], opposed this idea. Instead, Deakins used a film [[film processing|processing technique]] called [[bleach bypass]] (originally created by Technicolor and Deluxe, but recreated for this production by Key) to create the distinctive washed-out look of the film's colour visuals. The film is a very rare example of the technique being applied to every release print, rather than the [[interpositive]], that was struck from the [[original camera negative]], or the internegative (struck from the interpositive); as the silver is retained in the print and cannot be reclaimed by the lab, the cost is higher, but the retained silver gives a "depth" to the projected image.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

===Filming===
The opening scenes of the film showing the [[Two Minutes Hate]] were filmed in a grass-covered hangar at [[RAF Hullavington]] near [[Chippenham]] in [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://swindondiary.com/?m=8&amp;s=121&amp;ss=1154&amp;c=5590&amp;t=Nineteen+Eighty-Four Swindon Connection | Nineteen Eighty-Four 1984 starring Richard Burton | SwindonWeb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scenes set in Victory Square were also filmed at [[Alexandra Palace]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pirani |first=Adam |title=Welcome to 1984 |publisher=[[Starlog]] |page=78 |date=November 1984 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Senate House (University of London)]] was used for exterior shots of the [[Ministry of Truth]].

The disused [[Battersea Power Station]] in [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]] served as the façade for the Victory Mansions; and the [[Beckton Gas Works]] in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] of [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]] was used as the setting for the proletarian zones. The pawnshop exterior, a pub scene and a scene with a prostitute were filmed in [[Cheshire Street]], in London's East End, an area Orwell had visited and commented on in his first book, ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]''. The canteen interiors were filmed in a disused grain mill at Silvertown.

In contrast, the idyllic, dreamlike "Golden Country", where Winston and Julia repair for their first tryst and which recurs in Winston's fantasies, was filmed in the southwest county of [[Wiltshire]] at a natural circle of hills called "The Roundway", near the town of [[Devizes]]. The scenes on the train were shot on the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]].

The film shared a number of locations  with [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', which was filmed the same year.&lt;ref name="DenGeek"/&gt;  An epigraph in the closing credits claims that the ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was shot during the very months and in the very locales when and where Orwell's novel was set.

==Reception==
Upon its U.S. premiere, [[Vincent Canby]] said the film was "admirable, bleakly beautiful", though "not an easy film to watch".&lt;ref name="canby"&gt;{{cite web| title= The Screen: John Hurt in ''1984'', Adaptation of Orwell Novel | url= https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DEEDD143BF93BA25752C0A963948260 | first= Vincent |last=Canby| authorlink= Vincent Canby| date= 18 January 1985| publisher= The New York Times| accessdate= 2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film 3.5/4 stars, writing that it "penetrates much more deeply into the novel's heart of darkness" than previous adaptations, and describing Hurt as "the perfect Winston Smith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/1984-1984| title= 1984 (1984)| first= Roger|last= Ebert| authorlink= Roger Ebert|publisher= rogerebert.com| date= 1 February 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an 80% "fresh" rating, based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1984_1984/ |title=1984 (Nineteen Eighty-Four) (1984) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Score controversy==
{{refimprovesect|date=February 2017}}
Virgin Films (formerly part of the [[Virgin Group]]), who financed the film, commissioned the British rock/pop duo [[Eurythmics]] to produce the music for the soundtrack. Radford objected to Virgin's insistence on using the more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented [[Electronic music|electronic]] Eurythmics music, as the traditional [[orchestral]] [[film score|score]] originally intended for the film had been composed entirely by [[Dominic Muldowney]] a few months earlier.

Against Radford's wishes, Virgin exercised their right of final cut and replaced Muldowney's musical [[Cue (theatrical)|cues]] with the new Eurythmics contributions. One Eurythmics song, "[[Julia (Eurythmics song)|Julia]]", was also heard in its entirety during the film's closing credits. However, Muldowney's main theme music (particularly the state anthem, "Oceania, 'tis for thee") was still prominently featured in the film. In November 1984, Virgin Records released the Eurythmics soundtrack album, featuring considerably altered versions of their music heard in the film, under the title ''[[1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)]]''. Despite the controversy, the album reached number 23 on the UK Album Chart, and was later certified Gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.&lt;ref name="BPI"&gt;[http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx British Phonographic Industry online database]&lt;/ref&gt; A song from the album, "[[Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four) (Eurythmics song)|Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four)]]", was released as a single just prior to the album and became one of Eurythmics' biggest hits, peaking at number 4 and was awarded a Silver disc for sales in excess of 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="BPI"/&gt; The music video for the single featured clips from the film. The track "Julia" was also released as a single which peaked just outside the Top 40.

During his acceptance speech at the [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]], Radford openly expressed his displeasure with Virgin's decision and claimed that the Eurythmics music had been "foisted" on his film. Radford had disowned Virgin's edit of the film featuring the mixed Eurythmics/Muldowney score, yet when ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' made its theatrical debut on 10 October in [[London]] and on 14 December in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803/|title=1984|date=22 March 1985|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was the version released in wide circulation. Michael Radford withdrew the film from consideration at the [[BAFTA|BAFTA awards]] in protest of Virgin's decision to change the musical score. Eurythmics responded with a statement of their own claiming no knowledge of prior agreements between Virgin and Radford/Muldowney and that they had accepted the offer to compose music for the film in good faith.

In 1999, Muldowney's complete orchestral score (24 tracks in total) was released on a special limited edition [[CD]] album under the title ''Nineteen Eighty-Four: The Music of Oceania'', to commemorate the film's 15th anniversary. The CD booklet featured previously unseen production photographs and artwork as well as liner notes by Radford. 

On the subsequent [[MGM]] [[DVD]] release in [[North America]] in 2003, the film's colour is restored to a normal level of saturation and the Eurythmics contributions to the score were removed entirely and replaced with Muldowney's musical cues as Radford had originally intended—although both Eurythmics and Muldowney are still jointly credited in the opening and closing titles. This DVD release was quickly discontinued and currently remains out of print. This version had previously been shown by [[Channel 4]] in the UK in the late-1980s. However, the MGM DVD release of the film in the [[UK]] in 2004 features the mixed Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtrack on the [[English language|English-]] and [[French-language]] audio tracks as well as the original desaturated visuals.

In 2013 the film was re-released on DVD in North America by TGG Direct on a double feature with [[Megaville]]. This DVD release also features the original mix of Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtracks, as well as the theatrical desaturated colour palette. In 2015 the film was released on Blu-ray in North America by Twilight Time in a limited 3,000 copy run. This release features the Eurythmics/Muldowney Soundtrack on one audio channel and Muldowney's orchestral score on another, as well as keeping true to the original colour scheme.

The version of the film which has been released on [[Digital distribution|Digital Download]] services is the 2015 HD edition. It is available only with the original Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtrack.

==Awards==
The film won the Best British Film of the Year award at the [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]].
It also won The Golden Tulip Award at Istanbul International Film Festival in 1985.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

      <comment>/* Examples */ "and sprinted away" is technically not a clause, as it does not contain a subject</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">In [[grammar]], '''parallelism''', also known as '''parallel structure''' or '''parallel construction''', is a balance within one or more sentences of similar phrases or [[clause]]s that have the same grammatical structure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 71. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of parallelism affects readability and may make texts easier to process.&lt;ref&gt;For the point about processing, see Carlson, Katy. ''Parallelism and Prosody in the Processing of Ellipsis Sentences''. Routledge, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIJ7quEJl8gC&amp;pg=PA4 pp. 4–6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelism may be accompanied by other figures of speech such as [[antithesis]], [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], [[asyndeton]], [[Climax (figure of speech)|climax]], [[epistrophe]], and [[symploce]].&lt;ref name=examples/&gt; 

== Examples ==
Compare the following examples:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Lacking parallelism !! Parallel
|-
| "She likes cooking, jogging, and ''to read''."
| "She likes cooking, jogging, and reading."

"She likes to cook, jog, and read."
|-
| "He likes ''baseball'' and running."
| "He likes playing baseball and running."

"He likes to play baseball and to run."
|-
| "The dog ran across the yard, jumped over the fence, and ''sprinted away''."
| "The dog ran across the yard, jumped over the fence, and sprinted down the alley."
|}

All of the above examples are grammatically correct, even if they lack parallelism: "cooking", "jogging", and "to read" are all grammatically valid conclusions to "She likes", for instance. The first nonparallel example has a mix of [[gerund]]s and [[infinitive]]s. To make it parallel, the sentence can be rewritten with all gerunds or all infinitives. The second example pairs a gerund with a regular noun. Parallelism can be achieved by converting both terms to gerunds or to infinitives. The final phrase of the third example does not include a definite location, such as "across ''the yard''" or "over ''the fence''"; rewriting to add one completes the sentence's parallelism.

==In rhetoric==
{{see|Parallelism (rhetoric)}}
Parallelism is often used as a [[rhetorical device]]. Examples:

'''Pipe bursting''' is a [[trenchless]] method of replacing buried [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] (such as sewer, water, or natural gas pipes) without the need for a traditional [[construction trench]]. "Launching and receiving pits" replace the trench needed by conventional pipe-laying.

==Equipment==
There are five key pieces of equipment used in a pipebursting operation: the expander head, pulling rods, a pulling machine, a retaining device, and a [[hydraulic power pack]].

Today's expander heads have a leading end much smaller in diameter than the trailing (bursting) end, small enough to fit through the pipe that will be replaced. The smaller leading end is designed to guide the expander head through the existing pipe; earlier models did not have this feature and lost course at times, resulting in incomplete pipe bursts and project failures.

The transition from the leading end to the trailing end can include "fins" that make first contact with the existing pipe. Using these fins as the primary breaking point is a very effective way to ensure that the pipe is broken along the entire circumference.

A machine is set in the receiving pit to pull the expander head and new pipe into the line. The head is pulled by heavy, interlocking links that form a chain. Each link weighs several hundred pounds.

All of the equipment used in a pipe bursting operation is powered by one or multiple hydraulic power generators.

==Other applications==
Pipe bursting may also be used to expand pipeline carrying capacity by replacing smaller pipes with larger ones, or "upsizing."  Extensive proving work by the gas and water industries has demonstrated the feasibility of upsizing gas mains, [[water main]]s and [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s.  Upsizing from 100mm to 225mm diameter is now well established, and pipes of up to 36 inch &lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

'''Post-theism''' is a variant of [[nontheism]] that proposes that the division of [[theism]] vs.  [[atheism]] is obsolete, that [[God]] belongs to a stage of human development now past. Within nontheism, post-theism can be contrasted with [[antitheism]].
The term appears in Christian [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and [[Postchristianity]].

[[Frank Hugh Foster]] in a 1918 lecture announced that modern culture had arrived at a "post-theistic stage" in which humanity has taken possession of the powers of agency and creativity that had formerly been projected upon God.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Dorrien , ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Idealism, Realism, and Modernity, 1900-1950'' (2003), {{ISBN|978-0-664-22355-7}}, p. 177f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denys Turner]] argues that [[Karl Marx]] did not choose atheism over theism, but rejected the binary "[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]ian" choice altogether, a position which by being post-theistic is at the same time necessarily '''post-atheistic'''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Turner, "Religion: Illusions and liberation", in: Terrell Carver (ed), ''The Cambridge Companion to Marx'' (1991), {{ISBN|978-0-521-36694-6}}, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at one point Marx argued "there should be less trifling with the label 'atheism,'” as he insisted "religion in itself is without content, it owes its being not to heaven but to the earth, and with the abolition of distorted reality, of which it is the theory, it will collapse of itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/letters/42_11_30.htm Karl Marx, ''Letter from Marx to Arnold Ruge In Dresden'' (1842)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s pronouncement that "[[God is dead]]" and the [[transtheism]] of [[Paul Tillich]] or [[Pema Chödrön]].

{{Refimprove|date= March 2018}}
'''Poto and Cabengo''' (names given, respectively, by '''Grace and Virginia Kennedy''' to themselves) are American [[identical twin]]s who used an [[invented language]] until the age of about eight. ''Poto and Cabengo'' is also the name of a documentary film about the girls made by [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]] and released in 1980. The film ''[[Nell (film)|Nell]]'', based on the play ''[[Idioglossia (play)|Idioglossia]]'', was partly inspired by the twins.&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941222&amp;slug=1948594&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls were apparently of normal intelligence. They developed their own communication as they had little exposure to [[spoken language]] in their early years. Poto and Cabengo were the names they called each other.

== Birth ==
Grace and Virginia were born in 1970 in [[Columbus, Georgia]].{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Their birth was normal, and they were able to lift their heads and make eye contact with their parents within hours after birth, but both soon suffered apparent seizures. Their father maintained that a surgeon told him the girls might experience [[developmental disabilities]]. Apparently misunderstanding speculation for [[diagnosis]], the girls' parents ceased to pay more attention to them than necessary.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}}

== Early circumstances ==
Both parents were employed (although later characterized by ''[[U-T San Diego|The San Diego Tribune]]'' as living on "food stamps and welfare") and spent many hours away from home. The girls were left in the care of a grandmother who met their physical needs but did not play or interact with them. The grandmother spoke only German, while the parents spoke English. They had no contact with other children, seldom played outdoors, and were not sent to school.&lt;ref&gt;"Twins' Mysterious Speech Has Many Experts Talking", ''[[U-T San Diego|The San Diego Tribune]]'' July 22, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their father later stated in interviews that he realized the girls had invented a language of their own; but, since their use of [[English language|English]] remained extremely rudimentary, he had decided that they were, as the doctor suggested, developmentally challenged and that it would do no good to send them to school.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} When he lost his job, he told a caseworker at the unemployment office about his family; the caseworker advised him to put the girls in [[speech therapy]]. At the [[Rady Children's Hospital|Children's Hospital of San Diego]], in [[California]], speech therapists Ann Koeneke and Alexa Kratze quickly discovered that Virginia and Grace, far from being mentally impaired, had at least normal intelligence and had invented a complex [[idioglossia]].{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}}

==Language==
The language of the twins was spoken extremely quickly and had a [[staccato]] rhythm.  These characteristics transferred themselves to the girls' [[English (language)|English]], which they began to speak following speech therapy.   Linguistic analysis of their language revealed that it was a mixture of English and [[German (language)|German]] (their mother and grandmother were [[Germany|German]]-born), with some [[neologism]]s and several idiosyncratic grammatical features.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}}

The story of the "twins who made their own language" made the national newspapers in 1978 and was included in an edition of the ''[[People's Almanac]]''. Many speech and hearing experts, as well as [[psychiatrist]]s, offered speculation as to why the girls had not picked up English, as most idioglossic twins do whether or not they retain their personal language.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Kratze pointed out that the girls had had very little contact with anyone outside their family, and that contact within the family had been minimal at best. These factors contributed to the girls' [[developmental disability]], even if they had been born with normal intelligence.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}}

Once it was established that the girls could be educated, their father apparently forbade them to speak their personal language. He was quoted in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as saying "They don't want to be associated as dummies. You live in a society, you got to speak the language." Asked if they remembered their language, the girls confirmed that they did, but their father quickly stepped in to chide them for "lying".{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} They were [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] and placed in separate classes in [[elementary school]]. However, they were still affected by their family's emotional neglect. A follow-up in 2007 revealed that Virginia works on an assembly line in a supervised job training center, while Grace mops floors at a fast-food restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;The Learning Channel, [https://web.archive.org/web/20020106135506/http://tlc.discovery.com/tlcpages/twins/s_secret.html "Twin stories"], retrieved 2007-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample speech extract==
"Pinit, putahtraletungay." (Finish, potato salad hungry)

"Nis, Poto?" (This, Poto?)

"Liba Cabingoat, it." (Dear Cabengo, eat)

"La moa, Poto?" (Here more, Poto?)

'''Pouwhenua''' or '''pou whenua''' (land post), are carved wooden posts used by [[Māori people|Māori]], the [[indigenous peoples]] of [[New Zealand]] to mark territorial boundaries or places of significance. They are generally artistically and elaborately carved and can be found throughout New Zealand.&lt;ref name=govt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/heritage/historic-places-in-regional-parks/pou-whenua.cfm |title=Pou Whenua |publisher=Arc.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pouwhenua is also a long-handled fighting staff with a club-like broad head for striking.

== Cultural significance ==
Much like [[totem pole]]s, pou whenua tell a story. They are significant to the Māori people, representing their contributions to the cultural heritage of New Zealand. They acknowledge the association between the people ([[:wikt:tangata|tāngata]]) and the land ([[:wikt:whenua|whenua]]). Specifically, they reflect the relationship between the ancestors, environment, and the reputation or standing of the [[tangata whenua]].&lt;ref name=govt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnstone |first=Liesl |url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-karaka/issue-44/ |title=Marks of an ancestor |journal=Te Karaka |issue=44 |pages=23–25 |year=2009 |publisher=Ngāi Tahu Publications |date= |accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weaponry ==
Belonging to the same class of weaponry as the [[tewhatewha]] and [[taiaha]], pouwhenua are usually made of wood and have a large, broad blade known as ''rau'' at one end and a pointed, sharp tip at the other end. Usually a human head motif was carved on the shaft to form a boundary between the shaft and the long spear point.&lt;ref name="Hiroa"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hiroa | first = Te Rangi | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Long Clubs | work = The Coming of the Maori | publisher = Maori Purposes Fund Board | year = 1949 | url =http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucTheC-t1-g1-t2-body1-d12-d5.html | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pouwhenua were used for attacking an opponent with short sharp strikes or stabbing thrusts with quick footwork on the part of the wielder.&lt;ref name="Hiroa" /&gt; A single blow with the broad blade could easily result in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pouwhenua (long handled pointed fighting staff) | work = Collections Online | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date = | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=213399 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romance tours''' are tours that men take in search of a relationship, girlfriend or even a marriage.&lt;ref name="az"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dating/articles/1015aforeignaffair15-CP.html|title=Marriage Brokers Scrutinized|accessdate=2008-02-19|date=2005-10-15|author=Craig Harris|work=The Arizona Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some such tours, the men and potential brides interact in brief parties arranged by the hosting company.

A large number of romance tours take place every year throughout the world. Romance tours first began in Russia and CIS,&lt;ref&gt;Origination of Russian romance tours: http://www.anastasia-web-tours.com/Home/Tours/tabid/69/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; but have recently moved into other parts of the world such as South America.&lt;ref&gt;Romance Outsourcing: Tales of a Mail Order Bride Tour http://blog.sfgate.com/hleon/2012/01/25/romance-outsourcing-tales-of-a-mail-order-bride-tour/&lt;/ref&gt; Tours also take place in many parts of Asia. 

Once couples have met on a romance tour, an agency arranges "one on one" dates between the man and the women he found most compatible.  The ultimate goal of the tour is for the man to find a compatible wife.

Romance tours are just one part of the mail-order bride business, which may also include catalogs, CD-ROMs and the Internet.&lt;ref name="vv"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2DF143FF937A25751C0A961958260|title=Video Valentines to Russia, Seeking Patient Brides|accessdate=2008-02-19|date=1997-02-14|author=Alessandra Stanley|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional romance tour, seen by some as superficial,&lt;ref name="az"/&gt; is being somewhat replaced by the internet as technology evolves. However, the two are closely linked as a man eventually has to meet his prospective wife using a well-organized method of meeting and dating.

Romance tours should not be confused with [[sex tourism]], because the ultimate goal of a sex tourist is usually not marriage.

==Plot==


In 1815 California, Father Michael, an emissary of [[Pope Pius VII]], has traveled to meet with novice monk Brother Tomas. The young monk's order serves as the secret repository for evil, supernatural objects collected by the Church, and kept there for safekeeping. Michael delivers an ancient statue that has trapped two beautiful female demons, Munkar and Nakir. Tomas and his friend Brother Gregory inadvertently release the murderous demons, who travel to the 21st century using the monastery's Wheel of Time. 

As his brother lies dying, he is given a chance to redeem himself by going through the Wheel of Time with a sacred dagger previously used by [[Saint Nicodemus]] to imprison the succubi. Tomas reluctantly intends to track down the evil creatures and destroy them. The young monk takes on the task, traveling through the Wheel only to discover a future world he does not understand in present-day [[Seattle]], Washington, where he allies with police detective Rachel Dressler to recapture the homicidal terrors.

While the creatures seek to satisfy their centuries-long hunger, Tomas discovers their first victim. The police arrive on the murder scene and take Tomas into custody, believing he may be involved. Detective Rachel Dressler (Ravera) isn't about to believe Tomas' weird story, but strange things start to happen and bodies begin to pile up. Both Tomas and Rachel soon discover that the only way to stop these horrifying demons will be to take a leap of faith.

[[Sherlock Holmes]] has long been a popular character for [[pastiche]], Holmes-related work by authors and creators other than [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].
Their works can be grouped into four broad categories:
*new Sherlock Holmes stories;
*stories in which Holmes appears in a cameo role;
*stories about imagined descendants of Sherlock Holmes;
*and stories inspired by Sherlock Holmes but which do not include Holmes himself.

==Sherlock Holmes stories==
New Sherlock Holmes stories fall into many categories, including:
* Additional Sherlock Holmes stories in the conventional mould
* Holmes placed in settings of contemporary interest (such as World War II, or the future)
* Crossover stories in which Holmes is pitted against other fictional characters (for example vampires)
* Explorations of unusual aspects of Holmes' character which are hinted at in Conan Doyle's works (e.g. drug use)

{{details|List of authors of new Sherlock Holmes stories}}

In 1913 the Greek novel ''Sherlock Holmes saving Mr. Venizelos'' (''Ο Σέρλοκ Χολμς σώζων τον κ. Βενιζέλον'') was serialized in the magazine ''Hellas''. Written by an anonymous author, it describes Holmes' attempts to save [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] from a Bulgarian organization's assassination plot during the [[London Conference of 1912–13]]. It is considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] of the [[Greek literature]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  
In January 1928, the short story "My Dear Holmes" was published in [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch, or the London Charivari'']]. The sub-title of the story was: "His positively last appearance on earth."  Written from the point of view of Holmes, it starts out in the usual way, and then ends rather lamely with no mystery presented or solved, but Holmes dead of incautiously (and improbably) sniffing excessively at a bottle of an anesthetic ("A.C.E.") he has asked Watson to bring with them on an errand.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Arthur Conan Doyle's son, [[Adrian Conan Doyle]], wrote&amp;mdash;in a joint effort with [[John Dickson Carr]]&amp;mdash;twelve Sherlock Holmes short stories that were published under the title ''[[The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes]]'' in 1954.

Using his alternate name of H.F. Heard, [[Gerald Heard]] wrote three novels about a reclusive beekeeper in the English countryside who goes by the name of Mycroft; he's clearly intended to be Sherlock Holmes, but the books were written before the Doyle estate gave permission for other writers to use the name.  The three stories are ''[[A Taste for Honey]]'', ''Reply Paid'' and ''The Notched Hairpin''. ''A Taste for Honey'' was adapted for American TV in 1955 as "Sting of Death," with [[Boris Karloff]] as Mr. Mycroft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nollen|first=Scott Allen|title=Boris Karloff: A Critical Account of His Screen, Stage, Radio, Television, and Recording Work|location=Jefferson, NC|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|year=1991|page=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1iyAPhqmboC&amp;pg=PA338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American novelist and filmmaker [[Nicholas Meyer]] wrote three Holmes novels: ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' (1974), ''[[The West End Horror]]'' (1976), and ''[[The Canary Trainer]]'' (1993). In 1977 the novel ''Exit Sherlock Holmes: The Great Detective's Final Days'' by Robert Lee Hall was published, and featured an exploration of Holmes' origins with a science fiction twist. In this account Holmes and Moriarty are revealed to be from the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exit Sherlock Holmes|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-lee-hall-5/exit-sherlock-holmes/|publisher=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randall Collins]] published in 1978 ''The Case of the Philosophers' Ring'', under the pseudonym Dr. John H. Watson, with Holmes' services requested at Cambridge, around 1914, by [[Bertrand Russell]], and meeting the [[Cambridge Apostles]] (Moore, Hardy, [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]...) [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Annie Besant]] and of course, [[Aleister Crowley|Aleisteir Crowley]] as a perfect villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11803497? |title=The Case of the Philosopher's Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Dibdin]]'s novel ''[[The Last Sherlock Holmes Story]]'' (1979) confronts a somewhat psychopathic Sherlock Holmes with the crimes of [[Jack the Ripper]], whom Holmes suspects to be none other than [[Professor Moriarty|James Moriarty]]. [[Raymond Smullyan]] wrote ''The Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes'' (1979), in which Holmes (with Watson) applies retrograde analysis to solve chess problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes: Fifty Tantalizing Problems of Chess Detection|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486482014.html|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The detective novelist [[Loren D. Estleman]] wrote several short stories and two novels featuring Holmes; the novels pit the detective against [[Count Dracula]] and [[Dr. Jekyll]], respectively. The former was adapted for radio by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Radio: Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0084gr2|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cay Van Ash]] wrote the novel ''Ten Years Beyond Baker Street: Sherlock Holmes matches wits with the diabolical Dr. Fu Manchu'' (1984), set in 1914, in which the apparently retired detective comes into conflict with Sax Rohmer’s villainous master criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Years Beyond Baker Street: Sherlock Holmes Matches Wits with the Diabolical Dr. Fu Manchu|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/cay-van-ash/ten-years-beyond-baker-street-sherlock-holmes-m/|publisher=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian writer [[Ron Weyman]] published three novels between 1989 and 1994 which imagined Sherlock Holmes as being sent to [[Canada]] at the behest of [[Edward VII|Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], and investigating crimes there.&lt;ref name="globeobit2"&gt;"RON WEYMAN, 91 SAILOR, PRODUCER, PAINTER AND NOVELIST: Pioneer filmmaker turned hard-hitting social issues into popular television". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', July 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes aficionado [[Stephen Fry]] wrote a short story featuring Holmes, "The Adventure of the Laughing Jarvey", in which Holmes and Watson encounter a great Victorian writer and are engaged on a mission to recover a lost manuscript. It includes introductory text claiming the tale itself to be a long-lost manuscript, which modern analysis has shown to use linguistic style and grammar typical of Watson. The story appears in Fry's collection of journalism and early writings, ''[[Paperweight (book)|Paperweight]]'' (1992).  In [[Stephen King]]'s short story "[[The Doctor's Case]]" (1993), Holmes's alleged allergy to cats prevents him for once from solving the problem quicker than Watson. [[Barrie Roberts]] penned a series of Holmes pastiches including ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Man from Hell]]'' and ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Railway Maniac]]'' from 1994 until his death in 2007.  ''[[O Xangô de Baker Street]]'' (1995) tells the comic story of Sherlock Holmes's visit to Brazil, invited by the emperor Dom Pedro II, to solve the disappearance of a Stradivarius violin which becomes a hunt for a serial killer.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  [[Larry Millett]] has written six books and a short story featuring Holmes solving mysteries in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Larry Millett|url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/43311.Larry_Millett|publisher=[[Goodreads]]|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Mallory]] has written more than two dozen short stories and two novels featuring "Amelia Watson," the second wife of [[Dr. Watson]].  These are not pastiches so much as original detective stories that view Holmes and Watson from a different, somewhat humorous, point of view.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  Colin Bruce's ''[[The Strange Case of Mrs. Hudson's Cat: And Other Science Mysteries Solved by Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1997) and ''Conned Again, Watson!: Cautionary Tales of Logic, Maths and Probability'' (2001) are books of Sherlock Holmes stories in which Holmes uses scientific and mathematical approaches respectively to solve mysteries. ''[[The Mandala of Sherlock Holmes|The Mandala of Sherlock Holmes: The Missing Years]]'' (1999), by [[Tibet]]an author [[Jamyang Norbu]] is an account of Holmes's adventures in India and Tibet where, posing as Sigerson, he meets the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Huree Chunder Mookerjee]], a character from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s novel ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]''.

Italian conservative Catholic author Rino Cammilleri published in 2000 a novel with the title ''Sherlock Holmes e il misterioso caso di Ippolito Nievo'' ("Sherlock Holmes and the Mysterious Case of [[Ippolito Nievo]]") set in London, [[Turin]] and [[Naples]].

The collection ''[[Shadows Over Baker Street]]'' (2003) contains 14 stories by 20 authors pitting Holmes against the forces of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. Among them is [[Neil Gaiman]]'s "[[A Study in Emerald]]", which won the 2004 [[Hugo Award]] for Best Short Story.  The title is a play on ''A Study in Scarlet''. The narrator, never named (but whose initials in the end point him to be the criminal henchman of James Moriarty, [[Sebastian Moran]]; his tour in Afghanistan point to this as well.), meets the protagonist (who is also never named, but likely [[Professor Moriarty|James Moriarty]] himself, in a surprising role-reversal, making him the detective and Holmes the criminal) under similar circumstances to the meeting of Holmes and Watson in ''A Study in Scarlet'', even down to the deduction that the narrator has recently been in Afghanistan. The protagonist is tall and thin, a detective, chemist, and master of disguise. However, as the narrator and his friend investigate a murder of one of the Royal Family (shown to be the [[Great Old One]]s of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]) the murderer is revealed to be a tall, thin, pipe-smoking man, going by the name Sherry Vernet (a reference to the first name Sherlock, or possibly Conan Doyle's earlier "Sherrinford", and the last name of Holmes' grandmother). He is assisted by a "limping doctor", later tentatively identified as John (or possibly James) Watson. "Vernet" also had gone by the name Sigerson. [[Inspector Lestrade]] also appears in the story.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Michael Chabon]] wrote ''[[The Final Solution (novel)|The Final Solution]]'' in 2004. This book, that received favorable reviews,&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Jennifer|title=Wonder Boys|url=http://nymag.com/nymag/critics/books/10272/|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedell|first=Deborah|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/books/review/the-final-solution-bird-of-the-baskervilles.html|title='The Final Solution': Bird of the Baskervilles|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 14, 2004|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with an elderly Sherlock Holmes, referred to only as 'the old man,' solving the case of the missing parrot belonging to a nine-year-old Jewish refugee boy from Germany. While readily solving the mystery, 'the old man,' as well as the rest of the characters in the novella, fail to see what the parrot's incessant muttering of random German numbers really means.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt;

[[Caleb Carr]] was approached to pen a tale for the anthology ''[[Ghosts of Baker Street]]''.&lt;ref name="italiansecretary"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Caleb Carr]] |coauthors= |title=[[The Italian Secretary]] |year=2005 |publisher=[[Carroll &amp; Graf]] |quote= | page=261| url= |isbn=0-7867-1548-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr's short story grew to become a full length novel&lt;ref name="italiansecretary"/&gt; which became 2005's ''[[The Italian Secretary]]''.&lt;ref name="italiansecretary"/&gt;  An example of Sherlock Holmes pastiche is found in ''The Curse of the Nibelung: A Sherlock Holmes Mystery'' (2005) by [[Sam North]], which is currently in reprint. It finds Holmes at the very end of his career, together with a geriatric Watson, sent by Winston Churchill to [[Nazi Germany]] to help uncover a terrible secret.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  ''[[Elemental, querido Chaplin]]'', by [[Rafael Marín]] (2005, Minotauro, Barcelona, {{ISBN|84-450-7542-X}}), is presented as an [[false document|unpublished manuscript]] in which [[Charles Chaplin]] tells how, as a London poor child, he helped Sherlock Holmes in an adventure against Fu Manchu.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  [[Nick Rennison]]'s 2006 ''[[Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography]]'' is a "biography" of the detective much like [[William S. Baring-Gould]]'s earlier ''[[Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street|Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street: A Life of the World's First Consulting Detective]]''.

[[Mitch Cullin]]'s novel ''[[A Slight Trick of the Mind]]'' (2005) takes place two years after the end of the Second World War, and explores the character of Sherlock Holmes (now 93) as he comes to terms with a life spent in emotionless logic. Now old and frail, his once steel trap mind begins to fail him as he loses items and forgets whole parts of his day. The story follows Holmes both at his home where he now tends bees in quiet retirement, as well as a vacation in Japan where he observes their post-war society first-hand. The novel is also interspersed with chapters of Sherlock's own book which reveals a fleeting moment of love that even he does not yet realise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiasson|first=Dan|title='A Slight Trick of the Mind': Old Man Holmes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/books/review/a-slight-trick-of-the-mind-old-man-holmes.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 2005|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manly W. Wellman]]'s ''[[Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds]]'' combined the elements of Holmes canon with [[H.G. Wells]]'s [[The War of the Worlds|science fiction classic]] and describes Holmes' and Watson's adventures in the Martian-occupied London. (In passing, the book also asserts that Holmes had a long-lasting romantic relationship with Mrs. Hudson, but the puritanical Dr. Watson never noticed it). [[Laurie R. King]] recreates Sherlock Holmes in her [[Mary Russell (fictional)|Mary Russell]] series (starting with ''[[The Beekeeper's Apprentice]]''), set during World War I and the 1920s.  Her Holmes is (semi)retired in Sussex, where he gradually trains a teenage Russell as his apprentice.  The series includes 11 full length novels and a short story tie-in with a book from her Kate Martinelli series, ''[[The Art of Detection]]''. ''Repercussions'' is a short comic story by Dwight Baldwin and J.M. DeSantis in the literary trade paperback ''Iconic'' (Summer, 2009) by members of the Comicbook Artists Guild.  In it, Holmes and Watson are on the trail of the legendary [[Jack the Ripper]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  Another story which pits Holmes and Watson against Jack the Ripper is Lyndsay Faye's ''[[Dust and Shadow]]'' (2009). In [[Robert Wilton (author)|Robert Wilton]]'s 'The Adventure of the Distracted Thane', Holmes investigates the assassination of King [[Duncan I of Scotland]], previously explored by [[William Shakespeare]] in ''[[Macbeth]]'' (which itself, according to this interpretation, featured Dr Watson).

For younger readers, [[Shane Peacock]] has written [[The Boy Sherlock Holmes]] series. [[Andy Lane]] begun a [[Young Sherlock Holmes (books)|young adult series of Sherlock Holmes adventures]] with the publication of ''[[Death Cloud]]'' in 2010. This series is the first authorized series of teenage adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alison Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/18/young-sherlock-holmes-macmillan |title="Macmillan reveals adventures of young Sherlock Holmes": 18 March 2009 |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2009-03-18|accessdate=2010-12-17 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alberto López Aroca]] wrote "El problema de la pequeña cliente", a short story included in the book ''Nadie lo sabrá nunca'' (2004), where Sherlock Holmes meets [[Mary Poppins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tercerafundacion.es/biblioteca/ver/contenido/34340 |title=El problema de la pequeña cliente &amp;#124; Contenido &amp;#124; Biblioteca &amp;#124; La Tercera Fundación |publisher=Tercerafundacion.es |date=2001-01-01 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conan Doyle estate commissioned [[Anthony Horowitz]], author of the [[Alex Rider]] novels, ''[[The Power of Five]]'' and TV's ''[[Foyle's War]]'', to write a new, uniquely ''authorised'' Sherlock Holmes novel. Published by Orion Books in 2011 under the title ''[[The House of Silk]]'', the content and title were a "closely guarded secret" before publication.&lt;ref name=orion&gt;“[http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/news/anthony-horowitz-to-write-new-sherlock-holmes-novel Anthony Horowitz to Write New Sherlock Holmes Novel],” News release, [[Orion Publishing Group]], 17 January 2011.

===TV===
The [[BBC]]'s TV series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' re-imagines Holmes and Watson (played by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] and [[Martin Freeman]]) as contemporary figures with Watson publishing his accounts of Holmes' exploits online.

The US TV series ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' features a modern Holmes ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]) who lives in the [[United States]], where he is assisted by Dr. Joan Watson ([[Lucy Liu]]).

The 2014 [[NHK]] puppetry ''[[Sherlock Holmes (puppetry)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' is set in a fictional boarding school "[[Beeton School]]" and Holmes and Watson are pupils who live in 221B of [[Beeton School#Houses and uniform|Baker House]]. There's no murder and same characters appear many times.

HBO Asia's 2018 series ''[[Miss Sherlock]]'' is set in modern-day Japan, starring [[Yuko Takeuchi]] as the titular character, with [[Shihori Kanjiya]] as 'Wato'.

[[BBC Radio 2]] also broadcast in 1999 a more ribald six-episode [[parody|spoof]] series featuring Holmes and Watson titled ''[[The Newly Discovered Casebook of Sherlock Holmes]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b1rqs|title=The Newly Discovered Casebook of Sherlock Holmes - BBC Radio 4 Extra|author=|date=|website=BBC|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Roy Hudd]] as Holmes ("the brilliant detective, master of disguise and toffee-nosed ponce"), [[Chris Emmett]] as Watson ("contributor to the [[British Medical Journal]], ''Which Stethescope Magazine'' and inventor of the self-raising [[thermometer]]") and [[June Whitfield]] as Mrs. Hudson.  Titles in this series included "The Case of the Clockwork Fiend", "The Mystery of the Obese Escapologist", "The Case of the Deranged Botanist", "Sherlock Holmes and the Glorious Doppelganger", "Holmes Strikes a Happy Medium" and "The Demon Cobbler of Greek Street", and usually turned out to have Holmes' mortal enemy Moriarty ([[Geoffrey Whitehead]]) behind each mystery.  This series has since been re-broadcast on [[BBC Radio 7]], later [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]].

Starting in 1998, U.S. radio producer [[Jim French (radio)|Jim French]] was given permission from the Conan Doyle estate to produce new, original Sherlock Holmes stories for radio in North America.&lt;ref name="jimfrench"&gt;[http://jimfrenchproductions.com/zc137m/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=3 Jim French Productions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213065339/http://jimfrenchproductions.com/zc137m/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=3 |date=2010-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are presented within the [[Imagination Theater]] program on radio stations and XM satellite radio. The new stories are also broadcast under the banner ''The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes''. John Gilbert played Holmes until 2000, when John Patrick Lowrie took over the role.&lt;ref name="jimfrench"/&gt; Watson is played in all shows by Lawrence Albert.&lt;ref name="jimfrench"/&gt; Scripts are by Jim French, [[M. J. Elliott]], Matthew Booth, John Hall, Gareth Tilley, J R Campbell and Lawrence Albert. In 2005, with adaptations written by [[M. J. Elliott]], French and his company began a new series based on Conan Doyle's original tales called "The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes." Many episodes are available on CD as well as downloadable from the Imagination Theater website.

===Film===
Holmes has been an inspiration of both serious and comedy films.

====Serious films====
A series of [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|fourteen Sherlock Holmes films]] starring [[Basil Rathbone]] as Sherlock Holmes and [[Nigel Bruce]] as Dr. John Watson were released between 1939 and 1946. Many are loosely based on the original stories by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and some are original stories. Those that pit Holmes and Watson against the [[Nazi]]s, made during the Second World War,  were in the spirit of Conan Doyle's patriotism, and indeed the quintessential "[[His Last Bow (story)|His Last Bow]]" describes Holmes and his connections with [[MI5|British Intelligence]] on the eve of the [[First World War]].

''[[A Study in Terror]]'' (1965), directed by [[James Hill (British director)|James Hill]] starring [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as Holmes and [[Donald Houston]] as Watson, connected Holmes with the [[Jack the Ripper]] case, and was later novelised by [[Ellery Queen]].

''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970) was directed by [[Billy Wilder]] and stars [[Robert Stephens]] as the famous sleuth. In this film, Holmes travels to [[Scotland]] in search of [[the Loch Ness Monster]].

''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' (1976), based on [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s very successful novel, concentrates on Holmes' cocaine addiction and stars [[Nicol Williamson]] and [[Robert Duvall]] as Holmes and Watson, respectively. Professor Moriarty ([[Laurence Olivier]]) is characterised here as an inoffensive mathematics tutor, his villainy a fantasy of Holmes's drug habit.

''[[Sherlock Holmes in New York]]'' (1976 TV movie) starred [[Roger Moore]] as Holmes and [[Patrick Macnee]] as Watson.

''[[Murder by Decree]]'' (1979) portrays Holmes (played by [[Christopher Plummer]]) and Watson (played by [[James Mason]]) tracking down [[Jack the Ripper]], and dealing with the violent political situation of the day.  The theory of the Ripper murders presented in that film is similar to that portrayed in the comic book and film ''[[From Hell]]''. Both are derived from [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]'s book ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]] (1977)''.

In 1985, director [[Barry Levinson]] made a film called ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'' (a.k.a. ''Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear'') with a story about the youth of Holmes and Watson as [[Secondary School]] [[student]]s and their first great adventure, even before ''A Study in Scarlet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levinson.com/bl/ysherlock/index.htm |title=film menu |publisher=Levinson.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a lot of references about Holmes canon such as the [[violin]], the [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]], "elementary, my dear...", the clothes and the reason why Holmes never married, and it includes the first meeting of Holmes and [[Professor Moriarty]]. The film was produced by [[Steven Spielberg]] and written by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]; the novelization was written by Alan Arnold.

In both ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1987 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1987 TV movie) and ''[[Sherlock Holmes Returns]]'' (1993 TV movie) a cryogenically frozen Holmes is awakened in the present day.

''Hands of a Murderer'' (1990 TV movie) sees [[Edward Woodward]] playing Holmes and [[John Hillerman]] (of [[Magnum, P.I.]] fame) as Watson, in a plot involving Mycroft ([[Peter Jeffrey]]) and Moriarty ([[Anthony Andrews]]) battling for control of government secrets.

''[[Sherlock: Case of Evil]]'' (2002 TV movie) has [[James D'Arcy]] as a youthful, bed-hopping Holmes, meeting Roger Morlidge's Watson for the first time while pursuing [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]'s Moriarty, whose [[opium]]-trading schemes have left Mycroft ([[Richard E. Grant]]) physically and mentally scarred.

''[[The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire]]'' (2002 TV movie) stars [[Matt Frewer]] and [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Holmes and Watson investigating reports of [[vampire]] attacks in [[Whitechapel]], [[North East (London sub region)|East London]]. The film was preceded by adaptations of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (2000 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (2000 TV movie) and ''[[The Sign of Four (2001 film)|The Sign of Four]]'' (2001 TV movie).

''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking]]'' (2004 TV movie), has Holmes ([[Rupert Everett]]) and Watson ([[Ian Hart]]) searching for a killer with a foot fetish. The production was an original story written by [[Allan Cubitt]]. This was preceded by ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (2002 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (2002 TV movie) with Holmes now played by [[Richard Roxburgh]] and [[Ian Hart]] returning as Watson.

''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2009) was directed by [[Guy Ritchie]] for [[Warner Bros.]] and stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and [[Jude Law]] as Holmes and Watson. It also features [[Rachel McAdams]] as [[Irene Adler]]. The film explores Holmes and Watson's most complex adventure in which the antagonist Lord Blackwood ([[Mark Strong]]) seemingly rises from his grave after being executed and draws plans to control the British Empire. The sequel, ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'' (2011) pits the original cast against [[Professor Moriarty]] (played by [[Jared Harris]]).

''[[Sherlock Holmes (2010 film)|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2010) was directed by Rachel Lee Gondenberg and produced by low-budget direct-to-DVD film company [[The Asylum]]. It stars [[Gareth David Lloyd]] as Watson and new actor Ben Syder as Holmes. The film placed a younger Holmes and Watson in a [[steampunk]] [[science fiction]] story set in 1881, in which Holmes and Watson investigate the crimes of a mechanical genius known as [[Spring Heeled Jack]], who creates mechanical monsters to terrorise London.

====Comedy films====

Holmes' talents have sometimes been inverted for comic effect, as in [[Gene Wilder]]'s 1975 film ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]''. Here Holmes' younger brother Sigurson (Wilder), who is jealous of 'Sheer Luck' as he calls him, is manipulated by Holmes into solving one of his cases.

1988 brought [[Thom Eberhardt]]'s role-reversal comedy ''[[Without a Clue]]''. The film depicts Dr. Watson ([[Ben Kingsley]]) as the real detective genius and Holmes ([[Michael Caine]]) as a bumbling idiot who is merely an actor and a front man for Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096454/|title=Without a Clue|author=|date=21 October 1988|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a plot which cleverly mirrors the real life circumstance of Conan Doyle (also a physician) who eventually tired of his creation, Sherlock Holmes.

===Animation===
The 1999 animated series ''[[Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century]]'' was set in the year 2103 and involved Beth Lestrade, a direct descendant of Holmes's associate [[Inspector Lestrade]], reanimating the cryogenically preserved corpse of Holmes to battle Moriarty-later revealed to be a clone of the original-who was believed to be responsible for a series of crimes in New London.  Watson was long dead, but a robotic counterpart was made to physically resemble him after downloading Watson's stories- and essentially his personality- into his databanks by accident, and the three solved a number of cases patterned on the original Holmes stories; for instance, a retelling of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' took place on the moon and involved werewolves.  The series was created by DIC and Scottish Television, and ran for approximately two seasons.  It was unique in Sherlockiana for a number of reasons, including the fact that Holmes, who is canonically described as having black hair and grey eyes, was depicted with blond hair and blue eyes.

''[[Sherlock Hound]]'' (名探偵ホームズ Meitantei Hōmuzu?, lit. "Detective Holmes") is a 1984 anime television series based on Conan Doyle's work where almost all the characters are depicted as anthropomorphic dogs. The show featured regular appearances of Jules Verne-steampunk style technology, adding a 19th-century science-fiction atmosphere to the series. It was coproduced by Japanese and Italian companies and animated by [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha|TMS]]. Some episodes were directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]].

''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' featured an episode in which Holmes and Watson are acquaintances of [[Jason Blood]] and end up summoning [[Batman]] back through time in order to aid him when he is framed for the crimes of the future [[Gentleman Ghost]]. Upon encountering Batman Holmes is able to deduce much about his nature but is then baffled when Batman recognizes him immediately; he comes to see the Caped Crusader as something of a rival as they attempt to unravel the plot of Gentleman Ghost. After the villain's defeat, Holmes and his Victorian era allies see Batman off, and as Batman departs he acknowledges Holmes as "the World's Greatest Detective."

The 2015 anime film, ''[[The Empire of Corpses]]'', features a younger, re-imagined Holmes and Watson, the latter actually the protagonist, in a steampunk world where the dead are reanimated and used as a labor force.

===Comics===
In the [[Italian comics|Italian comic book]] ''[[Martin Mystère]]'' and spin-off series ''Storie di Altrove/Stories from Elsewhere'' Holmes is a historical character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-en.sergiobonellieditore.it/auto/scheda_speciale?collana=13&amp;numero=129 ''Martin Mystère: The shadows of Baker Street''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722052923/http://www-en.sergiobonellieditore.it/auto/scheda_speciale?collana=13&amp;numero=129 |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1880s he worked on the case of [[Jack the Ripper]] and met professor [[Abraham Van Helsing|Richard Van Helsing]], a [[vampire]] who destroyed [[Count Dracula]]. Along with Professor Challenger, Holmes visited a secret valley of dinosaurs in South America in 1896, which became the basis for Doyle's novel ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. The same year he worked with the American Secret Service "Elsewhere" to stop paranormal threats from another dimension. In 1910 he discovered a life extension serum. At the beginning of World War I he had a final confrontation with Professor Moriarty. After the war, he moved to Ukraine, giving Arthur Conan Doyle the task to convince everyone that he was just an imaginary character. With the help of his serum, Holmes prolonged his life for several decades. In 1990s he indirectly helped Martin Mystère to capture a villain who found a formula of his serum.

Set in the year 1864, it features younger versions of characters in the series. These include [[Inspector Lestrade]] as a junior police officer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeon|first=Hey-jin|author2=Lee, Ki-ha|title=Lizzie Newton: Victoria Mysteries (English translation)|volume=1|year=2012|page=168|isbn=978-1-935934-80-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor Moriarty as a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeon|first=Hey-jin|author2=Lee, Ki-ha|title=Lizzie Newton: Victoria Mysteries (English translation)|volume=2|year=2013|page=164|isbn=978-1-937867-08-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sherlock Holmes cameos==
===Print===
According to ''The Alternative Sherlock Holmes: Pastiches, Parodies, and Copies'' by Peter Ridgway Watt and Joseph Green, the first known period pastiche dates from 1893. Titled "[[The Late Sherlock Holmes]]", it came from the pen of Doyle's close friend, [[J. M. Barrie]], who was to create [[Peter Pan]] a decade later. The police are apprised of the death of Holmes and believe that Dr. Watson has killed him because of a disagreement about money. However, Holmes turns out to be alive and, although it is not made clear, Watson is presumably released.

In 1902 [[Mark Twain]] painted an unflattering portrait of Holmes and his methods of deduction in his ''[[A Double Barrelled Detective Story]]''. In the short story, set at a mining camp in [[California]], Fetlock Jones, a nephew of Sherlock Holmes, kills his master, a silver-miner, by blowing up his cabin. Since this occurs when Holmes happens to be visiting, he brings his skills to bear upon the case and arrives at logically worked conclusions that are proved abysmally wrong by an amateur detective with an extremely keen sense of smell which he employs in solving the case. Perhaps this ought to be seen as yet another piece where Twain tries to prove that life does not quite follow logic.

In 1905 the French writer [[Maurice Leblanc]] pitted his gentleman burglar [[Arsène Lupin]] against Holmes in a story called ''Sherlock Holmes arrive trop tard'' (Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late), the first of four in the '''Lupin''' series. Copyright concerns at the time forced Holmes to be renamed "Herlock Sholmes" or "Holmlock Shears", and Watson to be renamed "Wilson", in subsequent appearances. However, in many modern editions, the names have reverted to the original.

In 1910, the French writer [[Arnould Galopin]] teamed up his detective '''Allan Dickson''', the ''Australian Sherlock Holmes'' with an aging Holmes renamed ''Herlokolms'' who had been much impressed by the young man's early exploits in ''L'Homme au Complet Gris'' (The Man in Grey).
Allan Dickson may have been the prototype for ''[[Harry Dickson]]'' (see [[#Successors of Sherlock Holmes]], below).

Another French writer, [[Théodore Botrel]], wrote the play ''Le Mystère de Kéravel'' in 1932 in which Holmes, travelling incognito in Brittany, solves a murder at the request of local police, who know his true identity. He is referred to as ''L'étranger'' in the list of characters, but named in the text.

Several characters from the canon appear in [[Alan Moore]]'s [[comic book]] series ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', in which various characters from Victorian fiction are recruited to serve the interests of an alternate-history [[British Empire]]. Holmes himself appears only in a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] during the first series, as he is still presumed dead. Mycroft has a more substantial role in the second series. References in the series suggest Sherlock was a member of an earlier iteration of the League. Moriarty also figures into the first series and the film adaptation. Holmes also makes a minor but significant appearance in [[Warren Ellis]] and [[John Cassaday]]'s comic book series ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]''.

[[Michael P. Hodel]] and Sean M. Wright presented a mystery-adventure ''Enter the Lion: A Posthumous Memoir of Mycroft Holmes'' (1979) in which Sherlock's older brother prevents a conspiracy involving a return of the American "colonies" to Great Britain. Sherlock makes appearances with [[Victor Trevor]] (from [[The Adventure of the Gloria Scott]]), [[Professor Moriarty]] and Moriarty's father.

[[Carole Nelson Douglas]] has written a spin-off series centring upon Holmes' nemesis [[Irene Adler]]. The first book is titled ''Good Night, Mr. Holmes'' and takes place concurrently with ''[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]''. While Irene Adler is the main character, Sherlock Holmes plays a role in every book in the series.

[[Michael Mallory]] has written a series of short stories and one novel (''Murder in the Bath'') about the second wife of [[Doctor Watson]], here named "Amelia Watson."  Holmes appears in several of the stories as a semi-antagonistic foil for Amelia—a detective who is in reality slightly less than infallible, but who has been made to appear so to the public through Watson's writings.

In [[Kim Newman]]'s [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Anno Dracula (novel)|Anno Dracula]]'', set in a world where [[Dracula]] becomes the monarch of Britain, Holmes is one of the prominent "warms" to protest against the new order. The vampire government of [[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]] in turn imprisons him in a [[concentration camp]] in [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex]].

Holmes and Watson appear briefly in [[George MacDonald Fraser]]'s short story ''[[Flashman and the Tiger]]'' (1999), which appears in the collection of that name.  The events there are consistent with those of the canonical story ''[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]'', which takes place in 1894. Holmes sees Flashman disguised as a tramp and draws a series of conclusions about him which are all wrong.

Holmes and Watson also appear in [[Alan Coren]]'s children's books, ''Arthur and the Great Detective'' and ''Arthur and the Bellybutton Diamond''. The titular '''Arthur''' is an erstwhile Baker Street Irregular.

In 1993 the psychologist [[Keith Oatley]] wrote ''The Case of Emily V.'', a novel in which [[Sigmund Freud]], Watson and Sherlock Holmes turn out to be investigating the same person. This book won the 1994 Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best First Novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case of Emily V. |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-92935-530-3|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Oatley's book the reader finds out the "real truth" behind Freud's case notes on Emily V.

In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[All-Consuming Fire]]'' by [[Andy Lane]] the Time Lord meets Holmes and Watson while investigating a recent theft from the Library of St. John the Beheaded, revealed to be the work of Holmes's unknown eldest brother Sherringford (sic), Holmes in the end being forced to kill Sherringford (sic) to save Watson. They are later amongst numerous characters from the series who attend [[Bernice Summerfield]]'s wedding in ''[[Happy Endings (Doctor Who)|Happy Endings]]'' by [[Paul Cornell]]. Holmes also features in the ''[[Faction Paradox]]'' novel ''[[Erasing Sherlock]]'' by [[Kelly Hale]] and in the novelette ''The Shape of Things'' by [[Stuart Douglas (writer)|Stuart Douglas]] in the [[Iris Wildthyme]] collection [[Miss Wildthyme and Friends Investigate]].  [[Mycroft Holmes]], Dr John Watson and Professor George Challenger also appear in the same book.

[[Boris Akunin]]'s short story ''The Prisoner of the Tower, or A Short But Beautiful Journey of Three Wise Men'' in the ''[[Erast Fandorin#Jade Rosary Beads|Jade Rosary Beads]]'' compilation describes Holmes and Erast Fandorin's race to thwart a devious [[extortion]] plan by [[Arsène Lupin]].

Author [[Nancy Springer]] writes a series of novels of the adventures of [[Enola Holmes]], the much younger teenage sister of Sherlock and Mycroft.  Upon their mother's disappearance, Enola discovers that she in fact left of her own volition according to a carefully devised plan to live independently and raised her daughter with the skills to do the same if she chose to.  Finding the resources her mother carefully hid for her, Enola decides to run away rather than be forced into [[boarding school]] by Mycroft. She eventually comes to London where she secretly sets herself up in business as a private investigator when she realises she is equally as talented at the profession as her older brother even as she is determined to elude his notice.

Holmes cameos at the end of ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #572, the comic series' 50th anniversary issue, helping [[Batman]], [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[The Elongated Man]], and [[Slam Bradley]] tie up a case involving the descendants of both Dr. Watson and Professor Moriarty.  Well over a century old now, Holmes attributes his longevity to "a proper diet, a certain distillation of royal jelly, developed in my beekeeping days, and the rarified (sic) atmosphere of Tibet, where I keep my primary residence."  He apparently gave up tobacco, too, indicating that his pipe was now "purely for show these days."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike W. Barr]] (w); [[Alan Davis]] et al. (a). "The Doomsday Book", ''Detective Comics'' #572, [[DC Comics]], March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV===
In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', a Sherlock Holmes mystery was one of the programmes on the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]]'s [[holodeck]]. In the episode ''[[Elementary, Dear Data (TNG episode)|Elementary, Dear Data]]'', [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], after memorising all of the Sherlock Holmes books, is challenged to use deduction in an original mystery created by [[Katherine Pulaski|Dr. Pulaski]]. However, the programme goes awry when [[Geordi La Forge]], in response to Pulaski's challenge, asks the computer to create an adversary capable of defeating ''Data'', resulting in the hologram of Professor Moriarty (played by [[Daniel Davis]]) gaining full sentience, kidnapping Dr. Pulaski and taking over the ship's computer. In a later episode, ''[[Ship in a Bottle (TNG episode)|Ship in a Bottle]]'', the holodeck Moriarty again takes control of the ship, insisting that a way be found for him to experience life beyond the confines of the holodeck, until the crew manage to trap him in a permanent simulation. The first Holmes-based episode was produced with the understanding that Sherlock Holmes was [[public domain]], but a protest from the Doyle estate indicated otherwise (and, it is rumoured, prevented a plan for Data-as-Holmes to become a recurring character).

An elderly Holmes and Watson appear in a sketch of comedy show ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look]]'', where Holmes is portrayed as an increasingly senile old man whose flawed deductions are merely humoured by Watson to try to make his old friend feel better; the sketch ends on a tearful note as Holmes, his mind briefly clear, admits to Watson that he knows that his powers are failing him but simply cannot think clearly enough to get past his age.

===Animation===
* Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' (1986), also known as ''Basil of Baker Street'', was a relatively successful theatrical feature [[animated film]] based on the [[Basil of Baker Street|books]] of [[Eve Titus]], featuring a miniature subworld of London with mice, rats and cats in the lead roles. The title character is a mouse who lives in 221B Baker St and models his own detective career on Holmes, who lives at the same address and makes a cameo appearance.
* In one episode of The Fairly Oddparents Holmes is portrayed in stereotypical attire; he starts every sentence with "elementary, my dear (whomever he is addressing)" and will always know the answer to every single question posed to him about the asker.
* In the ''[[VeggieTales]]'' episode, ''[[Sheerluck Holmes and the Golden Ruler]]'', Larry the Cucumber and Bob the Tomato portray vegetable versions of Holmes and Watson, respectively, in order to teach a lesson on friendship.

==Video games==
Everett Kaser has published a series of free reflection games (puzzles) with names referring to Sherlock Holmes stories: ''Sherlock: The Game of Logic'', ''Dinner with Moriarty'', ''Watson&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Map'', ''Baker Street'', ''Scotland Yard'' ''Inspector Lestrade'', ''Mrs. Hudson'', ''Reichenbach Falls'', ''Queen's Gambit'', ''Mycroft&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Map''. Sherlock Holmes, however, does not appear in the games, except some very small icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaser.com/sherwin.html |title=Sherlock |website=Everett Kaser Software |access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Midnight Mysteries: Haunted Houdini'' a hidden-object/puzzle video game released in 2012 by [[MumboJumbo]], Sherlock Holmes is on the suspects list.

In ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'', released in [[Japan]] in 2015, Holmes briefly appears in the Camelot singularity. Then he appears in the Shinjuku singularity as an ally. He is a Ruler class servant. 

==Successors of Sherlock Holmes==
These stories treat Sherlock Holmes as an historical character but concern themselves with one of his successors — biological or spiritual — who usually take after him in some way, e.g. being good detectives.

===Film===
In the 1977 spoof ''[[The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It]]'', [[John Cleese]] plays Arthur Sherlock Holmes, grandson of the famous sleuth, alongside Watson's grandson, played by [[Arthur Lowe]].

===TV===
''[[The Adventures of Shirley Holmes]]'' is the story of the teenage Anglo-Canadian grandniece of Sherlock Holmes, Shirley, who after discovering some of Sherlock Holmes' effects (which he had concealed to ensure that only a fitting successor of similar intellect would find them), goes on to solve many crimes and mysteries with the assistance of her male Watson-like friend, Bo Sawchuk. She also has a Moriarty-like arch-enemy in the form of Molly Hardy.

===Manga/Anime===
In ''[[Hidan no Aria]]'' series, the character Aria Holmes Kanzake is the descendant of Sherlock Holmes. ''[[Tantei Opera Milky Holmes]]'' has four protagonists named after famous literary detectives, and they even adopt the iconic deerstalker into their uniform.

==Holmes-inspired characters==

===Print===
[[August Derleth]]'s Holmes-inspired sleuth [[Solar Pons]] is an obvious and early homage to Holmes. Derleth began to write the stories in 1928 after asking permission of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to continue the series of Sherlock Holmes stories (it was denied). The first collection of Pons stories was published in 1948, and Derleth's stories are contained in 13 additional books, several published after his death in 1971. [[Basil Copper]] continued the Pons series with an additional eight books, the most recent published in 2005.

The protagonist of [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''. Friar William of [[The Hound of the Baskervilles|Baskerville]] and his novice Adso (who, like Watson, is the narrator), are patterned on Holmes and Watson. William of Baskerville is physically similar to Holmes, has the habit of addressing his companion with "My dear Adso" and the story itself is about a strictly rational brain following a path of investigation of a seemingly inexplicable chain of violent deaths.

[[Poul Anderson]] wrote several stories in which characters modelled themselves on Holmes, including "The Martian Crown Jewels", "The Queen of Air and Darkness", and "The Adventure of the Misplaced Hound".

In [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'' (1966), one of the characters is a computer, a model "HOLMES IV", which adopts the name Mycroft, after Sherlock Holmes' brother.

[[Julian Symons]] created a character named Sheridan Haynes, an actor immersed in the role of Holmes for an epic project to adapt the entire canon for television (almost ten years before [[Jeremy Brett]] took up a similar challenge), in the 1975 novel ''A Three Pipe Problem''. Haynes finds himself confusing his own identity with Holmes', and becomes involved in a mystery. The character returned for a 1988 sequel, ''The Kentish Manor Murders'', and Symons also wrote a Holmes short story pastiche.

Thomas Brace Haughey wrote a series of six novels "in the best tradition of Holmes and Watson" from 1978-1986 with Geoffrey Weston as the Sherlock character (and a descendant of Mycroft Holmes) and John Taylor as his Watson, living at 31 Baker Street.  These stories, ''The Case of the Invisible Thief'', ''The Case of the Frozen Scream'', ''The Case of the Maltese Treasure'', ''The Case of the Kidnapped Shadow'', ''The Case of the Hijacked Moon'', and ''The Case of the Unbolted Lightning'', are all deeply imbued with an Evangelical Christian outlook.

[[Michael Chabon]]'s novella ''[[The Final Solution (novel)|The Final Solution]]'' (2004) features an unnamed protagonist that is likely a retired Holmes.  The story takes place during [[World War II]], and features the Holmes character investigating the appearance of a mute boy with a [[parrot]] who repeatedly calls a string of seemingly random numbers in German.  References to Holmes are plentiful: the protagonist is a [[Beekeeping|bee keeper]], is familiar with detectives in [[London]], and smokes a pipe.  The title simultaneously refers to the Nazi plan for genocide hinted at in the book and mirrors one of Doyle's own shorts, "[[The Adventure of the Final Problem|The Final Problem]]".

[[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Charles Hamilton]] under the pseudonym Peter Todd wrote almost 100 short parodies of the Holmes short stories from 1915 onwards. The characters became Herlock Sholmes and Dr Jotson, living in a Shaker Street apartment; and the sophisticated deductive reasoning of the original became absurdity in the spoofs, which were mainly published in a range of boys' comics of the period (''The Greyfriars Herald, The Magnet, The Gem'', etc.). Although satirical and often mocking contemporary mores (and World War I shortages), the stories had a real feel for the dialogue and structure of the originals. They were all reprinted in ''The Complete Casebook of Herlock Sholmes'' (Hawk Books 1989).

===Film===

[[Douglas Fairbanks]] played a cocaine-addicted Holmes spoof named "Coke Enneday" in ''[[The Mystery of the Leaping Fish]]'' (1916).  Many of this "scientific" detective's possessions are checkered in the Holmes manner, including his detective hat, jacket, and even his car, and whenever he feels momentarily dejected, he nonchalantly extracts yet another syringe from a bandolier on his chest and quickly injects himself with [[cocaine]], laughing in merriment as an immediate result.

In 1924, comedian [[Buster Keaton]] made ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', about a film projectionist who dreams of becoming a great detective.

The 1971 film ''[[They Might Be Giants (movie)|They Might Be Giants]]'', adapted from [[James Goldman]]'s 1961 British stage play of the same name, featured [[George C. Scott]] as a widowed judge named Justin Playfair who imagines himself to be Holmes. When his brother seeks to have him committed, he is brought to Dr. Mildred Watson ([[Joanne Woodward]]).

In ''[[The Return of the World's Greatest Detective]]'' (1976 TV movie) a rather ineffectual [[Los Angeles]] [[police officer|cop]], and avid fan of Sherlock Holmes, named ''Sherman Holmes'' (played by American actor [[Larry Hagman]]) suffers a brain injury when his parked [[motorcycle]] tips over and falls onto his [[Human head|head]] (he was lying beside it, reading). He wakes with both the unshakeable delusion that he is Sherlock Holmes and that he possesses all of Holmes' incredible deductive abilities. His friend and case-worker, Dr. Joan Watson ([[Jenny O'Hara]]), moves him to Apartment B of 221 Baker Street, where he becomes involved in the murder of an embezzler.  [[Nicholas Colasanto]] also stars as Lt. Tinker, Holmes' former superior, who is in charge of the murder investigation. Reviewers of the day pointed out parallels to ''[[They Might Be Giants]].''

The 1986 Soviet comedy ''[[:ru:Мой нежно любимый детектив|My Dearly Beloved Detective]]'' features two women (Shirley Holmes and Jane Watson) opening a private detective agency in London, to the displeasure of Scotland Yard at the competitors. Sherlock Holmes is fictional in the setting.

''[[Zero Effect]]'', loosely based on the Sherlock Holmes story "[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]", features [[Bill Pullman]] as Daryl Zero, a neurotic detective who is only in his element when on a case, and [[Ben Stiller]] as Watson-like assistant Steve Arlo. Set in modern [[Portland, Oregon]], the search for a shady businessman's lost keys reveals a plot involving murder, blackmail, and secret identities. Instead of [[cocaine]], Zero's occasional need for mental stimulation leads to experimentation with the drug [[Mescaline]]. In the film, Zero indicates that he has mastered his technique of "Observation and Objectivity" – or as he calls them, "The Two Obs".

Sherlock Holmes also inspired [[Satyajit Ray]], an [[India]]n film maker, to create the character Pradosh Mitter.  Mitter, affectionately called [[Feluda]], was immensely popular in Bengal.  Feluda used the method of deduction to solve his cases, most of which were set in Calcutta.  Ray even made some movies with Feluda as hero, including ''[[Sonar Kella]]'' (''The Golden Fortress'').  Additionally, the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer Saradindu Bandyopadhyay also had a detective named [[Byomkesh Bakshi]], which had some resemblance to Doyle's Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://byomkesh.com/2010/01/17/byomkesh-v-sherlock/ |title=Comparing Byomkesh Bakshi to Sherlock Holmes &amp;#124; Byomkesh.com – ব্যোমকেশ.কম |publisher=Byomkesh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many ways Bakshi was different from the "drug-addict" bachelor image that Holmes had. Bakshi was married and had few addictions except that of a cigarette. In many ways, Byomkesh's character was distinctly different from that of Holmes. However both used deductions and were astute observers. In their character portrayal though the biggest difference lies. The frequently brooding trait in Holmes' character was not found in the cheerful portrayal of Byomkesh Bakshi. The adventures of Bakshi was later developed into a television series that was aired in [[Doordarshan]], India's premier TV channel during those times, in the early 1990s. The series featuring Rajit Kapoor as Byomkesh Bakshi, telecast on the Doordarshan, inspired a lot of Indians to read the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and re-read the works of Saradindu Bandyopadhyay.

===TV===
[[Sherlock Hemlock]] is a [[muppet]] character based on Sherlock Holmes, who appears on the American children's programme ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

The highly popular ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' featured an entire episode circling around the death of a man who held 'mystery nights' with a group of friends in which they roleplayed as Holmes characters and solved invented crimes; his basement was an exact replica of Sherlock Holmes' 221B Baker Street parlour, and he emulated everything Holmes did in the books – from his smoking to his cocaine addiction. The episode was called "Who Shot Sherlock?" CSI is also notable for the lead character, [[Gil Grissom]], whose personality and methods often parallel those of Holmes.

The pilot episode of the well-remembered series, ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', starring Angela Lansbury, aired on 30 September 1984. The story had to do with her character, mystery writer Jessica Fletcher, searching out the murderer of Caleb McCallum (played by Brian Keith) who is killed at a masquerade party where he is dressed in deerstalker cap and cape-coat. It was titled "The Murder of Sherlock Holmes".

Andy Breckman, head writer of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', admitted to copying [[Adrian Monk]] from Conan Doyle "almost as if I used a [[Xerox]] machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40612FF3A5F0C708DDDA90994DA404482 |title=TV's Damaged Detectives Are Sherlock's Children |date=October 13, 2002 |publisher=The New York Times |author=Hinson, Hal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animation===
In [[Warner Bros.]] long-running ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon show, [[Daffy Duck]] did a turn as "Dorlock Holmes" in the episode "Deduce, You Say",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049131/|title=Deduce, You Say|author=|date=29 September 1956|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; first shown in 1956. In this episode, Dorlock Holmes (festooned in deerstalker cap and residing on Beeker Street) and his assistant Watkins (played by [[Porky Pig]]) must track down the Shropshire Slasher.

Several [[Dick Tracy]] animated cartoons centre around a white bulldog, helmeted like a London bobby, named '''Hemlock Holmes'''.

[[Sherlock Holmes]] is extremely popular in [[Japan]], and was an inspiration for the [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] and [[manga]], ''[[Case Closed (manga)|Case Closed]]'' (''Detective Conan'' in Japan), where the main character, [[Jimmy Kudo]] (Shin'ichi Kudo), takes his pseudonym, Conan Edogawa, from two detective fiction authors, [[Edogawa Rampo]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Incidentally [[Edogawa Rampo]] took his name from [[Edgar Allan Poe]], the American writer known as the 'Father' of detective fiction.

===Video games===
The Other Guys has released in 2016 an app called ''Sherlock Holmes: Lost Detective''. Divided into two seasons, the main character is a young Scotland Yard agent; in this game there is a professor of English literature claiming to be Sherlock Holmes. Originally for iOS and Android, at present time can be found only on iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/sherlock-holmes-lost-detective/id971889003?mt=8 |title=Sherlock Holmes: Lost Detective |website=iTunes |access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Doctor Watson: Mystery Cases'' (also ''Doctor Watson: Treasure Island'') and ''Doctor Watson 2: The Riddle of the Catacombs'' are two casual games (hidden object games with 3D capabilities) released by German software house UIG in which the main character is loosely inspired by the original Watson. Holmes himself, however, does not appear.

SecretBuilders Games has released in 2018 a casual game, ''Dr. Watson Mysteries - Hidden Objects Game'', where the protagonist is Dr. Watson, not Sherlock Holmes, but it features many Conan Doyle's stories such as ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'', ''The Valley of Fear'', ''The Speckled Band'', ''The Silver Blaze'', ''The Musgrave Ritual'', ''The Gloria Scott'', and ''The Copper Beeches''.

===Audio===
''[[The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra]]'' is a comedy album created by [[The Firesign Theatre]] featuring Hemlock Stones and Flotsam.

[[File:Husse fcm.jpg|thumb|A chair fitted with a black slipcover]]
A '''slipcover''' (also called '''loose cover''') is a fitted protective cover that may be slipped off and on a piece of [[upholstery|upholstered]] furniture. Slipcovers are usually made of cloth. Slipcovers slip on and off, they come fresh, and may be removed for seasonal change, cleaning, moving, or storage.

Slipcovers are sometimes defined as "clothing for furniture." Indeed, they are tailored just as clothing is, and are fitted loosely or snugly to the taste of the owner or tailor. Some people order furniture upholstered in plain [[muslin]] with the intention of using slipcovers only.

==History==

In the days before home air conditioning was available, it was common to put slipcovers on upholstered furniture in the hot months of the year to protect the upholstery fabric from sweat, and slipcover tailors offered clear [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]], or plastic slipcovers. These clear plastic slipcovers were available in large department stores such as [[Jordan Marsh]] or were custom made by artisans.

In some cities in the northeast U.S., slipcover tailors were sometimes given the nickname "summertime millionaires" as their busy season was in the spring and summer.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Custom slipcovering was done then, each one cut and sewn to order.

In the 1960s, technology and production techniques made it possible to manufacture furniture that could be sold at prices at or below the price of a custom-made slipcover, and the practice of custom slipcovering for a time declined.

In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in custom slipcovering driven by the interior design industry and the popularity of the very casual [[shabby chic]] design style.

==Technology and materials==
As this new "looser" fitting style of slipcovers do not always require custom tailoring, some furniture manufacturers are beginning to offer "ready made" slipcovers.

Ready made, generic fit slipcovers are available at many mainstream retailers that sell linens (sheets). With these generic fit slipcovers, some effort is required to maintain a tailored look of a slipcover applied to a couch or loveseat, as usage of the furniture will pull at the edges of the slipcover, which are simply tucked under the cushions, all of one piece.

Custom fitted slipcovers can resemble upholstery in their fit. They are fabricated to the exact shape of the furniture. Custom slipcovers have cushions slipcovered separately from the frame. 

Techniques can be used to make a slipcover that will not shift and require re-tucking after every use. Slipcovers with elasticized bottom means that there are no straps needed to secure it in place and it stays exactly where you want it to without shifting or moving.

Slipcover material is usually stretchable fabric, [[polyester]] blend (polyester, [[cotton]] and [[elastane]]). Bi-elastic fabric can be stretched both vertically and horizontally for a perfect fit.Strings or ribbons are used to keep the cover in place.

Slipcover fabrication is a specialty offered by slipcover makers. Some [[upholsterer]]s and [[drapery]] workrooms will also make slipcovers.

==Industry==
Slipcovering skills are revived every generation by new groups that tend to change in characteristics over decades.  Slipcover arts were once a close guarded secrets.

One constant is the [[cottage industry]] aspect, slipcovers are easily made by small groups, in the home or home based businesses.  Historically a lower wage occupation, division of labor tended on gender lines, slipcover sewers were often not taught or expected to cut.

Today, the trend is for more educated populations, more of them women, to choose this cottage industry product as a profession.  Each one person business tends to all the steps of the marketing and manufacturing.

These one-person businesses may jointly market their services.  The World Wide Web has contributed to the survival of slipcovering, slipcover artists have found one another in this way, through networks or professional listings.  Slipcover knowledge lately has been pooled and shared through this source.

The production of clear vinyl slipcovers, however, is not as great as it used to be. Modern upholstery fabrics are more durable;&lt;ref name="what-fabric-plumbs"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.plumbs.co.uk/find-inspiration/blog/be-inspired-by/what-fabric-when-buying-loose-covers/| title= What fabric?| publisher=Plumbs | accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are both more resistant to dirt and easier to clean. Many upholstery fabrics can in fact be washed in cold water without harm. Transparent vinyl slipcovers, although beautiful to look at, are often very uncomfortable to sit on, particularly on hot summer days. These days, it is almost impossible to get clear vinyl slipcovers without having to have them custom made.

The '''taboo on the dead''' includes the [[taboo]] against touching of the dead and those surrounding them; the taboo against mourners of the dead; and the taboo against anything associated with the dead.

==The taboo on mourners==

Among the [[Shuswaps]] of [[British Columbia]] widows and widowers in mourning are secluded and forbidden to touch their own head or body; the cups and cooking vessels which they use may be used by no one else. [...] No hunter would come near such mourners, for their presence is unlucky. If their shadow were to fall on anyone, he would be taken ill at once. They employ thorn-bushes for bed and pillow, in order to keep away the ghost of the deceased; and thorn bushes are also laid all around their beds.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer (1990, 142), quoting Boas (1890 [643f.]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Agutainos]], who inhabit [[Palawan]], the [[Philippines]], a widow may not leave her hut for seven or eight days after the death; and even then she may only go out at an hour when is not likely to meet anybody, for whoever looks upon her dies a sudden death. To prevent this fatal catastrophe, the widow knocks with a wooden peg on the trees as she goes along, thus warning people of her dangerous proximity; and the very trees on which she knocks soon die."&lt;ref&gt;Frazer (1990, 144), quoting Blumentritt (1891, 182).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The taboo against naming the dead==
A taboo against naming the dead is a kind of [[word taboo]] whereby the name of a recently deceased person, and any other words similar to it in sound, may not be uttered. It is observed by peoples from all over the world, including [[Australian Aborigines|Australia]],&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=Pam|last2=Phillips|first2=Emma|title=Australian findings on Aboriginal cultural practices associated with clothing, hair, possessions and use of name of deceased persons|journal=International Journal of Nursing Practice|date=2008|volume=14|issue=1|pages=57–66|doi=10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00667.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siberia]], [[Southern India]] and the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref name="Frazer 1922, 3"&gt;Frazer (1922, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

Among the [[Guaycurus]] of [[Paraguay]], when a death had taken place, the chief used to change the name of every member of the tribe; and from that moment everybody remembered his new name just as if he had borne it all his life.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer (1990, 357).&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[Yolngu]] man named Bitjingu died, the word ''bithiwul'' "no; nothing" was avoided.&lt;ref name="Dixon"&gt;Dixon (2002, 27).&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, a [[synonym]] or a [[loanword]] from another language would be used for a certain period, after which the original word could be used again; but in some cases the replacement word would continue to be used.

In some [[Australian Aboriginal avoidance practices|Australian Aboriginal cultural practices]], the dead are not referred to by their name directly as a  mark of respect. In [[Pitjantjatjara]], for instance, it is common to refer to a recently deceased person as 'kunmanara', which means "what's his name". Often, the person's last name can still be used. The avoidance period may last anywhere from 12 months to several years, depending on how important or famous the person was. The person can still be referred to in a roundabout way, such as "that old lady" or by generic [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin type]] but not by first name. Other reasons may include not making mockery of that person and keeping respect with regard to them.&lt;ref name=McGrath/&gt;

===Prevention===
The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] of [[East Africa]] resort to the device of changing the dead person's name immediately after their death; the person may then be mentioned freely under the new name while all the restrictions remain attached to the old one. They assume that the dead person will not know their new name, and so will not answer to it when hearing it pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer (1990, 354–355).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] and [[Ramindjeri]] tribes of South Australia, the repugnance to mentioning the names of those who have died lately is carried so far that persons who bear the same name as the deceased abandon it, and either adopt temporary names or are known by any others that happen to belong to them.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer (1922, 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punishment===
The taboo had been enforced with extreme severity in some cultures.

Among the [[Wayuu people|Guajiro]] of [[Colombia]] to mention the dead before their kin is a dreadful offence, which is often punished with death; for if it happens on the rancho of the deceased, in presence of a nephew or uncle, they will assuredly kill the offender on the spot if they can. But if they escape, the penalty resolves itself into a heavy fine, usually of two or more oxen.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer (1922, 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on language===
[[R. M. W. Dixon]] has suggested, in reference to [[Australian Aboriginal languages]], that the substitution of loanwords for tabooed words results in significant vocabulary replacement, hindering the application of the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; Other linguists find the effects of the taboo on vocabulary replacement to be insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;Alpher &amp; Nash (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans (June 2005, 258–261).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (2004, 34).&lt;/ref&gt;

Goddard (1979) also suggests upon finding evidence of name-taboos of the deceased in [[Tonkawa language|Tonkawa]] similar to Australian languages, the languages of the North American Southeast may have resisted classification into language families so far due in part to vocabulary replacement (in addition to their already sparse documentation).

==Origins and causes==

[[Sigmund Freud]] explains that the fundamental reason for the existence of such taboos is the fear of the presence or of the return of the dead person's ghost. It is exactly this fear that leads to a great number of ceremonies aimed at keeping the ghost at a distance or driving him off.&lt;ref&gt;Freud (1950, 57).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tuaregs]] of [[Sahara]], for example, dread the return of the dead man's spirit so much that "[they] do all they can to avoid it by shifting their camp after a death, ceasing for ever to pronounce the name of the departed, and eschewing everything that might be regarded as an evocation or recall of his soul. Hence they do not, like the Arabs, designate individuals by adding to their personal names the names of their fathers. [...] they give to every man a name which will live and die with him."&lt;ref name="Frazer 1922, 3"/&gt; In many cases the taboo remains intact until the body of the dead has completely decayed,&lt;ref&gt;Freud (1990, 372).&lt;/ref&gt; but until then the community must disguise itself so that the ghost shall not recognize them. For example, the [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar Islanders]] try to disguise themselves by shaving their heads.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer (1922, 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]] associates the taboo to a fear that the dead man's soul has become a [[demon]].&lt;ref&gt;Freud (1950, 58), quoting Wundt (1906, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many cases show a hostility toward the dead and their representation as malevolent figures.&lt;ref&gt;Freud (1950, 58).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Westermarck]] notes that "Death is commonly regarded as the gravest of all misfortunes; hence the dead are believed to be exceedingly dissatisfied with their fate [...] such a death naturally tends to make the soul revengeful and ill-tempered. It is envious of the living and is longing for the company of its old friend."&lt;ref&gt;Freud (1950, 59), quoting Westermarck (1906&amp;ndash;8, '''2''', 534f.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Testerian catechisms '''(Spanish: ''Catecismos testerianos'') are religious documents used in the evangelization of the New Spain.

'''''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|ゼルダの伝説 ムジュラの仮面 3D|Zeruda no Densetsu: Mujura no Kamen 3D}} in Japanese}} is an [[action-adventure game]] co-developed by [[Grezzo]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[handheld game console]]. The game is an enhanced [[remaster]] of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'', which was originally released for the [[Nintendo 64]] [[Home video game console|home console]] in 2000. The game was released worldwide in February 2015, coinciding with the North American and European releases of the [[New Nintendo 3DS]].

==Gameplay==
{{see also|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask#Gameplay}}

Much like its predecessor, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D]]'', ''Majora's Mask 3D'' is a remaster of the original ''Majora's Mask'' game, featuring enhanced [[stereoscopic 3D]] graphics, touchscreen controls, and gyroscopic features. Like the original, the game follows [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]]. Link is given only three days to save the land of Termina from being crushed by its moon, using various abilities obtained by wearing different masks. In addition, Nintendo changed the time mechanic of the original game, giving the player more time to explore, and added fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/11/14/legend-zelda-majoras-mask-3d-changes-boss-fights-adds-fishing/|title=The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D Changes Up Boss Fights, Adds Fishing|work=Siliconera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{main|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask#Plot}}
The game stars [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' and takes place several months after the conclusion of that game. The game begins with Link riding his faithful horse Epona deep into the woods, in search of his lost friend [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]]. After chasing a masked [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Skull Kid|Skull Kid]] who stole his [[Ocarina]], Link finds himself trapped in the parallel world of Termina, where he discovers that the moon will crash into the surface in three days' time and destroy the world. With the aid of his new fairy friend Tatl, Link must travel across Termina, wake the sleeping Four Giants to stop the moon's descent, and defeat Skull Kid and the mask possessing him. To do this, Link must acquire a series of strange masks to grant himself new abilities and aid the people of Termina, as well as using his ocarina to alter and travel through time and repeat the three-day cycle.

==Development==
''The Legend of Zelda'' series producer [[Eiji Aonuma]] and co-developers [[Grezzo]] had started the development of ''Majora's Mask 3D'' immediately after the release of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D|Ocarina of Time 3D]]'', in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maiberg|first1=Emanuel|title=The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D Isn't "Just Another Remake," Nintendo Says|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-3d-isnt-just-anot/1100-6423470/|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=November 9, 2014|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project itself, however, was put under wraps for the greater part of its development, with Aonuma and others involved with its development neither confirming or denying the existence of the game, but rather, suggesting that a ''Majora's Mask'' [[Video game remake|remake]] was "not an impossibility", depending on interest and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/118/1184015p1.html | title=Majora's Mask Remake is a Possibility | first=Keza| last=MacDonald| date=July 25, 2011 | publisher=IGN | accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Moonfall===
Following the release of ''Ocarina of Time 3D'', a fan campaign called Operation Moonfall was launched to prompt Nintendo and Grezzo to remake ''Majora's Mask'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]], in vein of ''Ocarina of Time 3D''.&lt;ref name="moonfall"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/operation-moonfall-plans-to-get-majora-s-mask-on-3ds-207344.phtml | title=Operation Moonfall plans to get Majora's Mask on 3DS | first=Jim | last=Sterling | date=July 28, 2011 | publisher=[[Destructoid]] | accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign name is a reference to a similar fan-based movement, [[Operation Rainfall]], set up to persuade [[Nintendo of America]] to release a trio of [[role-playing video game]]s for the [[Wii]].&lt;ref name="moonfall"/&gt; The petition reached 10,000 signatures within five days.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In response to the feedback, Nintendo of America released a statement: "At the risk of dampening the excitement you feel, I must be clear that no official announcements have been made regarding a remake of ''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'' for the Nintendo 3DS. However, we like hearing what our consumers find important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeldainformer.com/2011/07/operation-moonfall-update-encouraging-response-from-nintendo-of-america.html|work=ZeldaInformer|date=July 29, 2011|title=Operation Moonfall Update: Encouraging Response From Nintendo of America|accessdate=April 27, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007110847/http://www.zeldainformer.com/2011/07/operation-moonfall-update-encouraging-response-from-nintendo-of-america.html|archivedate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[GamesRadar]] in November 2011, Aonuma acknowledged Operation Moonfall, and told fans that he hopes to respond to their request sometime in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/zelda-past-and-future-interview-koji-kondo-and-eiji-aonuma/?page=2|work=GamesRadar|date=November 9, 2011|title=Zelda, past and future: An interview with Koji Kondo and Eiji Aonuma|quote=Eiji Aonuma: I did hear that there's a website here that was launched in North America by some people that are hoping we'll release a 3D version of Majora's Mask.

'''''The Tall Man''''' is a half-hour American [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] about Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] and the gunfighter [[Billy the Kid]] that aired seventy-five episodes on [[NBC]] from 1960 to 1962, filmed by [[Revue Productions]]. It was also &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinanews.com/tp/hd2011/2012/09-21/U399P4T426D134544F16470DT20120921103210.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; theatrically released and dubbed in [[North Korea]] in the 1960s.

The series is set in the late 1870s and early 1880s, and also depicts other figures of the period, such as [[John Tunstall]] and [[Lew Wallace]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:Pat Garrett2.jpg|left|thumb|125px|The real [[Pat Garrett]]]]
''The Tall Man'' stars 6'3" [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], and [[Clu Gulager]] as [[Billy the Kid]].    Gulager was 32 in 1960, 11 years older than Billy the Kid was at the time of his death in 1881 at the age of 21.  The highly fictionalized series provides a more humane image of the Kid than has history itself.  In real life Garrett eventually shot Billy dead in a night-time ambush at a farmhouse in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico|Fort Sumner]], [[New Mexico]], but no concluding episode depicting the grim conclusion was filmed.  Set in and about [[Lincoln, New Mexico]], the series opens with a view of the extremely long shadow cast by Sullivan on a Western street, hence the name "the tall man".

In the premiere episode, "Garrett and the Kid" (September 10, 1960), Garrett arrives in Lincoln, depicted in the series as a gold-mining [[boomtown]], as the new deputy sheriff, only to learn that a crooked saloon owner, Paul Mason ([[Robert Middleton]]), dominates the community, including the marshal, Dave Leggert ([[Denver Pyle]]). When he sees his power threatened, Mason tries to hire Billy to kill Garrett, unaware that the two were then on friendly terms. [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] is cast in this episode as Judge Riley, and [[King Donovan]] appears as a Mason henchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717585/|title=Garrett and the Kid|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marianna Hill]] was cast in several episodes as one of Billy's girlfriends, Rita. In one episode, [[Robert Lansing (actor)|Robert Lansing]] played the frontier dentist, gambler, and gunfighter [[Doc Holliday|John H. "Doc" Holliday]].

==Selected episodes==

[[Andy Clyde]] was cast in five episodes as Pa McBeam; [[Judy Nugent]] plays McBean's daughter, June. Different actress were cast as the other daughter, May. [[Olive Sturgess]] played the part of May in "McBean Rides Again", "The Reluctant Bridegroom", and "Millionaire McBean."In "The Reluctant Bridegroom" (February 18, 1961), [[Ellen Corby]] is featured as Hannah Blossom, a potential [[mail order bride]], for Pa McBeam. Hannah is lured to Lincoln through a fraudulent letter written by the McBeam daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717626/|title="The Reluctant Bridegroom", February 18, 1961|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In "Substitute Sheriff" (January 6, 1962), the McBeam daughters enlist their father as an acting sheriff in a scheme to thwart the seizure of their property for right-of-way by the railroad.  [[Bob Hastings]] appears in this episode as J. S. Chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717606/|title="Substitute Sheriff", January 6, 1962|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Clyde also appeared at the time in the role of the neighboring farmer George MacMichael on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', starring [[Walter Brennan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167395/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|title=Andy Clyde|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Reversed Blade" (February 4, 1961), [[Murray Matheson]] portrays Billy's employer, John Tundall, though the name of the historical person is [[John Tunstall]]. Tundall grows indignant when the con-man Ben Webster ([[John Archer (actor)|John Archer]]), who stole his wife and $10,000 eight years earlier, arrives in Lincoln. [[Jeanne Cooper]] plays Tundall's former wife, now Mrs. Elmira Webster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717627/|title="The Reversed Blade", February 4, 1961|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Tunstall died at twenty-four, but Matheson was forty-nine when he assumed the role as Billy's employer.

Two episodes focus on visits to Lincoln by [[governor of New Mexico|Governor]] [[Lew Wallace]] of the [[New Mexico Territory]]. In "The Great Western" (June 3, 1961), [[Frank Ferguson]] plays Wallace in a story about Big Mamacita ([[Connie Gilchrist]]), the owner of a rowdy cantina outside Lincoln and her grandson, who is a Wallace aide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717614/|title="The Great Western", June 3, 1962|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Black Robe" (May 5, 1962), Robert Burton plays Governor Wallace. In the story line, after the fall of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]], a [[France|French]] foreign agent is supplying arms to the [[Mescalero Apache|Mescalero]] [[Apache people|Apaches]] in a murky plot to reoccupy [[Mexico]]. [[Chief Yowlachie]] is cast as "The Great Chief"; [[Slim Pickens]] as Starr, and [[Martin Landau]] as Father Gueschim, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717608/|title="The Black Robe", May 5, 1962|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Landau had previously appeared in the Season 1 episode "Dark Moment" (Feb 11, 1961) as Francisco Valdez.)

In "The Cloudbusters" (April 29, 1961), [[Frank de Kova]] plays Mike Gray Eagle, who sells water to Lincoln residents at inflated prices during a [[drought]], during which the only flowing stream is on the Apache reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717609/|title="The Cloudbusters", April 29, 1961|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Death or Taxes" (May 27, 1961), Garrett rides into a railroad [[company town]] that abuses its workers, runs illegal gambling halls, and refuses to pay its taxes.

==Background==
When Senthil Nathan ([[R. S. Manohar]]) steals some precious diamonds, one henchman turns traitor and decamps with the booty. The man is killed, but the diamonds are not found. A Victoria driver is wrongly sentenced to life, since he was the last man to be seen with the dead man. Here, two crooks get the scent of the diamonds. The driver's daughter Rani ([[Jayalalithaa]]) too, is poised to prove her father's innocence. Senthil Nathan's son Raja ([[Jaishankar]]) too, joins the forces after learning her true nature. Will the weird team find the diamonds? What surprises does everybody have in store for them?

==Plot==
Senthil Nathan ([[R. S. Manohar]]) is a rich businessman, revered by his son Raja ([[Jaishankar]]) and society. In reality he is the leader of a smuggling gang. As a trusted member of society. He gets all information, while his gang executes his plans. However, during one such robbery, a gang member turns greedy and flees with the diamonds. Senthil Nathan sends another man to retrieve the diamonds and kill the traitors. The traitor ([[S. V. Ramadoss]]) is killed, but the killer too flees with the diamonds. A furious Senthil Nathan sends some henchman to kill the traitor and retrieve the diamonds. The henchman ([[Sreekanth]]) corners and kills the traitor, but later has succeeded in hiding the diamonds somewhere. Meanwhile, a Victoria driver ([[S. V. Sahasranamam]]) of the eponymous, Victoria, who was found near the dead body is arrested based on circumstantial evidence.

Somewhere else, two old golden-hearted crooks, Durai (M. R. R. Vasu) and Sami ([[S. A. Ashokan]]) are to be released. Durai had an infant son who was kidnapped from a park. To date, Durai doesn't know who kidnapped him or whether his son is even alive. The duo want to spend the rest of their lives as good, respected men. The plan is short-lived when they find themselves on the trail of the diamonds. Soon they learn about the Victoria and realise that no one has got a scent of the missing diamonds. To get closer to the Victoria, they pose as distant cousins of the Victoria driver, who are reluctantly admitted inside by the driver's elder daughter Rani ([[Jayalalithaa]]), who soon starts acting suspicious. During the day, Rani rides the Victoria, posing as a man.

She slips out of the home. One day Durai and Sami follow her to the house of a man unknown to them, Senthil Nathan and a henchman named Victor ([[Sreekanth]]). They are shocked to see Rani seducing him. But when Victor tries to rape her, the duo saves her. On accosting her, she says that the man was loitering suspiciously near the Victoria when her father was arrested. Before they can learn anything from him. he is shot dead. On learning the Victoria drivers' story, the duo decide to do a good turn. They tell Rani the whole truth, but a shocked Rani doesn't have a clue about the location of the diamonds. Even after tearing the Victoria apart, nothing is found. Meanwhile, Rani falls in love with Raja ([[Jaishankar]]). Whom she met while posing as a cab driver. she tries to woo him posing as a rich lady. A plan which works well.

However, Raja learns the truth and decides to marry her. Despite knowing about her father. Raja also meets Durai and Sami, where upon he gets suspicious of the duo. Here Senthil Nathan objects to Raja's relationship with Rani. Later, Raja learns of his father's true nature and leaves him. After meeting Rani, Durai and Sami tell the truth to him too. The quartet decide to find the diamonds. Senthil Nathan kidnaps Rani on learning that she is the daughter of Shankaralingam, the Victoria driver. Later, Raja, Durai and Sami are also kidnapped and tortured. During the deal, Senthil Nathan's drinks are being served on an ornate tray with a fake Victoria headlamp attached to it. Sami realises that the diamonds are hidden in the Victoria's lamp. He buys time for himself and old buddy and they go to retrieve the diamonds. The duo turn up at Senthil Nathan's den, where they manage to create confusion by luring the gang members to the diamonds.

Senthil Nathan is embarrassed to see that not one member of his gang is loyal to him. During the melee, another twist occurs where an old henchman of Senthil Nathan reveals that Raja isn't Senthil Nathan's son. Senthil Nathan had ordered the henchman to steal somebody's child, because Senthil Nathan's father had threatened to disown him. Senthil Nathan could have prevented the situation only by proving that Senthil Nathan fathered the child. In the end, Senthil Nathan and his remaining cronies are arrested and Rani's father is set free. After being reunited with his son and his would be daughter-in-law, Durai decides to settle down. However, Sami decides that his destiny might have written something else for him and leaves. Soon Durai spots a Burka-clad woman who is actually Sami.

'''Zorica Jevremović''' (in 1970s: Jevremović-Munitić; {{IPA-sh|zôritsa jeʋrěːmoʋitɕ mǔnititɕ|sr}}; born August 22, 1948 in [[Ražanj]], [[Serbia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]) is a Serbian theatre and video director, playwright, choreographer, intermedia theorist (film, television, animated film, comic strip), literary historian and feminist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czkd.org/czkd-arhiva/programi.php?id=251&amp;lang=sr „Zorica Jevremović: Kopile (1948-1968), drama utopije“] (o predstavi), Centar za kulturnu dekontaminaciju, Belgrade, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work also includes that of a dramaturge in alternative and informal theatrical and film groups.

She is director of the Belgrade Centre for Media "Ranko Munitić" and the editor of a regional journal for media and culture ''Mediantrop''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediantrop.rankomunitic.org/index.php/urednistvo/glavna-urednica „Editor-in-chief“], ''Mediantrop'', Belgrade.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband was a prominent Yugoslav cultural worker and media theorist [[Ranko Munitić]].

==Biography==
She was born by post-war circumstances in Ražanj, but she was raised in [[Belgrade]] from the earliest childhood.

She met Ranko Munitić at the amateur film festival "Mala Pula", on 24 June 1968. The two of them married in Belgrade on 1 May 1971, where Zorica added the surname Munitić to hers Jevremović, then they went to Zagreb. In November of the same year, they return to Belgrade, where they lived together until the end of March 2009 (when Munitić died).

She obtained her dramaturgy degree in 1975 at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade.

As an advocate of a common Yugoslav cultural milieu she has undertaken research into the cultural history and theological common law in multinational and/or multiconfessional regions of [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Kosovo]] within former Yugoslavia: [[Dubrovnik]] (1976-1980), [[Perast]] (1981), [[Dečani]] (1985-1989), [[Tacen]] (1982-1985), [[Povlja]] (1985), [[Poljica (Dalmatia)|Poljica]] (1986-1990), [[Zjum]] (1990).

She was active as a dramaturge in the following key alternative and informal theatre and film groups in former Yugoslavia: KPGT (1980-1990), Art-film (1981-1983), Nova osećajnost (1984-1985), Preduzeće za pozorišne poslove (1992).

She edited the following alternative research collections focused on literary history and published in “Književnost” journal: [[Sava Mrkalj]] (1984), [[St. Sava]] and [[Hilandar]] (1988), [[Vatroslav Jagić]] (1990).

She also founded the following alternative theatres that operated as 'neighborhood theatres' in ghettoized communities, in places with no previous history of theatre performances:

:1985: "Performative Children's Street Theater" („Performativno ulično dečije pozorište”) in [[Skadarlija]], the bohemian artists' venue teeming with restaurants in downtown Belgrade. The core of the troupe was made up of [[Romani people|Romani]] children who lived in Skadarlija, 'white' children' from [[Dorćol]] (a nearby prestigious Belgrade neighborhood), Romani children from the favelas of the Belgrade suburb of [[Mirijevo]] (who sell flowers in Skadarlija stolen in city cemeteries), professional actors and painters who live in Skadarlija, a Skadarlija fortune-teller, clowns, fire eaters, and alternative artists (musicians, painters).

:1993-1995: "Pocket Theatre M" („Džepno pozorište M”) on the premises of the "Dr Laza Lazarevic" Psychiatric Clinic. The core of this troupe was made up of convalescents, children from the vicinity of the hospital, professional actors, children of the hospital therapists and psychiatrists, film and television amateur actors, psychologists, models, public figures, and blind persons.

:1997-1999: "WAY 5a" („PUT 5a”), Feminist theatre in an apartment occupied by Autonomous Women's Center Against Sexual Violence. The core of this troupe was made up of women who came to the Center for help, Center activists, ballet dancers, painters, women who lived in the same building, women in wheelchairs, composers, students of Women’s Studies, and women refugees.

Zorica Jevremović has worked with the following marginal groups: Romani children, nuns, psychotics, invalids, blind persons, women who have suffered violence, parentless children, lesbians and women refugees.

At the beginning of the 1990s wars in former Yugoslavia, she was an active member of two anti-war groups: “Civilni pokret otpora” (The Civil Movement for Peace) and “Beogradski krug” (Belgrade Circle), in the framework of which she undertook a number of social-cultural projects.
	
Zorica has also published books on multimedia theory and applied theatre, as well as several books of plays. 
                                 
Her video works have been shown at the following festivals: “Video Medeja” in Novi Sad, Serbia; [[Superfest International Disability Film Festival]] in San Francisco, US; “Alternative - festival film/video” in Belgrade, Serbia, “Bitef polifonija” and the Serbian TV RTS programme “Trezor”, as well as numerous university centres around the world.

She has been a member of the Union of Performing Artists of Serbia since 1978. Since 2007, she has also been a member of the Serbian Writers’ Society.
