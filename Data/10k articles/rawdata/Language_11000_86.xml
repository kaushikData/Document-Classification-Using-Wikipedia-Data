==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Aravind Adiga was born in [[Madras]] (now [[Chennai]])&lt;!--(sic)--&gt; on 23 October 1974 to Dr. K. Madhava Adiga and Usha Adiga, both of whom hailed from [[Mangalore]]. His paternal grandfather was the late [[K. Suryanarayana Adiga]], former chairman of [[Karnataka bank|Karnataka Bank]],&lt;ref name="Booker for KannAdiga"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Oct162008/scroll2008101695497.asp?section=frontpagenews |title=Booker for KannAdiga |date=16 October 2008 |publisher=Deccan Herald |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406015813/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Oct162008/scroll2008101695497.asp?section=frontpagenews |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/16/stories/2008101658160300.htm|title=Karnataka/Mangalore News:Mangaloreans rejoice over aravind adiga's win|date=16 October 2008|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-10-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081020061237/http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/16/stories/2008101658160300.htm| archivedate= 20 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a maternal great-grandfather, [[U.

Muthiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adiga grew up in Mangalore and studied at [[Canara High School]], then at [[St Aloysius' College (Mangalore)|St. Aloysius College]], where he completed his [[SSLC]] in 1990 and secured the first place in his state in SSLC (his elder brother, Anand, had placed second in SSLC and first in PUC in the state).&lt;ref name="origin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alma mater celebrates Adiga's win"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangaloremirror.com/index.aspx?Page=article&amp;sectname=News%20-%20State&amp;sectid=73&amp;contentid=200810152008101519583954559343e3a|title=Almamater celebrates Adiga's win|date=16 October 2008|publisher=Bangalore Mirror|accessdate=2008-10-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081018000442/http://bangaloremirror.com/index.aspx?Page=article&amp;sectname=News%20-%20State&amp;sectid=73&amp;contentid=200810152008101519583954559343e3a| archivedate= 18 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After emigrating to [[Sydney]], Australia, with his family, Aravind studied at [[James Ruse Agricultural High School]].  He later studied English literature at [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], in New York city, under [[Simon Schama]] and graduated as [[salutatorian]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol22/vol22_iss23/record2223.13.html At Last! Commencement For More than 8,900 Today. Columbia University Record.

===Career===
Adiga began his journalistic career as a financial journalist, interning at the ''[[Financial Times]]''.  With pieces published in the ''Financial Times'' and ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'', he covered the stock market and investment, interviewing, amongst others, [[Donald Trump]].  His review of previous Booker Prize winner [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]]'s book, ''[[Oscar and Lucinda]]'', appeared in ''The Second Circle'', an online literary review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesecondcircle.net/arv/care.html The Second Circle] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4fe1hh?url=http://thesecondcircle.net/arv/care.html |date=17 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was subsequently hired by ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', where he remained a [[South Asia]] correspondent for three years before going freelance.&lt;ref&gt;Adiga is the first current or former TIME staffer to win the Man Booker Prize, or its predecessor, the Booker Prize.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this freelance period, he wrote ''The White Tiger''.  Aravind Adiga now lives in [[Mumbai]], [[Maharashtra]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesecondcircle.net/arv/ The second circle] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4fp1OO?url=http://thesecondcircle.net/arv/ |date=17 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booker Prize===
Aravind Adiga's debut novel, ''[[The White Tiger]]'', won the 2008 [[Booker Prize]].  He is the fourth Indian-born author to win the prize, after [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Arundhati Roy]], and [[Kiran Desai]].  ([[V. S. Naipaul]], another winner, is ethnically Indian but was born on the Caribbean island of Trinidad.)  The five other authors on the shortlist included one other Indian writer ([[Amitav Ghosh]]) and another first-time writer ([[Steve Toltz]]).&lt;ref name="First-timers seeking Booker glory "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7606147.stm |title=First-timers seeking Booker glory |date=9 September 2008 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-10-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4feoZv?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7606147.stm |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel studies the contrast between India's rise as a modern global economy and the lead character, Balram, who comes from crushing rural poverty.&lt;ref name="Review: The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga "&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/08/09/boadi109.xml |title=Review: The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga |first=Peter |last=Robins |date=9 August 2008 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=2008-10-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4g4TdB?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2008%2F08%2F09%2Fboadi109.xml |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|At a time when India is going through great changes and, with China, is likely to inherit the world from the West, it is important that writers like me try to highlight the brutal injustices of [Indian] society.  That's what I'm trying to do – it is not an attack on the country, it's about the greater process of self-examination.}}

Adiga explained that "criticism by writers like [[Flaubert]], [[Balzac]] and [[Dickens]] of the 19th century helped England and France become better societies".&lt;ref name="I highlighted India's brutal injustices: Adiga"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/oct/16adiga.htm |title=I highlighted India's brutal injustices: Adiga |date=16 October 2008 |publisher=Rediff |accessdate=2008-10-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4fh1LM?url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/oct/16adiga.htm |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after he won the prize, it was alleged that Adiga had, the previous year, sacked the agent who had secured his contract with [[Atlantic Books]] at the 2007 [[London Book Fair]].&lt;ref name="Booker in pocket, Aravind Adiga sacks agent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/booker-in-pocket-aravind-adiga-sacks-agent/76764-19.html?from=search-relatedstories|title=Booker in pocket, Aravind Adiga sacks agent|date=26 October 2008|publisher=CNN-IBN|accessdate=2008-10-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205183022/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/booker-in-pocket-aravind-adiga-sacks-agent/76764-19.html?from=search-relatedstories| archivedate= 5 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2009, it was announced that the novel would be adapted into a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/uk-ireland/smuggler-ascension-acquire-2008-mann-booker-winner-white-tiger/5000306.article Smuggler, Ascension acquire 2008 Mann Booker winner White Tiger | News | Screen]&lt;/ref&gt; Propelled mainly by the Booker Prize win, [[The White Tiger]]'s Indian hardcover edition sold more than 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article148574.ece"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic criticism ===
According to Ana Cristina Mendes (2010), ''The White Tiger'' falls prey to “inauthenticity”: Adiga – a well-read Indian author who writes in English, having been educated at Oxford and Columbia – errs on the side of an unconvincing colloquialism by making his characters speak a language of the Indian underground, which he himself masters only to a certain extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cristina Mendes|first=Ana|date=June 2010|title=Exciting Tales of Exotic Dark India: Aravind Adiga’s The White Tiger|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0021989410366896|journal=The Journal of Commonwealth Literature|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=275–293|doi=10.1177/0021989410366896|issn=0021-9894}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is described as a first-person [[Bildungsroman|''bildungsroman'']] and placed within the wider context of contemporary [[Indian Writing in English|Indian writing in English,]] as a novel about “the Darkness” (which reminds us of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]’s London) and a fascinating success story about the overnight rise of one character from rags to riches, but also about India’s development as a global market economy. Mendes (2010) notices in this a certain artificiality, cleverly masked by irony, and remarks the “‘cardboard cut-out’ title character equipped with an inauthentic voice that ultimately undermines issues of class politics” (p. 277).

=== Other works ===
Adiga's second book, ''[[Between the Assassinations]]'', was released in India in November 2008 and in the US and UK in mid-2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= AravindAdiga.com |url= http://www.AravindAdiga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; twelve interlinked short stories comprise this book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Praveen |last=Donthi |title=Adigas second book to hit shelves |url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Oct242008/scroll2008102496976.asp?section=frontpagenews |publisher=[[Deccan Herald]] |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406015826/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Oct242008/scroll2008102496976.asp?section=frontpagenews |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His second novel and third published book, ''[[Last Man in Tower]]'', was published in the UK in 2011. His third novel, ''[[Selection Day]]'', was published on 8 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Good Reads |url= http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28277145-selection-day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were formulated by the Linguist [[Otto Behaghel]] in the last volume of his four volume work ''Deutsche Syntax: Eine geschichtliche Darstellung'' (published 1923-1932).

They include the following cross-language principles:

# Elements that belong close together intellectually will also be placed close together ('''Behaghel’s First Law''')
# That which is less important (or already known to the listener) is placed before that which is important. ('''Behaghel’s Second Law''')
# The distinguishing phrase precedes that which is distinguished.
# Given two phrases, when possible, the shorter precedes the longer. ('''Law of Increasing Terms''' (or Constituents))

It is thus ensured that the utterances that the speaker finds important will remain in the thoughts of the listener, in that they are at the end of the sentence. From Behaghel’s Laws evolved the later [[Theme-rheme]].  They serve together with other of his topics as suggestions for research in [[Quantitative Linguistics]].

Behaghel's law of increasing terms is also known as "Panini's Law" after the [[Panini (grammarian)|Sanskrit grammarian]]. This name was introduced by William Cooper and [[John R. Ross|John Ross]] (1975)  in their study of English set phrases.&lt;ref&gt;
Cooper and Ross, "World order", in Robin E. Grossman ''et al''. (eds.), ''Papers from the Parasession on Functionalism'', (Chicago Linguistic Society, 1975), pp. 63–111.&lt;/ref&gt;
English examples include "free and easy", "lock, stock and barrel", "kit and (ca)boodle",  etc.
Michael O'Connor (1978) has observed a similar statistical preference in the case of [[Biblical Hebrew]] poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Patrick O'Connor, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7tdFvFIOFVYC Hebrew verse structure]'', ([[Eisenbrauns]], 1978), pp. 97 ''et seqq''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], '''call tracing''' is a procedure that permits an entitled [[User (telecommunications)|user]] to be informed about the [[routing]] of [[data]] for an established [[Telephone exchange|connection]], identifying the entire route from the origin to the destination.

There are two types of [[telephone call|call]] tracing. Permanent call tracing permits tracing of all calls. On-demand call tracing permits tracing, upon request, of a specific call, provided that the called party dials a designated code immediately after the call to be traced is disconnected 
immediately.

[[File:1904 denmark1.jpg|thumb|The Danish Christmas seal of 1904 features the Danish Queen Louise]]
'''Christmas seals''' are labels placed on [[mail]] during the [[Christmas]] season to raise funds and awareness for charitable programs. They have become particularly associated with lung diseases such as [[tuberculosis]], and with child welfare. Christmas seals are regarded as a form of [[cinderella stamp]]&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, James. Philatelic Terms Illustrated, 4th edition, Stanley Gibbons, London, 2003, p.25. {{ISBN|0-85259-557-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with [[Christmas stamp]]s used for postage.

== Origins ==
[[File:Einar Holbøll by Juncker-Jensen.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Einar Holbøll, c. 1900]]
At the beginning of the 1900s tuberculosis was a greatly feared disease, and its harmful effects on children seemed particularly cruel.
In 1904, Einar Holbøll, a [[Denmark|Danish]] postal clerk developed the idea of adding an extra charitable stamp on mailed holiday greetings during Christmas. The money raised could be used to help children sick with tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; The plan was approved by the Postmaster and the King of Denmark ([[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]]).

In 1904 the world’s first Christmas seal was issued, bearing the likeness of the Danish Queen ([[Louise of Hesse-Kassel]]) and the word ''Julen'' ([[Christmas]]).  Over 4 million were sold in the first year at [[Danish krone|DKK]] 0.02 per seal.

[[File:Hotel Koldingfjord - Denmark.jpg|thumb|left|The first Danish Christmas seal sanatorium in Kolding, now [[Hotel Koldingfjord]] ]]
During the first six years, enough  funds were raised to build the Christmas Seal Sanatorium in [[Kolding]], which was opened in 1911.
The same year the sanatorium was transferred to the administration of the Danish National Association to Combat Tuberculosis as it was considered a waste of resources to have two organisations working towards the same purpose.
The Danish Christmas Seal Committee – today known as Julemærkefonden (the Christmas Seal Fund) - decided at that time to put all future collected funds to use in building and operating convalescent homes for children.

== Christmas seals in Europe ==
Soon after Denmark issued the first Christmas seal, [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] followed.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Healey |first= Barth |title=Pastimes: Stamps |work= Archives, [[The New York Times]] |date=24 December 1989 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/24/style/pasti mes-stamps.html |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seals then spread throughout [[Scandinavia]] and every major country in Europe, and are still popular today. Christmas seals have been issued by hundreds of different societies, nationally, and locally in Asia, Africa, North and South America, and Australia. The majority of all TB seals since then were issued at Christmas time and included the international symbol against TB, the double barred [[Cross of Lorraine]].
{{-}}

== Christmas seals in the United States ==
[[File:1914 Christmas Seal.JPG|thumb|left|A 1914 American Christmas seal.]]
They were introduced to the [[United States]] by [[Emily Bissell]] in 1907, after she had read about the 1904 Danish Christmas seal in an article by Danish-born [[Jacob Riis]], a [[muckraker|muckraking]] journalist and photographer.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Bissell hoped to raise money for a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] on the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] in [[Delaware]]. Bissell went on to design a Delaware local Christmas seal in 1908. Local Christmas seals have existed alongside national issues in the US since 1907, and are catalogued by the [[Christmas Seal &amp; Charity Stamp Society]].

By 1908, Bissell's idea grew to a national program administered by the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (NASPT) and the [[American National Red Cross]]. The seals were sold in post office lobbies,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; initially in Delaware at 1 cent each. Net proceeds from the sales would be divided equally between the two organizations.  By 1920, the Red Cross withdrew from the arrangement and sales were conducted exclusively by the NASPT, then known as the National Tuberculosis Association (NTA). Various promotional schemes were tried: in 1954 the small town of [[Saranac Lake, New York]] (home of the [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium]]) won a nationwide competition selling Christmas seals, the reward for which was hosting the world premiere of the [[Paul Newman]] film ''[[The Silver Chalice (film)|The Silver Chalice]]''; the cast participated in a parade in the town's annual [[winter carnival]].

[[File:Cartoon_of_man_pasting_Christmas_seals_on_package_while_woman_brings_more_gifts.png|thumb|right|Newspaper cartoon of a man placing Christmas seals on a package while a woman brings more gifts. Facsimile of a Los Angeles, California, stamp is in the lower right corner. Original caption read: "Help Fight the White Plague."]]

After [[World War II]] with the development of the antibiotic [[streptomycin]] TB became a curable disease, although it would be decades before it could be considered under control in developed countries. To reflect the expanding scope of the organization's goals, the name was changed to the National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association in the late 1960s.  The NTRDA became the [[American Lung Association]] in 1973, though the 1974 seals continue to show the NTRDA inscription on the sheet margin.

Today the Christmas seals benefit the [[American Lung Association]] and other lung related issues.  Tuberculosis was declining, but recently has been on the rise.  TB is still one of the most common major infectious diseases in the world.

In 1987 the American Lung Association acquired a trademark for the term "Christmas Seals" to protect their right to be the sole US national fundraising Association to issue them. Of course, this trademark would not apply to Christmas seals issued outside the US or local and regional Christmas seals, used in the US by many organizations since 1907 when the Kensington Dispensary in Philadelphia PA issued their own local Christmas seal.

== Christmas seals in Canada ==
By 1908, the campaign had reached Canada. Interested people in [[Toronto]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]] began Christmas seal campaigns to build and support sanatoria, as TB hospitals were then called.

The ''[[Toronto Globe]]'' came promptly to their aid. Early in December, the ''Globe'' began running a daily story on the front page giving news of the campaign. The column was bordered by holly so that readers could easily spot it.

One story told how the children of 58 Toronto schools had sold 10,000 Christmas seals. Another issue announced that out in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]] another paper, the ''[[Regina Leader-Post|Regina Leader]]'', had written to say its staff would sell the seals and send the money back for the sanatorium being built in [[Muskoka]].

From [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]], the Rev. G. A. Moore wrote to say that he and other volunteers would sell 8,500 and send the money to Toronto for the sanatorium.

That first year, the Toronto campaign brought in $6,114.25 and Hamilton citizens gave $1,244.40.
Year by year, other cities across Canada tried the Christmas seal campaign as a means not only of raising money but of creating the awareness that tuberculosis could be controlled.

Finally, in 1927, it was agreed that the Christmas seal campaign was to be the official method for tuberculosis associations to appeal to the public for funds. A national seal was established.

Christmas seal campaigns have played an important role in public health. At first, the money raised was used for the new and badly needed sanatoria. When these were established, Christmas seal funds were used for TB prevention. The seals have paid for millions of Canadians to have chest X-ray or tuberculin tests. As a result, thousands of TB cases were discovered before disease spread to others.

The [[Canadian Lung Association]]'s Christmas seals continue to symbolize the grassroots support of Canadians that helped win the fight against TB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Association|first=Lung|title=History: Support Christmas Seals|url=http://www.lung.ca/involved-impliquez/christmas-noel/history-histoire/index_e.php|work=Canadian Lung Association|accessdate=13 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115234620/http://lung.ca/involved-impliquez/christmas-noel/history-histoire/index_e.php|archivedate=15 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Christmas seals ==
There are nearly one hundred different lung associations worldwide that issue Christmas seals. Many different countries issue their own Christmas seals, as well as cities, states and territories. Green's Catalog, the bible of US and worldwide TB Christmas seal collecting would distinguish them as national versus local Christmas seals. Many tuberculosis seal issuing societies are members of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, which holds a Christmas seal contest for best design among their Organizational and Constituent seal issuing members at their annual World Conference on Lung Health.

Between 1937 and 1943 the [[National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark|Danish Nazi Party (DNSAP)]] issued a variety of seals featuring the [[Nazi]] [[swastika]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} These scarce seals contain Christmas themes like [[holly]], but no known connection to the fight against tuberculosis, and for this reason, they are not listed in [[Green's Catalog]].

History has shown that most dictatorial regimes suspend Christmas seals from being issued. This happened in Korea under the Japanese occupation, China under the communists, and Argentina under [[Eva Peron]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Many other charitable funds were issued at Christmas time, often with Christmas themes, by religious organizations, civic and fraternal societies, patriotic organizations, sororities, etc., but since they were not issued to fight tuberculosis, they lack the double barred cross of Lorraine, the international symbol for the fight against tuberculosis, proposed in 1902 at the International Conference on Tuberculosis in Berlin Germany, and strictly speaking do not qualify as Christmas seals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85642">In [[computing]], a '''code page''' is a [[character encoding]] and as such it is a specific association of a set of printable [[character (computing)|character]]s and [[control character]]s with unique numbers.

The term "code page" originated from [[IBM]]'s [[EBCDIC]]-based mainframe systems,&lt;ref name="IBM_i_EBCDIC"/&gt; but [[Microsoft]], [[SAP AG|SAP]],&lt;ref name="SAP_CP"/&gt; and [[Oracle Corporation]]&lt;ref name="oracle.com"/&gt; are among the few vendors which use this term. The majority of vendors identify their own character sets by a name. In the case when there is a plethora of character sets (like in IBM), identifying character sets through a number is a convenient way to distinguish them. Originally, the code page numbers referred to the [[page number|''page'' number]]s in the IBM standard character set manual,&lt;ref name="DEC_VT510"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEC_1994_Codepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CODEPAGE"/&gt; a condition which has not held for a long time. Vendors that use a code page system allocate their own code page number to a [[character encoding]], even if it is better known by another name; for example, [[UTF-8]] has been assigned page numbers 1208 at IBM, 65001 at Microsoft, and 4110 at SAP.

[[Hewlett-Packard]] uses a similar concept in its [[HP-UX]] operating system and its [[Printer Command Language]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pclviewer.com/resources/pcl_symbolset.html Printer Command Language Symbol Sets]&lt;/ref&gt; (PCL) protocol for printers (either for HP printers or not). The terminology, however, is different: What others call a ''character set'', HP calls a ''symbol set'', and what IBM or Microsoft call a ''code page'', HP calls a ''symbol set code''. HP developed a series of symbol sets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pclhelp.com/pcl-symbol-sets/ HP Symbol Sets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/bpl13206.pdf PCL5 Camparison Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; each with an associated symbol set code, to encode both its own character sets and other vendors’ character sets.

The multitude of character sets leads many vendors to recommend [[Unicode]].

== The code page numbering system ==
[[IBM]] introduced the concept of systematically assigning a small, but globally unique, 16 bit number to each [[character encoding]] that a computer system or collection of computer systems might encounter. The IBM origin of the numbering scheme is reflected in the fact that the smallest (first) numbers are assigned to variations of IBM's EBCDIC encoding and slightly larger numbers refer to variations of IBM's [[extended ASCII]] encoding as used in its PC hardware.

With the release of [[PC DOS]] version 3.3 (and the near identical [[MS-DOS]] 3.3) IBM introduced the code page numbering system to regular PC users, as the code page numbers (and the phrase "code page") were used in new commands to allow the character encoding used by all parts of the OS to be set in a systematic way.&lt;ref&gt;The MS-DOS Encyclopaedia, Microsoft press (1988, {{ISBN|1-55615-049-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55615-049-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

After IBM and [[Microsoft]] ceased to cooperate in the 1990s, the two companies have maintained the list of assigned code page numbers independently from each other, resulting in some conflicting assignments. At least one third-party vendor ([[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) also has its own different list of numeric assignments.&lt;ref name="oracle.com"/&gt;  IBM's current assignments are listed in their [[CCSID]] repository, while Microsoft's assignments are documented within the [[MSDN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317756%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#Code|title=Code Page Identifiers|publisher=Microsoft|work=microsoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a list of the names and approximate IANA ([[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]]) abbreviations for the installed code pages on any given Windows machine can be found in the Registry on that machine (this information is used by Microsoft programs such as [[Internet Explorer]]).

Most well-known code pages, excluding those for the [[CJK]] languages and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]],&lt;!--not using CJKV here because this applies to the modern romanised Vietnamese--&gt; fit all their code-points into eight bits and do not involve anything more than mapping each code-point to a single character; furthermore, techniques such as combining characters, complex scripts, etc., are not involved.

The text mode of standard ([[VGA-compatible text mode|VGA-compatible]]) PC graphics hardware is built around using an 8-bit code page, though it is possible to use two at once with some color depth sacrifice, and up to eight may be stored in the display adaptor for easy switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/vgatext.htm|title=VGA/SVGA Video Programming--VGA Text Mode Operation|work=osdever.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a selection of third-party code page fonts that could be loaded into such hardware. However, it is now commonplace for operating system vendors to provide their own character encoding and rendering systems that run in a graphics mode and bypass this hardware limitation entirely.  However the system of referring to character encodings by a code page number remains applicable, as an efficient alternative to string identifiers such as those specified by the IETF and IANA for use in various protocols such as e-mail and web pages.

=== Relationship to ASCII ===
The majority of code pages in current use are supersets of [[ASCII]], a 7-bit code representing 128 control codes and printable characters. In the distant past, 8-bit implementations of the ASCII code set the top bit to zero or used it as a [[parity bit]] in network data transmissions. When the top bit was made available for representing character data, a total of 256 characters and control codes could be represented. Most vendors (including IBM) used this extended range to encode characters used by various languages and graphical elements that allowed the imitation of primitive graphics on text-only output devices. No formal standard existed for these ‘[[Extended ASCII|extended character sets]]’ and vendors referred to the variants as code pages, as IBM had always done for variants of [[EBCDIC]] encodings.

=== Relationship to Unicode ===
[[Unicode]] is an effort to include all characters from previous code pages into a single character enumeration that can be used with a number of encoding schemes. In the process, duplicate characters are eliminated and new variants are introduced, like [[Fullwidth forms|fullwidth ASCII]]. While consistent use of any single Unicode encoding would theoretically eliminate the need to keep track of different code pages or character encodings, the existence of multiple encodings of Unicode as well as the need to remain compatible with existing documents and systems that use the older encodings remains.  In practice the various Unicode character set encodings have simply been assigned their own code page numbers, and all the other code pages have been technically redefined as encodings for various subsets of Unicode.

==IBM code pages==
=== EBCDIC-based code pages ===
These code pages are used by IBM in its [[EBCDIC]] character sets for [[IBM mainframe|mainframe computers]].

=== DOS code pages ===
These code pages are used by IBM in its [[PC DOS]] operating system. These code pages were originally embedded directly in the [[text mode]] hardware of the graphic adapters used with the [[IBM PC]] and its clones, including the original MDA and CGA adapters whose character sets could only be changed by physically replacing a ROM chip that contained the font.  The interface of those adapters (emulated by all later adapters such as VGA) was typically limited to single byte character sets with only 256 characters in each font/encoding (although VGA added partial support for slightly larger character sets).

When dealing with older hardware, protocols and file formats, it is often necessary to support these code pages, but newer encoding systems, in particular [[Unicode]], are encouraged for new designs.

DOS code pages are typically stored in .CPI files.&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott_2006_CPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AEB_2001_CPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haralambous_2007_CPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MS_1991_PR"/&gt;

=== IBM AIX code pages ===
These code pages are used by IBM in its [[AIX]] operating system. They emulate several character sets, namely those ones designed to be used accordingly to ISO, such as UNIX-like operating systems.

== Microsoft code pages ==
=== Windows code pages ===
These code pages are used by [[Microsoft]] in its own [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system. Microsoft defined [[windows code pages|a number of code pages]] known as the ANSI code pages (as the first one, 1252 was based on an [[apocrypha]]l ANSI draft of what became [[ISO 8859-1]]). Code page 1252 is built on ISO 8859-1 but uses the range 0x80-0x9F for extra printable characters rather than the C1 control codes used in ISO-8859-1. Some of the others are based in part on other parts of [[ISO 8859]] but often rearranged to make them closer to 1252.

=== MS-DOS code pages ===
These code pages are used by Microsoft in its [[MS-DOS]] operating system. Microsoft refers to these as the OEM code pages because they were defined by the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s who licensed MS-DOS for distribution with their hardware, not by Microsoft or a standards organization. Most of these code pages have the same number as the equivalent IBM code pages, although they are not '''exactly''' identical. There are minimum differences&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/pentaho/pentaho-reporting/tree/master/libraries/libfonts/encodings/VENDORS/IBM]&lt;/ref&gt; in some code pages from IBM and Microsoft.

== HP Symbol Sets ==
HP developed a series of Symbol Sets (each with its associated Symbol Set Code) to encode either its own character sets or other vendors’ character sets. They are normally 7-bit character sets which, when moved to the higher part and associated with the [[ASCII]] character set, make up 8-bit character sets.

== Code pages from other vendors ==
These code pages are independent assignments by third party vendors. Since the original IBM PC code page ([[code page 437|number 437]]) was not really designed for international use, several partially compatible country or region specific variants emerged.

These code pages number assignments are '''not official''' neither by IBM, neither by Microsoft and almost none of them is referred as a usable character set by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]. The numbers assigned to these code pages are arbitrary and may clash to registered numbers in use by IBM or Microsoft. Some of them may predate codepage switching being added in DOS 3.3.

== Criticism ==
Many older character encodings (unlike [[Unicode]]) suffer from several problems.  Some code page vendors insufficiently document the meaning of all code point values, which decreases the reliability of handling textual data through various computer systems consistently.  Some vendors add proprietary extensions to some code pages to add or change certain code point values; for example, byte 0x5C in [[Shift JIS]] can represent either a [[back slash]] or a yen [[Currency sign (typography)|currency symbol]] depending on the platform.  Finally, in order to support several languages in a program that does not use Unicode, the code page used for each string/document needs to be stored.

Due to Unicode's extensive documentation, vast repertoire of characters and stability policy of characters, the problems listed above are rarely a concern for Unicode.  Applications may also mislabel text in [[Windows-1252]] as [[ISO-8859-1]]. Fortunately, the only difference between these code pages is that the code point values used by ISO-8859-1 for control characters are instead used as additional printable characters in Windows-1252. Since control characters have no function in HTML, web browsers tend to use Windows-1252 rather than ISO-8859-1. In HTML5, treating ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 is even codified as standard. Later, [[UTF-8]] has succeeded both encodings in terms of popularity on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== {{anchor|Private use|User-definable}}Private code pages ==
When, early in the history of personal computers, users did not find their character encoding requirements met, private or local code pages were created using [[Terminate and Stay Resident]] utilities or by re-programming [[BIOS]] [[EPROM]]s. In some cases, unofficial code page numbers were invented (e.g. CP895).

When more diverse character set support became available most of those code pages fell into disuse, with some exceptions such as the [[Kamenický encoding|Kamenický]] or KEYBCS2 encoding for the [[Czech alphabet|Czech]] and [[Slovak alphabet|Slovak]] alphabets. Another character set is [[Iran System encoding standard]] that was created by Iran System corporation for [[Persian language]] support. This standard was in use in Iran in DOS-based programs and after introduction of Microsoft code page 1256 this standard became obsolete. However some Windows and DOS programs using this encoding are still in use and some Windows fonts with this encoding exist.

In order to overcome such problems, the [[IBM Character Data Representation Architecture]] level 2 specifically reserves ranges of code page IDs for user-definable and private-use assignments. Whenever such code page IDs are used, the user must not assume that the same functionality and appearance can be reproduced in another system configuration or on another device or system unless the user takes care of this specifically.
The code page range 57344-61439 (&lt;tt&gt;E000h&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;EFFFh&lt;/tt&gt;) is officially reserved for user-definable code pages (or actually CCSIDs in the context of [[IBM CDRA]]), whereas the range 65280-65533 (&lt;tt&gt;FF00h&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;FFFDh&lt;/tt&gt;) is reserved for any user-definable "private use" assignments.
For example, a non-registered custom variant of code page 437 (&lt;tt&gt;1B5h&lt;/tt&gt;) or 28591 (&lt;tt&gt;6FAF&lt;/tt&gt;) could become 57781 (&lt;tt&gt;E1B5h&lt;/tt&gt;) or 61359 (&lt;tt&gt;EFAFh&lt;/tt&gt;), respectively, in order to avoid potential conflicts with other assignments and maintain the sometimes existing internal numerical logic in the assignments of the original code pages. An unregistered private code page not based on an existing code page, a device specific code page like a printer font, which just needs a logical handle to become addressable for the system, a frequently changing download font, or a code page number with a symbolic meaning in the local environment could have an assignment in the private range like 65280 (&lt;tt&gt;FF00h&lt;/tt&gt;).

The code page IDs 0, 65534 (&lt;tt&gt;FFFEh&lt;/tt&gt;) and 65535 (&lt;tt&gt;FFFFh&lt;/tt&gt;) are reserved for internal use by operating systems such as DOS and must not be assigned to any specific code pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6386">'''Concrete cover''', in [[reinforced concrete]], is the least distance between the surface of embedded [[reinforcement]] and the outer surface of the [[concrete]] ([[American Concrete Institute|ACI]] 130). The concrete cover depth can be measured with a [[Cover Meter|cover meter]].

==Purpose of provision of concrete cover==
The concrete cover must have a minimum thickness for three main reasons:
* to protect the [[steel]] [[reinforcement bar]]s (rebars) from environmental effects to prevent their [[corrosion]];
* to provide [[thermal insulation]], which protects the reinforcement bars from fire, and;
* to give reinforcing bars sufficient embedding to enable them to be stressed without slipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONCRETE COVER FOR REINFORCEMENT|url=http://theconstructor.org/practical-guide/concrete-cover-for-reinforcement/6014/|publisher= The Constructor |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premature failure of corroded steel reinforcements and the expansion of the iron corrosion products around the rebars are amongst the main causes of the concrete degradation. The [[carbon steel]] of rebars is protected from oxidation by atmospheric [[oxygen]] by the high [[pH]] of concrete interstitial water. Iron bar surface is [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] as long as the pH value is higher than 10.5. Fresh cement water has a pH of about 13.5 while evolved cement water pH ~&amp;nbsp;12.5 is controlled by the dissolution of [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]). [[Carbon dioxide]] present in the air slowly diffuses through the concrete cover over the rebar and progressively reacts with the alkaline hydroxides ([[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[NaOH]]) and with calcium hydroxide leading to the [[carbonatation]] of the hydrated cement paste. As a result, the pH of the cement drops and when its value is below 10.5 – 9.5, steel surface is no longer passivated and starts to corrode. A sufficient thickness of concrete cover is thus required in order to slow down the carbonatation process towards the rebar. The minimum concrete cover will depend on the environmental conditions encountered and must be thicker when the concrete is also exposed to moisture and [[chloride]] (proximity to the sea, use of de-icing salt for bridges or roads, ...). A high quality concrete made with a low water-to-cement (w/c) ratio will have a lower [[porosity]] and will be less permeable to water and to the ingress of corrosive species (dissolved oxygen, chloride, ...). A thicker cover or a more compact concrete will also reduce the diffusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the concrete, protecting it better from carbonatation and maintaining a higher pH for a longer time period, increasing so the rebar service life.

==Structural Applications==
Concrete covers are frequently used in the construction of commercial developments, homes, bridges, municipalities, curb forming, and other locations or projects requiring long-lasting, durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concrete Curb &amp; Gutter Forms, Corrugated Metals|url=http://www.corrugated-metals.com/concrete-curb-forms.html|publisher= Corrugated Metals, Inc.|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete and steel reinforcement bars combine to create strong, resilient in the following ways:
* Upon contact with each other, the cement paste and steel rebar form a non-reactive surface film preventing corrosion. 
* Reinforcement bars or beams can be strategically set throughout the concrete to achieve the required support system. 
* The bond created by utilizing rebar and concrete can also be attributed to the ridged rebar surface. This allows stresses to transfer from the concrete to the steel, and from the steel to concrete. 
*Concrete and steel have similar thermal expansion coefficients. Upon freezing or heating, they contract and expand in a similar manner, maintaining the structure needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concrete Basics in Construction from Construction Knowledge.net|url=http://www.constructionknowledge.net/concrete/concrete_basics.php|publisher= Construction Knowledge.Net |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidelines==
National [[building code|codes]] also specify minimum cover requirements based on their respective local exposure conditions.

|}

==Paradox==
Large cover depths (50–75&amp;nbsp;mm) are required to protect reinforcement against corrosion in aggressive environments, but thick cover leads to increased [[Fracture|crack]] widths in [[flexure|flexural]] reinforced concrete members. Large crack-widths (greater than 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm) permit ingress of moisture and chemical attack to the concrete, resulting in possible corrosion of reinforcement and [[Concrete degradation|deterioration of concrete]]. Therefore, thick covers defeat the very purpose for which it is provided. There is a need for judicious balance of cover depth and crack width requirements.

A possible economical solution for this paradox is the placing of a second layer of [[corrosion-resistant]] reinforcement like [[stainless steel]] rebars or [[mesh]]es or [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|FRP]] rebars in the concrete cover to distribute the cracks.

In [[law]], a '''conviction''' is the [[verdict]] that usually results when a [[court of law]] finds a [[defendant]] [[Guilt (law)|guilt]]y of a [[crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Bryan A. |date=2000 |title=Black's law dictionary |edition=7th |isbn=0-314-24077-2 |publisher=West Group |location=St. Paul, Minn. |page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of a conviction is an [[acquittal]] (that is, "not guilty"). In [[Scotland]] and in the [[Netherlands]], there can also be a verdict of "[[not proven]]", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases in which the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in England, Wales, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand the mechanism for this is a [[Discharge (sentence)|discharge]].

For a host of reasons, the [[criminal justice]] system is not perfect:  sometimes guilty defendants are acquitted, while innocent people are convicted. [[Appeal]] mechanisms and [[post conviction]] relief procedures may mitigate the effects of a conviction to some extent. An error which results in the conviction of an innocent person is known as a [[miscarriage of justice]].

After a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate [[sentence (law)|sentence]] as a [[punishment]]. Furthermore, the conviction may lead to results beyond the terms of the sentence itself. Such ramifications are known as the [[collateral consequences of criminal charges]].

A '''minor conviction''' is a warning conviction, and it does not affect the defendant but does serve as a warning.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

A history of convictions are called [[antecedent (law)|antecedent]]s, known colloquially as "previous" in the [[United Kingdom]], and "priors" in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]]. The history of convictions also shows that a minor law conviction can be prosecuted as any individual's punishment.

[[Image:Falaise Pocket map.jpg|thumb|Closing the [[Falaise pocket|Falaise-Argentan Pocket]] and the Mortain counterattack 6–17 August 1944]]

A '''counterattack''' is a tactic employed in response to an attack, with the term originating in "[[Military exercise|war games]]".&lt;ref name=DOD&gt;{{cite web |title=counterdeception |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/c/01333.html |work=DTIC Online |publisher=DEFENSE TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTER |accessdate=13 June 2012 |author=Staff |quote=year: Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general objective is to negate or thwart the advantage gained by the enemy during attack, while the specific objectives typically seek to regain lost ground or destroy the attacking enemy (this may take the form of an opposing sports team or [[Military organization#Commands.2C formations.2C and units|military units]]).&lt;ref name=DOD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McConnell leads GOP counter-attack against START pact|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/12/19/senate.start/index.html|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc|date=19 December 2010|author=Tom Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uruguay's momentum, Paraguay's bumpy road, more Copa America|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/tim_vickery/07/25/copa.america.ten.questions/index.html|work=SI.com|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc|accessdate=13 June 2012|author=Tim Vickery|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A saying, attributed to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] illustrate the tactical importance of the counterattack : "the greatest danger occurs at the moment of victory". In the same spirit, in his [[Battle Studies]], [[Ardant du Picq|Ardant du Pic]] noticed that "he, general or mere captain, who employs every one in the storming of a position can be sure of seeing it retaken by an organised counter-attack of four men and a corporal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=7294 Ardant du Picq, 'Battle Studies']&lt;/ref&gt;

A counterattack is a military tactic that occurs when one side successfully defends off the enemy’s attack and begins to push the enemy back with an attack of its own. In order to perform a successful counterattack, the defending side must quickly and decisively strike the enemy after defending, with the objective of shocking and overwhelming the enemy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1990/CDC.htm|title=A View On Counterattacks In The Defensive Scheme Of Maneuver|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concept of the counterattack is to catch the enemy by surprise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many historical counterattacks were successful because the enemy was off guard and not expecting the counterattack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ancient roots of the counterattack ==

[[File:Bamboo_book_-_edges_-_UCR.jpg|thumb|194x194px|This is the original text of The Art of War. The text was painted onto bamboo sticks and bound together in the form of a book.]]
The counterattack tactic was highlighted in [[Sun Tzu]]’s, ''The'' ''[[The Art of War|Art of War]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868200458|title=The art of war|last=B.|first=Griffith, Samuel|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195014761|oclc=868200458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 5 B.C, ''The Art of War'' serves as a guide on warfare and has been influential to the tactics used during war even to this day. In chapter 3, the book focuses on “stratagem” and goes over how to properly conduct a counterattack.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sun Tzu states, “Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy’s plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This quote advises one to wait out the enemy and conduct a counterattack when the time is right. It states that the best strategy is to stay one step ahead of the enemy, and know the enemy’s next move. Thus keeping a general always prepared for the enemy’s move, leaving opportunity for a counterattack.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Analyzing historical counterattacks ==

In the past, there have been many notable counterattacks which have changed the course of a war. To be specific, [[Operation Bagration]] and the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] are good examples of the proper execution of a counterattack.

=== Operation Bagration ===

[[File:Belorussia_Operation_Detailed.svg|thumb|316x316px|This map shows the point of attack during Operation Bagration and how the counterattack was executed.]]
Operation Bagration during World War II was one of the largest counterattacks in military history. In the summer of 1944 the assault by around 1.7 million Red Army soldiers successfully put the Red Army on the offensive in the Eastern Front after Nazi Germany in [[Operation Barbarossa]] had captured the territory against the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941.

The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] counterattack focused on Belorussia, but prior to the counterattack starting, the Soviet Union fooled Nazi military leaders into believing that the attack take place further south, near the Ukraine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/947149001|title=Battle for Belorussia : the Red Army's forgotten campaign of October 1943-April 1944|last=E.,|first=Glantz, Mary|isbn=9780700623297|oclc=947149001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To aid the deception, the Red Army established fake army camps in the Ukraine and after German reconnaissance planes reported Soviet troop concentration in the area, [[panzer]] and infantry divisions were rushed south from Belorussia, leaving it vulnerable to a major assault.

To support the attack, partisan groups in German controlled territory were instructed to destroy German railroads to hamper German efforts to transport supplies and troops throughout the occupied territories and further weakening German Army Group Centre in the Ukraine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On June 22, 1944, the attack on Belarus by 1.7 million Soviet troops began and overwhelmed the depleted Germans defenders.

On July 3, The Red Army captured Minsk and later liberated the rest of Belorussia.

Operation Bagration was a huge Soviet success and opened a direct route to Berlin after the fall of Belorussia leading to the Red Army beginning to liberate territory that was taken by the Wehrmacht three years before.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Battle of Austerlitz ===

Another military battle that utilized the counterattack tactic was the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] on December 2, 1805. While fighting the Austrian and Russian armies, Napoleon purposely made it seem as if his men were weak from the fighting in several cases.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/260090494|title=1805: Austerlitz : Napoleon and the destruction of the third coalition|last=Robert.|first=Goetz,|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=1853676446|oclc=260090494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon had his men retreat in an attempt to lure the Allies to battle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He purposely left his right flank open and vulnerable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This deceived the Allies into attacking and the Allies fell into [[Napoleon]]'s trap.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When the Allied troops went to attack Napoleon’s right flank, Napoleon quickly filled up the right flank so the attack was not effective.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, on the Allied side, a large gap was left open in the middle of the Allied front line due to troops leaving to attack the French right flank.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Noticing the large hole in the middle of the Allied lines, Napoleon attacked the middle and had his forces also flank around both sides, eventually surrounding the Allies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the Allies completely surrounded, the battle was over.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Battle of Austerlitz was a successful counterattack because the French army defended off the Allied attack and quickly defeated the Allies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Napoleon deceived the Allies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He made his men seem weak and near defeat.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Battle of St. Vith ===

The '''Battle of St. Vith''' was part of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], which began on 16 December 1944, and represented the right [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] in the advance of the German center, [[5th Panzer Army|5th ''Panzer-Armee'']] (Armored Army), toward the ultimate objective of [[Antwerp]]. Given the task of countering the German advance, US General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] decided that a [[mobile defense]] was the best solution. Knowing that the German army was aiming for an objective far behind the battle line, he decided that they could afford to lose a few kilometers a day - the idea being that a slowing down of the advance was as good as stopping them outright, since the Germans were limited by time.

The mobile defense he used at St. Vith involved the use of [[M36 tank destroyer]]s acting as a base of fire to resist the oncoming German armored thrust, slowing them down enough to then counter-attack them with a force of [[M4 Sherman]] tanks. Artillery and Infantry were involved in this process as a combined arms force. They key was not to engage the Germans in a pitched battle, but to slow their advance enough to ruin their offensive timetable. The counter-attacks ensured that the German forces could not break through the slowly retreating forces. Clarke's success was one of the first times armor had been used in a mobile defense, and was one of the turning points of the war.

'''Devudu Narasimha Sastry''' (1895–1962, known popularly by his pen-name '''Devudu''' was an eminent [[Kannada]] writer and novelist, [[Sanskrit]] scholar, actor and a journalist. His guru was Mahamahopadhyaya Vaidhyanatha Shastri.

''Mimansa Darpana'', his commentary on the Indian philosophy of [[Mimāṃsā]], is ranked highly among works on the subject. ''Antaranga'', his novel published in 1932, was the first novel in Kannada to employ the method of monologue narrative. In 1947, he published his most notable novel, ''Maha Brahmana'' ("The Great Brahmin") based on the life of the sage [[Vishwamitra]]. ''Mahākṣatriya'' ("The Great Warrior"), published in 1960 depicts the life and deeds of King [[Nahusha]]. This novel was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]], the most prestigious literary merit awarded by the Government of [[India]]. Devudu's last novel, ''Maha Darshana'' ("The Great Vision") is based on the life of sage [[Yajnavalkya]]. The book was published after his death in 1962.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">'''Danushkodi Ramasamy''' (1945? – 24 November 2005) was a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] writer from [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. His works were characterized by his sympathies with communist ideals and depictions of the plight of labourers. He was the general secretary of the ''Tamil Nadu Kalai Ilakkia Perumanram'', a literary organisation.&lt;ref name="hindu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/11/26/stories/2005112617310700.htm|title= Danushkodi Ramasamy dead  |date=26 November 2005|work=[[The Hindu]]|publisher=[[The Hindu Group]]|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Danushkodi Ramasamy was born in Kalingal Mettuppatti a village near [[Sattur]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. His father was a school teacher. Ramasamy obtained master's degrees in Arts and Education (M.A and M.Ed) and began his teaching career  as a primary teacher in Ayira Vysiya Higher Secondary School in Sattur. He eventually became the Head master of the school, a post he resigned from, as he felt it was interfering with his literary activities. He continued as a higher secondary teacher in the same school. During his younger days he was a proponent of the ''[[Tanittamil Iyakkam|Thani Tamil Iyakkam]]'' (Pure Tamil movement) and [[Gandhism]]. In his later life he became a supporter of [[Marxism]]. His first short story ''Simma Soppanam'' was published in 1978. During his writing career, he wrote a number of short stories and novels. His best known work is the 1985 novel ''Thozhar''. Some of his short stories were published in the magazine ''[[Ananda Vikatan]]''. In 1990, the [[Communist Party of India]]'s  (CPI) publishing arm - New century Book house - awarded him the best Tamil short story writer award. In 1992, his work ''Theemtharigida'' won the  Lilli Desigamani memorial prize. In 1991, he won the ''Ananda Vikatan'' Diamond Jubilee short story competition and in 94 the Agni Subhamangla short story competition. He served as a state secretary of the ''Tamil Nadu Kalai Ilakkia Perumanram'' and at the time of his death was its general secretary. Ramasamy died on 24 November 2005 after a prolonged illness.&lt;ref name="hindu1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trust1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhanushkodi.org/|title=Dhanushkodi Ramasamy trust webpage |language=Tamil|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thinnai2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinnai.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=60512024&amp;format=print&amp;edition_id=20051202|title=Danushkodi Ramasamy Obituary|date=2 December 2005|publisher=Thinnai.com|language=Tamil|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Dynamic terrain''' is the representation of terrain (e.g. [[mountains]], [[hills]], [[valleys]]) together with the capability for modification during a simulation (e.g. a constructive [[soldier]] (i.e. battlespace entity) digging a trench).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sim-summit.org/Economics_MS/.../FCS%20Brief%20for%20M&amp;S%20Reuse%20SCS%20Session%20at%20IITSEC%2006.ppt "MSDO Input to Phasing Briefing", PM FCS, 2006]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military simulation==
Dynamic terrain has been supported in military training simulations since the mid-1990s in the [[Close Combat Tactical Trainer]] (CCTT), the first trainer in the [[Combined Arms Tactical Trainer]] (CATT) family of military training systems. At the time, the [[Institute for Simulation and Training]] (IST) at the [[University of Central Florida]] (UCF) had been researching the dynamic terrain requirements of networked military simulations, including excavation, clouds and other atmospheric events, and water flow. The complexity proposed by IST was computationally expensive and not practical for the technology available at that time. Therefore, CCTT implemented dynamic terrain events as ''dynamically placed features'' (DPFs) that described the terrain deformation, such as a ''tank ditch''. Tank ditches are either 30, 60, 90, or 120 meters long and may be oriented in three dimensions. Since CCTT represents the terrain as an equally spaced elevation grid, terrain reasoning queries are adjusted based on the presence of a DPF. Nevertheless, the dynamic terrain implementation in CCTT caused a mismatch between the CCTT [[Semi-Automated Forces]] (SAF) and the visual display. The SAF reasons on the terrain and feature geometry, whereas the visual display focuses on presenting the terrain as a realistic scene. The difference between these two representations of the terrain is similar to the difference between ''feeling'' and ''seeing'', therefore these representations store information in very different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C.E.; McCulley, G., ''Terrain reasoning challenges in the CCTT dynamic environment,'' AI, Simulation, and Planning in High Autonomy Systems, 1994. 'Distributed Interactive Simulation Environments', Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Conference on , pp.55-61, 7-9 Dec 1994. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=390500&amp;isnumber=8849]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, J.; Provost, M., ''Design of terrain reasoning database for CCTT,'' AI, Simulation, and Planning in High Autonomy Systems, 1994. 'Distributed Interactive Simulation Environments'., Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Conference on , pp.62-68, 7-9 Dec 1994.
[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=390499&amp;isnumber=8849]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the Synthetic Theater of War (STOW) effort sponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) provided the capability to communicate and apply terrain deformations but the implementation still required high-end platforms without satisfying real-time requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, R., ''Dynamic Terrain in the Synthetic Environment,'' Proceedings of the RTO NMSG Conference on "The Second NATO Modelling and Simulation Conference", 24-26 Oct 2000. [http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFullText/RTO/MP/RTO-MP-071///MP-071-13.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517202722/http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public/ |date=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dynamic Terrain Simulator (DTSim) was developed for the STOW Synthetic Environments (SE) program at the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Army Geospatial Center]] (ASG) (formerly [[Topographic Engineering Center]] (TEC)).&lt;ref&gt;Commercial Terrain Visualization Software Product Information", [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], 17 September 2008 [http://www.agc.army.mil/research/software/TD/tvd/survey/Dynamic_Terrain_Simulator_DT_Sim.html]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other applications reused the DTSim framework for more specific implementations of the dynamic terrain capabilities, for example RunwaySim, the Hydrogeologic Simulator (HydroSim), Dynamic Terrain Scribe (DTScribe), Dynamic Terrain Agent (DTAgent), and the Ultra-High Resolution Building Simulator (UHRB-Sim) &lt;ref&gt;Adelson, S. J, Salesmann, L., Farsai, S., Miller, D. D., Miller, T., Nakanishi, M. E., and De la Cruz, J., ''Complex Terrain Databases for Urban Operations'', Spring 2004 Simulation Interoperability Workshop (SIW), Arlington, VA, April 18–23, 2004. [http://www.sisostds.org/index.php?tg=fileman&amp;idx=get&amp;id=2&amp;gr=Y&amp;path=Simulation+Interoperability+Workshops%2F2004+Spring+SIW%2F2004+Spring+SIW+Papers+and+Presentations&amp;file=04S-SIW-007.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockheed Martin Information Systems, ''Architectural Design for Dynamic Terrain and Real Time Database Modifications'', version 2.0, December 12, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the U.S.[[Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) released documentation related to their Dynamic Terrain Server (DTServer). DTServer computes structural effects of detonations and collisions and transmits the result to client simulations, making sure that all simulators share a unified terrain database. DTServer also uses a table look-up to compute the effects of blasts and collisions. The DTServer provides terrain updates by issuing [[distributed interactive simulation]] (DIS) [[protocol data units]] (PDUs). DTServer sends DIS Set Data PDUs of the following types: Breach Subtract, Breach vertices, and Ding messages. DTServer also provides a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) to inspect the state of the database. DTServer runs on three different databases: the terrain database, the object database, and the munitions database. The DIS interface has been successfully tested in the [[Soldier Visualization System]] (SVS), the [[After Action Review]] (AAR) system from IST, and the ARL DIS.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, M., ''The U.S. Army Research Laboratory Dynamic Terrain Server'', ARL-TR-2962, April 2003. [http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2003/ARL-TR-2962.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are current efforts to include dynamic terrain capabilities in [[One Semi-Automated Forces]] (OneSAF). The OneSAF Environment Runtime Component (ERC) updates presented in the 2009 OneSAF Users Conference mention that OneSAF 4.0 will include support for terrain deformation such as craters, tank defilades, infantry trenches, and breach holes in walls. OneSAF's dynamic terrain implementation will use a server to resolve dynamic terrain requests.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neal, J. R., ''OneSAF ERC Update'', 2009 OneSAF Users Conference, Orlando, FL, April 3, 2009. [http://www.onesaf.net/community/systemdocuments/UsersConference2009/3.Wednesday%20Briefings/Grand%20Ballroom/0945%20-%20OneSAF%20Environment%20Runtime%20Component%20V3.0%20Update%20UC09%20-%20O%27Neal.ppt]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command]] (RDECOM) [[Simulation and Training Technology Center]] (STTC) is sponsoring the development of the Shared Architecture for Dynamic Environment (SHADE). SHADE will provide a framework to receive events, calculate effects, and transmit dynamic environment changes to participating applications.&lt;ref&gt;"Applied Research Associates Central Florida Division (CFD) - New Contracts", Applied Research Associates, Inc., 2009 [http://www.ara.com/Offices/FL_orlando_lynda_contracts.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204104334/http://www.ara.com/Offices/FL_orlando_lynda_contracts.htm |date=2010-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts will seek to address the dynamic terrain capability gap in modeling and simulation identified by the U.S. Army [[Training And Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) [[Intelligence Support Activity]] (TRISA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1058">'''Elevators''', as developed for the drilling industry, are a hinged device with handles that are used to wrap around the tool joint of drill pipe, casing or lift nipples (for collars) to facilitate the lifting or lowering of them singly or of the [[drill string]] as a whole.

In practical use elevators are highly stressed components and require regular careful inspection. In practice, sets of elevators and a spare duplicate are required on-site for general operations. Their failure almost always stops operations.

To latch around a piece of pipework a set of elevators need a precise internal diameter, with an appropriately profiled shoulder to accommodate the lower profile of a tool joint. The latch mechanism has to prevent opening under [[Radius|radial]] loads of up to hundreds of tons. For some purposes (casing elevators, and loading pipe into and out of the derrick), the elevators also need to resist cross-axial loads of the weight of the pipe joints.

'''Food porn''' is a glamourized visual presentation of cooking or eating in advertisements, [[infomercial]]s, [[Blog|blogs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecitylane.com/buttermilk-sriracha-fried-chicken-recipe/|title=Buttermilk &amp; Sriracha Fried Chicken: Recipe|publisher=The City Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cooking show|cooking shows]] or other visual media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Beyond Food/Sex: Eating and an Ethics of Existence|last=Probyn|first=Elspeth|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=16|issue=2|pages=215–228|year=1999|doi=10.1177/02632769922050485}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be foods of a high fat and calorie content,&lt;ref name="tele20000510"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Simon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/05/10/wfat10.html|title=Unhealthy eating is new fad in US|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|date=2000-05-10|accessdate=2008-04-04|archiveurl=http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=0038mb|archivedate=2000-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or exotic dishes that arouse a desire to eat or the [[glorification]] of food as a substitute for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bourdain|first=Anthony|title=Food Porn: Lust for the gastronomic – from Zola to cookbooks – is nothing new, but maybe it's time to shelve it|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/11/04/RV201066.DTL|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2001-11-04|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food porn often takes the form of [[food photography]] with [[food stylist|styling]] that presents food provocatively, in a similar way to [[glamour photography]] or [[pornographic photography]].

==History==
The term food pornography is used in Frank Chin's 1978 copyrighted story "Railroad Standard Time."{{cn|date=November 2018}} The term appears to have been coined by the feminist critic [[Rosalind Coward]] in her 1984 book ''Female Desire''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Female Desire: Women's Sexuality Today|last=Coward|first=Rosalind|publisher=Paladin|year=1984|isbn=0-586-08447-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Cooking food and presenting it beautifully is an act of servitude. It is a way of expressing affection through a gift... That we should aspire to produce perfectly finished and presented food is a symbol of a willing and enjoyable participation in servicing others. Food pornography exactly sustains these meanings relating to the preparation of food. The kinds of picture used always repress the process of production of a meal. They are always beautifully lit, often touched up." (p.&amp;nbsp;103)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is important to realize that the term food porn does not strictly deal with the connection, often established throughout history, between food items and [[food and sexuality|sexual contents]]. In the United States, food porn is a term applied when "food manufacturers are capitalising on a backlash against low-calorie and diet foods by marketing treats that boast a high fat content and good artery-clogging potential".&lt;ref name="tele20000510"/&gt; The origin of the term was attributed to the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]&lt;ref name="tele20000510"/&gt; which began publishing a regular column called "Right Stuff vs. Food Porn" for its Nutrition Action Healthletter in January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cspinet.org/nah/1998index.html|title=1998 Index|publisher=Center for Science in the Public Interest|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207115207/http://www.cspinet.org/nah/1998index.html|archivedate=2009-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cspinet.org/nah/april98back.htm|title=April '98 Right Stuff vs. Food Porn|publisher=Center for Science in the Public Interest|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507072854/http://www.cspinet.org/nah/april98back.htm|archivedate=2008-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the term became popular in the 1990s due to the TV cookery programme ''[[Two Fat Ladies]]'' after the shows producer described the "pornographic joy" the pair of them took in using vast quantities of butter and cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benviveur.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/pornographic-joy.html|title=Ben Viveur: Pornographic Joy|publisher=Ben Viveur}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}

==Connection with business==
Taking a picture of food became one of the norms for the younger generation in the world.  Study from YPulse shows 63% of people between thirteen years old to thirty two years old posted their food picture while they are eating on social networking services.  Moreover, 57% of people in the same age range posted information of the food they were eating at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = #FoodPorn: The Growing Influence Of Social Food {{!}} Ypulse|url = https://www.ypulse.com/post/view/foodporn-the-growing-influence-of-social-food|website = www.ypulse.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the percentage, food and social media are starting to connect together as trend. People using the hashtag #foodporn helps the food industry to track audiences on social networking services.

==Uses/community==
The term food porn has shifted throughout its first appearances. Articles mentioned food porn as early as the late 1970s. The phrase food porn was used in a literal manner, describing food that was unhealthy for human consumption, directly comparing it to pornography. Its use then took on a new meaning, being used to describe food that was presented and prepared in a manner that was aesthetically appealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What 'Food Porn' Does to the Brain|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/what-food-porn-does-to-the-brain/390849/|website = The Atlantic|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took on this use for over a decade, until the social media boom that was created by the internet. Once the early 2000s hit, the terminology evolved into a way of documenting meals that are recognized for their presentation. This desire for food has flooded the internet, having significant effects on social media sites that provide the ability to display such as [[Instagram]], [[Flickr]], [[Snapchat]], [[Facebook]], [[Reddit]], and [[Twitter]]. The popularity of displaying food in a physically appealing manner is driven by the users that create these communities. The use of [[hashtag]]s that the users of these sites have adapted to, allow food porn to connect people in a way that documents anything about the food such as, foods that reflect cultures, calories, presentation, preparation, delicious taste, and anything else that adds to the authenticity of the meal.

==Culture==
The term "food porn" refers to images of food across various social media platforms such as TV, cooking magazine, online blog, mobile apps, websites and social media platforms. The reason why food porn is strongly connecting with popular culture is due to the fact that people are exposed to food in their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Where Food, Drink and Pop Culture Meet|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courtney-reum/where-food-drink-and-pop-_b_838652.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food porn is not specific to social media platforms and could also be part of the category on [[newspaper]] and online blog.  Moreover, food porn is experienced globally. Language barriers that exist culturally can be bypassed by the usage of #foodporn. Food porn is used collectively by the online users and is does not exclude or privilege one food over another.

== Pornographic metaphor ==
Contemporary literature and cinema consistently connect [[food and sexuality]].  Scholars note historical links between eating and sex, such as male and female humans coming together throughout evolution around food and creating offspring—two essential needs for survival.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food: The Key Concepts|last=Belasco|first=Warren|publisher=Berg|year=2008|isbn=|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a more obvious connection exists between the physical acts of eating and having sex in popular culture. In his book ''Food: The Key Concepts'', Warren Belasco examines this particular resonance between kitchen and bedroom in modern-day vocabulary: "these intensely sexualized associations between eating and loving make it difficult to adopt the asceticism implied in eating responsibly. If pastry, sugar, fat, meat, and salt are so closely tied to life’s most intimately pleasurable experiences, who would ever want to cut back on them?"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Observing the #foodporn revolution through the lens of digital pornography, scholars have proposed various underlying implications that this social media phenomenon has on users today. Food porn does not supplement sex. It substitutes food as a dangerous desire or a delicious dream. Pornographic images and videos often depict an exciting, unrealistic setting whose very purpose is to stimulate desire for these forbidden fantasies—scandalous images gain attention due to humans fascination with others’ private lives, and porn represents these unattainable visions. Unfortunately, this glorification of the ultimate fantasy severely limits what sex is interpreted as for viewers. For example, the pornography industry has been criticized for primarily featuring white, heterosexual actors (focused on the male’s pleasure), and thus excluding people of other races, sexualities, and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;'''Parreñas Shimizu, Celine.''' '''""Sexual Problems: Heteronormativity, Pornography and Asian American Men""''' ''Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Studies Association Annual Meeting, Renaissance Hotel, Washington D.C.'', &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2014-11-28&lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p318891_index.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Food porn is argued to operate similarly: it provocatively idolizes unattainably expensive meals at exotic restaurants that, for many, is out of financial reach. Food porn implies a limited accessibility, while idolizing the concept of "leakage" that offers a vicarious thrill and makes viewers feel energized by this scandalous viewing. Food porn, it is argued, embodies a new relevance when the pornographic metaphor is emphasized—underneath the oozing hamburgers and foot-tall brownie sundaes is a glorification of invading privacy and unspoken implications about who ''can'' access these fantastical treats. On this analysis food porn glorifies a particular, wealthy lifestyle meant to be universally stimulating but realistically available to a small percentage of people due to financial or logistic factors.

[[Image:Selassie restored.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Haile Selassie I]]]]
{{Rastafari}}
'''Iyaric''', '''Livalect''', '''Dread-talk''' or '''I-talk''' is a consciously created [[dialects of English|dialect of English]] in use among members of the [[Rastafari movement]]. African languages were lost among [[Black African|Africans]] when they were taken into captivity as part of the [[slave trade]], and adherents of Rastafari teachings believe that [[English language|English]] is an imposed [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[language]]. Their remedy for this situation has been the creation of a modified vocabulary and [[dialect]], reflecting a desire to take language forward and to confront what they see as the confusion of a corrupt and decadent society they call [[Babylon]]. This is accomplished by avoiding words and syllables seen as negative, such as "back", and changing them to positive ones.

Some if not most Rastas choose not to use certain words in the English language as they have Babylonian and devil-like connotations. For example, the word "hello" is not used because it contains the word "hell" and "lo" referring to "low". Instead words such as 'Wa Gwaan', 'Yes I' 'Cool Nuh Iyah' are used because they are words that uplift people. If at a Rastafari church, they would use their formal church greetings. For instance, the Rastafari branch known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel would say, "Greetings in that Most Precious and Divine Name of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who has  revealed Himself through the wonderful personality of H.I.M Emperor Haile Selassie the 1st of Ethiopia"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/985268340|title=The Rastafari movement : a North American and Caribbean perspective|last=Barnett|first=Michael|year=2018|isbn=9781138682146|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=985268340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iyaric is sometimes also referred to as '''Wordsound''' &amp;mdash; a name derived from the Rastafari principle of "Word, Sound and Power", which several scholars have compared to West African concepts regarding a power or essence being encapsulated within the pronounced sound of a name or word. Iyaric sometimes also plays a liturgical role among Rastafari, in addition to [[Amharic]] and [[Ge'ez]].

==I words==
* ''I'' replaces "me", which is much more commonly used in [[Jamaican English]] than in the more conventional [[English language|forms]]. ''Me'' is felt to turn the person into an [[Object pronoun|object]] whereas ''I'' emphasises the [[Subject (philosophy)|subjectivity]] of an individual.
* ''I and I'' (also spelled ''I&amp;I'', ''InI'', or ''Ihi yahnh Ihi'') is a complex term, referring to the oneness of [[Jah]] (God) and every human. In the words of Rastafari scholar E. E. Cashmore: "''I and I'' is an expression to totalize the concept of oneness. 'I and I' as being the oneness of two persons. So God is within all of us and we're one people in fact. I and I means that God is within all men. The bond of Ras Tafari is the bond of God, of man."  The term is often used in place of "you and I" or "we" among Rastafari, implying that both persons are united under the love of Jah. Also in the [[Twi language]] (in which patois uses a lot of Twi loan words) of Ghana, Me ne me is also said, which literally translate to "I and I".
* ''[[I-tal]]'' or ''Di food fula itality'' is spiritually blessed food that has not touched modern chemicals and is served without preservatives, condiments or salts. [[Alcohol]], [[coffee]], [[milk]], and flavoured beverages are generally viewed as not I-tal. Most Rastas follow the I-tal proscriptions generally, and many are [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] or [[vegans]]. Even meat-eating Rastas abstain from eating [[pork]], as [[pig]]s are scavengers of the dead, as are [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, and [[shrimp]] (whose banning coincides with the restrictions of [[Kashrut]]).
* ''I man'' is the inner person within each Rastafari believer.
* ''Irie'' refers to positive emotions or feelings, or anything that is good. Specifically it refers to high emotions and peaceful vibrations. This is a phonetical representation of "all right".
* ''Ites'' derived from English "heights", means "joy" and also the colour "red". It can also be short for "Israelites".
* ''Itesquake'' replaces "earthquake".
* ''Irator'' replaces "creator", and ''Iration'' replaces "creation".
* ''Idren'' or ''Bredren'' and ''Sistren'' refer to the oneness of Rastafari and are used to describe one's peers (male - "bredren", female - "sistren").
* ''Itinually'' replaces continually. It has the everlasting/everliving sense of I existing continuously.
* ''Inity'' replaces "unity", demonstrating a general pattern of replacing "you" and similar sounds with "I".
* ''Iya'' (higher): Rastafari vocabulary is full of references to the "iya man", "stepping higher and higher", etc. It is not a reference to the "high" normally associated with cannabis, but to stepping into higher realms of reality, as in higher awareness. Iya is also used to refer to a friend. As in "Yes Iya", or "Cool (no) Iya".
* ''Iyaric'' is the self-applied term for Rastafari language.  It is formed by a combination of ''Iya'' (higher) and ''[[Amharic]],'' the language spoken by Haile Selassie I.
* ''Iwa''  replaces "time" or more accurately, "hour": ''"Inna this ya iwa."''

==Other words==
*''[[Dreadlocks]]'' describes the locks commonly worn among Rastas, now universally called dreadlocks in English. The 'dread' component refers to the fear of the Lord, as well as the fear inspired when Rastas first began to grow locks in the 1940s in Jamaica. To Rastas, dreadlocks can be a deeply spiritual part of their identity. The [[Nazirite]] vow in the [[Torah]] and the story of [[Samson]] are commonly cited: "And she made a vow, saying, 'O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head'." {{bibleverse|1|Sam|1:11|NIV}}. [http://rastaphilosophy.com/images/Dreadlocks.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Rastas see this as the most natural way to grow one's hair, as well as a symbol of defiance of Rome and Babylon.
*''Dreads'' can refer to the dreadlocks, or to those who wear them.
* Persons without dreads are sometimes called ''baldheads'' (somewhat derisive) or ''lack'' (more respectful); however as a common Rasta refrain points out, "It's not the dread upon your head, but the love in your heart that makes you Rasta..." meaning that many Rasta faithful themselves lack dreadlocks, while some non-Rastas, ''wolves inna sheeps clothes'', may wear dreads solely for fashion.  Dreads that were induced artificially or with additives, rather than allowed to take their natural course, are known as ''bathroom locks''.
*''Babylon'' is an important Rastafari term, referring to human government and institutions that are seen as in rebellion against the rule of Jah (God), beginning with the [[Tower of Babel]]. It is further used by some to mean specifically the 'politricksters' who have been oppressing the black race for centuries through economic and physical slavery. In a more general sense, Babylon refers to any system that oppresses or discriminates against all peoples. Rastafari is defiance of Babylon, sometimes also called [[Rome]] &amp;mdash; in part because of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|1935 Italian invasion of Ethiopia]], then ruled by Rastafari's 'Living God,' Haile Selassie I, and partly because as the head of the [[Roman Catholic church]] (the [[Pope]]) is considered an opponent of Selassie I and Rastafari. ''[[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon the Great]]'' and ''[[Whore of Babylon]]'' are apocalyptic terms from the book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] that may have been used to describe the pagan [[Roman Empire]], which often persecuted [[Christianity]]. ''Babylon'' is also sometimes used by some Rastas with the more specific meaning of "police", insofar as they are seen as executive agents of Babylon's will.
* ''Politricks'' is a Rasta term replacing English "politics", because so many politicians, etc. turn out, they say, to be more like tricksters. ''Politrickster'' n. 
*''Everliving'' replaces "everlasting", particularly in the context of Life Everliving. The "last" in "everlasting", although actually implying survival (to "last" is to "survive" or "bide through"), is seen by the Rastas as implicative of an end (as in the term "at last"), and as the life the Rastas have will never end according to them, they being immortalists. Often used in the phrase "...I and I is Everliving, Everfaithful, Eversure. Ras Tafari."
*''H.I.M.'' (His Imperial Majesty), pronounced ''him'', and referring to Haile Selassie I.
*''Downpression'' replaces "oppression", because oppression holds man down instead of keeping him up (pronounced ''op'' in [[Jamaican patois]].)  Similarly "downgression" = "violence" (from ''aggression''). ''Downpressor'' n. 
*''Livication'' replaces "dedication", to rid itself of a connotation of death. ''adj. Livicated. v. Livicate.''
*''Outvention'' replaces "invention", because mechanical devices are seen as outward; it is the inner experience of being Rastafari that is invention.
*''Overstanding'' (also "innerstanding") replaces "understanding", referring to enlightenment that raises one's consciousness.
*''Apprecilove'' replaces "appreciate" because of the similarity to hate.
* ''Amagideon''/''Gideon'' is a Rasta theological concept meaning the general state the entire world is in now, and has been getting progressively deeper in since 1930, and especially since 1974.  This is a slight mutation of [[Armageddon]], a name appearing in Revelation. 
*''[[Zion#Rastafari movement|Zion]]'' refers to either Ethiopia or the whole continent of Africa, after the Day of Judgment, as well as a state of mind one can enter through Rastafari.
*''Know'' replaces "believe". Rastafari would not say they "believe" Haile Selassie is Jah and that they, the Rastas, are the chosen people. They would say they "know" these things.
*''[[Whore of Babylon]]''  is the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] character sometimes considered to be [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], who is still the Head of State of [[Jamaica]]; or the papacy; or both.

== Popular impact ==
Several Rastafari words have migrated into mainstream English usage, or even widespread global usage.  The term ''dreadlocks'', for example, is used worldwide for the hairstyle that was popularized by the Rastafari. Rastafari usage of words like ''Zion'' and ''Babylon'' also the term "overstand" and "politricks" have entered [[hip hop culture]] through Caribbean-American and Caribbean-British rappers/musicians. In Europe, perhaps influenced by popular culture depictions of or actual encounters with Afro-Caribbean "[[rude boy]]" gangs, the term ''Babylon'' is sometimes used to refer to the police.

[[Market efficiency]] implies that [[stock price]]s fully reflect all publicly available information instantaneously; thus no [[Investment strategy|investment strategies]] can systematically earn [[abnormal return]]s. Fama (1991)&lt;ref&gt;FAMA, E.F., 1991. Efficient Capital Markets: II. The Journal of Finance, 46(5), pp. 1575.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that stock prices respond instantaneously and without bias to their new values based on new, relevant information and that security returns over time are determined only by changes in the market level and individual stock risk.  Therefore, there are no profitable [[investment]] opportunities from superior analysis, which implies no one can consistently outperform the market.  The precondition for this 'strong' definition is that information and trading costs are always equal to zero.  This is arguably not true in practice.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[Stock market]] anomalies are violations of the [[Market efficiency|market efficiency hypothesis]] in which consistently abnormal returns can be earned by some investment strategies that are constructed based on potential [[Market inefficiency|market inefficiencies]].

The '''joint hypothesis problem''' is the problem that testing for market efficiency is difficult, or even impossible.  Any attempts to test for market (in)efficiency must involve [[asset pricing models]] so that there are expected returns to compare to real returns.  It is not possible to measure 'abnormal' returns without expected returns predicted by pricing models.  Therefore, anomalous market returns may reflect market inefficiency, an inaccurate asset pricing model or both.

In sum, the joint hypothesis problem implies that market efficiency per se is not testable.

Large was also one of the finalists at the [[Ushant]] (Ouessant in French) Literary Contest in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacbayle.club.fr/livres/Nouveau/Large.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225011422/http://jacbayle.club.fr/livres/Nouveau/Large.html |archivedate=February 25, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in both French and [[Haitian Creole]]. Josaphat-Robert Large was a member of " La Société des Gens de Lettres de France" (Society of French intellectuals), of the "Association des Écrivains de langue française" (Association of writers of French origin) and of the [[PEN Club]] America. The Society of French and francophone teachers of America has organized two [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] on his literary production (specially his novels), one at [[Florida International University]] in 2001 and one at [[Fordham University]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fabula.org/actualites/article13777.php&lt;/ref&gt; Large also participated in the famous festival Étonnants-Voyageurs in 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etonnants-voyageurs.net/spip.php?article2305&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008, he was one of the author in the great [[literary]] opening organized in [[Port-au-Prince]] by the Presses Nationales d'Haiti (National Press of Haiti).

A '''lookout''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/hometime/glossary/frame.htm#lookout PBS Glossary - Framing - Lookout]&lt;/ref&gt; '''lookout rafter''' or '''roof outlooker'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.definition-of.com/roof+outlooker Definition-of.com Dictionary definition of roof outlooker]&lt;/ref&gt; is a wooden [[joist]] that extends in cantilever out from the exterior wall (or wall plate) of a building, supporting the [[roof]] sheathing and providing a nailing surface for the [[Fascia (architecture)|fascia]] boards.  When not exposed it serves to fasten the finish materials of the [[eaves]].

'''Maharashtri''' or '''Maharashtri Prakrit''' (''{{IAST|Mahārāṣṭri Prākṛt}}''), is a language of ancient and medieval [[India]] which is the ancestor of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Konkani language|Konkani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/konkaniweb/language-literature.htm |title=Roots of Konkani |publisher=Goa Konkani Akademi |language=English, Konkani |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828171254/http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/konkaniweb/language-literature.htm |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the many languages (often called dialects) of a complex called [[Prakrit]], and the chief [[Dramatic Prakrit]]. Maharashtri was spoken for 1000 years (500 BCE&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;V.Rajwade, ''Maharashtrache prachin rajyakarte''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Linguist List"&gt;[http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pmh The Linguist List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225003616/http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pmh |date=2009-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dr.Kolarkar, ''Marathyancha Itihaas''&lt;/ref&gt; to 500 CE). It was used in numerous works of literature, and its literary use was made famous by the Sanskrit playwright [[Kālidāsa]].&lt;ref name="The Linguist List" /&gt;

Maharashtri Prakrit was commonly spoken until 875 CE&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;V.Rajwade, ''Maharashtrache prachin rajyakarte''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Linguist List"&gt;[http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pmh The Linguist List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225003616/http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pmh |date=2009-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dr.Kolarkar, ''Marathyancha Itihaas''&lt;/ref&gt; and was the official language of the [[Satavahana dynasty]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Works like ''Karpurmanjari'' and ''Saptashati'' (150{{space}}BCE) were written in it. Maharashtri Prakrit was the most widely used Prakrit language in western and southern India.

Maharashtri [[apabhraṃśa]]s remained in use until the 13th century, and were widely used in [[Jainism#Jain literature|Jain literature]], forming an important link in the evolution of the language. This form of Apabhraṃśa was re-Sanskritised and eventually became Marathi.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==History==
The rise of the [[Prakrit]]s is dated to the middle of the second millennium BCE when they existed alongside Vedic [[Sanskrit]] and later evolved into highly developed literary languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dani|first1=A. H.|title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia|publisher=Unesco Publishing|isbn=92-3-102719-0|pages=357|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=6lPzhfNRZ9IC&amp;pg=PA357}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subject of scholarly debate as to whether Sanskrit or the Prakrits are older with some scholars contending that Sanskrit was born out of the Prakrits.&lt;ref name="EBPrakrit" /&gt; According to the Sanskrit scholar, Rajaramshastri Bhagawat, Maharashtri is older and more vivacious than Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Submission for Classical Status Of Marathi Language|date=November 2013|page=81|url=https://marathibhasha.maharashtra.gov.in/Site/pdf/english/main.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2017}} {{quote|Through many evidences Ketkar and Bhagwat have demonstrated that Marathi has not originated from Sanskrit but it is as old as Sanskrit. While highlighting the conclusion of research of Rajaramshastri Bhagwat, [[Durga Bhagwat]] (1979, p. 2) remarks, “He showed that old Mahārāṣṭrī is older and more vivacious than Sanskrit.” It is an important observation and view both as it comes from Rajaramshastri Bhagwat and Durgabai Bhagwat who were both scholars of Sanskrit and Marathi and their dialects, respectively.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2017}}

[[Vararuchi]], the oldest known grammarian of Prakrit, devotes four chapters of his ''Prakrita-Prakasha'' ({{IAST3|Prákṛita-Prakáśa}}) to the grammar of Maharashtri Prakrit. The other popular Prakrits—[[Shauraseni]], [[Ardhamagadhi]], and [[Paishachi]]—merit only one each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verma|first1=C.B.|last2=Varma|first2=C.B.|title=The Prakrit Bloom|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=2002|volume=46|issue=1 (207)|page=144|jstor=23344538}}&lt;/ref&gt; This preeminence of Maharashtri is confirmed by [[Daṇḍin|Dandin]] ({{flourished|6th–7th century}}) who, in his [[Kavyadarsha]], grants it the highest status among all Prakrits.&lt;ref name="EBPrakrit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prakrit languages|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Prakrit-languages|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Maharashtri is the most attested amongst all [[Prakrit]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book|title=Introduction to Prakrit|author=Alfred C. Woolner}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was spoken from [[Malwa]] and [[Rajputana]] (north) to the [[Krishna River]] and [[Tungabhadra River]] region (south).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Historians agree that Maharashtri and other Prakrit languages prevailed in what is now modern [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;V.Rajwade, ''Maharashtrache prachin rajyakarte''&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2017}}

Maharashtri was widely spoken in [[Western India]] and even as far south as [[Kannada language|Kannada]]-speaking region.&lt;ref&gt;C. V. Vaidya, ''History of Medieval Hindu India, Being a History of India from 600 to 1200 AD,'' in 3 vols.: Vol. I, p. 317.  {{ISBN|81-7020-438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early literature==
The ''[[Gaha Sattasai|Gāhā Sattasaī]]'' is attributed to King [[Hāla]] (r. 20-24 CE). Other Maharashtri Prakrit works include ''Setubandh'' and ''Karpuramañjarī''. The language was used by Vakpati to write the poem ''Gaüdavaho''.&lt;ref name="The Linguist List"&gt;[http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pmh The Linguist List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225003616/http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pmh |date=2009-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dr.Kolarkar, ''Marathyancha Itihaas''&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2017}} It is also used in the dialogue and songs of low-class characters in Sanskrit plays, especially the famous dramatist Kālidāsa.&lt;ref name="The Linguist List" /&gt;

==Royal patronage==
Maharashtri was the official language of the Satavahana dynasty in the early centuries of the [[Common Era]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Under the patronage of the Satavahana Empire, Maharashtri became the most widespread Prakrit of its time, and also dominated the literary culture amongst the three "Dramatic" Prakrits of the time, Maharashtri, Shauraseni and Magadhi. A version of Maharashtri called ''Jaina Maharashtri'' was also employed to write Jain scripture.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Marta Steinsvik''' (23 March 1877 – 27 July 1950) was a Norwegian author and translator. She was a champion of women's rights, a proponent of [[anti-semitism]] and [[anti-Catholicism]], and promoter of the use of [[Nynorsk]]. She was the first female to graduate from the [[MF Norwegian School of Theology|Norwegian School of Theology]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://libra.antropos.no/TC_Marta_Steinsvik.html ''Marta Steinsvik'' (Terje Christensen)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Steinsvik was born in [[Flekkefjord]]. he studied medicine in [[Oslo|Kristiania]], but never finished her studies because she was against [[vivisection]]. She studied several other subjects including [[Egyptology]] in [[London]]. In 1902, Marta Steinsvik studied oriental languages including [[Assyria]]n and ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]. She also became interested in [[Esotericism]]. She was influenced by the thinking of both English [[Theosophist]], [[Annie Besant]] and  Austrian [[philosopher]], [[Rudolf Steiner]]. She was the first woman to graduate from the Norwegian School of Theology, but was not allowed to practice. She was the first Norwegian woman to preach in a church, during 1910 at the [[Grønland Church]] in [[Oslo]]. She was invited to an international women's conference in [[Geneva]], and planned to give a talk on women priests, until the [[Pope]] forbade all [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] women to attend if she did, forcing her to give a speech on another subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Marta_Steinsvik ''Marta Steinsvik'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 she started writing in the newspaper, ''[[Den 17de Mai]]'', which had been started that same year by her future husband [[Rasmus Steinsvik]]. She was employed as secretary to [[Hans Tambs Lyche]], editor and founder of the cultural journal ''[[Kringsjaa]]'''. In 1910 she became editor of the paper ''Kringsjaa''. She was multilingual and translated several books into [[Nynorsk]], including ''[[Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc|Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc, by the Sieur Louis de Conte]]'' written by [[Mark Twain]] and ''Quo vadis?'' written by [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Den_17de_mai  ''Den 17de mai''  (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s she was active in spreading anti-semitism and was one of the most important proponents of anti-semitism in Norway. Among other things, she delivered lectures based on the [[Protocolls of the Elders of Zion.]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Marta_Steinsvik ''Marta Steinsvik'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 she published an anti-Catholic book ''Sankt Peters himmelnøkler'' ("Saint Peter's keys to Heaven").

Marta published ''Frimodige ytringer'', ("Frank Speech") in 1946. It was about the Norwegian treatment of suspects when they were punishing traitors after the [[Second World War]]. The book includes examples of [[Norwegian resistance movement]] torturing suspected [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizers in the summer of 1945. It also discussed the legality of withdrawing a group's human rights, (those who were members of [[Nasjonal Samling]], the Norwegian National Socialist party, after 9 April 1940), by an [[ex post facto]] law that set aside the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] which Norway had ratified.

The papers left behind on her death are currently being organised at the Norwegian cultural institution, [[The Blue Colour Works]]. Several people have announced their plans to write a book about Marta Steinsvik.

==Personal life==
She was born Marta Tonstad on the farm Skjeggestad in [[Bakke, Norway|Bakke]] ( now part of [[Flekkefjord]]) in the county of [[Vest-Agder]], [[Norway]]. Both of her parents Torkild Tonstad (1852–1908) and Ingeborg Evertsdatter Haugan (1848–1922) came from old farming families. Her father worked as a teacher in Flekkefjord and owned the farm Skjeggestad, where Marta lived until she was three years old.

On 16 May 1896, she married Rasmus Steinsvik (1863–1913), the founder and editor of ''Den 17de Mai''. She had problems in childbirth and her doctor told her a sixth child would be likely to kill her, so she moved away from her husband. Her husband had a friend who was a doctor who diagnosed her as insane as soon as he heard she believed in [[reincarnation]], and her husband had her committed. While institutionalized, she took the opportunity to study [[psychology]]. Another doctor became interested in her case and was able to get her released. This episode was often later used against her in newspaper debates. Her husband died in 1913 after an operation, barely 50 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Rasmus_Steinsvik/utdypning ''Rasmus Steinsvik'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''murder board''', also known as a "scrub-down",&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Safire|first1=William|title=On Language; Murder Board At the Skunk Works|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/11/magazine/on-language-murder-board-at-the-skunk-works.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a committee of questioners set up to critically review a proposal and/or help someone prepare for a difficult [[oral examination]].

The term originated in the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]], specifically from [[the Pentagon]],&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; but is also used in [[academic]] and government appointment contexts.  [[NASA]] contends the murder board was created by [[Hans Mark]], Director of [[NASA Ames|Ames Research Center]] from 1969 to 1977,&lt;ref&gt;http://history.arc.nasa.gov/hist_pdfs/bugos_nasa_sp2014_4314.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the earlier concept of the [[tiger team]].

In highly risk-averse, technical endeavors where extreme efforts are taken to prevent mistakes (e.g. satellite operations), murder boards are used to aggressively review, without constraint or pleasantries, a situation's problem, assumptions, constraints, mitigations, and the proposed solution.  The board's goal is to kill the well-prepared proposal on technical merit; holding back even the least suspicion of a problem is not tolerated.  Such argumentative murder boards consist of many subject matter experts of the specific system under review and of all interfacing systems.

In [[project management]], a murder board is a process where a committee asks questions from project representatives as part of the project selection process.&lt;ref&gt;Ashe, Kenneth, [https://kennethashe.com/project-management-murder-board/ The Project Management Murder Board], Accessed 11 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Politics of the United States|U.S. politics]], murder boards are used in preparing candidates for [[debate]]s and [[President of the United States|presidential]] [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|appointees]] for [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[Advice and consent|confirmation hearings]].

On April 20, 2010 representative [[Mary Jo Kilroy]] asked former Lehman Brothers CEO [[Dick Fuld]] if he had set up a murder board to prepare for his testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]] concerning the [[Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers|2008 Lehman Brothers failure]]. Fuld expressed confusion at the expression, apparently unfamiliar with the term. Fuld indicated that he had not set up a murder board after [[Barney Frank]] explained what it meant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-spanarchives.org/program/ID/222787&amp;start=6361&amp;end=6481 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313113821/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/program/ID/222787%26start%3D6361%26end%3D6481 |date=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nested quotation''' is a [[quotation]] that is encapsulated inside another quotation, forming a [[hierarchy]] with multiple levels.  When focusing on a certain quotation, one must interpret it within its scope.  Nested quotation can be used in literature (as in nested narration), speech, and computer science (as in "meta"-statements that refer to other statements as [[string (computer science)|strings]]).  Nested quotation can be very confusing until evaluated carefully and until each quotation level is put into perspective.

==In literature==
In languages that allow for nested quotes and use quotation mark punctuation to indicate direct speech, hierarchical quotation sublevels are usually punctuated by alternating between primary quotation marks and secondary quotation marks. For a comprehensive analysis of the major quotation mark systems employed in major writing systems, see [[Quotation mark]].

==In JavaScript programming==
Nested quotes often become an issue using the '''eval''' keyword&lt;ref&gt;https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[eval|eval function]] is a function that converts and interprets a string as actual [[JavaScript]] code, and runs that code.  If that string is specified as a [[string literal|literal]], then the code must be written as a quote itself (and [[escape character|escaped]] accordingly).

For example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;eval("var a=3; alert();");&lt;/pre&gt;

This code declares a variable '''a''', which is assigned the value '''3''', and a blank alert window is popped up to the user.

===Nested strings (level 2)===
Suppose we had to make a quote ''inside'' the quoted interpreted code.  In JavaScript, you can only have ''one'' unescaped quote sublevel, which has to be the ''alternate'' of the top-level quote. If the 2nd-level quote symbol is the same as the first-level symbol, these quotes must be escaped&lt;ref&gt;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp&lt;/ref&gt;. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;alert("I don't need to escape here");
alert('Nor is it "required" here');
alert('But now I do or it won\'t work');&lt;/pre&gt;

===Nested strings (level 3 and beyond)===
Furthermore, (unlike in the literature example), the third-level nested quote must be escaped in order not to conflict with ''either'' the first- or second-level quote delimiters. This is true regardless of alternating-symbol encapsulation. Every level after the third level must be '''[[recursion|recursively]]''' escaped for all the levels of quotes in which it is contained. This includes the escape character itself, the backslash (“\”), which is escaped by itself (“\\”).

For every sublevel in which a backslash is contained, it must be escaped for the level above it, and then all the backslashes used to escape that backslash as well as the original backslash, must be escaped, and so on and so forth for ''every'' level that is ascended. This is to avoid ambiguity and confusion in escaping.

Here are some examples that demonstrate some of the above principles:
&lt;pre&gt;
document.write("&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is the body of the document.");
document.writeln("&lt;/p&gt;");
document.write("&lt;p&gt;A newline in HTML code 
acts simply as whitespace, whereas a &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; starts a new line.");
document.write("&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n");

eval('eval(\"eval(\\\"alert(\\\\\\\"Now I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m confused!\\\\\\\")\\\")\")');
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the number of backslashes increase from 0 to 1 to 3 to 7 to 15, indicating a 2^n-1 rule for successively nested symbols.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1528">The production of the first [[coil stamp]]s, dating in the United States from 1908, began with the flat-plate-press printing of normal [[Sheet of stamps|stamp sheets]] which contained the standard 400 images.  The sheets were then gummed, perforated in one direction only, and cut in the other direction into twenty strips consisting of twenty stamps apiece.  Strips would subsequently be pasted together to produce coils of 500 or 1000 stamps. &lt;ref name="Johl"&gt;{{cite book |title=The United States Postage Stamps of the Twentieth Century, Volume I |year=1937 |publisher=H. L. Lindquist |first=Beverly |last=King |author2=Johl, Max}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; At each join, the paper from the end of one strip would overlap the beginning of the next (the overlap is termed a "paste-up tab").  A pair of stamps that straddles the join is known as a '''paste-up pair'''.

[[File:Paste-up pair of 1912 Washington 3-cent coil stamp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;U. S. Paste-up pair, 1912&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the mid-1920s, rotary presses came into use for printing stamps which used long rolls of paper rather than individual sheets, and this made the paste-up phase unnecessary, as sheets of any length could be produced by the press and merely needed to be cut into strips. &lt;ref name="Johl2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The United States Postage Stamps of the Twentieth Century, Volume III |year=1937 |publisher=H.

'''Prabodh Bechardas Pandit''' ({{lang-gu|પ્રબોધ બેચરદાસ પંડિત}}; 23 June 1923 - 28 November 1975) was an Indian [[Linguistics|linguist]] from [[Gujarat]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciil-ebooks.net/html/kelkar/html1/a23.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He published a total of ten books in the Gujarati language, along with many research papers published in various journals. In 1967, he received the Recipient of  [[Sahitya Akademi Award]], and in 1973, the [[Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak]], for his contribution to the study of Gujarati language and linguistics.

==Life==
Pandit was born on June 23, 1923, in Vala, a village in the [[Bhavnagar district]] of Gujarat. He studied at various institutions, including Pritamnagar municipal school of [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Amreli]]. He matriculated in 1939 from the [[Shri Damubhai Shukla Shaikshanik Sankul|Navchetan High School]], Ahmedabad. He initially missed out on graduate studies due to participating in the [[Quit India Movement|Indian independence movement of 1942]], which led to him being jailed for six months. He later completed his Bachelor of Arts in 1944 in the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Ardhamagadhi language|Ardhamagadhi]] languages, then attained his Master of Arts at [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Educational Trust|Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]] in 1946 in Sanskrit and [[Linguistics]]. Later, he went to [[London]] and joined the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]], where he worked under the guidance of linguist [[Ralph Lilley Turner]] for his doctorate. There, he obtained his Ph.D. in 1950 for his research on ''Shadavashyak-balavabodhvritti''. His interest in linguistics brought him into contact with [[Jules Bloch|Jules Bloch,]] who inspired him to study various Indian dialects.&lt;ref name="DattaLal2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amaresh Datta|author2=Mohan Lal|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Navaratri-Sarvasena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sOsbAAAAIAAJ|year=2007|edition=4th|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|location=New Delhi|pages=3071|isbn=978-81-260-1003-1|ignore-isbn-error=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gujarati Sahitya Parishad"&gt;{{cite web | title=સવિશેષ પરિચય: પ્રબોધ પંડિત, ગુજરાતી સાહિત્ય પરિષદ | website=Gujarati Sahitya Parishad | url=http://www.gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/sarjako/savishesh/Savishesh-Prabodh-Pandit.html | language=gu | access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to India, Pandit joined the L.D. Arts College, Ahmedabad, as a lecturer in Sanskrit. In 1957, he transferred to the [[Gujarat University]] as a Reader in the Linguistics department. From 1964 to 1965 he taught at the [[Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute|Deccan College]], [[Pune]]. In 1967, he went to [[Delhi]] and joined [[Delhi University]] as a lecturer of Linguistics where he remained until 1975. During this time he taught as a visiting lecturer at several academic institutions including the [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of Nairobi|Nairobi]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Cornell University|Cornell's]] respective [[universities]].&lt;ref name="DattaLal2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gujarati Sahitya Parishad"/&gt;

He published a total of ten books in the Gujarati language along with many research papers published in various journals. His most significant works are ''Prakrit Bhasha'' (1954), ''(/ɛ/) and (/ɔ/) in Gujarati'' (1955), ''Nasalization, Aspiration and Murmur in Gujarati'' (1957), ''Historical Phonology of Gujarati Vowels'' (1961), ''Borrowing: A Study of Linguistic Expression of Social Distance'' (1961), ''Gujarati Bhashanun Dhvaniswarup ane Dhvani-Parivartan'' (1966), ''Phonemic and Morphemic Frequencies of the Gujarati Language'' (1968), ''Some Observations Studies in Speech Analysis'' (1971) and ''Language in Plural Society'' (1976).&lt;ref name="DattaLal2007"/&gt;

'''Qazi Anwar Hussain''' (born 19 July 1936) is a well known and very famous Bangladeshi writer who mainly writes detective and adventure based novels most of which are adaptation translation from or heavily influenced by foreign literature.

==Family==
Hussain's father was a scientist and writer, [[Qazi Motahar Hossain]], a national professor. Anwar grew up in a literary environment. Some of the more famous members of his family includes his late brother Qazi Mahbub Husain, sister Zobaida Mirza (professor/author), his older sister [[Sanjida Khatun]] (singer/author), his younger sister [[Fahmida Khatun]] (singer/author), sister Mahmuda Khatun (singer), sons Qazi Maimur Husain and Qazi Shahnur Husain. Anwar Husain's wife was a singer [[Farida Yasmin (singer)|Farida Yasmin]].

==Background==
Hussain got his [[Master's Degree]] in Bengali literature and language from the [[University of Dhaka]]. As a graduation gift, he requested a printing press of his father. He then proceeded to lock himself in his room for hours at length. In the middle of 1960, he started a paperback publishing house called [[Sheba Prokashoni]] with four writers, three of whom were his own pen-names.  The publishing house is credited with publishing works of world literature, as well as original work. It has a long tradition.

==''Sheba Prokashoni''==
At first, Sheba meant Segun Bagicha, as well as service. Later, It meant only service. In 1971, the Pakistani militants burnt sheba. Sheba gave birth to many successful writers as Sheikh Abdul Hakim, Rakib Hasan, Niaz Murshed, Asaduzzaman, Masud Mahmud, Khosru Chowdhury, Tipu Kibriya, Anish Das Opu and many others. Sheba's Sister concern is Projapoti, the hard bound publisher.

In [[computing]], '''rebooting''' is the process by which a running computer system is restarted, either intentionally or unintentionally. Reboots can be either "cold" (alternatively known as "hard") where the power to the system is physically turned off and back on again, causing an [[Booting|initial boot]] of the machine, or '''warm''' (alternatively known as '''soft''') where the system restarts without the need to interrupt the power. The term '''restart''' is used to refer to a reboot when the [[operating system]] closes all programs and finalizes all pending input and output operations before initiating a soft reboot.

== Terminology ==
=== Origin of the term ===
Early electronic computers (like the [[IBM 1401]]) had no operating system and little internal memory. The input was often a stack of [[punch cards]]. The computer was initiated by pressing a start button that performed a single command, read a card. This first card then instructed the machine to read more cards that eventually loaded a user program. This process was likened to an old saying, "picking yourself up by the bootstraps", referring to a horseman who lifts himself off the ground by pulling on the straps of his boots. This set of initiating punch cards was called "bootstrap cards". Thus a cold start was called [[booting]] the computer up.  If the computer crashed, it was rebooted. The boot reference carried over to all subsequent types of computers. For more, see [[Bootstrapping]].

=== Cold vs. warm reboot ===
{{Anchor|Cold|Clean|Warm}}
{{Redirect|Cold boot|the attack called a "cold boot attack"|Cold boot attack}}
Technical sources describe two contrasting forms of reboot known as a cold reboot (also a cold boot, hard reboot or hard boot) and warm reboot (also soft reboot, or soft boot), although the definition of these forms can vary slightly between sources.

According to Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002),&lt;ref name="Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002)" /&gt; Cooper (2002),&lt;ref name="Cooper (2002)" /&gt; Tulloch (2002)&lt;ref name="Tulloch (2002)" /&gt; and Soper (2004),&lt;ref name="Soper (2004)" /&gt; on [[IBM PC compatible]] platform, a cold boot is a boot process in which the computer starts from a powerless state. All except Tulloch (2002) also mention that in cold boot, the system performs a [[power-on self-test]] (POST). In addition to the [[power switch]], Cooper (2002) and Soper (2004) also state that the [[reset button]], if present, may commence a cold reboot. Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002) contradicts this assertion and states that a reset button may commence either a cold or warm reboot, depending on the system. Microsoft Support article 102228&lt;ref name="Microsoft (2005)" /&gt; also confers that although the reset button is designed to perform a cold reboot, it may not disconnect the power to the motherboard – a state that does not correspond to the cold boot definition given above. According to Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002),{{rp|509}} both the operating system and third-party software can initiate a cold boot; the restart command in [[Windows 9x]] initiates a cold reboot, unless Shift key is held.

Finding a definition for warm boot, however, is more of a challenge. All aforementioned sources indicate that a warm boot is initiated by pressing [[Control-Alt-Delete|Ctrl + Alt + Delete]] key combination; all except Tulloch (2002) mention that a warm reboot does not perform POST. Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002) specifies that for a warm reboot to occur, [[BIOS]] must be the recipient of the key combination. Microsoft Support article 102228 takes a more technical approach and defines warm boot as the result of invoking [[INT (x86 instruction)|INT]] 19h, a [[BIOS interrupt call]], with the Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination being only one way of achieving this.&lt;ref name="Microsoft (2005)" /&gt; According to Grimes (2001),&lt;ref name="Grimes (2001)" /&gt; [[malware]] may prevent or subvert a warm boot by intercepting the Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination and prevent it from reaching BIOS. The [[Windows NT]] family of operating systems also does the same and reserves the key combination for its own use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination to open Windows Security opens Task Manager|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/281980|work=Microsoft Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=19 January 2013|date=15 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/01/24/359850.aspx |title=Why is Control-Alt-Delete the secure attention sequence (SAS)? |last=Osterman |first=Larry |work=Larry Osterman's WebLog |publisher=[[MSDN Blogs]] |date=24 January 2005 |accessdate=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soper (2004) asserts that the Windows "Restart" command initiates a warm boot, thus contradicting Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002), who believe the very same action performs a cold boot.

The [[Linux]] family of operating systems supports an alternative to warm boot; the Linux kernel has optional support for [[kexec]], a [[system call]] which transfers execution to a new kernel and skips hardware or firmware reset. The entire process occurs independently of the system firmware. The kernel being executed does not have to be a Linux kernel.

Outside the domain of IBM compatible PCs, the types of boot may not be as disambiguous. According to Sue Loh of [[Windows CE]] Base Team, Windows CE devices support three types of boots: Warm, cold and clean. A warm boot discards program memory. A cold boot additionally discards storage memory (also known as the "object store"), while a clean boot erases ''all'' forms of memory storage from the device. However, since these areas do not exist on all Windows CE devices, users are only concerned with two forms of reboot: one that resets the volatile memory and one that wipes the device clean and restores factory settings. For example, for a [[Windows Mobile 5.0]] device, the former is a cold boot and the latter is a clean boot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Loh|first=Sue|title=Boot Persistence Terminology|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ce_base/archive/2005/06/22/431699.aspx|work=Windows CE Base Team Blog|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=22 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hard reboot ===
{{Anchor|Hard|Soft|Quick}}
A hard reboot means that the system is not shut down in an orderly manner, skipping file system synchronisation and other activities that would occur on an orderly shutdown. This can be achieved by either applying a [[Reset (computing)|reset]], by cycling power, by issuing the {{code|lang=sh|halt -q}} command in most [[Unix-like]] systems, or by triggering a [[kernel panic]].

=== Restart ===
The term "restart" is used by [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]] family of operating systems to denote an operating system-assisted reboot. In a restart, the operating system ensures that all pending I/O operations are gracefully ended before commencing a reboot.

== Causes ==
=== Deliberate ===
[[File:PC-Netzteil (redundant).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Redundant power supplies in a computer system reduce the risk of an unexpected loss of power]]
Users may deliberately initiate a reboot. Rationale for such action may include:
*'''Troubleshooting:''' Rebooting may be used by users, support staff or system administrators as a technique to work around bugs in software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did you reboot|last=Debogue|first=Jean|url=http://www.wedebugyou.com/2012/07/did-you-reboot/|publisher=WeDebugYou}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[memory leak]]s or processes that [[Server hog|hog]] resources to the detriment of the overall system, or to terminate [[malware]]. While this approach does not address the root cause of the issue, resetting a system back to a good, known state may allow it to be used again for some period until the issue next occurs.
*'''Switching operating systems:''' On a [[multi-boot]] system without a [[hypervisor]], a reboot is required to switch between installed operating systems.
*'''Offensive:''' As stated earlier, components lose power during a cold reboot; therefore, components such as [[random-access memory|RAM]] that require power lose the data they hold. However, in a [[cold boot attack]], special configurations may allow for part of the system state, like a RAM disk, to be preserved through the reboot.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fS8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|work=InfoWorld|date=28 October 1985|title=Jram-3 Rivals Persyst Stretch In RAM Race of Add-On Boards|author=Ken Freeze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The means of performing a deliberate reboot also vary and may include:
*'''Manual, hardware-based:''' A power switch or [[reset button]] can cause the system to reboot.&lt;ref name="Cooper (2002)" /&gt; Doing so, however, may cause the loss of all unsaved data.&lt;ref name="Shelly, Vermaat (2012)" /&gt;
*'''Manual, software-based:''' Computer software and operating system can trigger a reboot as well; more specifically, [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems are outfitted with a restart command that closes open programs and eliminate data loss due to reboot.&lt;ref name="Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002)" /&gt;{{rp|509}}
*'''Automated:''' Software can be scheduled to run at a certain time and date; therefore, it is possible to schedule a reboot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gary A. Donahue|first=Gary A.|title=Network Warrior|year=2011|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|location=[[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]]|isbn=9781449309350|page=698|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power failure ===
Unexpected loss of power for any reason (including [[power outage]], [[power supply]] failure or depletion of [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] on a mobile device) forces the system user to perform a cold boot once the power is restored. Some [[BIOS]]es have an option to automatically boot the system after a power failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://europe.asrock.com/manual/775i65G%20R3.0.pdf|title=AsRock 775i65G User Manual|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.supermicro.com/CDR-C7_1.02_for_Intel_C7_platform/MANUALS/C7Q67.pdf|title=Supermicro C7Q67 User's Manual|page=69}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS), backup battery or redundant power supply can prevent such circumstances.

=== Random reboot{{anchor|Random}} ===
"Random reboot" is a non-technical term referring to an unintended (and often undesired) reboot following a [[Crash (computing)|system crash]], whose root cause may not immediately be evident to the user. Such crashes may occur due to a multitude of software and hardware problems, such as [[triple fault]]s.  They are generally symptomatic of an error in [[Ring (computer security)|ring 0]] that is not trapped by an [[Exception handling|error handler]] in an operating system or a hardware-triggered [[non-maskable interrupt]].

Systems may be configured to reboot automatically after a power failure, or a [[fatal system error]] or [[kernel panic]]. The method by which this is done varies depending whether the reboot can be handled in software, or must be handled at the firmware or hardware level.  Operating systems in the [[Windows NT]] family (from [[Windows NT 3.1]] through [[Windows 7]]) have an option to modify the behavior of the error handler so that a computer immediately restarts rather than displaying a [[Blue Screen of Death]] (BSOD) error message. This option is enabled by default on some editions.

== Hibernation ==
{{Main|Hibernation (computing)}}
The introduction of [[advanced power management]] allowed operating systems greater control of hardware power management features. With [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface]] (ACPI), newer operating systems are able to manage different power states and thereby sleep and/or [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernate]]. While hibernation also involves turning a system off then subsequently back on again, the operating system does not start from scratch, thereby differentiating this process from rebooting.

== Simulated reboot ==
A reboot may be simulated by software running on an operating system.  For example: the Sysinternals BlueScreen utility, which is used for pranking; or some modes of the &lt;tt&gt;bsod&lt;/tt&gt; [[XScreenSaver]] "hack", for entertainment (albeit possibly concerning at first glance). Malware may also simulate a reboot, and thereby deceive a computer user for some nefarious purpose.&lt;ref name="Grimes (2001)" /&gt;

[[Microsoft App-V]] sequencing tool captures all the file system operations of an installer in order to create a virtualized software package for users. As part of the sequencing process, it will detect when an installer requires a reboot, interrupt the triggered reboot, and instead simulate the required reboot by restarting services and loading/unloading libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/7/8/f784a197-73be-48ff-83da-4102c05a6d44/app-v/app-v%204.6%20service%20pack%201%20sequencing%20guide.docx Microsoft App-V 4.6 SP1 Sequencing Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Windows deviations and labeling criticism ==
[[Windows 8]] &amp; [[Windows 10|10]] enable (by default) a [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernation]]-like "Fast Startup" (a.k.a. "Fast Boot") which can cause problems (including confusion) for users accustomed to turning off computers to (cold) reboot them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/243901/the-pros-and-cons-of-windows-10s-fast-startup-mode/|title=The Pros and Cons of Windows 10’s "Fast Startup" Mode|author=Walter Glenn|date=3 March 2016|website=[[How-To Geek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/olivnie/2012/12/14/windows-8-fast-boot/|title=Windows 8: Fast Boot|author=Oliver Niehus|date=14 December 2012|website=MSDN - Oliver's Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/distinguishing-fast-startup-from-wake-from-hibernation|title=Distinguishing Fast Startup from Wake-from-Hibernation|website=Microsoft Hardware Dev Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5744">[[Image:L'Embarquement pour Cythere, by Antoine Watteau, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'', 1717, was [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]]'s reception piece for the ''[[Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture]]''.]]
In art, a '''reception piece''' is a work submitted by an artist to an academy for approval as part of the requirements for admission to membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=reception+piece&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300178236 reception pieces] ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online'', [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum]], 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6KxewynyN Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is normally representative of the artist's work, and the organization's judgement of its skill may or may not form part of the criteria for accepting a new entrant.  The work itself is usually retained by the academy, and many academies have large and valuable collections acquired in this way. Alternative terms include ''diploma work'' at the [[Royal Academy]] in London (where some 18th and 19th century examples are on display), ''diploma piece'', and in France at the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]], ''tableau de réception'' or ''morceau de réception''.  The term [[masterpiece]] originated in the same way under the earlier system of [[guild]]s, including [[Guild of Saint Luke|those for artists]]. 

==Origins==
The requirement to submit a reception or diploma piece is closely related to the practice in the [[medieval]] period and later of requiring a craftsman to submit one or more virtuoso or test-pieces to a [[guild]] to demonstrate his skill before he was granted membership.&lt;ref&gt;Chavannes, Meta. "masterpiece" in ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art''. Oxford University Press, 2001. Online edition, Oxford Reference. 2003. Retrieved 8 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joining an academy==
Membership of an academy may be by genre or technique and limited by numbers or age. The Royal Academy, London, for instance, at one time limited the number of engravers who could join, and where artistic styles and tastes change, new categories of membership may be created as necessary.

When [[Antoine Watteau]] applied to join the ''Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture'', there was no suitable category for his ''[[fête galante]]'' works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application, describing him as a "peintre des festes galantes".&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred, S. (Ed.) (2011) ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A global history''.  Enhanced 13th edn. Boston: Wadsworth, p. 755. {{ISBN|978-0-495-79986-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, M. &amp; D. (2010) "fête galante" in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms''. oxfordreference.com, [[Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While this acknowledged Watteau as the originator of the genre, it also prevented him being recognised as a [[History painting|history painter]], the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, later said: "The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Wine and Annie Scottez-De Wambrechies.

In 1728, when [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was admitted to the same academy for ''The Ray'', it was as a "painter of animals and fruits".&lt;ref&gt;Getlein, Mark. (2005) ''Gilbert's living with art''. 7th edition. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 422. {{ISBN|0072859342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red and blue pill.jpg|thumb|A red pill and a blue pill]]
{{wiktionary|red piller}}

The '''red pill''' and its opposite, the '''blue pill''', are a popular cultural [[meme]], a metaphor representing the choice between: 
*[[Knowledge]], [[freedom]], [[uncertainty]] and the brutal [[truth]]s of [[reality]] (red pill) 
*[[Security]], [[happiness]], [[beauty]], and the [[blissful ignorance effect|blissful ignorance]] of [[illusion]] (blue pill) 

The terms, popularized in [[science fiction]] culture, are directly derived from the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]''. However, it is speculated that the scriptwriters may have borrowed the idea from the 1865 [[Lewis Carroll]]'s novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'', in which the central character has a choice to drink or eat potions to enable her adventure to continue. In the Matrix, the main character [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by rebel leader [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]. The red pill represented an uncertain future—it would free him from the enslaving control of the machine-generated [[dream world (plot device)|dream world]] and allow him to escape into the real world, but living the "truth of reality" is harsher and more difficult. On the other hand, the blue pill represented a beautiful [[prison]]—it would lead him back to ignorance, living in confined comfort without want or fear within the [[simulated reality]] of the Matrix.

On December 1, 1969 the [[Selective Service System]] of the United States conducted two lotteries to determine the order of call to military service in the [[Vietnam War]] for men born from January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950. The 366 days of the year (including February 29) were printed on slips of paper. These pieces of paper were then each placed in opaque blue plastic capsules that resembled large blue pills. The blue pills were then mixed in a shoebox and then dumped into a deep glass jar. The blue pills were then drawn from the jar one at a time and opened. The order that each birthdate was drawn signified the draft order for that birthdate. From this first draft lottery, 195 birth dates were selected to serve in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Selective Service System |url=http://www.sss.gov/LOTTER8.HTM |title=1970 Draft Lottery Results drawn December 1, 1969 sorted by date |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915232321/http://www.sss.gov/LOTTER8.HTM |archivedate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' (1979)===
[[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' features a pair of characters who "push-into" and "pop-out of" the two-dimensional world of [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] prints. The way they do this is to drink from a blue or a red phial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Douglas Hofstadter – Little Harmonic Labyrinth |url=https://genius.com/Douglas-hofstadter-little-harmonic-labyrinth-annotated |work=''[[Genius (website)|Genius]]'' |location=New York City |accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofstadter2000_116"&gt;{{cite book |author=Douglas R.

Hofstadter cites [[Lewis Carroll]] as a strong influence on the book (the front cover of the book has a line that says that the book is "in the spirit of Lewis Carroll".) The "push-into" and "pop-out of" phials are reminiscent of the ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' "drink me" and "eat me" potion and cake, which cause Alice to shrink and grow.

===''Total Recall'' (1990)===
The [[science fiction]] film ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) features a red pill which is offered to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s character, Douglas Quaid, by one Dr. Edgemar. He is told "it's a symbol, of your desire to return to reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Parker (psychologist) |title=Psychology, Science Fiction and Postmodern Space |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/008124639602600303 |journal=South African Journal of Psychology |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]] |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |date=September 1996 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=143−149 |doi=10.1177/008124639602600303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[YouTube]] |title=''Total Recall'' - The Red Pill |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWfh0OuTKKE |date=April 20, 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No blue pill is present in the film, and the story centers on the uncertainty of whether Quaid is dreaming or in the real world. However, the pill is offered to him with the claim that he {{em|is}} dreaming, and that the pill will return him to reality, with the words "inside your dream, you'll fall asleep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Ian |title=Psychoanalytic Culture.

''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), directed by [[The Wachowskis]], makes references to historical myths and philosophy, including [[gnosticism]], [[existentialism]], and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/24/arts/24MATR.html|title=Philosophers Draw on the Film 'Matrix'|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=May 24, 2003|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/gnostic.htm|title=Journal of Religion &amp; Film: Wake Up!

Japanese director [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' was a strong influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Matrix Virtual Theatre'' (interview with the Wachowskis)| publisher=''[[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studios]]'', Official Website | url=http://www.warnervideo.com/matrixevents/wachowski.html |date=1999-11-06| accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Matrix'', [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]) hears rumors of the Matrix and a mysterious man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]. Neo spends his nights at his home computer trying to discover the secret of the Matrix and what the Matrix is. Eventually, another hacker, [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]), introduces Neo to Morpheus.

Morpheus ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) explains to Neo that the Matrix is an illusory world created to prevent humans from discovering that they are slaves to an external influence. Holding out a capsule on each of his palms, he describes the choice facing Neo:

{{quotation|This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the {{em|red}} pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.}}

As narrated, the blue pill will allow the subject to remain in the fabricated reality of the Matrix; the red serves as a "location device" to locate the subject's body in the real world and to prepare him or her to be "unplugged" from the Matrix. Once one chooses the red or blue pill, the choice is irrevocable.

Neo takes the red pill and awakens in the real world, where he is forcibly ejected from the liquid-filled chamber in which he has been lying unconscious. After his rescue and convalescence aboard Morpheus's ship, Morpheus shows him the true nature of the Matrix: a detailed computer simulation of Earth at the end of the 20th century (the actual year, though not known for sure, is approximately two hundred years later). It has been created to keep the minds of humans docile while their bodies are stored in massive power plants, their body heat and [[bioelectricity]] consumed as power by the sentient machines that have enslaved them.

In a 2012 interview, [[The Wachowskis|Lana Wachowski]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviecitynews.com/2012/10/dp30-cloud-atlas-screenwriterdirectors-lana-wachowski-tom-tykwer-andy-wachowski/|title=DP/30: Cloud Atlas, Screenwriter/Directors Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski|at=18:49|last=Poland|first=David|publisher=moviecitynews.com|date=October 13, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|source=Lana Wachowski, ''Movie City News'', October 13, 2012|quote=What we were trying to achieve with the story overall was a shift, the same kind of shift that happens for Neo, that Neo goes from being in this sort of cocooned and programmed world, to having to participate in the construction of meaning to his life. And we're like, "Well, can the audience go through the three movies and experience something similar to what the main character experiences?" So the first movie is sort of classical in its approach. The second movie is deconstructionist, and it assaults all of the things that you thought to be true in the first movie, and so people get very upset, and they're like "Stop attacking me!" in the same way that people get upset with deconstructionist philosophy. I mean, Derrida and Foucault, these people upset us. And then the third movie is the most ambiguous, because it asks you to actually participate in the construction of meaning...}}

==Analysis==
An essay written by [[Russell Blackford]] discusses the red and blue pills, questioning whether if a person were fully informed they would take the red pill, opting for the real world, believing that the choice of physical reality over a digital simulation is not so beneficial as to be valid for all people. Both Neo and another character, Cypher ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), take the red pill over the blue pill, though later in the first ''Matrix'' film, the latter demonstrates regret for having made that choice, saying that if Morpheus fully informed him of the situation, Cypher would have told him to "shove the red pill right up [his] ass." When Cypher subsequently makes a deal with the machines to return to the Matrix and forget everything he had learned, he says, "Ignorance is bliss." Blackford argues that the ''Matrix'' films set things up so that even if Neo fails, the taking of the red pill is worthwhile because he lives and dies authentically. Blackford and science-fiction writer [[James Patrick Kelly]] feel that ''The Matrix'' stacks the deck against machines and their simulated world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vX7HCkNTv0wC&amp;pg=PA169|title=Jacking in to the Matrix franchise: cultural reception and interpretation|isbn=978-0-8264-1588-2|author1=Kapell, Matthew|author2=Doty, William G|date=2004-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Matrix Warrior: Being the One'' author [[Jason Horsley|Jake Horsley]] compared the red pill to [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], citing a scene where Neo forms his own world outside of the Matrix. When he asks Morpheus if he could return, Morpheus responds by asking him if he would want to. Horsley also describes the blue pill as [[addiction|addictive]], calling ''The Matrix'' series a continuous series of choices between taking the blue pill and not taking it. He adds that the habits and routines of people inside the Matrix are merely the people dosing themselves with the blue pill. While he describes the blue pill as a common thing, he states that the red pill is one of a kind, and something someone may not even find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-FfxGSgdnsC&amp;pg=PA125|title=Matrix Warrior: Being the One|isbn=978-0-312-32264-9|author1=Horsley, Jake|date=2003-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Art of the Start]]'', author Guy Kawasaki uses the red pill as an analogue to the situation of leaders of new organizations, in that they face the same choice to either live in reality or fantasy. He adds that if they want to be successful, they have to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gXlwJnnNoEC&amp;pg=PA92|title=The art of the start: the time-tested, battle-hardened guide for anyone starting anything|isbn=978-1-59184-056-5|author1=Kawasaki, Guy|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Blue Pill (software)|Blue Pill]] [[rootkit]] ("[[malware]]")—named in reference to the pill as are the Red Pill techniques used to combat it—is a special type of software that utilizes the virtualization techniques of modern [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) to execute as a [[hypervisor]]; as a virtual platform on which the entire operating system runs, it is capable of examining the entire state of the machine and to cause any behavior with full privilege, while the operating system "believes" itself to be running directly on physical hardware, creating a parallel to the illusory Matrix. Blue Pill describes the concept of infecting a machine while Red Pill techniques help the operating system to detect the presence of such a hypervisor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joanna Rutkowska]].

* In cybersecurity, a red pill is any means of detecting [[hooking]] or [[virtualization]]. It is frequently used by [[anti-cheat]], [[antirootkit]] software, [[malware]], and [[digital rights management]], etc. Red pills usually make use of [[real-time clock]]s to measure the time it takes for [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements#Virtualization theorems|critical operations]] and interactions with peripheral hardware to occur, and compare the length of them with the expected length of such operations as they occur without virtualization. If the clock is compromised, the hypervisor can hide its presence by slowing the clock down in a controlled way, to hide the extra time imposed by virtualization. 
* Until they were removed from the [[Maemo]] operating system application installer in January 2010, certain advanced features were unlocked by a "Red Pill Mode" [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] to prevent accidental use by novice users but make them readily available to experienced users. This was activated by starting to add a catalog whose URL was "matrix" and then choosing to cancel. A dialog box would appear asking "Which pill?" with the choices "Red" or "Blue", allowing the user to enter red pill mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.maemo.org/index.php?title=Red_Pill_mode&amp;oldid=26816|title=Red Pill mode|work=maemo.org wiki|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mxr.maemo.org/fremantle/source/hildon-application-manager/src/repo.cc#153|title=src/repo.cc|work=hildon-application-manager|at=Line 153|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Red Pill" mode, the installer allows the user to view and reconfigure system packages whose existence it normally does not acknowledge. In Blue Pill mode the installer displays only software installed by a user, creating the illusion that system software does not exist on the system.
* The choice between taking a blue or red pill is a central metaphor in the 2011 [[Arte]] documentary film ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'', in which philosophers including [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Nina Power]] explore solutions to the global [[Great Recession|economic and financial crisis of 2008–09]]. The film also contains an animated parody of the red/blue pill scene in ''The Matrix'', with [[Leon Trotsky]] as Morpheus and [[Karl Marx]] as Neo.&lt;ref name="Marx Reloaded"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybvsZ7YjBL0 | title=Marx Reloaded trailer  | accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dwight Robert Ladd Jr''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 5 March 1947), is a [[Linguistics|linguist]] and retired academic specialising in [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]]. From 1997 to 2011, he was Professor of Linguistics at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

== Career ==
Dwight Robert Ladd Jr, known professionally as D. Robert Ladd, was born on 5 March 1947 and studied at [[Brown University]], graduating in 1968 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[linguistics]]. After spending two years in the [[United States Army|US Army]], he studied at [[Cornell University]] (1970–72) to complete a [[Master of Arts]] degree in linguistics. After a year lecturing at the [[Heidelberg University]], he returned to Cornell in 1975 to carry out doctoral studies, and was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1978 for his thesis "The structure of intonational meaning". Having spent a year lecturing at Cornell, he lectured at the [[Babeș-Bolyai University|University of Cluj]] as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholar]] (1978–79), before holding a number of short-term positions at Cornell (1979–80, 1984), the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1980–81), [[Bucknell University]] (1980–81), the [[University of Giessen]] (1981–83) and the [[University of Sussex]] (1983–84), before being appointed a lecturer in the Department of Linguistics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1985. He was promoted to a [[Reader (academic rank)|readership]] there in 1989, and then to a professorship in linguistics in 1997. Ladd retired in 2011 and became an [[emeritus]] professor and honorary professorial fellow at Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~bob/ "D.

Retrieved 2 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his British Academy profile, Ladd's research focuses on "phonology and phonetics, and the relation between them ('laboratory phonology')", as well as "intonation and prosody, including focus, emotion, pitch perception, tone languages, and links between language and music".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Honours and awards ==

A [[Dramatic Prakrit]], '''Shauraseni''' was the chief [[language]] used in drama in northern [[middle kingdoms of India|medieval India]]. Most of the material in this language originates from the 3rd to 10th centuries, though it was probably a spoken vernacular around the 2nd century BCE in the ancient state of [[Surasena]]. Among the [[Prakrit]]s, Shauraseni is said to be the one most closely related to [[Classical Sanskrit]] in that it "is derived from the Old Indian dialect of the [[Madhyadesa|Madhyadeśa]] on which Classical Sanskrit was mainly based."&lt;ref name="woolner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woolner|first1=Alfred C.|title=Introduction to Prakrit|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontopr00woolrich|publisher=University of the Punjab|accessdate=2 March 2016|location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-4}} Its descendants include the languages of the [[Hindi Belt]], the Central Zone of modern Indic or [[Hindi languages]], the standard registers of the [[Hindustani language]] based on the [[Khariboli dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=psu&lt;/ref&gt;

Jain [[acharya]]s belonging to the [[Digambara]] sect wrote in Shauraseni. The ''[[Satkhandagama|Ṣaṭkhaṅḍāgama]]'' and the ''[[Kasayapahuda|Kāsāyapahuḍa]]'' are two major Jain epics in Shauraseni.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Relation with other Prakrits==
Shauraseni is said to be the most similar to [[Classical Sanskrit]] out of all the Prakrits.&lt;ref name="woolner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woolner|first1=Alfred C.|title=Introduction to Prakrit|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontopr00woolrich|publisher=University of the Punjab|accessdate=2 March 2016|location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

'''Shemale''' (also known as '''she-male''') is a term primarily used in [[sex work]] to describe a [[transgender woman]] with male [[genitalia]] and female [[secondary sex characteristics]], usually including [[breasts]] from [[breast augmentation]] or use of [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormones]].

Many [[transgender]] people regard the term ''shemale'' as offensive, arguing that it mocks or shows a lack of respect towards transgender individuals;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ignatavicius |first1=Donna J. |last2=Workman |first2=M.

Using the term ''shemale'' for a [[transsexual]] woman often implies that she is working in the [[sex trade]].&lt;ref name="castaneda"/&gt; The phrase is commonly used in [[Transsexual pornography|pornography]].&lt;ref name="lennard"/&gt;

The term ''shemale'' has been used since the mid-19th century, when it was a humorous [[colloquialism]] for ''female'', especially an aggressive woman.

==Academic use==
Some [[biologist]]s have used ''shemale'' to refer to male non-human animals displaying female traits or behaviors, such as female pheromones being given off by male reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shine | first1 = R. | last2 = Phillips | first2 = B. | last3 = Waye | first3 = H. | last4 = LeMaster | first4 = M. | last5 = Mason | first5 = R.

Crews, ''Hormones, brain and behavior: Biology of the reptilia'', vol. 13, physiology E, pp. 70-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist and Darwin-critic, [[Joan Roughgarden]], rejected use of the term in the reptile literature, as she says it is "degrading and has been borrowed from the porn industry."&lt;ref name="flam"&gt;[[Faye Flam|Flam, Faye]] (2008).''The Score: How the Quest for Sex Has Shaped the Modern Man. ''Avery, {{ISBN|978-1-58333-312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that ''gynomorphic male'' and ''andromorphic female'' are preferred in scientific literature, adding, "I hope future work on these animals is carried out with more professionalism."&lt;ref name="roughgarden"&gt;Roughgarden, Joan (2005).

In Japan, the term ''New Half'' is used for trans people.

In 1979, [[Janice Raymond]] employed the term as a derogatory descriptor for transsexual women in her controversial book, ''The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male''.&lt;ref name="raymond"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Raymond |first=J. |title=The Transsexual Empire |year=1994 |publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University |place=New York |isbn=0-8077-6272-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond and other [[cultural feminism|cultural feminists]] like [[Mary Daly]] argue that a "she-male" or "male-to-constructed female" is still male and constitutes a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] attack by males upon the female [[essentialism|essence]].&lt;ref name="daly"&gt;Daly, Mary (1985).

In addition to its use in pornography, the term has been used as a [[punch line]] or for rhetorical effect.

Film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] has written about the lack of "real women" in summer blockbusters, claiming [[Judd Apatow]] comedies feature men who act more like leading ladies: "These aren't the she-males you find in the back pages of ''[[The Village Voice]]'', mind you. The Apatow men hit the screen anatomically intact: they’re emasculated but not castrated, as the repeated images of the flopping genitals in ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'' remind you."&lt;ref name="dargis2009"&gt;Dargis, Manola (May 4, 2008).

The word came under extreme criticism when it was used during episode four of RuPaul's Drag Race Season 6. Logo TV, the show's broadcast station, released a statement on April 14, 2014 saying: "We wanted to thank the community for sharing their concerns around a recent segment and the use of the term 'she-mail' on Drag Race. Logo has pulled the episode from all of our platforms and that challenge will not appear again. Furthermore, we are removing the 'You've got she-mail' intro from new episodes of the series. We did not intend to cause any offense, but in retrospect we realize that it was insensitive.

      <comment>Changing [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]] from "audible feedback to the speaker in a telecommunications system" to "audible feedback to the speaker using a telecommunications system" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4963">{{short description|audible feedback to the speaker using a telecommunications system}}
'''Sidetone''' is audible feedback to someone speaking when using a handset or headset as an indication of an active transmission.  The term is often used in the [[telecommunication]] field.

==Telephony==
In [[telephony]], sidetone is the effect of sound picked up by the telephone's transmitter (mouthpiece) and instantly introduced at a low electronic signal level into the receiver (earpiece) of the same handset, a form of [[feedback]]. 

Sidetone in 19th century telephones varied until the [[carbon microphone|carbon transmitter]] was used, which produced a distinct sidetone that discouraged speaking loudly enough, and occasionally so loud as to cause the instrument to produce uncontrolled oscillations, resulting in ''howling'' audio effects. Sidetone is disabled when phones of any kind are running in [[speakerphone]] mode, due to perpetual and almost immediate feedback. '''Anti-sidetone''' circuitry incorporating the principle of the [[hybrid coil]] brought sidetone under control in the early 20th century, leaving enough feedback signal to assure the user that the phone is really working, and allowing the use of a unitized [[Transceiver#Telephony|telephone handset]]. In cellular technologies, one of the many benefits of sidetone-enabled phones is that a user knows a call has been dropped or ended if he or she no longer hears sidetone. [[Comfort noise]] provides a similar benefit.

Almost all land-line (wired and wireless) phones have employed sidetone, so naturally it was an expected convention for cellular telephony but is not standard by any means. Usability experts believe that lack of adequate sidetone causes some people to shout or speak too loudly when using a cell phone (this behavior is sometimes referred to as "cell yell").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Donald A. |last=Norman |url=http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/minimizing_the.html |title=Minimizing the annoyance of the mobile phone |publisher=jnd.org |date=2005 |accessdate=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Siegel |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4229967 |title=What's Behind Shouting on Cell Phones? |publisher=NPR |date=2004-12-15 |accessdate=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sidetone is valuable for the hearing impaired. The amount of sidetone typically found on land-lines is 8%, and is 4% for cellular phones. Sidetone can be, and often is, amplified for land-line phones for the hearing impaired. In [[Voice over IP|VOIP]] technologies such as [[Skype]], sidetone has been experimented with but has not been formally adopted by software or hardware &amp; accessories creators. Several software packages and wiring workarounds have been developed that replicate sidetone, but feedback looping remains a problem.

==Radiotelegraphy==
In [[wireless telegraphy]] (WT) and [[amateur radio]], sidetone is the audible indication of a [[continuous wave]] (CW) signal as the operator sends [[Morse Code]].  As in telephony, sidetone serves as feedback to the operator that what they are sending is what is intended.  

It is designed to mimic the tone generated by a typical radio receiver when a CW signal is converted to the [[intermediate frequency]] (IF), then mixed with the [[Beat frequency oscillator]] (BFO) frequency to generate a ''difference frequency'', which is audible over the radio receiver loudspeaker or headphones.

Sidetone is also used on voice radio equipment to give the radio operator confidence that they are transmitting over the radio. The sidetone audio is typically derived from the transmit audio circuitry.

==Aviation==
In aviation audio systems the loudness of the sidetone heard in a helmet or headset may be adjusted to suit personal comfort, although this may lead to communication problems since the person speaking  will be largely unaware of how his transmission sounds to the recipient. The ideal level for the right psychoacoustic behavior is reported to be about 7dB below the received audio, according to [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|RTCA]] specification DO-214. If the headset signal level is set too high, the pilot will inevitably speak more softly, resulting in too low a level of modulation to the radio transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/commercial/Avionics-System-Design-Huh-What-Did-He-Say_12875.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public address systems==
When a commentator, [[announcer]], or [[MC]] for a public event may otherwise be able to hear their own voice in the delayed output from the loudspeakers, they may opt to use a headset which provides instant sidetone of their own voice, thus removing the distracting effect of greatly delayed feedback from the loudspeakers.

[[Image:Sultammahmut Toraygirov monumant.jpg|250px|thumb|A memorial to Sultanmahmut Toraygirov located on the street of [[Pavlodar]] named after him. Author of the monument: sculptor [[Yesken Sergebayev]]]]
'''Sultanmahmut Toraygirov''' ({{lang-kz|Сұлтанмахмұт Торайғыров}}, 29 October 1893 − 21 May 1920) was a prominent [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] writer and poet. He was born in Qyzyl Tau (near the city of [[Kokshetau]]) but moved to [[Bayanaul, Pavlodar|Bayanaul]] in the [[Pavlodar Province|province of Pavlodar]] at the age of four. Toraygirov wrote his first poems when only 13 years old. From 1913 on, he was the sub-editor for the first Kazakh journal ''Aikap''. In 1914 and 1915 he worked as a teacher in [[Bayanaul, Pavlodar|Bayanaul]]. In 1916 Toraygirov moved to [[Tomsk]] in Russia, but the next year the [[February Revolution]] made him return to [[Semey]], in Kazakhstan. During this time he developed his style and wrote prolifically.

Toraygirov released several poem collections and his novel ''Beauty Kamar'', released posthumously in 1933, was one of the first [[Kazakh language]] novels. He was very active politically, advocating both Kazakh national interests and the new [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] ideals. However, he died in 1920, at the age of only 26, and therefore couldn't witness the birth of the [[Soviet Union]].

The state university in [[Pavlodar]] is named after Toraygirov.

'''The rhetorical presidency''' is a political [[communication theory]] that describes the communication and government style of [[U.S. president]]s in the twentieth century. This theory describes the transition from a presidency that directed rhetoric toward the [[United States Congress]] and other government bodies, to one that addresses rhetoric, policy and ideas directly to the public.

After [[political scientists]] introduced this theory in 1981&lt;ref name="Caesar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ceaser|first=James W.|author2=Glen E. Thuerow |author3=Jeffrey Tulis |author4=Joseph M Bessette |title=The Rise of the Rhetorical Presidency|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|date=Spring 1981|volume=11|issue=2|pages=158–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Jeffrey Tulis authored ''The Rhetorical Presidency'' in 1987 establishing itself as the first book on the theory. Tulis established three stages in his book how presidential rhetoric evolved throughout the U.S.' history: the "''Old Way''", the "''Middle Way''" and the "''New Way''".&lt;ref name="Tulis"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey |last=Tulis|title=The Rhetorical Presidency|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GRx5sYilShIC}}|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-02295-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulis's book sparked much debate over the historical evolution of presidential rhetoric. Presidential rhetoric integrates both verbal and visual rhetoric practices to gather the support of the public. 
== History ==
The term "rhetorical presidency" was introduced by [[political scientists]] James Ceaser, Glen E. Thurow, Jeffrey Tulis, and Joseph Bessette in 1981.&lt;ref name="Caesar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ceaser|first=James W.|author2=Glen E. Thuerow |author3=Jeffrey Tulis |author4=Joseph M Bessette |title=The Rise of the Rhetorical Presidency|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|date=Spring 1981|volume=11|issue=2|pages=158–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulis wrote the foundational book on the subject entitled ''The Rhetorical Presidency'', in 1987. Tulis' book spurred heated debate on the history and evolution of presidential rhetoric,{{By whom|date = March 2014}} with Tulis himself later revising positions{{Elucidate|date = March 2014}} taken in his book.

By relying less on the traditional methods of communication with Congress and, Presidents rely more on the approval of the people as a means of governance. Presidents hope the people put pressure on their members of Congress to side with the President.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McFarlane |first1=Megan D. |title=Visualizing the Rhetorical Presidency: Barack Obama in the Situation Room |journal=Visual Communication Quarterly |date=January 1, 2016 |volume=23 |issue=No. 1 |pages=3-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Development ==
He claimed that changes in the rhetorical style of the presidency were a symptom of a shift in American's underlying conceptions regarding how government should function. Rhetorical presidency cut congressional dominion, influenced the power to fit public policy, and put the president in front with the American people to show the development of leadership as an imperative demeanor of presidential character and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillespie|first1=Andra|title=Whose Black Politics? Cases in Post-Racial Black Leadership|date=December 23, 2009|publisher=Routledge|page=157|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetorical presidency is both a structural theory and a theory of how presidents communicate in the media age. It draws from political science, history and communication studies.&lt;ref name="Medhurst1996"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin J.|last=Medhurst|title=Beyond the Rhetorical Presidency|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=frR3AAAAMAAJ|p=XI}}|year=1996|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|isbn=978-0-89096-710-2 |p=XI=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tulis delineates the historical arc of presidential rhetoric in the United States as having three stages: the "''Old Way''", the "''Middle Way''" and the "''New Way''".

The Old Way (1789–1900) corresponds with traditional conventions of [[Power in international relations|statecraft]] and rhetoric addressed to Congress, the courts or visiting dignitaries. Most presidential rhetoric was delivered in writing. The only attempt during this period to use rhetoric to address the whole people was President [[Andrew Johnson|Andrew Johnson's]] [[Swing Around the Circle]], which failed.&lt;ref name="Tulis"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey |last=Tulis|title=The Rhetorical Presidency|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GRx5sYilShIC}}|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-02295-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle Way (1900–1913) marks a hybrid between internal and external appeals on important matters epitomized by the presidency of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He met fierce opposition from his own party in Congress regarding the [[Hepburn Act]], with appeals directly to the people.&lt;ref name=Tulis /&gt; [[William McKinley]]'s 1898 speaking tour is argued to be an integral part of developing the "''Middle Way''" that Theodore Roosevelt is mainly credited for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladin |first1=John |title=William McKinley and the Rhetorical Presidency |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |date=March 3, 2011 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=119-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Way (1913–present) refers to a presidency which dispenses with traditional statecraft and instead regularly engages the public. [[Woodrow Wilson]] employed two types of rhetoric: the policy speech and the visionary speech. A policy speech explains and defends the president's policy on a certain issue, while the visionary speech articulates a goal for the future and calls the nation towards that goal. Since Wilson, all Presidents have emphasized these tools.&lt;ref name=Tulis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Roderick P.|title=Beyond the Rhetorical Presidency|year=1996|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|location=College Station|isbn=0-89096-710-5|pages=77–103|author2=Kathleen E. Kendall |editor=Martin J. Medhurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Verbal and Visual Rhetoric ==
Verbal rhetoric used by Presidents is the most common type of presidential rhetoric used. The implication of Woodrow Wilson's policy speeches and visionary speeches laid the groundwork for the following Presidents. The use of the [[State of the Union Address]] is an example of Presidents explaining and defending their own policies to gain the support of the public directly. 

Using visual images, text and video to influence or persuade an audience is how Presidents utilize [[visual rhetoric]] in their own presidential rhetoric. The increasing growth of the mass media has increased the value of visual rhetoric in helping create a positive political image with the people.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McFarlane |first1=Megan D. |title=Visualizing the Rhetorical Presidency: Barack Obama in the Situation Room |journal=Visual Communication Quarterly |date=January 1, 2016 |volume=23 |issue=No. 1 |pages=3-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ben hands off to Willie.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] wearing their 75th year "Throwback" uniforms.]]

'''Throwback uniforms''', '''throwback jerseys''' or '''retro kits''' or '''heritage guernseys''' are [[sports uniform]]s styled to resemble the uniforms that a team wore [[Retro style|in the past]]. One-time or limited-time retro uniforms are sometimes produced to be worn by teams in games, on special occasions such as anniversaries of significant events.

Throwback uniforms have proven popular in all major pro and college sports in North America, not only with fans, but with the teams' merchandising departments. Because the "authentic" uniforms (accurate reproductions) and less-authentic "replicas" had been so popular at retail, the professional leagues institutionalized throwbacks as "[[third jersey]]s".

== Background ==
Throwbacks were first popularized in [[Major League Baseball]], where teams not only wore renditions of their past styles, but also tributes to defunct [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] and [[Negro League]] baseball teams as well. Often, the games where teams will wear throwbacks are promoted as ''"Turn Back The Clock Nights"''. Throwbacks also make frequent appearances every season in [[college football]] games, [[National Hockey League]] games, and in [[National Basketball Association]] games.

The first companies to produce throwback uniforms were Tiedman &amp; Company Sportswear (college football, basketball, hockey, NFL and [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] soccer), Mitchell &amp; Ness (Major League Baseball), and Ebbets Field Flannels (Negro League baseball). All three companies are still in business; Tiedman &amp; Company relaunched in 2009 under the brand name Tiedman &amp; Formby [[Vintage (design)|Vintage]] Athletic Co..

In some instances, teams will wear "fauxbacks": retro designed uniforms harkening back to an era which pre-dates the team itself. For example, the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], formed in 1998, wore 1979-style baseball uniforms in 2012 (although they have used [[Tampa Tarpons]] and [[Tampa Smokers]] throwback jerseys),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chriscreamer.com/logo.php?id=egltsw8ih6uwg1iw7536i8lxu|title=Tampa Bay Rays Wordmark Logo – American League (AL) – Chris Creamer's Sports Logos Page – SportsLogos.Net|work=chriscreamer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dallas Mavericks]] have used a 1970s-like basketball uniform since 2004, despite having been established in 1980.  Fauxback can also refer to a retro style "vintage inspired" uniform that has design elements from a uniform from the past but is in itself a completely new and different design due to cosmetic adjustments.  An example of this is the current [[Buffalo Bills]] NFL team uniforms that feature helmets resembling the team's white helmets from the 1970s but with a different, more modern looking stripe design.

=== National Football League ===
Throwbacks were introduced in the [[National Football League|NFL]] in 1991 at retail through the NFL Throwbacks Collection.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The rights to produce the vintage apparel was limited to six apparel licensees, including Tiedman &amp; Company Sportswear (exclusive to jerseys), Riddell (helmets), Starter (caps), Nutmeg Mills (sweatshirts), and DeLong (jackets). In [[1994 NFL season|1994]], to honor the NFL's 75th Anniversary, teams were allowed to wear modern versions of their old uniform styles.

However, the designs varied widely in their accuracy:
* While no attempt was made to simulate obsolete [[leather]] helmets which were phased out in the 1950s, teams simulating uniforms from the era of leather headgear simply removed all decals and striping from their regular hard-shell helmets.
* A rule imposed by the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in [[1970 NFL season|1970]] adopted the AFL's policy of all jerseys displaying the player's last name on the back side. This practice was not part of the NFL officially until after the merger, but in order to keep consistency with current rules, the names were placed on the back side of all throwback jerseys.
* In most instances the fonts and typestyles used were only approximate matches at best.
* The [[Arizona Cardinals]], [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] wore reproductions of uniforms that pre-dated large numerals on the front of jerseys, so instead smaller numerals were worn on the right shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Stadium/3028/pitt-v-colts.jpg&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:19:46&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dallas Cowboys]] and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old "standing buffalo" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue "charging buffalo" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the "double-star" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red "standing buffalo" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the [[American Football League|AFL]]-era jerseys as opposed to the [[Jim Kelly]]/[[Marv Levy]]-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The [[New York Jets]] also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis.
* The [[Miami Dolphins]], [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Cleveland Browns]] had not had major uniform redesigns up to that point or only made subtle changes, as the Seahawks and Buccaneers had joined the league just 18 years earlier. The Seahawks and Buccaneers have also since redesigned their uniforms in 2002, 2012 and 1997, 2014 respectively, while the Dolphins made some minor updates in 1997, then a brand new look altogether in 2013, the Saints got new uniforms in 2000, and also the Browns in 2015.

[[File:Champ Bailey.JPG|thumb|[[Champ Bailey]] wearing a [[Denver Broncos]] throwback uniform in 2009]]
All the teams were informed that they would be wearing the Throwbacks during Week Three of the season. Some teams continued to wear theirs throughout the season. The [[San Francisco 49ers]] wore replicas of their 1955 uniforms in their [[Super Bowl XXIX]] victory. The uniforms were well-liked enough that the 49ers brought them back, in slightly modified form, for 1996–1997. In 1998, the gold pants from before were returned, in more modern form. In 2009, the team debuted an updated design of the 1980s uniforms that won them four of their five [[Super Bowls]].

Both of the NFL's New York City teams' throwbacks proved so popular with their fans that the teams returned to wearing them full-time soon afterwards: [[New York Jets|The Jets']] replicas of their 1968 uniforms (with a darker shade of green than before), and the [[New York Giants|Giants']] 1961 uniforms, with the lowercase "ny" instead of the underlined uppercase "GIANTS" – which was retained as a secondary logo – imposed after moving to East Rutherford, New Jersey. Both teams have modernized the 1960s decals for their current primary corporate logos.

As a result of the NFL modifying its rules to allow teams to wear alternate jerseys in 2002, throwbacks still make occasional appearances. The [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] hosted by the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]] have been a showcase of throwbacks in recent years. The Bills, [[San Diego Chargers]] and Cowboys traditionally wear their early 1960s throwbacks twice each season.  Additionally, the Lions dropped their much criticized black alternates in favor of the popular 1940's and 1950s throwbacks (plain blue jersey, silver pants and helmets) in 2008. However;  due to the NFL's regulations about player safety and helmets both teams have ceased wearing the throwback uniforms. The Lions in 2011 and Cowboys in 2013.

The [[Cleveland Browns]] throwbacks are based on a uniform/helmet combination that first appeared in 1957 when [[Jim Brown]] was drafted. (Player numbers appeared on the side of the helmet that year.) The Browns began wearing their throwbacks in 2006 as part of the team's 60th Anniversary. They only wear them once per season.

The [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who substantially changed their uniforms and team colors in 1997, never wore their orange throwbacks from 1997 to 2008. In [[2009 NFL season#Uniforms|2009]], the team wore their throwbacks for the first time against the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] on November 8 to debut the "Buccaneers' Ring of Honor." The club has continued to do so annually until 2014.

The [[San Diego Chargers]] wore their 1960s style powder-blue uniforms with white helmets as alternates from 2002 to 2006 and in 2007 adopted a modified version as their full-time uniforms. Meanwhile, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] wore their 1980s-style home red uniforms as throwbacks in 2002 (in 2005 the team re-designated them as alternate uniforms to be worn 1–2 home games a season). The team also petitioned the league to wear the throwbacks on the 2007 season opening night, as a tribute to their late former head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. For the 2009 season, an updated design based heavily on the 1980s throwbacks was debuted by the 49ers, which was combined with the team's current modern logo. On September 16, 2007, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], celebrating their 75th season, wore a variation of their older early '60s uniforms that featured gold helmets with black stripe, black jerseys with gold numbers and stripes, and white pants with black-and-gold side stripes as they hosted Buffalo. They wore them again on [[Monday Night Football]] on November 5 against [[Baltimore Ravens|Baltimore]]. The Steelers enjoyed immense success in both games, winning each handily (26–3 vs. Buffalo, 38–7 vs. Baltimore), in direct contrast to the team's struggles when they wore those jerseys originally. On November 11, 2007, The New York Giants, wore their red uniforms against the division rival Dallas Cowboys. Also in 2007, the [[New York Jets]] twice wore replicas of their New York Titans uniforms – once against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and once against the [[Miami Dolphins]].  Since then, the Jets have worn the Titans uniforms several more times – twice in 2008, three times in 2009, and once in 2011.  For two of the 2009 games, the Jets wore white versions, replicating the Titans road uniforms.

The Eagles wore their powder blue and yellow throwback jerseys during the home game against the [[Detroit Lions|Lions]] on September 23, 2007. Though the Eagles had a big 56–21 victory, these particular Throwbacks were criticised as being very unattractive. During [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]] on [[NBC]] that week, [[Keith Olbermann]] named the Philadelphia Eagles the "Worst Persons in the NFL" for their blue-and-yellow throwback jerseys, citing "Throwbacks? Try ''throw-ups!''" The blue and yellow uniforms, which are the same colors as the flag of the City of [[Philadelphia]], were used by the Eagles, and their predecessors, the defunct [[Frankford Yellowjackets]] franchise, until the 1940s when the more familiar pre-[[Jeffrey Lurie]] era [[kelly green]] was introduced. The kelly green throwbacks from the 1960 season were wore for the 2010 season opener vs. the [[Green Bay Packers]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of when the Eagles beat the Packers to win the [[1960 NFL Championship]].

For the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]], commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[American Football League]], the eight charter members of the AFL wore throwback uniforms from the early 1960s on select "Legacy Weekends." The Dallas Cowboys, also celebrating their 50th anniversary season, wore throwback jerseys for some games.

The Packers, starting in 2010, introduced their 1929 throwback uniforms as their alternative uniform. Honoring the Packers first ever championship team in 1929, the uniform features a navy blue jersey with yellow numbers, with an added twist, as the uniforms in 1929 featured a small yellow circle in the front with a blue number in it. The circle and numbers were enlarged to meet current NFL uniform rules. Complimenting the rest of the uniform were tan pants, replicating the canvas uniform pants used during the 1920s. The team switched to their 1940s uniforms for the 2015 season, which removed the yellow circle but retained the color scheme.

The NFL imposed a new rule for the [[2013 NFL season|2013 season]] prohibiting the use of alternate colored helmets, eliminating many of the historically accurate throwback uniforms that had been in use up to that point. Teams are still allowed to use alternate decals (or no decals at all) for their throwbacks, but they must use them on the regular helmets.&lt;ref&gt;Breech, John (September 17, 2013).

'Retro shirts', as they are known in the United Kingdom, are also sometimes used in [[association football]], albeit with modern fabrics. In 2005–06 [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] changed their home colours from their traditional red and white to a variant of maroon known as redcurrant as a commemoration of their final season at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury Stadium]]; this colour was supposedly the same shade the team had worn when they first played at Highbury in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kit Design| date=7 December 2007| publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]]| url =http://www.arsenal.com/history/kit-design| accessdate = 17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although later evidence suggested that Arsenal's main colour at that time was a more standard shade known as 'Garibaldi red'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mark| last=Andrews| first2 =Andy|last2 =Kelly |title=Woolwich Arsenal in 1913 or is it? | date=February 8, 2013| work=The History of Arsenal |publisher=AISA Arsenal History Society | url =http://www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/archives/5358| accessdate = March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redcurrant, however, still played a part in their kits since; most recently on their yellow change kit featuring redcurrant shorts and pinstripes on the shirt and socks, between 2010 and 2012.

[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] wore several retro-style kits in the 1990s and 2000s, based on kits the worn by the club in the 1950s and '60s, as well as that worn by their first ever team, known then as ''Newton Heath''.  The Newton Heath-inspired kit was introduced for their centenary in 1992 and worn for two seasons as a third kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester United Change Kits|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Manchester_United/Manchester_United-change-kits.html|work=historicalkits.co.uk|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wore a replica of their jersey from 1958 during the [[Manchester derby]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on February 10, 2008 at [[Old Trafford]] to mark the 50th anniversary of the [[Munich air disaster]] four days earlier. United were granted special dispensation by the [[Premier League]] to wear the one-off uniform which was devoid of logos and kit markings, and used the traditional "one to eleven" numbering scheme rather than using [[squad number (association football)|squad numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Oliver| last=Kay| title=Manchester United replicate 1958 kit to mark game of respect for Busby Babes| date=2007-12-07| publisher=The Times| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article3013603.ece| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a gesture of solidarity, Manchester City similarly removed the sponsor and manufacturer logos from their kits for the game, giving their shirts the same clean and empty look resembling the plain shirts of the 1950s when logos and team badges were not worn. However, they used the current season's kit style and chose not to go the whole distance in producing a retro-looking kit; retaining the club crest, competition sleeve patches, and the player name and squad number on the kit but added a [[black ribbon]] above the right breast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=City unveil shirts without sponsors for derby clash to mark Munich anniversary | date=2008-02-05 | work=[[Daily Mail]] | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-512438/City-unveil-shirts-sponsors-derby-clash-mark-Munich-anniversary.html | accessdate= 2013-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous season, [[2006–07 Manchester United F.C. season|2006–07]], United introduced a similar 1950s-style uniform to celebrate 50 years of the [[Busby Babes]]' first [[1955–56 Football League|league championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New home kit to be revealed on ManUtd.com | date=2006-07-07 | publisher=[[Manchester United F.C.]] | url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2006/Jul/New-home-kit-to-be-revealed-on-ManUtdcom.aspx | accessdate= 2013-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After their [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League victory]] in 2008, United introduced another retro-style kit for [[2008–09 Manchester United F.C. season|2008–09]], celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first European Cup win.

More authentic reproductions of kits from the past have become popular fashion items, especially jerseys linked to successful or memorable teams. When [[France national football team|France]] won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], their uniform was reminiscent of the design of the triumphant [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]] team, with a red horizontal stripe and three thin horizontal stripes across the chest.

When the [[United States men's soccer team]] took the field between 1999 and 2001, their plain white uniform with a thick V-neck collar looked reminiscent of the [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer Federation]]'s first uniform worn in 1916. A similar uniform was produced in 2013, complete with vintage crest, to mark the 100th anniversary of the USSF.

For the FIFA Centenary Match in 2004, [[France national football team|France]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] played in kits resembling their first ever home kits.  The Brazilian team wore white tops with blue trim, the original colours of their home kit, which was replaced in 1951 by today's yellow top with green trim after the [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1950 World Cup defeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fifa centenary match France host Brazil  | date=2004-05-21 | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/21/newsstory.sport14 | first=Keir | last=Radnedge | accessdate= 2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] celebrated the club's 125th anniversary in [[2010–11 Southampton F.C. season|2010–11]], by wearing the strip worn by the team's original forebears, which consisted of a white shirt with a red sash, white shorts and black socks.

During the later stages of the 2011–12 season, financially troubled Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] wore their normal blue shirts on the pitch, but began selling and encouraging fans to wear throwback red and black striped scarves, the traditional colours of the burgh of Govan (where [[Ibrox Stadium]] is located) in an attempt to raise money.  The club would be placed in administration, face liquidation and then sold to a new ownership group, with a severe relegation penalty for the 2012–13 season.

English club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] wore a replica of their [[1968 FA Cup Final]] kit, in their Premier League game against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 11 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Jeff Astle charity launched on special West Bromwich Albion day | date= 2015-04-11 | publisher= [[BBC]] | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32257003 | accessdate= 2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was worn to honour the match-winning goalscorer in the 1968 Cup Final, [[Jeff Astle]], who died in 2002 due to [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] as a result of heading the heavy leather footballs through his career.  The kit used the 1–11 numbering system save for the goalkeeper's shirt, which was left blank as they were in those days.

2014–15 [[Scottish Championship]] winners [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.]] chose for their current season a replica of the shirt worn by the team 100 years ago, for the 1914–15 season. The shirt is plain maroon with a white collar and fly-button opening and has no sponsorship logos. Though the 1914–15 shirt bore no badge, the current shirt has an embroidered badge in the style of the club's logo of one hundred years ago. The shirt and badge also commemorate Hearts first and reserve teams, management and fans who, though currently topping the Scottish league, volunteered for the [[Great War]] effort en-masse in November 1914 to join a newly forming wartime volunteer infantry battalion, 16th Battalion [[Royal Scots]], commanded by [[George McCrae (politician)]] MP. Spurred on by Hearts, "[[McCrae's Battalion]]" also attracted players and supporters from other Scottish teams plus various sportsmen. The first football team to join up, Hearts and "McCrae's Battalion" were mentioned in thanks by Winston Churchill in Parliament and proved a catalyst in the formation of other football and sportsmen battalions of [[Kitchener's Army]]. Heart of Midlothian lost 7 players killed in the war, plus others maimed or gassed and unable to resume their careers after the war.

[[File:Port Adelaide Magpies Jumper.svg|thumb|110px|right|{{AFL Por}}'s heritage guernsey.]]
{{See also|Guernsey (Australian rules football)}}
Throwback uniforms, more commonly called '''heritage guernseys''', are worn occasionally by clubs in the [[Australian Football League]], mostly to commemorate the anniversaries of past successes or events. Between 2003 and 2007, there was an annual "Heritage Round", in which all clubs were encouraged to wear heritage guernseys from either their club or state.

The heritage guernsey of the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] has been a regular source of controversy. The primary historical guernsey of the Port Adelaide Football Club, when it dominated national football the years before World War I and the [[South Australian National Football League]] for the 19th century, was black with a white "prison bars" design; however, when the club entered the Australia Football League in 1997, it was forced to change its colours to avoid a clash with the [[Collingwood Football Club]], who also wear black and white although in a different design. Whether or not Port Adelaide is permitted to wear its black and white guernsey in any heritage matches, even those not played against Collingwood, has been a point of contention between the clubs.

{{cquote|"It should have nothing to do with Eddie McGuire and Collingwood...I'll say that for a start."|15px|15px| [[Leigh Matthews]] during a discussion regarding Port Adelaide's traditional guernsey &lt;br /&gt;during the 2014 Elimination Final.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Matthews, 2014 AFL Elimination Final – Port Adelaide vs. Richmond, Channel 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most recent instance of the club wearing the guernsey was during the Elimination Final of the [[2014 AFL season]].

In 1990, the [[Chicago White Sox]] wore replicas of their [[1917 World Series]] uniforms against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] as part of the White Sox celebration of the final season at [[Comiskey Park]]. During the game, the scoreboard and public address system were turned off, and the lineups announced with a hand-held megaphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=George| last=Bova| title=Memories of Old Comiskey Park: Turn Back the Clock Day July 11, 1990| publisher=White Sox Interactive | url =http://www.whitesoxinteractive.com/OldComiskey/TurnBackTheClock.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, these games have proven popular not only among team fans but also with viewers of TV highlight shows. [[ESPN]], for the highlights of the 1990 game, sped up the highlights and showed them in black and white to emulate the [[silent film]] of the era. The team then adopted a modified version of the 1959 "Go-Go Sox" era jerseys for the first year at [[Guaranteed Rate Field|the new Comiskey Park]] in 1991, having kept that design since and winning the [[2005 World Series]] in that design, ending an 88-year World Series championship drought.

With the introduction of [[interleague play]], when the [[Atlanta Braves]] played the [[Boston Red Sox]] for the first time in a regular season game in Boston in 1997, the teams wore uniforms that traced back to the initial season in which each team adopted the current nickname, the Braves wearing road uniforms from the 1912 season with the word 'BOSTON' and the Red Sox wearing 1908 uniforms with a large red sock with the word 'BOSTON' in white on the sock. It was the Braves' first official game against the Red Sox since the team moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Braves manager Bobby Cox went on record as being firmly against his team being identified as 'Boston' by their uniforms.

Some throwback nights featured the [[Oakland Athletics]] wearing one combo or another of the gold/white/green uniform set it featured in the 1970s and 1980s, or the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' black-and-gold combo from the same era – on June 26, 2010, they did so against one another, with Pittsburgh in black and Oakland in gold.

In 2003 the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] hosted the [[Baltimore Orioles]] with teams wearing retro St. Louis Cardinals and [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] (the predecessor to today's Orioles, which moved to Baltimore for 1954) uniforms, respectively. The scoreboard that day said "Browns" and the stadium announcer played along with the fantasy as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Matthew| last=Leach|author2=Gary Washburn  | title=Orioles turn back Cards| date=2003-06-07| publisher=[[MLB.com]]| url =http://www.mlb.com/news/wrap.jsp?ymd=20030607&amp;content_id=361373&amp;vkey=wrapup2003&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=null| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]], the two participants in that game (the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]) met in a 3-game interleague series at [[PNC Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. While the Red Sox took two of three of those games with both teams wearing their standard uniforms, the one the Pirates won was meant to replicate their matchup in the 1903 World Series with both teams wearing 1903-era throwbacks. Although baseball teams did not have [[Squad number|uniform numbers]] at the time, to keep with the current rules numbers were put on the backs of the otherwise-accurate throwbacks. The [[JumboTron]] screen was left with a static background, and the scoreboard had the different team names at the time: the "Boston Americans" and the "[[Etymology of Pittsburgh|Pittsburg]] Pirates". The stadium crew at PNC Park also did other 1903-era activities such as using a [[megaphone]] for announcements.

In 2006 the [[New York Mets]], in honor of the 20th anniversary of the 1986 World Series, held a "turn-back-the-clock-night" and wore their 1986 uniforms.  In 2009 the Mets played three games of a four-game set against the [[San Francisco Giants]] in a "fauxback" jersey based on early 20th century New York Giants' jerseys with a giant "NY" on the chest, but using the Mets' current team colors of orange and blue. (The Mets are the only team to have worn a throwback from their home city's past instead of their franchise's past; while the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], both of whom were once the Washington Senators, have each used throwbacks from their previous hometown, the city's current team, the [[Washington Nationals]], have worn both Twins-Senators and Rangers-Senators throwbacks as well.) In 2008, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] adopted an alternate uniform based on their [[1948 Philadelphia Phillies season|1948]] uniforms, but with modern graphics on an off-white color background.

Not all throwbacks use Major League uniforms; at least 15 MLB teams have at some point paid tribute to the pre-integration [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]] by wearing the uniform of a Negro League from the city's past; in almost every case both teams do so simultaneously. Since the [[Homestead Grays]] played "home" games in both Washington and Pittsburgh, the team has been honored as such by both the Nationals and Pirates; in 2008 the two teams did so together, with Washington wearing the Grays' home uniforms and Pittsburgh the away ones.

The [[Tampa Bay Rays]] have staged a "Turn Back the Clock" promotion with a retro theme and throwback uniforms almost every season of their existence. Because the franchise does not yet have a long history from which to choose uniforms, they have often worn the uniforms of historical local teams such as the [[Tampa Tarpons]] of the [[Florida State League]] (worn in 1999, 2006, and 2010), the [[St. Petersburg Pelicans]] of the [[Senior Professional Baseball Association]] (worn in 2008), the [[St. Petersburg Saints]] (2007) and [[Tampa Smokers]] (2011) of the [[Florida International League]], and the [[Tampa Spartans|University of Tampa Spartans]] (2000). The Rays have worn their own uniforms for Turn Back the Clock night only once: in 2009, when they wore Devil Rays "rainbow" uniforms from their 1998 inaugural season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/article1180400.ece "Rays have worn a variety of throwback uniforms"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016204058/http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/article1180400.ece |date=2012-10-16 }} ''St. Pete Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the Rays' opponent on Turn Back the Clock night wear throwbacks of their own from the same era as the Rays' retro uniforms. For example, the Houston Astros wore their 1980s "[[Rainbow Guts]]" uniforms, the Dodgers wore the 1955 road uniforms of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], the Mets wore the road unis of their 1969 championship team, and the Orioles wore their rare all-orange uniforms from the early 1970s.

The [[San Diego Padres]] have also worn multiple throwback uniforms. Pre-1969 designs have represented the Padres of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. During the 2010 season, throwback uniforms were worn during all Thursday home day games. Multiple designs and color schemes were used, including the 1969 "first major league season" brown and gold, 1984 "first World Series" white with gold lettering and brown trim (and "RAK" on the sleeves for then-recently deceased owner Ray A. Kroc), and a 1990s era white with orange-trimmed blue lettering (while these were the accurate Padres jersey of the period, the design is also very similar to that of the [[New York Mets]], as the owners of the team at the time were investors from New York). All of these were fairly accurate representations of the team's uniforms and colors of the period, and in most games the visiting team wore throwback uniforms of a similar period. For example, at the final home game on September 30, the visiting [[Chicago Cubs]] and the Padres both wore 1984-era jerseys, in tribute to the 1984 NLCS, in which the same two teams played against each other.

In recent years, the Milwaukee Brewers have resurrected their old 1980s pinstriped uniforms with the old ball-in-glove "MB" logo on the caps for use as an alternate uniform.

In 2008, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] unveiled their new "Flashback Friday" powder blue throwback uniforms, similar to those worn between the 1977 and 1979 seasons.

The [[Cleveland Indians]] throwbacks are usually worn once a year in July and normally are based on their uniforms from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (most notably, their 1974 "All Red" home uniforms), They have also worn uniforms based on the 1948 Indians in honor of [[Larry Doby]], the first [[African Americans|African-American]] player in the [[American League]] with the Indians.

The 2011 [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] celebrated the tenth anniversary of their [[2001 World Series]] championship on September 9–11. To commemorate the event the Diamondbacks held a reunion of players who had been on the championship team. They also wore the purple, teal, and copper uniforms that the team wore from 1998 to 2006.

To celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[Fenway Park]], the [[New York Yankees]] and Boston Red Sox wore 1912 throwbacks during a regular-season game on April 20, 2012; the Yankees' 1912 uniforms were a nod to their days as the New York Highlanders.

In the [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999 season]], MLB held a series of "[[Turn Ahead the Clock]]" nights. It was inspired by an independently held promotion on July 18, 1998 at a game between the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. During those nights, teams wore uniforms envisioned as they might be in the year 2021. Twenty-two teams ultimately participated over 13 different games in 1999, with some teams wearing the uniforms more than once. The promotion proved unpopular, and has yet to be repeated since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Turn_Ahead_the_Clock_Night|title=Turn Ahead the Clock Night – BR Bullpen|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their [[1986 New York Mets season|1986 world championship season]], the [[New York Mets]] revived their 1986 uniforms to be used for all Sunday home games.

In [[1921 in baseball|1921]] a baseball game held at [[Rickwood Field]] as part of the Semicentennial of [[Birmingham, Alabama]] was played in "old-style" uniforms and according to "the rules of the games as they were in 1872.".&lt;ref name="Birmingham 1921"&gt;"Baseball Fans Given Rare Treat at Wood." (October 26, 1921) ''The Birmingham News''&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1996 Rickwood Field has been the site of the annual "Rickwood Classic", a regular season [[Birmingham Barons]] game in which both [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] teams wear uniforms honoring some period of their respective histories.

The [[Lotte Giants]] of the Korea Baseball Organization has "Again 1984/1992" day once per month in commemoration of their league titles from those respective years. The team dresses in their old baby blue jerseys as well as their old cap, complete with the old logo. The "Again 1984/1992" games are usually the most popular games of the year in Busan, with the stadium as well as the throwback merchandising usually selling out fast. Due to this success, starting in 2008, other teams in the league such as [[Doosan Bears]] and [[Samsung Lions]] have started to incorporate a similar style of throwback day as well.

The [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the International League adopted a throwback uniform as their main jersey in 2012 as part of their change in parent club affiliation to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].

== Basketball ==

=== National Basketball Association ===
In the [[1996–97 NBA season]], the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary by introducing throwback jerseys, known as "Hardwood Classics". The [[Toronto Raptors]] were notable for wearing the uniforms of the long-defunct [[Toronto Huskies]], an original BAA team. The Raptors have since brought back this tradition on certain occasions, notably games against the [[New York Knicks]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] wore script-logo throwbacks from the beginning of [[Michael Jordan]]'s career. Some of the throwbacks that were introduced in this season have been brought back on more occasions since, notably the [[Golden State Warriors]], whose throwback placed the players' numbers inside an angled [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] (a reference to San Francisco, where they had played in the early years in California).

In more recent years, throwback jerseys in the NBA have recalled some of the more gaudy uniforms of the NBA and the [[American Basketball Association (1967–76)|ABA]], ranging from the aforementioned Warriors uniforms, to the [[Detroit Pistons]]' [[Thunderbolt|lightning bolt]] uniforms of the [[Dick Vitale]] era of the late 1970s, to the [[Miami Floridians]] throwbacks worn by the [[Miami Heat|Heat]], and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]' 1980s era jerseys worn by [[Brad Daugherty (basketball)|Brad Daugherty]], [[Mark Price]], and [[Ron Harper]] as well as uniforms based on the early and mid-1970s. In contrast, the [[New York Knicks]] often wear throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s that are understated by comparison. The warmups and uniform shorts of that era feature an "interlocking NY" identical to the one worn by the [[New York Yankees]] on their caps and home jerseys. Most "Hardwood Classics" jerseys worn by current players for games, however, are based on modern fabrics, and not the classic fabric designs of the past. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] wore throwback short-shorts in 2007 for one game. Kobe Bryant complained, saying, "I feel violated. I feel naked. It's one thing to see those old guys wearing them on film, it's another to actually wear them". The [[Philadelphia 76ers]] began wearing throwback jerseys from their championship season of 1982–83 in 2007–08 to honor the 25th anniversary of their championship. They were so popular that the Sixers kept these jerseys for next year, and reverted to their old logo (modified with a newer "6") for the [[2009–10 NBA season|2009–10 season]].

The [[Orlando Magic]] are notable for wearing the same throwback design at least twice; their black pinstriped throwback was used in 2003–04, 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons. They also wore the blue pinstriped throwbacks in 2004–05 and the white pinstriped throwbacks in 2005–06. The then-[[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans Hornets]], [[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Bobcats]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Memphis Grizzlies]] were also notable for wearing throwbacks of long-forgotten [[American Basketball Association]] franchises [[New Orleans Buccaneers]], [[Carolina Cougars]], [[Los Angeles Stars]], [[Minnesota Muskies]] and [[Memphis Sounds|Memphis Tams/Pros]]. The [[San Antonio Spurs]] also paid tribute to their predecessors [[Dallas Chaparrals]], while the Bulls and the [[Washington Wizards]] did the same to a pair of former Chicago-based NBA franchises, the [[Chicago Stags|Stags]] and Zephyrs.

The usage of throwback uniforms even inspired some NBA teams to acquire elements used from old uniform designs in creating new ones. For example, the [[Detroit Pistons]], [[Milwaukee Bucks]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Golden State Warriors]] reverted to their original color schemes while adding some accent colors to create a more modern look, while the Magic and the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] revived the use of pinstripes on their uniforms. The [[Dallas Mavericks]] briefly used a third jersey with the green, blue and white color scheme of the 1980s. The [[Houston Rockets]] revived the classic red and gold scheme in unveiling their new alternate uniform in 2009. The [[Utah Jazz]] are re-using their classic "J" note logo and a similar (though not the same) color scheme, and also plan to adopt a similar uniform design to what they originally wore from 1974 to 1996. The [[Washington Wizards]] also went retro, with secondary logos inspired from the old Bullets logos and the modernized "[[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]" uniform worn from 1974 through 1987. The [[New York Knicks]] eliminated black from their color scheme and unveiled a modern adaptation of their 1970–75 uniforms, sans the shorts' side stripes, addition of silver trim, and a bolder, less arched "NEW YORK" script. The [[Sacramento Kings]] have used their classic Kansas City-era script to their gold and then black alternate uniforms. The [[Denver Nuggets]] revived the 'rainbow' uniforms from the 1980s as an alternate uniform, this time with the current colors and typeface, while the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] wore alternate uniforms with a vertically arranged front script similar to those worn by the [[Oscar Robertson]]-era Cincinnati Royals. The [[Phoenix Suns]] paid tribute to the 1990s by unveiling new uniforms featuring a modified streaking sun.

In 2003, the [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball]] team wore throwback jerseys in home games against [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] and [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]] to celebrate the program's 100th anniversary season. The jerseys were lavender with black letters and numerals, similar to the uniforms worn by [[Jack Hartman]]'s teams in the 1970s and 1980s, during some of KSU's best seasons.

The [[Kansas Jayhawks]] basketball team wore throwbacks in March 2005 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of [[Allen Fieldhouse]]. In February 2008 and February 2013, they wore throwbacks for the 20th and 25th anniversaries, respectively, of the [[1987–88 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1988 NCAA championship team]], and did so again in February 2012 to honor the [[1951–52 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1952 NCAA championship team]]'s 60th anniversary.

The [[Philadelphia Wings (1987–2014)|Philadelphia Wings]] indoor lacrosse team ditched their silver, red, and black uniforms for a game to wear their original [[Philadelphia Wings (1974–75)|orange and white jerseys worn in the early 1970s]] from the original [[National Lacrosse League (1974–75)|National Lacrosse League]]. For the 100th anniversary of [[Johns Hopkins – Maryland rivalry|the rivalry]] between [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse|Johns Hopkins]] and [[Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse|Maryland]] in [[field lacrosse|men's lacrosse]], both teams wore special retro jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamondbackonline.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=0a3ea5b0-8743-4f5c-842d-a7798060ccd0 Rivalry 101: Terps vs. Johns Hopkins], ''[[The Diamondback]]'', April 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 35th anniversary of women's field hockey at [[Dartmouth College]], the [[Dartmouth Big Green|Big Green]] are wearing a special harlequin-design throwback uniform.

== Canadian football ==

=== Canadian Football League ===
The first documented use of a throwback uniform came during the [[1998 Calgary Stampeders season|1998 season]], when the [[Calgary Stampeders]] wore [[1948 Calgary Stampeders season|1948]] red striped jerseys to celebrate the [[36th Grey Cup|first]] [[Grey Cup]] championship won by the Stampeders franchise. The jerseys were worn on October 4, 1998 against the [[BC Lions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/former%20stamps%20owner%20gutsche%20dies/8915635/story.html|title=Former Stamps owner Sig Gutsche dies at 64|first=,Bryan|last=Weismiller|work=calgaryherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BC Lions were the next to wear throwback jerseys in [[2003 BC Lions season|2003]], as they were celebrating their 50th season with orange replica jerseys from the [[1954 BC Lions season]]. Those jerseys were worn four times that season with the first being the home opener that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wnESgJUudk|title=CFL 2003 WINNIPEG BLUEBOMBERS AT BC-LIONS|first=|last=cflvideo1964|date=5 July 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, neither uniform was accurate as the jerseys were paired with pants and helmets from both teams' present day sets. In [[2007 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2007]], the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] wore green replica jerseys from the late 1960s to 1970s with double white striping over the shoulders. As opposed to the single season usage the Stampeders and Lions employed, the Roughriders wore these jerseys from 2007 to [[2013 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2013]], including their usage in the [[97th Grey Cup|97th]] and [[98th Grey Cup]].

It wasn't until the [[2008 CFL season]] that the league started to truly embrace throwback uniforms when they announced that the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] and [[Toronto Argonauts]] would play two games (September 12 in [[Toronto]] and October 10 in [[Winnipeg]]) to celebrate and recognize the 1950s and in particular, the [[38th Grey Cup|1950 Mud Bowl Grey Cup game]].&lt;ref name="CFL 1950s"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2008/08/26/celebrating-our-legacy-the-cfl-goes-retro/|title=Celebrating Our Legacy: The CFL goes "Retro"|date=26 August 2008|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams wore coloured jerseys, as was common during the 1950s. Toronto's jerseys were a light blue in colour, with dark blue striping on the sleeves and the team's old "Pull Together" football-as-a-ship logo on the shoulders. The Blue Bombers' jerseys were dark blue in colour, with gold sleeve stripes. The team's 1950s-era logo was on the front of the jersey, just below the V in the neck. A special CFL "Retro Week" logo adorned each jersey as well, that logo being a take-off of the maple leaf one used as the league symbol from 1954 through 1969.

For the [[2009 CFL season]], all eight teams [[2009 CFL season#CFL retro|wore retro uniforms]], this time based on uniforms from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2009/04/07/cfl-retro-celebrating-the-sixties/|title=CFL Retro: Celebrating the Sixties|date=7 April 2009|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Week 3 of the 2009 season featured all teams wearing their retro uniforms. When revealed at the time, four teams had white retro jerseys and four had coloured retro jerseys. As the season progressed, Saskatchewan added a green 1960s jersey for the [[Labour Day Classic]] and Calgary wore a white 1960s jersey for the Labour Day rematch versus [[Edmonton Eskimos|Edmonton]]. 11 games were scheduled during the season to feature both teams wearing these uniforms while more were added later on.

In [[2010 CFL season|2010]], all eight teams again [[2010 CFL season#CFL retro|wore retro uniforms]] and for this season it was based on uniforms worn from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2010/01/30/kicking-off-2010-schedule-with-momentum/|title=Kicking off 2010 schedule with momentum|date=30 January 2010|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams wore retro uniforms during weeks 6 and 7, however, contrary to the previous year, only the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] wore white throwback uniforms, meaning most teams wore their regular white uniforms as the away team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2010/07/14/riders-set-to-celebrate-retro-style/|title=Riders set to celebrate retro style|date=14 July 2010|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roughriders wore their regular 1970s throwback jersey during retro games they hosted. Additionally, during this season, the Roughriders were celebrating their 100th anniversary as a franchise and wore black, red, and silver throwback uniforms similar to the ones worn by the Regina Roughriders from 1912 to 1947. These uniforms were worn on July 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riderville.com/2010/06/15/riders-unveil-retro-jerseys/|title=Riders unveil Retro Jerseys|date=15 June 2010|work=riderville.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the league had originally planned to celebrate with retro uniforms each season leading up to the [[100th Grey Cup]], the CFL did not introduce 1980s-themed uniforms for the [[2011 CFL season]].&lt;ref name="CFL 1950s" /&gt; Some teams (Calgary, Saskatchewan, Toronto, and Winnipeg) continued wearing the previous year's retro uniforms while the rest wore no throwback uniforms at all. In [[2012 CFL season|2012]], all teams remodeled their full uniform set with only Saskatchewan and Winnipeg carrying over their 1970s throwback uniforms.

In [[2013 CFL season|2013]], the Toronto Argonauts wore 1980s throwback uniforms on August 23, 2013 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[71st Grey Cup]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerscentre.com/events/article.jsp?content=20130822_143039_5108|title=Rogers Centre – Events – ARGONAUTS HOST STAMPEDERS IN 100TH GREY CUP REMATCH THIS FRIDAY NIGHT|work=rogerscentre.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] wore red, black, and white replicas of the 1943 [[Hamilton Flying Wildcats]] to celebrate the 70th anniversary of their [[31st Grey Cup]] victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/4059672-ticats-to-pay-homage-to-flying-wildcats-with-historic-uniforms/|title=Ticats to pay homage to Flying Wildcats with historic uniforms|date=3 September 2013|publisher=|via=The Hamilton Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the uniforms from these games were worn only once. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers wore 1980s-themed uniforms from 2013 to 2015 before switching full-time to similar royal blue jerseys in 2016. The Roughriders introduced new throwback uniforms based on the uniforms from the early 1980s in 2014 and wore them again in 2015. The franchise introduced another green retro-styled jersey in 2016, but due to lack of numbers on the shoulders, were never actually worn before in their history.

As of the [[2015 CFL season]], the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Toronto Argonauts have worn throwback uniforms representing four different decades, which is the most in the league. The Roughriders have worn six different throwback jerseys, including two white jerseys, which is also the most in the league. No Ottawa franchise ([[Ottawa Rough Riders]], [[Ottawa Renegades]], and [[Ottawa Redblacks]]) has ever worn a throwback uniform, presumably due to their checkered absences from the league over the past 20 years.

== Cricket ==
In February 2005 at [[Eden Park|Eden Park, Auckland]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] contested the very first [[Twenty20 cricket]] international match. Both teams appeared in retro 1980s-style tight-fitting [[One Day International|one day international]] uniforms without team names, numbers or sponsors' logos. The Australians wore their original "yellow and gold" whilst New Zealand were in "beige" inspired by the [[Beige Brigade]] sports fans. The game was played in a light-hearted manner with both teams sporting 1980s-style head bands, moustaches and hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/image/163829.html|title=Cricket Photos – Latest cricket images – ESPN Cricinfo|work=cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cycling ==
When [[Lance Armstrong]] won his fifth Tour de France championship, in 2003, his [[U.S. Postal Service]]-sponsored team wore a special jersey sporting the old U.S. Mail logo from the 1970s for the final day of the race. This was not technically a throwback jersey, as the team itself did not exist in that era, and had only been affiliated with USPS since 1998.

== Ice hockey ==

=== National Hockey League ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Throwbacks were first introduced in the [[National Hockey League]] in their 75th [[anniversary]] season of [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92]]. At the time, only the [[Original Six]] teams wore throwbacks, although they were also used in the All-Star game.

While the NHL had long since replaced the heavy wool sweaters with more modern air-knit jerseys, the patterns for the 75th anniversary throwbacks were consistent with the original versions, with a few exceptions (as noted below). Player surnames were worn on the back of the throwback jerseys, even though this was not originally the case (the NHL did not require names on the jerseys until 1977).

The Original Six teams' throwbacks included the following modifications:
* [[Boston Bruins]] – c. 1927 through 1931 "shield logo" design &lt;br /&gt; The Bruins' colors were brown and gold during this era, but the throwback jerseys use a "basic black" scheme with a small amount of white and gold trim, with the "shield logo" on the front of the jersey, and the "spoked-B" modern day regular logo placed on the jersey shoulders. For the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]] that they hosted at [[Fenway Park]] on January 1, [[2009–10 NHL season|2010]], they wore adapted replicas of the first "Spoked B" logo from 1947 to 1948 on the 1955–58 gold jerseys.
* [[Chicago Blackhawks]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; The Blackhawks' "[[barber pole]]" design was used one more time, in a game against Detroit at [[Chicago Stadium]] in January 1994. A c.-1936 design, featuring beige in the color scheme, was used in the [[2009 NHL Winter Classic]] on January 1, [[2008–09 NHL season|2009]] at [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]]; it would become the team's third jersey for the [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10 season]].
* [[Detroit Red Wings]] – c. 1928 design &lt;br /&gt; At the time the design was originally worn, the Red Wings were known as the Cougars. They wore their throwbacks again in the aforementioned game at Chicago Stadium in 1994. (The design was also used by [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s team of All-Stars that toured Europe during the [[1994–95 NHL lockout]], and by the [[Adirondack Red Wings]] as a [[third jersey]]). For the Winter Classic in 2009, the Wings donned a modified version of their inaugural 1926 sweater, which featured a single red stripe across the chest with a stylized "D" in the center, along with the current winged wheel logo to the shoulders.
* [[Montreal Canadiens]] – c. 1926 design &lt;br /&gt; The Canadiens' red jerseys have changed very little. The differences between the throwback and their current jersey were the crew collar and the duplicate Canadiens logo on the left sleeve. Three "retro" jersey designs from the Canadiens' past were authorized as part of the team's centennial celebration in 2009, including a "barber pole" design of red, white and blue horizontal stripes.
* [[New York Rangers]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; This jersey was notable because it was of the style the Rangers wore when they had last won the [[Stanley Cup]]. (They won the cup again [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|two years later]].)
* [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; The two-stripe design was used for many years by the Maple Leafs, and after over two decades of the single-stripe design, the Leafs adopted a new version of the two-stripe design the following season.
* [[Wales Conference]] All-Stars – c. 1952 design (white)
* [[Campbell Conference]] All-Stars – c. 1952 design (red) &lt;br /&gt; The stripes running down the sleeves of the All-Star jerseys were wider than those on the original versions.

As other leagues began using throwbacks, interest in retro jerseys increased within the NHL. To celebrate new ownership, the [[New York Islanders]] wore a modified throwback design for one game in 1998. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] pulled a similar stunt for a game in 2003. The Toronto Maple Leafs also brought back a 1960s-era jersey as a [[third jersey]] beginning in [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]]. In [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]], the NHL implemented a Vintage program, allowing several teams to wear throwback uniforms that were specially branded with a vintage "V" patch. The following teams were among those that participated in the program:
* [[Boston Bruins]] – c. 1970s uniforms &lt;br /&gt; These were notable as the [[Bobby Orr]]-era uniforms. The black throwbacks would replace the gold third jerseys in [[2006–07 NHL season|2006]].
* [[Edmonton Oilers]] – c. 1990s uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The current Oilers only wore the white uniforms once, for the [[2003 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]]. The Oilers alumni wore the blue version for the preceding MegaStars game. For 2008–09, this uniform served as the Oilers' third jersey and became the team's primary jersey in 2009–10.
* [[Los Angeles Kings]] – c. 1977 uniforms
* [[Montreal Canadiens]] – c. 1946 (white), c. 1960 (red) &lt;br /&gt; The white throwbacks, similar in design to the red jersey with its blue-and-white stripe across the chest, continued to be worn as an alternate jersey in subsequent seasons. The red throwbacks featured a tie-up collar, a design feature that has seen a comeback in recent years, although it's there strictly for aesthetic purposes.
* [[New York Islanders]] – [[1972–73 NHL season|1972–73]] &lt;br /&gt; This uniform, from the team's first season featured similar-(though not the same)colored numbers on similar (though not the same)-colored trim against a royal blue background, serving as the 2008–09 and 2009–10 third jersey, was elevated to their full-time home uniform in 2010–11.
* [[New York Rangers]] – c. 1977 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; This uniform featured the team's shield logo instead of "RANGERS" written diagonally across the chest. Ironically, these throwback jerseys were actually newer in design than their regular jerseys.
* [[St. Louis Blues]] – c. 1979 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; Their then-current uniforms, introduced in 1998, were at least partially inspired by these uniforms.
* [[Vancouver Canucks]] – c. 1977 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The blue throwbacks would replace their screen-printed red/blue alternate in 2006. These throwbacks served as the basis for Vancouver's new uniforms in 2007.
* [[Philadelphia Flyers]] – c. 1974 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The first two times the Flyers wore these jerseys, the numbers were the same as the old ones. The numbers on the throwbacks worn in 2008–09 are the same as the numbers on their current road and third jerseys. These will serve as the Flyers' primary home jerseys for the 2009–10 season; a white version was used for the Winter Classic at Fenway Park January 1; these will serve as of 2010–11 as their road uniforms.

A few teams also introduced "fauxback" uniform (a term that was coined by Paul Lukas, the creator of the Uni Watch column and blog, for a uniform design not worn in the past, but given the appearance of decades-old vintage) designs as alternate jerseys. The [[Colorado Avalanche]] introduced burgundy third jerseys similar in design to the [[New York Rangers]]' blue ones, while the [[Minnesota Wild]] introduced a red alternate featuring a logo encased in a circle containing the team's name, a feature previously used by the Blackhawks and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. The [[2004 National Hockey League All-Star Game]] also featured faux throwback designs. The Sabres introduced a "fauxback" jersey designed as an homage to its [[American Hockey League]] predecessor, the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Bisons]], in 2010 and wore it as their third jersey until 2012.

The Bruins, Canadiens, Maple Leafs, and Canucks used their throwbacks through [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]]. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] also wore a throwback blue-and-gold jersey for one season, bringing it back again in 2008–09, and making it their 2009–10 home sweater. Although third jerseys were temporarily discontinued for [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08]] so that teams could get used to the new [[Rbk Edge]] uniforms (third jerseys returned for the [[2008–09 NHL season|2008–09 season]]), Boston and Vancouver have adopted new uniforms that are based on their throwback designs.

On January 1, 2008, the Sabres and the Penguins donned throwback uniforms in the [[AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic]] at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in [[Orchard Park, New York]], albeit with [[Reebok]]'s "Edge" [[Pattern (sewing)|design template]]. The Penguins also used the throwbacks as their third jersey for the 2008–09 season. And as mentioned earlier, at the 2009 NHL Winter Classic, the Blackhawks and the Red Wings wore throwback replicas at Wrigley Field and the Flyers and Bruins donned retro schemes at Fenway Park in 2010. For the 2011 game, the Penguins (1967–68) and their opposition, the [[2010–11 Washington Capitals season|Washington Capitals]] (1974–75) are expected to wear their first season replicates.

In recent years, [[CCM (The Hockey Company)|CCM]], now owned by Reebok, has made additional replica throwbacks available for sale, in addition to those in current use. 1992 throwbacks such as Detroit's and Chicago's were among those reissued, while others included older-era jerseys of current NHL teams the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], the [[Colorado Avalanche]], the [[Dallas Stars]], the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and the [[New Jersey Devils]] when they had played in their former markets of (Winnipeg, Quebec City, Bloomington, Minnesota, Hartford and Denver). The much-maligned "Flying-V" uniforms of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] were also reissued. The Winnipeg jerseys were particularly popular and were seen throughout Winnipeg after it became clear that a new [[Winnipeg Jets]] franchise would be established in 2011; Jets jerseys were prevalent at the [[2011 NHL Draft]], where the new Jets' name was revealed.

'''Tillage''' is the [[agriculture|agricultural]] preparation of [[soil]] by mechanical [[wikt:agitation#Noun|agitation]] of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of [[manual labour|human-powered]] '''tilling''' methods using [[hand tool]]s include [[shovel]]ling, [[pickaxe|picking]], [[mattock]] work, [[hoe (tool)|hoeing]], and [[rake (tool)|raking]]. Examples of [[working animal|draft-animal-powered]] or [[mechanization|mechanized]] work include [[plough]]ing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks), [[rotary tiller|rototilling]], rolling with [[cultipacker]]s or other [[roller (agricultural tool)|rollers]], [[harrow (tool)|harrowing]], and cultivating with [[cultivator]] shanks (teeth). Small-scale gardening and farming, for household food production or [[small business]] production, tends to use the smaller-scale methods, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods. There is a fluid continuum, however. Any type of gardening or farming, but especially larger-scale commercial types, may also use [[#Reduced tillage|low-till]] or [[no-till farming|no-till]] methods as well.

Tillage is often classified into two types, primary and secondary. There is no strict boundary between them so much as a loose distinction between tillage that is deeper and more thorough (primary) and tillage that is shallower and sometimes more selective of location (secondary). Primary tillage such as ploughing tends to produce a rough surface finish, whereas secondary tillage tends to produce a smoother surface finish, such as that required to make a good [[seedbed]] for many crops. Harrowing and rototilling often combine primary and secondary tillage into one operation.

"Tillage" can also mean the land that is '''tilled'''. The word "'''cultivation'''" has several senses that overlap substantially with those of "tillage". In a general context, both can refer to agriculture. Within agriculture, both can refer to any kind of soil agitation. Additionally, "cultivation" or "cultivating" may refer to an even narrower sense of shallow, selective secondary tillage of [[row crop]] fields that kills weeds while sparing the crop plants.

==Tillage systems==

===Reduced tillage===
[[File:Ploughtilling the field.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Plough tilling the field]]
Reduced tillage&lt;ref group="note" name="Systems" /&gt; leaves between 15 and 30% crop residue cover on the soil or 500 to 1000 pounds per acre (560 to 1100&amp;nbsp;kg/ha) of small grain residue during the critical erosion period.  This may involve the use of a chisel plow, field cultivators, or other implements.  See the general comments below to see how they can affect the amount of residue.

===Intensive tillage===
Intensive tillage&lt;ref group="note" name="Systems" /&gt; leaves less than 15% [[crop residue]] cover or less than 500 pounds per acre (560&amp;nbsp;kg/ha) of small grain residue. This type of tillage is often referred to as [[conventional tillage]] but as conservational tillage is now more widely used than intensive tillage (in the United States),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSERVATION TILLAGE IN THE UNITED STATES: AN OVERVIEW|work=okstate.edu|url=http://agecon.okstate.edu/isct/labranza/walters/conservation.doc|publisher=Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Nebraska – Lincoln  U.S.A.|page=Figure 2|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRM&gt;{{cite web|work=ctic.purdue.edu|url=http://www.ctic.purdue.edu/CRM|title=National Crop Residue Management (CRM) Survey Summary (various years)|publisher=Conservation Technology Information Center.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is often not appropriate to refer to this type of tillage as conventional. Intensive tillage often involves multiple operations with implements such as a mold board, disk, and/or  chisel [[Plough|plow]]. Then a finisher with a [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]], rolling basket, and cutter can be used to prepare the seed bed.  There are many variations.

===Conservation tillage===
Conservation tillage&lt;ref group="note" name="Systems" /&gt; leaves at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface, or at least 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb/ac (1,100&amp;nbsp;kg/ha) of small grain residue on the surface during the critical [[soil erosion]] period.  This slows water movement, which reduces the amount of [[soil erosion]]. Additionally, conservation tillage has been found to benefit predatory arthropods that can enhance pest control.&lt;ref&gt;Tamburini, G. , De Simone, S. , Sigura, M. , Boscutti, F. , Marini, L. and Kleijn, D. (2016), Conservation tillage mitigates the negative effect of landscape simplification on biological control. J Appl Ecol, 53: 233-241. [[doi:10.1111/1365-2664.12544]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation tillage also benefits farmers by reducing fuel consumption and soil compaction. By reducing the number of times the farmer travels over the field, farmers realize significant savings in fuel and labor. In most years since 1997, conservation tillage was used in US cropland more than intensive or reduced tillage.&lt;ref name=CRM /&gt;

However, conservation tillage delays warming of the soil due to the reduction of dark earth exposure to the warmth of the spring sun, thus delaying the planting of the next year's spring crop of corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/machine/AE-1370/ae1370.htm |title=Strip Till for Field Crop Production |publisher=Ag.ndsu.edu |date=2012-11-14 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[No-till]] - Never use a plow, disk, etc. ever again.  Aims for 100% ground cover.
* [[Strip-Till]] - Narrow strips are tilled where seeds will be planted, leaving the soil in between the rows untilled.&lt;ref name="tce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Management Practices for Conservation/Reduced Tillage|url=http://publications.tamu.edu/WHEAT/PUB_wheat_Best%2520Management%2520Practices%2520for%2520Conservation%2520Tillage.pdf|publisher=Texas Cooperative Extension, The Texas A&amp;M University System|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810225128/http://publications.tamu.edu/WHEAT/PUB_wheat_Best%20Management%20Practices%20for%20Conservation%20Tillage.pdf|archivedate=10 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mulch-till]]
* Rotational Tillage - Tilling the soil every two years or less often (every other year, or every third year, etc.).&lt;ref name="tce"/&gt;
* Ridge-Till
* Zone tillage - a form of modified deep tillage in which only narrow strips are tilled, leaving soil in between the rows untilled.  This type of tillage agitates the soil to help reduce [[soil compaction]] problems and to improve internal [[soil drainage]].&lt;ref name="Deep Zone Tillage"&gt;[http://extension.umass.edu/vegetable/projects/deep-zone-tillage], UMassAmherst. Vegetable Program. "Deep Zone Tillage", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Deep zone builder.jpg|thumb|right|Deep zone builder]] --&gt;

===Purpose===
Zone tillage is designed to only disrupt the soil in a narrow strip directly below the crop row. In comparison to no-till, which relies on the previous year’s plant residue to protect the soil and aides in postponement of the warming of the soil and crop growth in Northern climates, zone tillage creates approximately a 5-inch-wide strip that simultaneously breaks up plow pans, assists in warming the soil and helps to prepare a seedbed.&lt;ref name="Penn State Extension"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extension.psu.edu/on-farm/research/miller |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513074243/http://extension.psu.edu/on-farm/research/miller |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Pennsylvania State University. "Evaluation of Zone Tillage for Corn Production", 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  When combined with cover crops, zone tillage helps replace lost organic matter, slows the deterioration of the soil, improves soil drainage, increases soil water and nutrient holding capacity, and allows necessary soil organisms to survive.

===Usage===
It has been successfully used on farms in the mid-west and west for over 40 years and is currently used on more than 36% of the U.S. farmland.&lt;ref name="Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.uconn.edu/ipm/veg/htms/dpzonetill.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522091343/http://www.hort.uconn.edu/ipm/veg/htms/dpzonetill.htm |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}, Boucher,J. University of Connecticut. "Soil Health and Deep-Zone Tillage", 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some specific states where zone tillage is currently in practice are Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Minnesota, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois.

Unfortunately, there aren't consistent yield results in the Northern [[Cornbelt]] states; however, there is still interest in deep tillage within the [[agriculture]] industry.&lt;ref name="Ag Answers"&gt;[http://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgAnswers/story.asp?storyID=1912], "Fall Zone Tillage Conserves Soil, Yields Well", 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In areas that are not well-drained, deep tillage may be used as an alternative to installing more expensive tile drainage.&lt;ref name="Plant Management Network"&gt;[http://extension.umass.edu/vegetable/research-projects/deep-zone-tillage], DeJong-Hughes, J. Johnson, J. Plant Management Network. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of tillage==
[[File:Arròs,_sequer_(26462086444).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rice]] tillage. [[Valencian Museum of Ethnology]].]]

=== Positive ===
Plowing:
* Loosens and [[aerates]] the top layer of soil or horizon A, which facilitates planting the crop.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalyst.uw.edu/workspace/file/download/6beb3d10db7900e231deacecf87272ab3a24add3d4e835991f1d2ae2624af123| format=PPT--available as non-PPT by searching the path through a search engine|title=Soils in Agriculture |author = Ray Hilborn |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Helps mix harvest residue, organic matter (humus), and nutrients evenly into the soil.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;
* Mechanically destroys weeds.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;
* Dries the soil before seeding (in wetter climates tillage aids in keeping the soil drier).&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;
* When done in autumn, helps exposed soil crumble over winter through frosting and defrosting, which helps prepare a smooth surface for spring planting.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;

===Negative===
* Dries the soil before seeding.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;
* Soil loses a lot of [[nutrients]], like [[nitrogen]] and fertilizer, and its ability to store water.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="NutrientWaterLossPrevention" /&gt;
* Decreases the water infiltration rate of soil. (Results in more runoff and erosion&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gebhardt_et_al. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; since the soil absorbs water slower than before)&lt;ref group="note" name="IncreaseWaterInfiltration" /&gt;
* Tilling the soil results in dislodging the cohesiveness of the soil particles thereby inducing erosion.
* Chemical runoff.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="IncreaseWaterInfiltration" /&gt;
* Reduces organic matter in the soil.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="IncreaseOrganics" /&gt;
* Reduces microbes, earthworms, ants, etc.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soil Compaction and Conservation Tillage|url=http://extension.psu.edu/plants/crops/soil-management/conservation-tillage/soil-compaction-and-conservation-tillage|work=Conservation Tillage Series|publisher=PennState- College of Agricultural Sciences - Cooperative Extension|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Destroys soil aggregates.&lt;ref name="UofWashington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

* Crop diseases can be harbored in surface residues.&lt;ref name="tbars1"/&gt;

==General comments==
* The type of implement makes the most difference, although other factors can have an effect.&lt;ref name="miss-extension"&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/explore/agguides/agengin/g01650.htm Conservation Tillage and Residue Management to Reduce Soil Erosion] University of Missouri: Extension&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tilling in absolute darkness (night tillage) might reduce the number of weeds that sprout following the tilling operation by half. Light is necessary to break the dormancy of some weed species' seed, so if fewer seeds are exposed to light during the tilling process, fewer will sprout. This may help reduce the amount of herbicides needed for weed control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/dec95/tilling1295.htm |title=Nightmare in Tilling Fields - a Horror for Weed Pests |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Greater speeds, when using certain tillage implements (disks and chisel plows), lead to more intensive tillage (i.e., less residue is on the soil surface).
* Increasing the angle of disks causes residues to be buried more deeply. Increasing their concavity makes them more aggressive.
* Chisel plows can have spikes or sweeps. Spikes are more aggressive.
* Percentage residue is used to compare tillage systems because the amount of [[crop residue]] affects the soil loss due to erosion.&lt;ref name="miss-extension"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/icm/2002/5-13-2002/cropresidue.html |title=Methods for measuring crop residue |author1=Mahdi Al-Kaisi |author2=Mark Hanna |author3=Michael Tidman |publisher=Iowa State University |date= 13 May 2002 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
''Primary tillage'' loosens the soil and mixes in [[fertilizer]] and/or plant material, resulting in soil with a rough texture.

''Secondary tillage'' produces finer soil and sometimes shapes the rows, preparing the seed bed. It also provides weed control throughout the growing season during the maturation of the crop plants, unless such weed control is instead achieved with low-till or no-till methods involving [[herbicide]]s.
* The seed bed preparation can be done with [[harrow (tool)|harrows]] (of which there are many types and subtypes), [[dibber|dibble]]s, [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]s, [[shovel]]s, [[rotary tiller]]s, [[subsoiler]]s, ridge- or bed-forming tillers, [[roller (agricultural tool)|roller]]s, or [[cultivator]]s.
* The weed control, to the extent that it is done via tillage, is usually achieved with cultivators or hoes, which disturb the top few centimeters of soil around the crop plants but with minimal disturbance of the crop plants themselves. The tillage kills the weeds via 2 mechanisms: uprooting them, burying their leaves (cutting off their [[photosynthesis]]), or a combination of both. Weed control both prevents the crop plants from being outcompeted by the weeds (for water and sunlight) and prevents the weeds from reaching their seed stage, thus reducing future weed population aggressiveness.

==History of tilling==
[[File:Tilling with Hungarian Grey cattles.tif|thumb|Tilling with Hungarian Grey cattles]]
Tilling was first performed via human labor, sometimes involving [[Slavery|slaves]]. Hoofed animals could also be used to till soil by trampling. The wooden [[plow]] was then invented. It could be pulled with human labor, or by [[mule]], [[ox]], [[elephant]], [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], or similar sturdy animal. Horses are generally unsuitable, though breeds such as the [[Clydesdale]] were bred as draft animals. The [[steel]] plow allowed farming in the [[American Midwest]], where tough [[prairie]] grasses and rocks caused trouble. Soon after 1900, the [[farm tractor]] was introduced, which eventually made modern large-scale [[agriculture]] possible.

==Alternatives to tilling==
Modern [[agricultural science]] has greatly reduced the use of tillage. Crops can be grown for several years without any tillage through the use of [[herbicide]]s to control weeds, crop varieties that tolerate packed soil, and equipment that can plant seeds or fumigate the soil without really digging it up. This practice, called [[no-till farming]], reduces costs and environmental change by reducing [[soil erosion]] and [[diesel fuel]] usage.

==Site preparation of forest land==
Site preparation is any of various treatments applied to a site in order to ready it for seeding or planting. The purpose is to facilitate the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of that site by the chosen method. Site preparation may be designed to achieve, singly or in any combination: improved access, by reducing or rearranging slash, and amelioration of adverse forest floor, soil, vegetation, or other biotic factors. Site preparation is undertaken to ameliorate one or more constraints that would otherwise be likely to thwart the objectives of management. A valuable bibliography on the effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and [[Taiga|boreal]] tree species has been prepared by McKinnon et al. (2002).&lt;ref name="mck"&gt;McKinnon, L.M.; Mitchell, A.K.; Vyse, A. 2002. The effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and boreal tree species: a bibliography. Nat. Resour., Can., Can. For. Serv., Victoria BC, Inf. Rep. BC-X-394. 29 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Site preparation is the work that is done before a forest area is regenerated. Some types of site preparation are burning.

===Burning===
Broadcast burning is commonly used to prepare clearcut sites for planting, e.g., in central British Columbia,&lt;ref name="Macadam 1987"&gt;Macadam, A.M. 1987. Effects of broadcast slash burning on fuels and soil chemical properties in the sub-boreal spruce zone of central British Columbia. Can. J. For. Res. 17(12):1577–1584.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the temperate region of North America generally.&lt;ref name="kii"&gt;Kiil, A.D.; Chrosciewicz, Z. 1970. Prescribed fire – its place in reforestation. For. Chron. 46:448–451.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescribed burning is carried out primarily for slash hazard reduction and to improve site conditions for regeneration; all or some of the following benefits may accrue:

:a) Reduction of logging slash, plant competition, and humus prior to direct seeding, planting, scarifying or in anticipation of natural seeding in partially cut stands or in connection with seed-tree systems.

:b) Reduction or elimination of unwanted forest cover prior to planting or seeding, or prior to preliminary scarification thereto.

:c) Reduction of humus on cold, moist sites to favour regeneration.

:d) Reduction or elimination of slash, grass, or brush fuels from strategic areas around forested land to reduce the chances of damage by wildfire.

Prescribed burning for preparing sites for direct seeding was tried on a few occasions in Ontario, but none of the burns was hot enough to produce a seedbed that was adequate without supplementary mechanical site preparation.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;Scott, J.D. 1970. Direct seeding in Ontario. For. Chron. 46(6):453–457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in soil chemical properties associated with burning include significantly increased pH, which Macadam (1987)&lt;ref name="Macadam 1987" /&gt; in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone of central British Columbia found persisting more than a year after the burn. Average fuel consumption was 20 to 24 t/ha and the forest floor depth was reduced by 28% to 36%. The increases correlated well with the amounts of slash (both total and ≥7&amp;nbsp;cm diameter) consumed. The change in pH depends on the severity of the burn and the amount consumed; the increase can be as much as 2 units, a 100-fold change.&lt;ref name="holt"&gt;Holt, L. 1955. White spruce seedbeds as related to natural regeneration. Pulp Paper Res. Instit. Can., Montreal QC. 28 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiencies of copper and iron in the foliage of white spruce on burned clearcuts in central British Columbia might be attributable to elevated pH levels.&lt;ref name="Ballard 1985"&gt;Ballard, T.M. 1985. Spruce nutrition problems in the central interior and their relationship with site preparation. Proc. Interior spruce seedling performance: state of the art Symposium. Northern Silviculture Committee Workshop, Feb. 1985, Prince George BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even a broadcast slash fire in a clearcut does not give a uniform burn over the whole area. Tarrant (1954),&lt;ref name="tarr"&gt;Tarrant, R.F. 1954. Effect of slash burning on soil pH. USDA, For. Serv., Pacific Northwest For. and Range Exp. Sta., Portland OR, Res. Note 102. 5 p.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, found only 4% of a 140-ha slash burn had burned severely, 47% had burned lightly, and 49% was unburned. Burning after windrowing obviously accentuates the subsequent heterogeneity.

Marked increases in exchangeable calcium also correlated with the amount of slash at least 7&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter consumed.&lt;ref name="Macadam 1987" /&gt; Phosphorus availability also increased, both in the forest floor and in the 0&amp;nbsp;cm to 15&amp;nbsp;cm mineral soil layer, and the increase was still evident, albeit somewhat diminished, 21 months after burning. However, in another study&lt;ref name="tay"&gt;Taylor, S.W.; Feller, M.C. 1987. Initial effects of slashburning on the nutrient status of Sub-boreal Spruce Zone ecosystems. ''In'' Papers presented at the Fire Management Symposium, April 1987, Prince George BC, Central Interior Fire Protection Committee, Smithers BC.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same Sub-boreal Spruce Zone found that although it increased immediately after the burn, phosphorus availability had dropped to below pre-burn levels within 9 months.

Nitrogen will be lost from the site by burning,&lt;ref name="Macadam 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="litt"&gt;Little, S.N.; Klock, G.O. 1985. The influence of residue removal and prescribed fire on distribution of forest nutrients. USDA, For. Serv., Res. Pap. PNW-333.&lt;/ref&gt; though concentrations in remaining forest floor were found by Macadam (1987)&lt;ref name="Macadam 1987" /&gt; to have increased in 2 of 6 plots, the others showing decreases. Nutrient losses may be outweighed, at least in the short term, by improved soil microclimate through the reduced thickness of forest floor where low soil temperatures are a limiting factor.

The ''Picea/Abies'' forests of the Alberta foothills are often characterized by deep accumulations of organic matter on the soil surface and cold soil temperatures, both of which make reforestation difficult and result in a general deterioration in site productivity; Endean and Johnstone (1974)&lt;ref name="end"&gt;Endean, F.; Johnstone, W.D. 1974. Prescribed fire and regeneration on clearcut spruce–fir sites in the foothills of Alberta. Environ. Can., Can. For. Serv., Northern For. Res. Centre, Edmonton AB, Inf. Rep. NOR-X-126. 33 p.&lt;/ref&gt; describe experiments to test prescribed burning as a means of seedbed preparation and site amelioration on representative clear-felled ''Picea/Abies'' areas. Results showed that, in general, prescribed burning did not reduce organic layers satisfactorily, nor did it increase soil temperature, on the sites tested. Increases in seedling establishment, survival, and growth on the burned sites were probably the result of slight reductions in the depth of the organic layer, minor increases in soil temperature, and marked improvements in the efficiency of the planting crews. Results also suggested that the process of site deterioration has not been reversed by the burning treatments applied.

===Ameliorative intervention===
Slash weight (the oven-dry weight of the entire crown and that portion of the stem &lt; 4 inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the [[Wildfire|forest fire]] hazard on harvested sites.&lt;ref name="kii1"&gt;Kiil, A.D. 1965. Weight and size distribution of slash of white spruce and lodgepole pine. For. Chron. 41:432–437.&lt;/ref&gt; Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968).&lt;ref name="kii2"&gt;Kiil, A.D. 1968. Weight of the fuel complex in 70-year-old lodgepole pine stands of different densities. Department of Forestry and Rural Development, Forest Research Laboratory, Calgary, Alberta. Departmental Publication 1228. 13 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (&lt;1.27&amp;nbsp;cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil's study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; open-grown trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.

The need to provide shade for young outplants of [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]] in the high [[Rocky Mountains]] is emphasized by the U.S. Forest Service. Acceptable planting spots are defined as microsites on the north and east sides of down logs, stumps, or slash, and lying in the shadow cast by such material.&lt;ref name="ronco"&gt;Ronco, F. 1975. Diagnosis: sunburned trees. J. For. 73(1):31–35. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the objectives of management specify more uniform spacing, or higher densities, than obtainable from an existing distribution of shade-providing material, redistribution or importing of such material has been undertaken.

===Access===
Site preparation on some sites might be done simply to facilitate access by planters, or to improve access and increase the number or distribution of microsites suitable for planting or seeding.

Wang et al. (2000)&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;Wang, G.G.; Siemens, A.; Keenan, V.; Philippot, D. 2000. Survival and growth of black and white spruce seedlings in relation to stock type, site preparation and plantation type in southeastern Manitoba. For. Chron. 76(5):775–782.&lt;/ref&gt; determined field performance of white and black spruces 8 and 9 years after outplanting on boreal mixedwood sites following site preparation (Donaren disc trenching versus no trenching) in 2 plantation types (open versus sheltered) in southeastern Manitoba. Donaren trenching slightly reduced the mortality of black spruce but significantly increased the mortality of white spruce. Significant difference in height was found between open and sheltered plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce, and root collar diameter in sheltered plantations was significantly larger than in open plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce. Black spruce open plantation had significantly smaller volume (97&amp;nbsp;cm³) compared with black spruce sheltered (210&amp;nbsp;cm³), as well as white spruce open (175&amp;nbsp;cm³) and sheltered (229&amp;nbsp;cm³) plantations. White spruce open plantations also had smaller volume than white spruce sheltered plantations. For transplant stock, strip plantations had a significantly higher volume (329&amp;nbsp;cm³) than open plantations (204&amp;nbsp;cm³). Wang et al. (2000)&lt;ref name="wang" /&gt; recommended that sheltered plantation site preparation should be used.

===Mechanical===
Up to 1970, no "sophisticated" site preparation equipment had become operational in Ontario,&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;Hall, J. 1970. Site preparation in Ontario. For. Chron. 46:445–447.&lt;/ref&gt; but the need for more efficacious and versatile equipment was increasingly recognized. By this time, improvements were being made to equipment originally developed by field staff, and field testing of equipment from other sources was increasing.

According to J. Hall (1970),&lt;ref name="hall" /&gt; in Ontario at least, the most widely used site preparation technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario's Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.

J. Hall's (1970)&lt;ref name="hall" /&gt; report on the state of site preparation in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant [[hardwood]] stands for natural regeneration of [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]]. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine–spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been "quite successful" for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.

===Mounding===
Site preparation treatments that create raised planting spots have commonly improved outplant performance on sites subject to low soil temperature and excess soil moisture. Mounding can certainly have a big influence on soil temperature. Draper et al. (1985),&lt;ref name="drap"&gt;Draper, D.; Binder, W.; Fahlman, R.; Spittlehouse, D. 1985. Post-planting ecophysiology of Interior spruce. Interior Spruce Seedling Performance: State of the Art. Northern Silvic. Committee, Prince George BC. 18 p. (mimeo).&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, documented this as well as the effect it had on root growth of outplants (Table 30).

The mounds warmed up quickest, and at soil depths of 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm and 10&amp;nbsp;cm averaged 10 and 7&amp;nbsp;°C higher, respectively, than in the control. On sunny days, daytime surface temperature maxima on the mound and organic mat reached 25&amp;nbsp;°C to 60&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on soil wetness and shading. Mounds reached mean soil temperatures of 10&amp;nbsp;°C at 10&amp;nbsp;cm depth 5 days after planting, but the control did not reach that temperature until 58 days after planting. During the first growing season, mounds had 3 times as many days with a mean soil temperature greater than 10&amp;nbsp;°C than did the control microsites.

Draper et al.'s (1985)&lt;ref name="drap" /&gt; mounds received 5 times the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100-600 µEm‾²s‾1 intensity range is the most important for [[photosynthesis]], the mounds received over 4 times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.

===Orientation of linear site preparation===
With linear site preparation, orientation is sometimes dictated by [[topography]] or other considerations, but the orientation can often be chosen. It can make a difference. A disk-trenching experiment in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone in interior British Columbia investigated the effect on growth of young outplants ([[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]) in 13 microsite planting positions: berm, hinge, and trench in each of north, south, east, and west aspects, as well as in untreated locations between the furrows.&lt;ref name="burt"&gt;Burton, P.; Bedford L.; Goldstein, M.; Osberg, M. 2000. Effect of disk trench orientation and planting spot position on the ten-year performance of lodgepole pine. New For. 20:23–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Tenth-year stem volumes of trees on south, east, and west-facing microsites were significantly greater than those of trees on north-facing and untreated microsites. However, planting spot selection was seen to be more important overall than trench orientation.

In a Minnesota study, the N–S strips accumulated more snow but snow melted faster than on E–W strips in the first year after felling.&lt;ref name="clau"&gt;Clausen, J.C.; Mace, A.C., Jr. 1972. Accumulation and snowmelt on north–south versus east–west oriented clearcut strips. Univ. Minnesota, Coll. For., St. Paul MN, Minn. For. Res. Notes No. 34. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Snow-melt was faster on strips near the centre of the strip-felled area than on border strips adjoining the intact stand. The strips, 50 feet (15.24 m) wide, alternating with uncut strips 16 feet (4.88 m) wide, were felled in a ''Pinus resinosa'' stand, aged 90 to 100 years.

==History of translations==
Despite its [[Sanskrit revival|thin popularity as a spoken and colloquial language]], Sanskrit is considered divine and a language of revelation by scholars. This resulted in more than five translations available of the Kural text in Sanskrit. Unlike in other languages where maiden attempts of translating the Kural text is widely made in prose, all translations in Sanskrit are made in verse in the form of typical ''slokas''. This is because historically Sanskrit literature has been in verse, for which it has gained renown.&lt;ref name="OOCities_Sanskrit"&gt;{{cite web

The Kural was translated into Sanskrit for the first time in 1922 by Appa Vajapeyin. It was published by Gururajachariar under the title ''Suniti Kusuma Mala'' at [[Kumbakonam]]. The second translation was published in 1937–1940 by Sankara Subramanya Sastri, who published it as "Sugati Ratnaakaraa" in the journal ''Sahridaya''. Another translation was published in verse by an anonymous translator. It was published in [[Delhi]] and contained prose explanation in [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name="TKSeminarPapers"&gt;{{cite book

'''William Crathorn''' (fl. c. 1330) was an [[England|English]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[philosopher]], from [[Oxford]]. He was a philosopher who immediately followed in the intellectual tradition of [[William of Ockham]] and worked to strengthen his philosophical works. Crathorn created unique theories in the [[philosophy of language]] and [[psychology]], as well as in [[epistemology]] by focusing on the claims of skeptics. Other areas of Crathorn's philosophy, which have not been extensively studied, show promise is revealing more about his life and his work.

==Life==
Almost nothing is certain about Crathorn's life outside of his position as lecturer at Oxford. Crathorn was born in Yorkshire and served as a Dominican [[friar]], lecturing on a book from [[Peter the Lombard]] entitled ''Sentences''. Crathorn is also known to have lectured on the [[Bible]] during his time teaching. His date of birth and death are unknown; the year in which he lectured is known only by an eclipse mentioned in his manuscripts which is known to have occurred in July 1330.

==Epistemology==
Crathorn's philosophy focuses mainly upon [[epistemology]] and the problem of [[knowledge]]. His thoughts on knowledge resemble closely those of [[Roger Bacon]], who held that knowledge of the external world comes from recognition of different "species" of objects. The species which is perceived is both a cause and a likeness in the eye of the perceiver. Crathorn asserts a somewhat [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian view that we have no direct access to things in the external world and that we immediately perceive only their mental likenesses or representations (their species). Crathorn believed that since concepts can only belong to the category of quality, they must be mental qualities having the same nature as non-mental qualities and they must exist subjectively in the mind, which is to say that they exist in some part of the brain. To illuminate this theory, he offered theories of explaining brain function and how such relates to the philosophy of knowledge.

Crathorn affirms that whenever one is contemplating a certain [[concept]], the mind of the person thinking it actually mirrors the concept. He thought that mental concepts cannot resemble substances but only qualities of substances because the species of substance would have to be a substance itself and our minds would turn into a new substance if we thought of it. It also cannot be a pure quantity because in thinking of infinite magnitudes, our minds would become infinite, and the same is true for the other categories besides quality. Crathorn held that one's ability to conceptualize is therefore limited to natural concepts of qualities, which in being conceived become qualities of the soul.

Crathorn also looked into the skeptical challenges which he anticipated in the problem of knowledge. To refute skeptical claims, he turned back to the ''cogito''-argument to prove that we can at least be certain of our own mental activity, for if one were to doubt a proposition such as ‘I am’, it would follow that he exists, since he who does not exist does not doubt.

==Philosophy of Language==
Like much philosophical discussion during his time in England, Crathorn considered the linguistic aspects of science. He questioned whether that when we know something scientifically, is that knowledge about external things, [[proposition]]s, or some other more complex thing. It is believed that Crathorn popularized the notion that neither the external aspect or the proposition is the proper object of science, that the "total significance" of the proposition is most important.

He also discussed the nature of mental language, namely whether it is conventional or natural. Crathorn's predecessors had argued that thinking occurs in a universal language of concepts acquired causally via experience, and that all conventional languages are subordinated to this mental language, which is shared by everyone in an a priori fashion. But Crathorn could not accept such a position because of his view that only qualities are natural signs of their extra-mental significates. Crathorn argued that except for natural signs of qualities, mental language is conventional because it is derived from conventional language. Hence, whatever language one speaks in his head is modeled on that language used for external communication. Crathorn was the revolutionary in his time to affirm that words are prior to ideas and that ideas are shaped by words.

==Ontology==
Crathorn differed from the standard system of [[Aristotle]] of [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]]. Crathorn felt the entire system had to be revised; the human mind naturally knows only qualities, and one cannot be certain that even they exist without appealing to the principle that God could not deceive us. Thinking and reasoning are of no help because they are purely conventional. For example, the category of substance is distinguished from the other categories by the fact that it has no contrary and can successively acquire contrary qualities. Thus, there are no non-substances, though a substance can be black and then white in succession, or cold and then gradually hot. But Crathorn claims that when we heat an object, not only the substance but also its qualities become hot, such that its qualities change from one state to their contrary exactly like a substance.
