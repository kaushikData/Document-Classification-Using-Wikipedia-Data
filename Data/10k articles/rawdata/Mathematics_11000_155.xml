'''Abū Ḥātim al-Muẓaffar al-Isfazārī''' ([[Floruit|fl]]. late 11th – early 12th century CE) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muslim]] [[mathematician]] from [[Khurasan]]. According to [[Ibn al-Athir]] and [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]], he worked in the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] observatory of [[Isfahan]]. [[Nezami Aruzi]] met him in [[Balkh]] in (in present‐day Afghanistan) in 1112 or 1113.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abattouy|first1=Mohammed|title=Isfizari|url=http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Isfizari_BEA.htm|website=islamsci.mcgill.ca|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a contemporary of [[Umar al-Khayyam]] and [[Al-Khazini|Abd al-Raḥmān al-Khāzinī]]. He main work is entitled ''Irshād dhawī al-cirfān ilā ṣinācat al-qaffān'' (Guiding the possessors of learning in the art of the steelyard), a relatively long text on the theory of the steelyard balance with unequal arms. His other surviving works include a summary of [[Euclid's Elements]], a text on geometrical measurements, and a treatise on meteorology in [[Persian language]].

Al-Isfazārī's corpus of mechanics is composed of two sets of texts, which have been published in ''Matn al-Muẓaffar al-Isfazārī fī cilmay al-aṯqāl wa’l-ḥiyal'' by the [[Al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation]].

The cooling itself is done in an algorithmic manner using ordinary quantum operations. The input is a set of qubits, and the output is a subset of qubits cooled to a desired threshold determined by the user. This cooling effect may have usages in initializing cold (highly [[Quantum purity|pure]]) qubits for [[quantum computation]] and in increasing polarization of certain spins in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]. Therefore, it can be used in the initializing process taking place before a regular quantum computation.

==Overview==
Quantum computers need [[qubit]]s (quantum bits) on which they operate. Generally, in order to make the computation more reliable, the qubits must be as [[Quantum purity|pure]] as possible, minimizing possible fluctuations. Since the purity of a qubit is related to [[von Neumann entropy]] and to [[temperature]], making the qubits as pure as possible is equivalent to making them as cold as possible (or having as little entropy as possible). One method of cooling qubits is extracting entropy from them, thus purifying them. This can be done in two general ways: [[Reversible computing|reversibly]] (namely, using [[Unitary operator|unitary operations]]) or [[Irreversible process|irreversibly]] (for example, using a [[Thermal reservoir|heat bath]]). Algorithmic cooling is the name of a family of algorithms that are given a set of qubits and purify (cool) a subset of them to a desirable level.

This can also be viewed in a probabilistic manner. Since qubits are two-level systems, they can be regarded as coins, [[Fair coin|unfair ones]] in general. Purifying a qubit means (in this context) making the coin as '''unfair''' as possible: increasing the difference between the probabilities for tossing different results as much as possible. Moreover, the entropy previously mentioned can be viewed using the prism of [[information theory]], which assigns entropy to any [[random variable]]. The purification can therefore be considered as using probabilistic operations (such as [[Logic gate|classical logical gates]] and [[conditional probability]]) for minimizing the entropy of the coins, making them more unfair.

The case in which the algorithmic method is reversible, such that the total entropy of the system is not changed, was first named "molecular scale heat engine",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schulman |first=Leonard J. |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh V. |date=1999-01-01 |title=Molecular Scale Heat Engines and Scalable Quantum Computation |journal=Proceedings of the Thirty-first Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing |series=STOC '99 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=ACM |pages=322–329 |arxiv=quant-ph/9804060 |doi=10.1145/301250.301332 |isbn=1581130678}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also named "reversible algorithmic cooling". This process cools some qubits while heating the others. It is limited by a variant of [[Shannon–Hartley theorem|Shannon's bound]] on data compression and it can [[asymptotically]] reach quite close to the bound.

A more general method, "irreversible algorithmic cooling", makes use of irreversible transfer of [[heat]] outside of the system and into the environment (and therefore may bypass the Shannon bound). Such an environment can be a heat bath, and the family of algorithms which use it is named "heat-bath algorithmic cooling".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite arxiv |last=Park |first=Daniel K. |last2=Rodriguez-Briones |first2=Nayeli A. |last3=Feng |first3=Guanru |last4=Darabad |first4=Robabeh R. |last5=Baugh |first5=Jonathan |last6=Laflamme |first6=Raymond |date=2015-01-05 |title=Heat Bath Algorithmic Cooling with Spins: Review and Prospects |eprint=1501.00952 |class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this algorithmic process entropy is transferred reversibly to specific qubits (named reset spins) that are coupled with the environment much more strongly than others. After a sequence of reversible steps that let the entropy of these reset qubits increase they become hotter than the environment. Then the strong [[coupling]] results in a heat transfer (irreversibly) from these reset spins to the environment. The entire process may be repeated and may be applied [[Recursion|recursively]] to reach low temperatures for some qubits.

==Background==

===Thermodynamics===
Algorithmic cooling can be discussed using classical and quantum [[thermodynamics]] points of view.

====Cooling====
The classical interpretation of "cooling" is transferring heat from one object to the other. However, the same process can be viewed as [[entropy]] transfer. For example, if two gas containers that are both in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]] with two different temperatures are put in contact, entropy will be transferred from the "hotter" object (with higher entropy) to the "colder" one. This approach can be used when discussing the cooling of an object whose [[temperature]] is not always intuitively defined, e.g. a single particle. Therefore, the process of cooling spins can be thought of as a process of transferring entropy between spins, or outside of the system.

====Heat reservoir====
The concept of [[Thermal reservoir|heat reservoir]] is discussed extensively in classical thermodynamics (for instance in [[carnot cycle]]). For the purposes of algorithmic cooling, it is sufficient to consider heat reservoirs, or "heat baths", as large objects whose temperature remains unchanged even when in contact with other ("normal" sized) objects. Intuitively, this can be pictured as a bath filled with room-temperature water that practically retains its temperature even when a small piece of hot metal is put in it.

Using the entropy form of thinking from the previous subsection, an object which is considered hot (whose entropy is large) can transfer heat (and entropy) to a colder heat bath, thus lowering its own entropy. This process results in cooling.

Unlike entropy transfer between two "regular" objects which preserves the entropy of the system, entropy transfer to a heat bath is normally regarded as non-preserving. This is because the bath is normally not considered as a part of the relevant system, due to its size. Therefore, when transferring entropy to a heat bath, one can essentially lower the entropy of their system, or equivalently, cool it. Continuing this approach, the goal of algorithmic cooling is to reduce as much as possible the entropy of the system of qubits, thus cooling it.

===Quantum mechanics===

====General introduction====
Algorithmic cooling applies to [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] systems. Therefore, it is important to be familiar with both the core principles and the relevant notations.

A [[qubit]] (or quantum [[bit]]) is a unit of information that can be in a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of two [[Quantum state|states]], denoted as &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The general superposition can be written as &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle=\alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle,\,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;| \alpha |^2 + | \beta |^2=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. If one [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measures]] the state of the qubit in the [[orthonormal basis]] composed of &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, one gets the result &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with [[probability]] &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|^2&lt;/math&gt; and the result &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;|\beta|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The above description is known as a quantum [[Quantum purity|pure]] state. A general [[mixed quantum state]] can be prepared as a [[probability distribution]] over pure states, and is represented by a [[density matrix]] of the general form &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sum_i p_i| \psi_i \rangle \langle \psi_i |&lt;/math&gt;, where each &lt;math&gt;|\psi_i \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a pure state (see [[Bra–ket notation|ket-bra notations]]) and each &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of &lt;math&gt;| \psi_i \rangle&lt;/math&gt; in the distribution. The quantum states that play a major role in algorithmic cooling are mixed states in the [[Diagonal matrix|diagonal]] form &lt;math&gt;\rho=\begin{pmatrix}
 \frac{1+\epsilon}2 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; \frac{1-\epsilon}2 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \in [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Essentially, this means that the state is the pure &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; state with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1+\epsilon}2&lt;/math&gt; and is pure &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-\epsilon}2&lt;/math&gt;. In the [[Bra–ket notation|ket-bra notations]], the [[density matrix]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1+\epsilon}2 | 0 \rangle \langle 0 | + \frac{1-\epsilon}2 | 1 \rangle \langle 1 |&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; the state is called pure, and for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=0&lt;/math&gt; the state is called completely mixed (represented by the normalized [[identity matrix]]). The completely mixed state represents a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform probability distribution]] over the states &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

====Polarization or bias of a state====
The state &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; above is called &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-polarized, or &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased, since it deviates by &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; in the diagonal entries from the completely mixed state.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Polarization in Bloch sphere.png|thumb|184x184px|Graphical demonstration of the concept of polarization in [[Bloch sphere]]: The state represented by the density matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased. 
It lies on the imaginary line connecting the antipodal points which represent the (pure) states &lt;math&gt;| 0\rangle ,| 1\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and is within distance &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the sphere, which represents the completely mixed state.
]] --&gt;
Another approach for the definition of bias or polarization is using [[Bloch sphere]] (or generally Bloch [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]]). Restricted to a diagonal density matrix, a state can be on the straight line connecting the antipodal points representing the states &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; ("north and south poles" of the sphere). In this approach, the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; parameter (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon\in [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;) is exactly the distance (up to a sign) of the state from the center of the ball, which represents the completely mixed state. For &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\pm1&lt;/math&gt; the state is exactly on the poles and for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=0&lt;/math&gt; the state is exactly in the center. A bias can be negative (for example &lt;math&gt;-\frac12&lt;/math&gt;), and in this case the state is in the middle between the center and the south pole.

In the [[Pauli matrices]] representation form, an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased quantum state is &lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1+\epsilon &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1-\epsilon \end{pmatrix}=\frac{1}{2}\left(I +(0,0,\epsilon) \cdot \vec{\sigma} \right)=\frac12 (I+\epsilon \sigma_z)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Entropy====
Since quantum systems are involved, the entropy used here is [[von Neumann entropy]]. For a single qubit represented by the (diagonal) density matrix above, its entropy is &lt;math&gt;H(\epsilon)=-\Bigl(\frac{1+\epsilon}2 \log\frac{1+\epsilon}2+\frac{1-\epsilon}2 \log\frac{1-\epsilon}2\Bigr)&lt;/math&gt; (where the [[logarithm]] is to base &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;). This expression coincides with the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of an [[Fair coin|unfair coin]] with "bias" &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, meaning probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1+\epsilon}2&lt;/math&gt; for tossing heads. A coin with bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\pm1&lt;/math&gt; is [[Determinism|deterministic]] with zero entropy, and a coin with bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=0&lt;/math&gt; is fair with maximal entropy (&lt;math&gt;H(\epsilon=0)=\log2=1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The relation between the coins approach and von Neumann entropy is an example of the relation between [[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory|entropy in thermodynamics and in information theory]].

==Intuition==
An intuition for this family of algorithms can come from various fields and mindsets, which are not necessarily quantum. This is due to the fact that these algorithms do not explicitly use quantum phenomena in their operations or analysis, and mainly rely on [[information theory]]. Therefore, the problem can be inspected from a classical (physical, computational, etc.) point of view.

===Physics===
The physical intuition for this family of algorithms comes from classical [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Reversible case====
The basic scenario is an array of [[qubit]]s with equal initial biases. This means that the array contains small thermodynamic systems, each with the same [[entropy]]. The goal is to transfer entropy from some qubits to others, eventually resulting in a sub-array of "cold" qubits and another sub-array of "hot" qubits (the sub-arrays being distinguished by their qubits' entropies, as in the [[#Background|background]] section). The entropy transfers are restricted to be reversible, which means that the total entropy is conserved. Therefore, reversible algorithmic cooling can be seen as an act of redistributing the entropy of all the qubits to obtain a set of colder ones while the others are hotter.

To see the analogy from classical thermodynamics, two qubits can be considered as a gas container with two compartments, separated by a movable and [[Thermal insulation|heat-insulating]] partition. If external [[Work (physics)|work]] is applied in order to move the partition in a reversible manner, the gas in one compartment is compressed, resulting in higher [[temperature]] (and entropy), while the gas in the other is expanding, similarly resulting in lower temperature (and entropy). Since it is reversible, the opposite action can be done, returning the container and the gases to the initial state. The entropy transfer here is analogous to the entropy transfer in algorithmic cooling, in the sense that by applying external work entropy can be transferred reversibly between qubits.

====Irreversible case====
The basic scenario remains the same, however an additional object is present - a [[heat bath]]. This means that entropy can be transferred from the qubits to an external reservoir and some operations can be irreversible, which can be used for cooling some qubits without heating the others. In particular, hot qubits (hotter than the bath) that were on the receiving side of reversible entropy transfer can be cooled by letting them interact with the heat bath. The classical analogy for this situation is the [[Carnot cycle#The Reversed Carnot cycle|Carnot refrigerator]], specifically the stage in which the engine is in contact with the cold [[Thermal reservoir|reservoir]] and heat (and entropy) flows from the engine to the reservoir.

===Information theory===
The intuition for this family of algorithms can come from an extension of Von-Neumann's solution for the problem of obtaining [[Fair coin#Fair results from a biased coin|fair results from a biased coin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peres |first=Yuval |date=1992-03-01 |title=Iterating Von Neumann's Procedure for Extracting Random Bits |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176348543 |journal=The Annals of Statistics |language=EN |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=590–597 |doi=10.1214/aos/1176348543}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to algorithmic cooling, the bias of the qubits is merely a probability bias, or the "unfairness" of a coin.

==Applications==
Two typical applications that require a large number of pure qubits are [[quantum error correction]] (QEC)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and ensemble computing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In realizations of [[quantum computing]] (implementing and applying the algorithms on actual qubits), algorithmic cooling was involved in realizations in [[optical lattice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bakr |first=Waseem S. |last2=Preiss |first2=Philipp M. |last3=Tai |first3=M. Eric |last4=Ma |first4=Ruichao |last5=Simon |first5=Jonathan |last6=Greiner |first6=Markus |date=2011-12-22 |title=Orbital excitation blockade and algorithmic cooling in quantum gases |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v480/n7378/full/nature10668.html |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=480 |issue=7378 |pages=500–503 |arxiv=1105.5834 |doi=10.1038/nature10668 |doi-access=free|bibcode=2011Natur.480..500B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, algorithmic cooling can be applied to [[in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy|''in vivo'' magnetic resonance spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Quantum error correction===
[[Quantum error correction]] is a quantum algorithm for protection from errors. The algorithm operates on the relevant qubits (which operate within the computation) and needs a supply of new pure qubits for each round. This requirement can be weakened&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Criger |first=Ben |last2=Moussa |first2=Osama |last3=Laflamme |first3=Raymond |date=2012-04-20 |title=Quantum Error Correction with Mixed Ancilla Qubits |arxiv=1201.1517 |journal=Physical Review A |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=044302 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.85.044302|bibcode=2012PhRvA..85d4302C }}&lt;/ref&gt; to purity above a certain thershold instead of requiring fully pure qubits. For this, algorithmic cooling can be used to produce qubits with the desired purity for quantum error correction.

===Ensemble computing===
Ensemble computing is a computational model that uses a [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] number of identical computers. Each computer contains a certain number of qubits, and the computational operations are performed simultaneously on all the computers. The output of the computation can be obtained by measuring the state of the entire ensemble, which would be the average output of each computer in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cory |first=David G. |last2=Fahmy |first2=Amr F. |last3=Havel |first3=Timothy F. |date=1997-03-04 |year=|title=Ensemble quantum computing by NMR spectroscopy |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/94/5/1634.full |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=1634–1639 |pmc=19968 |pmid=9050830 |via= |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.5.1634|bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.1634C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the number of computers is macroscopic, the output signal is easier to detect and measure than the output signal of each single computer.

This model is widely used in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer|NMR quantum computing]]: each computer is represented by a single (identical) molecule, and the qubits of each computer are the [[Spin (physics)|nuclear spins]] of its [[atom]]s. The obtained (averaged) output is a detectable [[Magnetism|magnetic]] signal.

===NMR spectroscopy===
[[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (sometimes called MRS - magnetic resonance spectroscopy) is a non-invasive technique related to MRI ([[magnetic resonance imaging]]) for analyzing [[Metabolism|metabolic]] changes ''[[in vivo]]'' (from Latin: "within the living organism"), which can potentially be used for [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosing]] [[brain tumor]]s, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], etc. It uses some magnetic properties of the relevant [[metabolite]]s to measure their [[concentration]]s in the body, which are correlated with certain diseases. For example, the difference between the concentrations of the metabolites [[glutamate]] and [[glutamine]] can be linked to some stages of [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] diseases, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jansen |first=Jacobus F. A. |last2=Backes |first2=Walter H. |last3=Nicolay |first3=Klaas |last4=Kooi |first4=M.

Some uses of MRS focus on the [[carbon]] atoms of the metabolites (see [[carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance]]). One major reason for this is the presence of carbon in a large portion of all tested metabolites. Another reason is the ability to [[Biomarker|mark]] certain metabolites by the [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] [[isotope]], which is more easy to measure than the usually used [[hydrogen]] atoms mainly because of its magnetic properties (such as its [[gyromagnetic ratio]]).

In MRS, the nuclear spins of the atoms of the metabolites are required to be with a certain degree of polarization, so the [[spectroscopy]] can succeed. Algorithmic cooling can be applied&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; ''in vivo'', increasing the resolution and precision of the MRS. Realizations (not in vivo) of algorithmic cooling on metabolites with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope have been shown to increase the polarization of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in amino acids&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Elias |first=Y. |last2=Gilboa |first2=H. |last3=Mor |first3=T. |last4=Weinstein |first4=Y. |date=2011-12-07 |title=Heat-bath cooling of spins in two amino acids |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |volume=517 |issue=4–6 |pages=126–131 |arxiv=1108.5109 |doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2011.10.039|bibcode=2011CPL...517..126E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Atia |first=Yosi |last2=Elias |first2=Yuval |last3=Mor |first3=Tal |last4=Weinstein |first4=Yossi |date=2016-01-14 |title=Algorithmic Cooling in Liquid State NMR |arxiv=1411.4641 |journal=Physical Review A |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=012325 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012325|bibcode=2016PhRvA..93a2325A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brassard |first=G. |last2=Elias |first2=Y. |last3=Fernandez |first3=J.

MRS can be used to obtain [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] information about certain body [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] in a non-invasive manner. This means that the operation must be carried out at room [[temperature]]. Some methods of increasing polarization of spins (such as [[Hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]], and in particular [[Dynamic nuclear polarisation|dynamic nuclear polarization]]) are not able to operate under this condition since they require a cold environment (a typical value is 1K, about -272 [[degrees Celsius]]). On the other hand, algorithmic cooling can be operated in room temperature and be used in MRS ''in vivo,''&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; while methods that required lower temperature can be used in [[biopsy]], outside of the living body.

==Reversible algorithmic cooling - basic compression subroutine==
The algorithm operates on an array of equally (and independently) biased qubits. After the algorithm transfers heat (and entropy) from some qubits to the others, the resulting qubits are rearranged in increasing order of bias. Then this array is divided into two sub-arrays: "cold" qubits (with bias exceeding a certain threshold chosen by the user) and "hot" qubits (with bias lower than that threshold). Only the "cold" qubits are used for further [[quantum computation]]. The basic procedure is called "Basic Compression Subroutine"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or "3 Bit Compression".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandez |first=Jose M. |last2=Lloyd |first2=Seth |last3=Mor |first3=Tal |last4=Roychowdhury |first4=Vwani |date=2004-01-21 |title=Algorithmic Cooling of Spins: A Practicable Method for Increasing Polarization |journal=International Journal of Quantum Information |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=461–467 |arxiv=quant-ph/0401135 |doi=10.1142/S0219749904000419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reversible case can be demonstrated on 3 qubits, using the probabilistic approach. Each qubit is represented by a "coin" (two-level system) whose sides are labeled 0 and 1, and with a certain bias: each coin is independently with bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, meaning probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1+\epsilon}2&lt;/math&gt; for tossing 0. The coins are &lt;math&gt;A,B,C &lt;/math&gt; and the goal is to use coins &lt;math&gt;B,C &lt;/math&gt; to cool coin (qubit) &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt;. The procedure:
# Toss coins &lt;math&gt;A,B,C &lt;/math&gt; independently.
# Apply '''[[Controlled NOT gate|C-NOT]]''' on &lt;math&gt;B,C &lt;/math&gt;.
# Use coin &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt; for conditioning '''[[Swap (computer science)|C-SWAP]]''' of coins &lt;math&gt;A,C &lt;/math&gt;.
After this procedure, the average ([[expected value]]) of the bias of coin &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is, to [[Leading-order term|leading order]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{new} ^{average}=\frac32 \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===C-NOT step===
Coins &lt;math&gt;B,C &lt;/math&gt; are used for [[Controlled NOT gate|C-NOT]] operation, also known as [[Exclusive or|XOR]] (exclusive or). The operation is applied in the following manner: &lt;math&gt;A_{new}=A, B_{new}=B\oplus C, C_{new}=C &lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;B\oplus C &lt;/math&gt; is computed and replaces the old value of &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A,C &lt;/math&gt; remain unchanged. More specifically, the following operation is applied:
* If the result of coin &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt; is 1:
** Flip coin &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt; without looking at the result
* Else (the result of coin &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt; is 0):
** Do nothing (still without looking at the result of &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt;)
Now, the result of coin &lt;math&gt;B_{new} &lt;/math&gt; is checked (without looking at &lt;math&gt;A_{new},C_{new} &lt;/math&gt;). Classically, this means that the result of coin &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt; must be "forgotten" (cannot be used anymore). This is somewhat problematic classically, because the result of coin &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt; is no longer probabilistic; however, the equivalent quantum operators (which are the ones that are actually used in realizations and implementations of the algorithm) are capable of doing so.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the C-NOT operation is over, the bias of coin &lt;math&gt;C_{new} &lt;/math&gt; is computed using [[conditional probability]]:
# If &lt;math&gt;B_{new}=0 &lt;/math&gt; (meaning &lt;math&gt;B=C &lt;/math&gt;): &lt;math&gt;P(C_{new}=0 | B=C)=\frac{P(B=C=0)}{P(B=C)}=
\frac{\frac{(1+\epsilon)^2}{4}}{\frac{(1+\epsilon)^2}{4}+\frac{(1-\epsilon)^2}{4}}

=\frac{\frac{(1+\epsilon)^2}{4}}{\frac{1+\epsilon^2}{2}}=\frac{1+\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon^2}}2 &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the new bias of coin &lt;math&gt;C_{new} &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon^2} &lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;B_{new}=1 &lt;/math&gt; (meaning &lt;math&gt;B\neq C &lt;/math&gt;): &lt;math&gt;P(C_{new}=0 | B\neq C)=\frac{P(C=0,B=1)}{P(B\neq C)}=
\frac{\frac{1+\epsilon}{2} \frac{1-\epsilon}{2}}{\frac{1+\epsilon}{2} \frac{1-\epsilon}{2}+\frac{1-\epsilon}{2} \frac{1+\epsilon}{2}}

=\frac{\frac{1-\epsilon^2}{4}}{\frac{1-\epsilon^2}{2}}=\frac12 &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the new bias of coin &lt;math&gt;C_{new} &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;.

===C-SWAP step===
Coins &lt;math&gt;A_{new},B_{new},C_{new} &lt;/math&gt; are used for C-[[Swap (computer programming)|SWAP]] operation. The operation is applied in the following manner: &lt;math&gt;A'=A_{new}B_{new}+\overline{B_{new}}C_{new}, B'=B_{new}, C'=A_{new}\overline{B_{new}}+B_{new}C_{new} &lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;A_{new},C_{new} &lt;/math&gt; are swapped if &lt;math&gt;B_{new}=0 &lt;/math&gt;.

After the C-SWAP operation is over:
# If &lt;math&gt;B_{new}=0 &lt;/math&gt;: coins &lt;math&gt;A_{new} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{new} &lt;/math&gt; have been swapped, hence coin &lt;math&gt;A' &lt;/math&gt; is now &lt;math&gt;\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon^2} &lt;/math&gt;-biased and coin &lt;math&gt;C' &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;-biased.
# Else (&lt;math&gt;B_{new}=1 &lt;/math&gt;): coin &lt;math&gt;A' &lt;/math&gt; remains unchanged (still of bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;) and coin &lt;math&gt;C' &lt;/math&gt; remains with bias &lt;math&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;. In this case, coin &lt;math&gt;C' &lt;/math&gt; can be discarded from the system, as it is too "hot" (its bias is too low, or, equivalently, its entropy is too high).
The average bias of coin &lt;math&gt;A' &lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by looking at those two cases, using the final bias in each case and the probability of each case:
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{new} ^{average}=P(B_{new}=0)\cdot 
\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon^2 } + P(B_{new}=1)\cdot 
\epsilon=\left( \frac{(1+\epsilon)^2}{4}+\frac{(1-\epsilon)^2}{4}\right)\cdot 
\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon^2 } + \left(\frac{1+\epsilon}{2}\frac{1-\epsilon}{2}+\frac{1-\epsilon}{2}\frac{1+\epsilon}{2}\right)\cdot \epsilon=\frac{3\epsilon}2 -\frac{\epsilon^3}2 &lt;/math&gt;
Using the approximation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the new average bias of coin &lt;math&gt;A' &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{new} ^{average}=\frac32 \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, these two steps increase the polarization of coin &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; on average.

===Alternative explanation: quantum operations===
The algorithm can be written using quantum operations on qubits, as opposed to the classical treatment. In particular, the C-NOT and C-SWAP steps can be replaced by a single [[Unitary matrix|unitary]] [[Operator (physics)|quantum operator]] that operates on the 3 qubits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although this operation changes qubits &lt;math&gt;B,C &lt;/math&gt; in a different manner than the two classical steps, it yields the same final bias for qubit &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt;. The operator &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; can be uniquely defined by its action on the computational basis of the [[Hilbert space]] of 3 qubits:
: &lt;math&gt; | 0 0 0\rangle \mapsto | 0 0 0\rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; | 0 0 1\rangle \mapsto | 0 0 1\rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; | 0 1 0\rangle \mapsto | 01 0\rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; | 0 11\rangle \mapsto | 1 0 0\rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; | 100\rangle \mapsto | 0 11\rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; | 101\rangle \mapsto | 101\rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; | 11 0\rangle \mapsto | 11 0\rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; | 111\rangle \mapsto | 111\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
In matrix form, this operator is the [[identity matrix]] of size 8, except that the 4th and 5th rows are swapped. The result of this operation can be obtained by writing the [[product state]] of the 3 qubits, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{A,B,C}=\rho_A \otimes \rho_B \otimes \rho_C&lt;/math&gt;, and applying &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; on it. Afterwards, the bias of qubit &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by [[Projection (linear algebra)|projecting]] its state on the state &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; (without projecting qubits &lt;math&gt;B,C &lt;/math&gt;) and taking the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the result (see [[Density matrix#Measurement|density matrix measurement]]):

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1+\epsilon^{average} _{new}}2=\operatorname{tr}[(P_0 \otimes I \otimes I) (U\rho_{A,B,C}U^{\dagger})]=\frac{1+\frac{3\epsilon}2-\frac{\epsilon^3}{2}}2
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_0=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}=| 0 \rangle \langle 0 |&lt;/math&gt; is the projection on the state &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

Again, using the approximation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the new average bias of coin &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{new} ^{average}=\frac32 \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

==Heat-bath algorithmic cooling (irreversible algorithmic cooling)==
The irreversible case is an extension of the reversible case: it uses the reversible algorithm as a subroutine. The irreversible algorithm contains another procedure called "Refresh"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and extends the reversible one by using a [[Thermal reservoir|heat bath]]. This allows for cooling certain qubits (called "reset qubits") without affecting the others, which results in an overall cooling of all the qubits as a system. The cooled reset qubits are used for cooling the rest (called "computational qubits") by applying a compression on them which is similar to the basic compression subroutine from the reversible case. The "insulation" of the computational qubits from the heat bath is a theoretical idealization that does not always hold when implementing the algorithm. However, with a proper choice of the physical implementation of each type of qubit, this assumption fairly holds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There are many different versions of this algorithm, with different uses of the reset qubits and different achievable biases.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brassard |first=Gilles |last2=Elias |first2=Yuval |last3=Mor |first3=Tal |last4=Weinstein |first4=Yossi |date=2014-11-28 |title=Prospects and limitations of algorithmic cooling |journal=The European Physical Journal Plus |language=en |volume=129 |issue=11 |pages=258 |arxiv=1404.6824 |doi=10.1140/epjp/i2014-14258-0|bibcode=2014EPJP..129..258B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schulman |first=L. |last2=Mor |first2=T. |last3=Weinstein |first3=Y. |date=2007-01-01 |title=Physical Limits of Heat‐Bath Algorithmic Cooling |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=1729–1747 |doi=10.1137/050666023|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/8355/1/SCHUsiamjc07.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The common idea behind them can be demonstrated using three qubits: two computational qubits &lt;math&gt;A,B &lt;/math&gt; and one reset qubit &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Each of the three qubits is initially in a completely mixed state with bias &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (see the [[#Background|background]] section). The following steps are then applied:
# Refresh: the reset qubit &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt; interacts with the heat bath.
# Compression: a reversible compression (entropy transfer) is applied on the three qubits.
Each round of the algorithm consists of three iterations, and each iteration consists of these two steps (refresh, and then compression). The compression step in each iteration is slightly different, but its goal is to sort the qubits in descending order of bias, so that the reset qubit would have the smallest bias (namely, the highest temperature) of all qubits. This serves two goals:
* Transferring as much entropy as possible away from the computational qubits.
* Transferring as much entropy as possible away from the whole system (and in particular the reset qubit) and into the bath in the following refresh step.
When writing the density matrices after each iteration, the compression step in the 1st round can be effectively treated as follows:
* 1st iteration: swap qubit &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; with the previously-refreshed reset qubit &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt;.
* 2nd iteration: swap qubit &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt; with the previously-refreshed reset qubit &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt;.
* 3rd iteration: boost the bias of qubit &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt;.
The description of the compression step in the following rounds depends on the state of the system before the round has begun and may be more complicated than the above description. In this illustrative description of the algorithm, the boosted bias of qubit &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; (obtained after the end of the first round) is &lt;math&gt;\frac{3\epsilon_b}2 -\frac{\epsilon_b^3}2 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_b &lt;/math&gt; is the bias of the qubits within the heat bath.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This result is obtained after the last compression step; just before this step, the qubits were each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_b &lt;/math&gt;-biased, which is exactly the state of the qubits before the reversible algorithm is applied.

===Refresh step===
The contact that is established between the reset qubit and the heat bath can be modeled in a several possible ways:
#A physical interaction between two thermodynamic systems, which eventually results in a reset qubit whose temperature is identical to the bath temperature (equivalently - with bias equal to the bias of the qubits in the bath, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_b &lt;/math&gt;). 
#A mathematical [[Partial trace|trace-out]] on the reset qubit, followed by taking the system in a product state with a fresh new qubit from the bath. This means that we lose the former reset qubit and gain a refreshed new one. Formally, this can be written as &lt;math&gt;\rho_{new}=tr_{C}(\rho)\otimes \rho_{\epsilon_b} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{new} &lt;/math&gt; is the new density matrix (after the operation is held), &lt;math&gt;tr_{C}(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[partial trace]] operation on the reset qubit &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \rho_{\epsilon_b} &lt;/math&gt; is the density matrix describing a (new) qubit from the bath, with bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_b &lt;/math&gt;. 
In both ways, the result is a reset qubit whose bias is identical to the bias of the qubits in the bath. In addition, the resulted reset qubit is uncorrelated with the other ones, independently of the correlations between them before the refresh step was held. Therefore, the refresh step can be viewed as discarding the information about the current reset qubit and gaining information about a fresh new one from the bath.

===Compression step===
The goal of this step is to reversibly redistribute the entropy of all qubits, such that the biases of the qubits are in descending (or non-ascending) order. The operation is done reversibly in order to prevent the entropy of the entire system from increasing (as it cannot decrease in a closed system, see [[entropy]]). In terms of temperature, this step rearranges the qubits in ascending order of temperature, so that the reset qubits are the hottest. In the example of the three qubits &lt;math&gt;A,B,C &lt;/math&gt;, this means that after the compression is done, the bias of qubit &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is the highest and the bias of &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt; is the lowest. In addition, the compression is used for the cooling of the computational qubits.

The state of the system will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon_A,\epsilon_B,\epsilon_C)&lt;/math&gt; if the qubits &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated with each other (namely, if the system is in a [[product state]]) and their corresponding biases are &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_A,\epsilon_B,\epsilon_C&lt;/math&gt;.

The compression can be described as a sort operation on the diagonal entries of the [[density matrix]] which describes the system. For instance, if the state of the system after a certain reset step is &lt;math&gt;(2\epsilon_b,0,\epsilon_b)&lt;/math&gt;, then the compression operates on the state as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\rho_{ABC}=\frac 18\operatorname{diag}\begin{pmatrix} (1+2\epsilon_b)(1+\epsilon_b) \\ (1+2\epsilon_b)(1-\epsilon_b) \\ (1+2\epsilon_b)(1+\epsilon_b) \\ (1+2\epsilon_b)(1-\epsilon_b) \\ (1-2\epsilon_b)(1+\epsilon_b) \\ (1-2\epsilon_b)(1-\epsilon_b) \\ (1-2\epsilon_b)(1+\epsilon_b) \\ (1-2\epsilon_b)(1-\epsilon_b)\end{pmatrix} \xrightarrow{compression} \rho_{ABC}'=\frac 18\operatorname{diag}\begin{pmatrix} (1+2\epsilon_b)(1+\epsilon_b) \\ (1+2\epsilon_b)(1+\epsilon_b) \\ (1+2\epsilon_b)(1-\epsilon_b) \\ (1+2\epsilon_b)(1-\epsilon_b) \\ (1-2\epsilon_b)(1+\epsilon_b) \\ (1-2\epsilon_b)(1+\epsilon_b) \\ (1-2\epsilon_b)(1-\epsilon_b) \\ (1-2\epsilon_b)(1-\epsilon_b)\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This notation denotes a [[diagonal matrix]] whose diagonal entries are listed within the parentheses. The density matrices &lt;math&gt;\rho_{ABC}, \rho_{ABC}'&lt;/math&gt; represent the state of the system (including possible correlations between the qubits) before and after the compression step, respectively. In the above notations, the state after compression is &lt;math&gt;(2\epsilon_b,\epsilon_b,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

This sort operation is used for the rearrangement of the qubits in descending order of bias.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As in the example, for some cases the sort operation can be described by a simpler operation, such as [[Swap (computer programming)|swap]]. However, the general form of the compression operation is a sort operation on the diagonal entries of the density matrix.

For an intuitive demonstration of the compression step, the flow of the algorithm in the 1st round is presented below:
* 1st Iteration: 
** After the refresh step, the state is &lt;math&gt;(0,0,\epsilon_b)&lt;/math&gt;.
** After the compression step (which swaps qubits &lt;math&gt;A,C&lt;/math&gt;), the state is &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon_b,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;.
* 2nd Iteration: 
** After the refresh step, the state is &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon_b,0,\epsilon_b)&lt;/math&gt;.
** After the compression step (which swaps qubits &lt;math&gt;B,C&lt;/math&gt;), the state is &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon_b,\epsilon_b,0)&lt;/math&gt;.
* 3rd Iteration: 
** After the refresh step, the state is &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon_b,\epsilon_b,\epsilon_b)&lt;/math&gt;.
** After the compression step (which boosts the bias of qubit &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt;), the biases of the qubits are &lt;math&gt;\frac{3\epsilon_b}2 -\frac{\epsilon_b^3}2,
\frac{\epsilon_b}2+\frac{\epsilon_b^3}2,
\frac{\epsilon_b}2+\frac{\epsilon_b^3}2&lt;/math&gt;, which can be approximated (to leading order) by &lt;math&gt;\frac{3\epsilon_b}2,
\frac{\epsilon_b}2,
\frac{\epsilon_b}2&lt;/math&gt;. Here, each bias is independently defined as the bias of the matching qubit when discarding the rest of the system (using [[partial trace]]), even when there are [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]] between them. Therefore, this notation cannot fully describe the system, but can only be used as an intuitive demonstration of the steps of the algorithm.

After the 1st round is over, the bias of the reset qubit (&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon_b}2+\frac{\epsilon_b^3}2&lt;/math&gt;) is smaller than the bias of the heat bath (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_b&lt;/math&gt;). This means that in the next refresh step (in the 2nd round of the algorithm), the reset qubit will be replaced by a fresh qubit with bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_b&lt;/math&gt;: this cools the entire system, similarly to the previous refresh steps. Afterwards, the algorithm continues in a similar way.

===General results===
The number of rounds is not bounded: since the biases of the reset qubits asymptotically reach the bias of the bath after each round, the bias of the target computational qubit asymptotically reaches its limit as the algorithm proceeds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The target qubit is the computational qubit that the algorithm aims to cool the most. The "cooling limit" (the maximum bias the target qubit can reach) depends on the bias of the bath and the number of qubits of each kind in the system. If the number of the computational qubits (excluding the target one) is &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; and the number of reset qubits is &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then the cooling limit is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{max}=\frac{(1+\epsilon_b)^{m 2^{n'}}-(1-\epsilon_b)^{m 2^{n'}}}{(1+\epsilon_b)^{m 2^{n'}}+(1-\epsilon_b)^{m 2^{n'}}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the case where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{b}\ll m 2^{n'}&lt;/math&gt;, the maximal polarization that can be obtained is proportional to &lt;math&gt;m 2^{n'}&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, the maximal bias reaches arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The number of rounds required in order to reach a certain bias depends on the desired bias, the bias of the bath and the number of qubits, and moreover varies between different versions of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Elias |first=Yuval |last2=Mor |first2=Tal |last3=Weinstein |first3=Yossi |date=2011-04-29 |title=Semi-optimal Practicable Algorithmic Cooling |arxiv=1110.5892 |journal=Physical Review A |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=042340 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.83.042340|bibcode=2011PhRvA..83d2340E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are other theoretical results which give bounds on the number of iterations required to reach a certain bias. For example, if the bias of the bath is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_b \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;, then the number of iterations required to cool a certain qubit to bias &lt;math&gt;k\epsilon_b \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; is at least &lt;math&gt;k^2&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5179">In [[mathematics]], especially [[several complex variables]], an '''analytic polyhedron''' is a subset of the [[Complex coordinate space|complex space]] {{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\{ z \in D : |f_j(z)| &lt; 1, \;\; 1 \le j \le N \}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''D''}} is a bounded connected open subset of {{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; are [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on {{math|''D''}}.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Åhag|Czyż|Lodin|Wikström|2007|p=139}} and {{harv|Khenkin|1990|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; above are polynomials, then the set is called a '''polynomial polyhedron'''. Every analytic polyhedron is a [[domain of holomorphy]] and it is thus [[pseudoconvex set|pseudo-convex]].

The boundary of an analytic polyhedron is the union of the set of hypersurfaces

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_j = \{ z \in D : |f_j(z)| = 1 \}, \; 1 \le j \le N. &lt;/math&gt;

An analytic polyhedron is a ''Weil polyhedron'', or [[Weil domain]] if the intersection of {{math|''k''}} hypersurfaces has dimension no greater than {{math|2''n-k''}}.&lt;ref name=Khenkin1990&gt;{{harv|Khenkin|1990|pp=35–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15308">{{dablink|For generalizations of Lambert series see [[Appell&amp;ndash;Lerch series]].}}
In mathematics, '''Appell [[series (mathematics)|series]]''' are a set of four [[hypergeometric series]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of two [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s that were introduced by {{harvs | txt | authorlink= Paul Émile Appell | first= Paul | last= Appell | year= 1880}} and that generalize [[hypergeometric function|Gauss's hypergeometric series]] &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of one variable. Appell established the set of [[partial differential equation]]s of which these [[function (mathematics)|function]]s are solutions, and found various reduction formulas and expressions of these series in terms of hypergeometric series of one variable.

==Definitions==
The Appell series ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is defined for |''x''| &lt; 1, |''y''| &lt; 1 by the double series:

:&lt;math&gt;
F_1(a,b_1,b_2;c;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_{m+n} (b_1)_m (b_2)_n} {(c)_{m+n} \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_1(a,b_1,b_2;c;x,y) = \sum_{r=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_r (b_1)_r (b_2)_r (c-a)_r} {(c+r-1)_r (c)_{2r} r!} \,x^r y^r {}_2F_{1}\left(a+r,b_1+r;c+2r;x\right){}_2F_{1}\left(a+r,b_2+r;c+2r;y\right)~&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Pochhammer symbol]] (''q'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the rising factorial:

:&lt;math&gt;(q)_n = q\,(q+1) \cdots (q+n-1) = \frac{\Gamma(q+n)}{\Gamma(q)}~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equality is true for all complex &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; except &lt;math&gt;q=0,-1,-2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;.

For other values of ''x'' and ''y'' the function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined by [[analytic continuation]].

Similarly, the function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is defined for |''x''| + |''y''| &lt; 1 by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(a,b_1,b_2;c_1,c_2;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_{m+n} (b_1)_m (b_2)_n} {(c_1)_m (c_2)_n \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(a,b_1,b_2;c_1,c_2;x,y) = \sum_{r=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_r (b_1)_r (b_2)_r} {(c_1)_r (c_2)_r r!} \,x^r y^r {}_2F_{1}\left(a+r,b_1+r;c_1+2r;x\right){}_2F_{1}\left(a+r,b_2+r;c_2+2r;y\right)~&lt;/math&gt;
 
the function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for |''x''| &lt; 1, |''y''| &lt; 1 by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2;c;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a_1)_m (a_2)_n (b_1)_m (b_2)_n} {(c)_{m+n} \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

and the function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for |''x''|&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt; + |''y''|&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 1 by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
F_4(a,b;c_1,c_2;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_{m+n} (b)_{m+n}} {(c_1)_m (c_2)_n \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Recurrence relations==
Like the Gauss hypergeometric series &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the Appell double series entail [[recurrence relation]]s among contiguous functions. For example, a basic set of such relations for Appell's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
(a-b_1-b_2) F_1(a,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) - a \,F_1(a+1,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) + b_1 F_1(a,b_1+1,b_2,c; x,y) + b_2 F_1(a,b_1,b_2+1,c; x,y) = 0 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
c \,F_1(a,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) - (c-a) F_1(a,b_1,b_2,c+1; x,y) - a \,F_1(a+1,b_1,b_2,c+1; x,y) = 0 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
c \,F_1(a,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) + c(x-1) F_1(a,b_1+1,b_2,c; x,y) - (c-a)x \,F_1(a,b_1+1,b_2,c+1; x,y) = 0 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
c \,F_1(a,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) + c(y-1) F_1(a,b_1,b_2+1,c; x,y) - (c-a)y \,F_1(a,b_1,b_2+1,c+1; x,y) = 0 ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Any other relation&lt;ref&gt;For example, &lt;math&gt;(y-x) F_1(a, b_1+1, b_2+1,c,x,y) = y \, F_1(a,b_1,b_2+1,c,x,y) - x \, F_1(a,b_1+1,b_2,c,x,y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; valid for ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be derived from these four.

Similarly, all recurrence relations for Appell's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; follow from this set of five:

:&lt;math&gt;
c \,F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) + (a_1+a_2-c) F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c+1; x,y) - a_1 F_3(a_1+1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c+1; x,y) - a_2 F_3(a_1,a_2+1,b_1,b_2,c+1; x,y) = 0 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
c \,F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) - c \,F_3(a_1+1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) + b_1 x \,F_3(a_1+1,a_2,b_1+1,b_2,c+1; x,y) = 0 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
c \,F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) - c \,F_3(a_1,a_2+1,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) + b_2 y \,F_3(a_1,a_2+1,b_1,b_2+1,c+1; x,y) = 0 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
c \,F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) - c \,F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1+1,b_2,c; x,y) + a_1 x \,F_3(a_1+1,a_2,b_1+1,b_2,c+1; x,y) = 0 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
c \,F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) - c \,F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2+1,c; x,y) + a_2 y \,F_3(a_1,a_2+1,b_1,b_2+1,c+1; x,y) = 0 ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivatives and differential equations==
For Appell's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the following [[derivative]]s result from the definition by a double series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial^n} {\partial x^n} F_1(a,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) = \frac {\left(a\right)_n \left(b_1\right)_n} {\left(c\right)_n} F_1(a+n,b_1+n,b_2,c+n; x,y) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial^n} {\partial y^n} F_1(a,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) = \frac {\left(a\right)_n \left(b_2\right)_n} {\left(c\right)_n} F_1(a+n,b_1,b_2+n,c+n; x,y) 
&lt;/math&gt;

From its definition, Appell's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is further found to satisfy the following system of second-order [[partial differential equation|differential equations]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
x(1-x) \frac {\partial^2F_1(x,y)} {\partial x^2} + y(1-x) \frac {\partial^2F_1(x,y)} 
{\partial x \partial y} + [c - (a+b_1+1) x] \frac {\partial F_1(x,y)} {\partial x} - b_1 y 
\frac {\partial F_1(x,y)} {\partial y} - a b_1 F_1(x,y) = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y(1-y) \frac {\partial^2F_1(x,y)} {\partial y^2} + x(1-y) \frac {\partial^2F_1(x,y)} 
{\partial x \partial y} + [c - (a+b_2+1) y] \frac {\partial F_1(x,y)} {\partial y} - b_2 x 
\frac {\partial F_1(x,y)} {\partial x} - a b_2 F_1(x,y)= 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

A system partial differential equations for ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x(1-x) \frac {\partial^2F_2(x,y)} {\partial x^2} - xy \frac {\partial^2F_2(x,y)} 
{\partial x \partial y} + [c_1 - (a+b_1+1) x] \frac {\partial F_2(x,y)} {\partial x} -b_1 y \frac {\partial F_2(x,y)} {\partial y}- 
a b_1 F_2(x,y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y(1-y) \frac {\partial^2F_2(x,y)} {\partial y^2} - xy \frac {\partial^2F_2(x,y)} 
{\partial x \partial y} + [c_2 - (a+b_2+1) x] \frac {\partial F_2(x,y)} {\partial y} -b_2 x \frac {\partial F_2(x,y)} {\partial x}- 
a b_2 F_2(x,y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The system have solution

:&lt;math&gt;F_2(x,y)=C_1F_2(a,b_1,b_2,c_1,c_2;x,y)+C_2x^{1-c_1}F_2(a-c_1+1,b_1-c_1+1,b_2,2-c_1,c_2;x,y)+C_3y^{1-c_2}F_2(a-c_2+1,b_1,b_2-c_2+1,c_1,2-c_2;x,y)+C_4x^{1-c_1}y^{1-c_2}F_2(a-c_1-c_2+2,b_1-c_1+1,b_2-c_2+1,2-c_1,2-c_2;x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the following derivatives result from the definition:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial} {\partial x} F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) = \frac {a_1 b_1} {c} F_3(a_1+1,a_2,b_1+1,b_2,c+1; x,y) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial} {\partial y} F_3(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) = \frac {a_2 b_2} {c} F_3(a_1,a_2+1,b_1,b_2+1,c+1; x,y) 
&lt;/math&gt;

And for ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the following system of differential equations is obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;
x(1-x) \frac {\partial^2F_3(x,y)} {\partial x^2} + y \frac {\partial^2F_3(x,y)} 
{\partial x \partial y} + [c - (a_1+b_1+1) x] \frac {\partial F_3(x,y)} {\partial x} - 
a_1 b_1 F_3(x,y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y(1-y) \frac {\partial^2F_3(x,y)} {\partial y^2} + x \frac {\partial^2F_3(x,y)} 
{\partial x \partial y} + [c - (a_2+b_2+1) y] \frac {\partial F_3(x,y)} {\partial y} -

A system partial differential equations for ''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is

==Integral representations==
The four functions defined by Appell's double series can be represented in terms of [[multiple integral|double integral]]s involving [[elementary functions]] only {{harv|Gradshteyn|Ryzhik|2015|loc=§9.184}}. However, {{harvs | txt | authorlink= Charles Émile Picard | first= Émile | last= Picard | year= 1881}} discovered that Appell's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can also be written as a one-dimensional [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]-type [[integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
F_1(a,b_1,b_2,c; x,y) = \frac{\Gamma(c)} {\Gamma(a)\Gamma(c-a)} 
\int_0^1 t^{a-1} (1-t)^{c-a-1} (1-xt)^{-b_1} (1-yt)^{-b_2} \,\mathrm{d}t, 
\quad \real \,c &gt; \real \,a &gt; 0 ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

This representation can be verified by means of [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] of the integrand, followed by termwise integration.

==Special cases==
Picard's integral representation implies that the [[elliptic integral|incomplete elliptic integral]]s ''F'' and ''E'' as well as the [[elliptic integral|complete elliptic integral]] Π are special cases of Appell's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
F(\phi,k) = \int_0^\phi \frac{\mathrm{d} \theta} 
{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta}} = \sin (\phi) \,F_1(\tfrac 1 2, \tfrac 1 2, \tfrac 1 2, \tfrac 3 2; \sin^2 \phi, k^2 \sin^2 \phi), \quad |\real \,\phi| &lt; \frac \pi 2 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
E(\phi, k) = \int_0^\phi \sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta} \,\mathrm{d} \theta = \sin (\phi) \,F_1(\tfrac 1 2, \tfrac 1 2, -\tfrac 1 2, \tfrac 3 2; \sin^2 \phi, k^2 \sin^2 \phi), \quad |\real \,\phi| &lt; \frac \pi 2 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Pi(n,k) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\mathrm{d} \theta} {(1 - n \sin^2 \theta) 
\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta}} = \frac {\pi} {2} \,F_1(\tfrac 1 2, 1, \tfrac 1 2, 1; 
n,k^2) ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

* {{main|Lauricella hypergeometric series}}
:{{harvs | txt | authorlink= Giuseppe Lauricella | first= Giuseppe | last= Lauricella | year= 1893}} defined four functions similar to the Appell series, but depending on many variables rather than just the two variables ''x'' and ''y''. These series were also studied by Appell. They satisfy certain partial differential equations, and can also be given in terms of Euler-type integrals and [[line integral|contour integral]]s.

Originally, the three [[Baltic states]] participated, but the list of invitees has since grown to include all countries around the [[Baltic Sea]]; [[Germany]] sends a team representing only its northernmost parts, and [[Russia]] a team from [[St. Petersburg]]. [[Iceland]] is invited on grounds of being the first state to recognize the newfound independence of the Baltic states. Extra "guest" teams are occasionally invited at the discretion of the organizers: [[Israel]] was invited in 2001, [[Belarus]] in 2004 and 2014, [[Belgium]] in 2005, [[South Africa]] in 2011 and the [[Netherlands]] in 2015. Responsibility for organizing the contest circulates among the regular participants.&lt;ref&gt;Lists of results in first reference below and web sites linked there and in the next two references.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Probability based on prior knowledge}}
[[File:Bayes' Theorem MMB 01.jpg|thumb|A blue [[neon sign]] showing the simple statement of Bayes' theorem]]
{{Bayesian statistics}}

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], '''Bayes' theorem''' (alternatively '''Bayes' law''' or '''Bayes' rule''') describes the [[probability]] of an [[event (probability theory)|event]], based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes' theorem, a person's age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age.

One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is [[Bayesian inference]], a particular approach to [[statistical inference]]. When applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes' theorem may have different [[probability interpretation]]s. With the [[Bayesian probability]] interpretation the theorem expresses how a subjective degree of belief should rationally change to account for availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to [[Bayesian statistics]].

Bayes' theorem is named after Reverend [[Thomas Bayes]] ({{IPAc-en|b|eɪ|z}}; 1701–1761), who first provided an equation that allows new evidence to update beliefs in his ''[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]'' (1763). It was further developed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], who first published the modern formulation in his 1812 "[[Théorie analytique des probabilités]]". [[Harold Jeffreys|Sir Harold Jeffreys]] put Bayes' algorithm and Laplace's formulation on an axiomatic basis. Jeffreys wrote that Bayes' theorem "is to the theory of probability what the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is to geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jeffreys |first=Harold |author-link=Harold Jeffreys |year=1973 |title=Scientific Inference |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-521-18078-8 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of theorem==
[[File:Bayes' Theorem 2D.svg|thumb|Visualization of Bayes' theorem by superposition of two event [[Tree diagram (probability theory)|tree diagrams]].]]
Bayes' theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1= A. | last1= Stuart | first2= K. | last2= Ord | title= Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics: Volume I—Distribution Theory | year= 1994 | publisher= [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]] | at= §8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \, P(A)}{P(B)},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are [[Event (probability theory)|events]] and &lt;math&gt;P(B) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[conditional probability]]: the likelihood of event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; occurring given that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is true.
* &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of event &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; occurring given that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true.
* &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(B)&lt;/math&gt; are the probabilities of observing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; independently of each other; this is known as the [[marginal probability]].

==Examples==

===Drug testing===
[[File:Bayes theorem drugs example tree.svg|thumb|Tree diagram illustrating drug testing example. U, Ū, "+" and "−" are the events representing user, non-user, positive result and negative result. Percentages in parentheses are calculated.]]
Suppose that a test for using a particular drug is 99% [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] and 99% [[Specificity (tests)|specific]]. That is, the test will produce 99% true positive results for drug users and 99% true negative results for non-drug users. Suppose that 0.5% of people are users of the drug. What is the [[probability]] that a randomly selected individual with a positive test is a drug user?

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(\text{User}\mid\text{+}) &amp;= \frac{P(\text{+}\mid\text{User}) P(\text{User})}{P(+)} \\
 &amp;= \frac{P(\text{+}\mid\text{User}) P(\text{User})}{P(\text{+}\mid\text{User}) P(\text{User}) + P(\text{+}\mid\text{Non-user}) P(\text{Non-user})} \\[8pt]
&amp;= \frac{0.99 \times 0.005}{0.99 \times 0.005 + 0.01 \times 0.995} \\[8pt]
&amp;\approx 33.2\%
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Even if an individual tests positive, it is more likely that they do not use the drug than that they do. This is because the number of non-users is large compared to the number of users. The number of false positives outweighs the number of true positives. For example, if 1000 individuals are tested, there are expected to be 995 non-users and 5 users. From the 995 non-users, 0.01&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;995&amp;nbsp;≃&amp;nbsp;10 false positives are expected. From the 5 users, 0.99&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;5 true positives are expected. Out of 15 positive results, only 5 are genuine.

The importance of [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] in this example can be seen by calculating that even if sensitivity is raised to 100% and specificity remains at 99% then the probability of the person being a drug user only rises from 33.2% to 33.4%, but if the sensitivity is held at 99% and the specificity is increased to 99.5% then the probability of the person being a drug user rises to about 49.9%.

===A more complicated example===
The entire output of a factory is produced on three machines. The three machines account for 20%, 30%, and 50% of the factory output. The fraction of defective items produced is 5% for the first machine; 3% for the second machine; and 1% for the third machine. If an item is chosen at random from the total output and is found to be defective, what is the probability that it was produced by the third machine?

Once again, the answer can be reached without recourse to the formula by applying the conditions to any hypothetical number of cases. For example, if 100,000 items are produced by the factory, 20,000 will be produced by Machine A, 30,000 by Machine B, and 50,000 by Machine C. Machine A will produce 1000 defective items, Machine B 900, and Machine C 500. Of the total 2400 defective items, only 500, or 5/24 were produced by Machine C.

A solution is as follows. Let ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the event that a randomly chosen item was made by the ''i'' &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; machine (for ''i''&amp;nbsp;= A,B,C). Let ''Y'' denote the event that a randomly chosen item is defective. Then, we are given the following information:
:''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.2, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''P''(X&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.3, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''P''(X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;= 0.5.
If the item was made by the first machine, then the probability that it is defective is 0.05; that is, ''P''(''Y''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.05. Overall, we have
:''P''(''Y''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.05, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''P''(''Y''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;X&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.03, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''P''(''Y''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.01.
To answer the original question, we first find ''P''(Y). That can be done in the following way:

:''P''(''Y'') = Σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''P''(''Y''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ''P''(''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') = (0.05)(0.2) + (0.03)(0.3) + (0.01)(0.5) = 0.024.

Hence 2.4% of the total output of the factory is defective.

We are given that ''Y'' has occurred, and we want to calculate the conditional
probability of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. By Bayes' theorem,
:''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;Y) = {{sfrac|''P''(''Y''&amp;thinsp;{{!}}&amp;thinsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)|''P''(''Y'')}} = {{sfrac|(0.01)(0.50)|0.024}} = {{sfrac|5|24}}.

Given that the item is defective, the probability that it was made by the third
machine is only 5/24. Although machine C produces half of the total output, it
produces a much smaller fraction of the defective items. Hence the knowledge
that the item selected was defective enables us to replace the prior probability
''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;= 1/2 by the smaller posterior probability ''P''(X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''Y'')&amp;nbsp;= 5/24.

==Interpretations==
[[File:Bayes theorem visualisation.svg|thumb|192px|A geometric visualisation of Bayes' theorem. The figures denote the cells of the table involved in each metric, the probability being the fraction of each figure that is shaded. Similar reasoning shows that
&lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}
P(\bar{A}\mid B)\,=\,\frac{P(B\mid\bar{A})\,P(\bar{A})}{P(B)}
\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and so on.]]
The interpretation of Bayes' theorem depends on the [[Probability interpretations|interpretation of probability]] ascribed to the terms. The two main interpretations are described below.

===Bayesian interpretation===
In the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretation]], probability measures a "degree of belief." Bayes' theorem then links the degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence. For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is twice as likely to land heads than tails. If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief may rise, fall or remain the same depending on the results.

For proposition ''A'' and evidence ''B'',

:* ''P'' (''A'' ), the ''prior'', is the initial degree of belief in ''A''.
:* ''P'' (''A''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''B'' ), the ''posterior'' is the degree of belief having accounted for ''B''.
:* the quotient {{sfrac|''P''(''B''&amp;thinsp;{{!}}''A''&amp;thinsp;)|''P''(''B'')}} represents the support ''B'' provides for ''A''.

For more on the application of Bayes' theorem under the Bayesian interpretation of probability, see [[Bayesian inference]].

===Frequentist interpretation===
[[File:Bayes theorem tree diagrams.svg|thumb|Illustration of frequentist interpretation with [[Tree diagram (probability theory)|tree diagrams]]. Bayes' theorem connects conditional probabilities to their inverses.]]

In the [[Frequentist interpretation of probability|frequentist interpretation]], probability measures a "proportion of outcomes." For example, suppose an experiment is performed many times. ''P''(''A'') is the proportion of outcomes with property ''A'', and ''P''(''B'') that with property ''B''. ''P''(''B''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''A'' ) is the proportion of outcomes with property ''B'' ''out of'' outcomes with property ''A'', and ''P''(''A''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''B'' ) the proportion of those with ''A'' ''out of'' those with&amp;nbsp;''B''.

The role of Bayes' theorem is best visualized with tree diagrams, as shown to the right. The two diagrams partition the same outcomes by ''A'' and ''B'' in opposite orders, to obtain the inverse probabilities. Bayes' theorem serves as the link between these different partitionings.

====Example====
[[File:Bayes theorem simple example tree.svg|thumb|Tree diagram illustrating frequentist example. R, C, P and P bar are the events representing rare, common, pattern and no pattern. Percentages in parentheses are calculated. Note that three independent values are given, so it is possible to calculate the inverse tree (see figure above).]]

An [[Entomology|entomologist]] spots what might be a rare [[subspecies]] of [[beetle]], due to the pattern on its back. In the rare subspecies, 98% have the pattern, or ''P''(Pattern&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;Rare) = 98%. In the common subspecies, 5% have the pattern. The rare subspecies accounts for only 0.1% of the population. How likely is the beetle having the pattern to be rare, or what is ''P''(Rare&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;Pattern)?

From the extended form of Bayes' theorem (since any beetle can be only rare or common),

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P(\text{Rare}\mid \text{Pattern}) &amp;= \frac{P(\text{Pattern}\mid \text{Rare})P(\text{Rare})} {P(\text{Pattern})}
\\[8pt] &amp;= \frac{P(\text{Pattern}\mid \text{Rare})P(\text{Rare})} {P(\text{Pattern}\mid \text{Rare}) P(\text{Rare}) + P(\text{Pattern}\mid \text{Common})P(\text{Common})}
\\[8pt] &amp;= \frac{0.98 \times 0.001} {0.98 \times 0.001 + 0.05 \times 0.999}
\\[8pt] &amp;\approx 1.9\%
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Forms==

===Events===

====Simple form====
For events ''A'' and ''B'', provided that ''P''(''B'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0,

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid  A)\, P(A)}{P(B)}\cdot &lt;/math&gt;

In many applications, for instance in [[Bayesian inference]], the event ''B'' is fixed in the discussion, and we wish to consider the impact of its having been observed on our belief in various possible events ''A''. In such a situation the denominator of the last expression, the probability of the given evidence ''B'', is fixed; what we want to vary is ''A''. Bayes' theorem then shows that the posterior probabilities are [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the numerator:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B) \propto P(A) \cdot P(B\mid A) &lt;/math&gt; (proportionality over ''A'' for given ''B'').

The posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

If events ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e., one of them is certain to occur but no two can occur together, and we know their probabilities up to proportionality, then we can determine the proportionality constant by using the fact that their probabilities must add up to one. For instance, for a given event ''A'', the event ''A'' itself and its complement ¬''A'' are exclusive and exhaustive. Denoting the constant of proportionality by ''c'' we have

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B) = c \cdot P(A) \cdot P(B\mid A) \text{ and } P(\neg A\mid B) = c \cdot P(\neg A) \cdot P(B\mid \neg A). &lt;/math&gt;

Adding these two formulas we deduce that

:&lt;math&gt; 1 = c \cdot (P(B\mid A)\cdot P(A) + P(B\mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)),&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; c = \frac{1}{P(B\mid A)\cdot P(A) + P(B\mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)}  = \frac 1 {P(B)}. &lt;/math&gt;

====Alternative form====
Another form of Bayes' Theorem that is generally encountered when looking at two competing statements or hypotheses is:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A)\,P(A)}{ P(B\mid A) P(A) + P(B\mid \neg A) P(\neg A)}.&lt;/math&gt;

For an epistemological interpretation:

For proposition ''A'' and evidence or background ''B'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayes' Theorem: Introduction|url=http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/bayesweb/|website=Trinity University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[prior probability]], is the initial degree of belief in ''A''.
* &lt;math&gt;P(\neg A)&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding probability of the initial degree of belief against ''A'', where &lt;math&gt;1-P(A) = P(\neg A)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conditional probability]] or likelihood, is the degree of belief in ''B'', given that the proposition ''A'' is true.
* &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid\neg A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conditional probability]] or likelihood, is the degree of belief in ''B'', given that the proposition &lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt; is true.
* &lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[posterior probability]], is the probability for ''A'' after taking into account ''B'' for and against ''A''.

====Extended form====
Often, for some [[partition of a set|partition]] {''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''} of the [[sample space]], the [[Sample space|event space]] is given or conceptualized in terms of ''P''(''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') and ''P''(''B''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''). It is then useful to compute ''P''(''B'') using the [[law of total probability]]:

:&lt;math&gt;P(B) = {\sum_j P(B\mid A_j) P(A_j)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow P(A_i\mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A_i)\,P(A_i)}{\sum\limits_j P(B\mid A_j)\,P(A_j)}\cdot&lt;/math&gt;

In the special case where ''A'' is a [[binary variable]]:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A)\,P(A)}{ P(B\mid A) P(A) + P(B\mid \neg A) P(\neg A)}\cdot&lt;/math&gt;

===Random variables===
[[File:Bayes continuous diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram illustrating the meaning of Bayes' theorem as applied to an event space generated by continuous random variables ''X'' and ''Y''. Note that there exists an instance of Bayes' theorem for each point in the [[Domain of a function|domain]]. In practice, these instances might be parametrized by writing the specified probability densities as a [[Function (Mathematics)|function]] of ''x'' and ''y''.]]
Consider a [[sample space]] Ω generated by two [[random variables]] ''X'' and ''Y''. In principle, Bayes' theorem applies to the events ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''} and ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''}. However, terms become 0 at points where either variable has finite [[probability density function|probability density]]. To remain useful, Bayes' theorem may be formulated in terms of the relevant densities (see [[#Derivation|Derivation]]).

====Simple form====
If ''X'' is continuous and ''Y'' is discrete,

:&lt;math&gt;f_{X\,\mid\,Y=y}(x) = \frac{P(Y=y\mid X=x)\,f_X(x)}{P(Y=y)}&lt;/math&gt;

where each &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a density function.

If ''X'' is discrete and ''Y'' is continuous,

:&lt;math&gt; P(X=x\mid Y=y) = \frac{f_{Y\,\mid\,X=x}(y)\,P(X=x)}{f_Y(y)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If both ''X'' and ''Y'' are continuous,

:&lt;math&gt; f_{X\,\mid\,Y=y}(x) = \frac{f_{Y\,\mid\,X=x}(y)\,f_X(x)}{f_Y(y)}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Extended form====
[[File:Continuous event space specification.svg|thumb|Diagram illustrating how an event space generated by continuous random variables X and Y is often conceptualized.]]

A continuous event space is often conceptualized in terms of the numerator terms. It is then useful to eliminate the denominator using the [[law of total probability]]. For ''f&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''y''), this becomes an integral:

:&lt;math&gt; f_Y(y) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_Y(y\mid X=\xi )\,f_X(\xi)\,d\xi .&lt;/math&gt;

===Bayes' rule===
Bayes' theorem in [[odds|odds form]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;O(A_1:A_2\mid B) = O(A_1:A_2) \cdot \Lambda(A_1:A_2\mid B) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(A_1:A_2\mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A_1)}{P(B\mid A_2)}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[Bayes factor]] or likelihood ratio and the odds between two events is simply the ratio of the probabilities of the two events. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;O(A_1:A_2) = \frac{P(A_1)}{P(A_2)},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;O(A_1:A_2\mid B) = \frac{P(A_1\mid B)}{P(A_2\mid B)},&lt;/math&gt;

So the rule says that the posterior odds are the prior odds times the [[Bayes factor]], or in other words, posterior is proportional to prior times likelihood.

==Derivation==

===For events===
Bayes' theorem may be derived from the definition of [[conditional probability]]:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \text{ if } P(B) \neq 0, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)}, \text{ if } P(A) \neq 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[joint probability]] of both A and B being true, because

:&lt;math&gt;P(B \cap A)=P(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow P(A \cap B) = P(A\mid B)\, P(B) = P(B\mid A)\, P(A) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A)\,P(A)}{P(B)}, \text{ if } P(B) \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===For random variables===
For two continuous [[random variable]]s ''X'' and ''Y'', Bayes' theorem may be analogously derived from the definition of [[conditional density]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f_{X\,\mid\, Y=y} (x) = \frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_Y(y)} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_{Y\,\mid\, X=x}(y) = \frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_X(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore

:&lt;math&gt;f_{X\,\mid\,Y=y}(x) = \frac{f_{Y\,\mid\, X=x}(y)\,f_X(x)}{f_Y(y)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Correspondence to other mathematical frameworks==
===Propositional logic===
''Bayes' theorem'' represents a generalisation of [[contraposition]] which in [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]] can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(\lnot A \to \lnot B) \to (B \to A). &lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding formula in terms of probability calculus is Bayes' theorem which in its expanded form is expressed as: 
:&lt;math&gt;P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A)\,a(A)}{P(B\mid A)\,a(A)+P(B \mid \lnot A)\,a(\lnot A)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the equation above the [[conditional probability]] &lt;math&gt;P(B \mid A)&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the logical statement &lt;math&gt;(A \to B)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. in addition to assigning TRUE or FALSE we can also assign any probability to the statement. The term &lt;math&gt;a(A)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[prior probability]] (aka. the [[base rate]]) of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that &lt;math&gt;P(A \mid B) = 1&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; being TRUE, and that &lt;math&gt;P(A \mid B) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; being FALSE.  It is then easy to see that &lt;math&gt;P(A \mid B) = 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;P(\lnot B\mid \lnot A) = 1&lt;/math&gt; i.e. when &lt;math&gt;(\lnot A \to \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt; is TRUE. This is because &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid \lnot A) = 1 - P(\lnot B \mid \lnot A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; so that the fraction on the right-hand side of the equation above is equal to 1, and hence &lt;math&gt;P(A \mid B) = 1&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to  &lt;math&gt;(B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; being TRUE. Hence, Bayes' theorem represents a generalization of [[contraposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Audun Jøsang, 2016, ''Subjective Logic; A formalism for Reasoning Under Uncertainty.'' Springer, Cham, {{ISBN|978-3-319-42337-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subjective logic===
''Bayes' theorem'' represents a special case of conditional inversion in [[subjective logic]] expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(\omega^S_{A\tilde{|}B},\omega^S_{A\tilde{|}\lnot B}) = (\omega^S_{B\mid A}, \omega^S_{B\mid\lnot A})\,\widetilde{\phi\,}\, a_A,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\widetilde{\phi\,}\,&lt;/math&gt; denotes the operator for conditional inversion. The argument &lt;math&gt;(\omega^S_{B\mid A},\omega^S_{B\mid\lnot A})&lt;/math&gt; denotes a pair of binomial conditional opinions, as expressed by source &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and the argument &lt;math&gt;a_{A}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[prior probability]] (aka. the [[base rate]]) of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The pair of inverted conditional opinions is denoted &lt;math&gt;(\omega^S_{A\tilde{|}B},\omega^{S}_{A\tilde{|}\lnot B})&lt;/math&gt;. The conditional opinion &lt;math&gt;\omega^S_{A\mid B}&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the probabilistic conditional &lt;math&gt;P(A \mid B)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. in addition to assigning a probability the source &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can assign any subjective opinion to the conditional statement &lt;math&gt;(A\mid B)&lt;/math&gt;. A binomial subjective opinion &lt;math&gt;\omega^{S}_{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the belief in the truth of statement &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with degrees of uncertainty, as expressed by source &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Every subjective opinion has a corresponding projected probability &lt;math&gt;P(\omega^{S}_{A})&lt;/math&gt;. The projected probability of opinions applied to Bayes' theorem produces a [[homomorphism]] so that Bayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of the projected probabilities of opinions:

:&lt;math&gt;P(\omega^S_{A \tilde{|} B}) = \frac{P(\omega^S_{B \mid A})\,a(A)}{P(\omega^S_{B\mid A}) \, a(A) + P(\omega^S_{B \mid \lnot A})\,a(\lnot A)}. &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the subjective Bayes' theorem represents a generalization of Bayes' theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Audun Jøsang, 2016, ''Generalising Bayes' Theorem in Subjective Logic.'' IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI 2016), Baden-Baden, September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bayes' theorem was named after [[Thomas Bayes]] (1701–1761), who studied how to compute a distribution for the probability parameter of a [[binomial distribution]] (in modern terminology). Bayes' unpublished manuscript was significantly edited by [[Richard Price]] before it was posthumously read at the [[Royal Society]].

The French [[mathematician]] [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reproduced and extended Bayes' results in 1774, apparently unaware of Bayes' work.&lt;ref&gt;Laplace refined Bayes' theorem over a period of decades:
* Laplace announced his independent discovery of Bayes' theorem in: Laplace (1774) "Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements," "Mémoires de l'Académie royale des Sciences de MI (Savants étrangers)," '''4''': 621–656.

Bayes' theorem appears on p. 29.
* Laplace presented a refinement of Bayes' theorem in: Laplace (read: 1783 / published: 1785) "Mémoire sur les approximations des formules qui sont fonctions de très grands nombres," "Mémoires de l'Académie royale des Sciences de Paris," 423–467.

Available on-line at: [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k775981/f218.image.langEN Gallica]. Bayes' theorem is stated on page 301.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19415">In [[coding theory]], '''block codes''' are a large and important family of [[Channel coding|error-correcting codes]] that encode data in blocks.
There is a vast number of examples for block codes, many of which have a wide range of practical applications. The abstract definition of block codes is conceptually useful because it allows coding theorists, [[mathematics|mathematicians]], and [[computer science|computer scientists]] to study the limitations of ''all'' block codes in a unified way.
Such limitations often take the form of ''bounds'' that relate different parameters of the block code to each other, such as its rate and its ability to detect and correct errors.

Examples of block codes are [[Reed–Solomon code]]s, [[Hamming code]]s, [[Hadamard code]]s, [[Expander code]]s, [[Golay code (disambiguation)|Golay code]]s, and [[Reed–Muller code]]s. These examples also belong to the class of [[linear code]]s, and hence they are called '''linear block codes'''.  More particularly, these codes are known as algebraic block codes, or cyclic block codes, because they can be generated using boolean polynomials.

Algebraic block codes are typically [[Soft-decision decoder|hard-decoded]] using algebraic decoders.{{Technical statement|date=May 2015}}

The term ''block code'' may also refer to any error-correcting code that acts on a block of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; bits of input data to produce &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bits of output data &lt;math&gt;(n,k)&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, the block coder is a ''memoryless'' device. Under this definition codes such as [[turbo code]]s, terminated convolutional codes and other iteratively decodable codes (turbo-like codes) would also be considered block codes. A non-terminated convolutional encoder would be an example of a non-block (unframed) code, which has ''memory'' and is instead classified as a ''tree code''.

This article deals with "algebraic block codes".

== The block code and its parameters ==

[[Error-correcting code]]s are used to [[reliability (computer networking)|reliably]] transmit [[digital data]] over unreliable [[communication channel]]s subject to [[channel noise]].
When a sender wants to transmit a possibly very long data stream using a block code, the sender breaks the stream up into pieces of some fixed size. Each such piece is called ''message'' and the procedure given by the block code encodes each message individually into a codeword, also called a ''block'' in the context of block codes. The sender then transmits all blocks to the receiver, who can in turn use some decoding mechanism to (hopefully) recover the original messages from the possibly corrupted received blocks.
The performance and success of the overall transmission depends on the parameters of the channel and the block code.

Formally, a block code is an [[injective]] mapping
:&lt;math&gt;C:\Sigma^k \to \Sigma^n&lt;/math&gt;.
Here, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite and nonempty [[set (mathematics)|set]] and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are integers. The meaning and significance of these three parameters and other parameters related to the code are described below.

=== The alphabet Σ ===
The data stream to be encoded is modeled as a [[string (computer science)|string]] over some '''alphabet''' &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The size &lt;math&gt;|\Sigma|&lt;/math&gt; of the alphabet is often written as &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;q=2&lt;/math&gt;, then the block code is called a ''binary'' block code. In many applications it is useful to consider &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; to be a [[prime power]], and to identify &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; with the [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_q&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The message length ''k'' ===
Messages are elements &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^k&lt;/math&gt;, that is, strings of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence the number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''message length''' or '''dimension''' of a block code.

=== The block length ''n'' ===
The '''block length''' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of a block code is the number of symbols in a block. Hence, the elements &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^n&lt;/math&gt; are strings of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and correspond to blocks that may be received by the receiver. Hence they are also called received words.
If &lt;math&gt;c=C(m)&lt;/math&gt; for some message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is called the codeword of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The rate ''R'' ===
The '''rate''' of a block code is defined as the ratio between its message length and its block length:
:&lt;math&gt;R=k/n&lt;/math&gt;.
A large rate means that the amount of actual message per transmitted block is high. In this sense, the rate measures the transmission speed and the quantity &lt;math&gt;1-R&lt;/math&gt; measures the overhead that occurs due to the encoding with the block code.
It is a simple [[information theory|information theoretical]] fact that the rate cannot exceed &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; since data cannot in general be losslessly compressed. Formally, this follows from the fact that the code &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is an injective map.

=== {{anchor|Minimum distance}}The distance ''d'' ===
The '''distance''' or '''minimum distance''' {{mvar|d}} of a block code is the minimum number of positions in which any two distinct codewords differ, and the '''relative distance''' &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction &lt;math&gt;d/n&lt;/math&gt;.
Formally, for received words &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2\in\Sigma^n&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\Delta(c_1,c_2)&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Hamming distance]] between &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the number of positions in which &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; differ.
Then the minimum distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of the code &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;d := \min_{m_1,m_2\in\Sigma^k\atop m_1\neq m_2} \Delta[C(m_1),C(m_2)]&lt;/math&gt;.
Since any code has to be [[injective]], any two codewords will disagree in at least one position, so the distance of any code is at least &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Besides, the '''distance''' equals the '''[[minimum weight]]''' for linear block codes because:
:&lt;math&gt;\min_{m_1,m_2\in\Sigma^k\atop m_1\neq m_2} \Delta[C(m_1),C(m_2)] = \min_{m_1,m_2\in\Sigma^k\atop m_1\neq m_2} \Delta[\mathbf{0},C(m_1)+C(m_2)] = \min_{m\in\Sigma^k\atop m\neq\mathbf{0}} w[C(m)] = w_\min&lt;/math&gt;.

A larger distance allows for more error correction and detection.
For example, if we only consider errors that may change symbols of the sent codeword but never erase or add them, then the number of errors is the number of positions in which the sent codeword and the received word differ.
A code with distance {{mvar|d}} allows the receiver to detect up to &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; transmission errors since changing &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; positions of a codeword can never accidentally yield another codeword. Furthermore, if no more than &lt;math&gt;(d-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; transmission errors occur, the receiver can uniquely decode the received word to a codeword. This is because every received word has at most one codeword at distance &lt;math&gt;(d-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;. If more than &lt;math&gt;(d-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; transmission errors occur, the receiver cannot uniquely decode the received word in general as there might be several possible codewords. One way for the receiver to cope with this situation is to use [[list decoding]], in which the decoder outputs a list of all codewords in a certain radius.

=== Popular notation ===
The notation &lt;math&gt;(n,k,d)_q&lt;/math&gt; describes a block code over an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, with a block length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, message length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.
If the block code is a linear block code, then the square brackets in the notation &lt;math&gt;[n,k,d]_q&lt;/math&gt; are used to represent that fact.
For binary codes with &lt;math&gt;q=2&lt;/math&gt;, the index is sometimes dropped.
For [[maximum distance separable code]]s, the distance is always &lt;math&gt;d=n-k+1&lt;/math&gt;, but sometimes the precise distance is not known, non-trivial to prove or state, or not needed. In such cases, the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-component may be missing.

Sometimes, especially for non-block codes, the notation &lt;math&gt;(n,M,d)_q&lt;/math&gt; is used for codes that contain &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; codewords of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For block codes with messages of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; over an alphabet of size &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, this number would be &lt;math&gt;M=q^k&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==

As mentioned above, there are a vast number of error-correcting codes that are actually block codes.
The first error-correcting code was the [[Hamming(7,4)]] code, developed by [[Richard W. Hamming]] in 1950. This code transforms a message consisting of 4 bits into a codeword of 7 bits by adding 3 parity bits. Hence this code is a block code. It turns out that it is also a linear code and that it has distance 3. In the shorthand notation above, this means that the Hamming(7,4) code is a &lt;math&gt;[7,4,3]_2&lt;/math&gt; code.

[[Reed–Solomon code]]s are a family of &lt;math&gt;[n,k,d]_q&lt;/math&gt; codes with &lt;math&gt;d=n-k+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; being a [[prime power]]. [[Rank error-correcting code|Rank codes]] are family of &lt;math&gt;[n,k,d]_q&lt;/math&gt; codes with &lt;math&gt;d \leq n-k+1&lt;/math&gt;. [[Hadamard code]]s are a family of &lt;math&gt;[n,k,d]_2&lt;/math&gt; codes with &lt;math&gt;n=2^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d=2^{k-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Error detection and correction properties ==

A codeword &lt;math&gt;c \in \Sigma^n&lt;/math&gt;could be considered as a point in the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimension space &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^n&lt;/math&gt; and the code &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^n&lt;/math&gt;. A code &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; has distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;\forall c\in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, there is no other codeword in the ''Hamming ball'' centered at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; with radius &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as the collection of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimension words whose ''[[Hamming distance]]'' to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is no more than &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; with (minimum) distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; has the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can detect &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; errors : Because a codeword &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the only codeword in the Hamming ball centered at itself with radius &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt;, no error pattern of &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; or fewer errors could change one codeword to another. When the receiver detects that the received vector is not a codeword of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the errors are detected (but no guarantee to correct).
* &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can correct &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\left\lfloor {{d-1} \over 2}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; errors. Because a codeword &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the only codeword in the Hamming ball centered at itself with radius &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt;, the two Hamming balls centered at two different codewords respectively with both radius &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\left \lfloor {{d-1} \over 2}\right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; do not overlap with each other. Therefore, if we consider the error correction as finding the codeword closest to the received word &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, as long as the number of errors is no more than &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\left \lfloor {{d-1} \over 2}\right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, there is only one codeword in the hamming ball centered at &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with radius &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\left \lfloor {{d-1} \over 2}\right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, therefore all errors could be corrected.
* In order to decode in the presence of more than &lt;math&gt;(d-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; errors, [[list-decoding]] or [[Decoding methods#Maximum likelihood decoding|maximum likelihood decoding]] can be used.
* &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can correct &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; [[Binary erasure channel|erasures]]. By ''erasure'' it means that the position of the erased symbol is known. Correcting could be achieved by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-passing decoding : In &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; passing the erased position is filled with the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; symbol and error correcting is carried out. There must be one passing that the number of errors is no more than &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\left \lfloor {{d-1} \over 2}\right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the erasures could be corrected.

== Lower and upper bounds of block codes ==

[[File:Linear Binary Block Codes and their needed Check Symbols.png|thumb|720px|
There are theoretical limits (such as the Hamming limit), but another question is which codes can actually constructed. It is like [[Sphere packing|packing spheres in a box]] in many dimensions. This diagram shows the constructible codes, which are linear and binary. The ''x'' axis shows the number of protected symbols ''k'', the ''y'' axis the number of needed check symbols ''n–k''. Plotted are the limits for different Hamming distances from 1 (unprotected) to 34.
Marked with dots are perfect codes:

=== Family of codes ===

&lt;math&gt;C =\{C_i\}_{i\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; is called '' family of codes'', where &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;(n_i,k_i,d_i)_q&lt;/math&gt; code with monotonic increasing &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Rate''' of family of codes {{mvar|C}} is defined as &lt;math&gt;R(C)=\lim_{i\to\infty}{k_i \over n_i}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Relative distance''' of family of codes {{mvar|C}} is defined as &lt;math&gt;\delta(C)=\lim_{i\to\infty}{d_i \over n_i}&lt;/math&gt;

To explore the relationship between &lt;math&gt;R(C)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta(C)&lt;/math&gt;, a set of lower and upper bounds of block codes are known.

=== Hamming bound ===
{{main article|Hamming bound}}
: &lt;math&gt; R \le 1- {1 \over n} \cdot \log_{q} \cdot \left[\sum_{i=0}^{\left\lfloor {{\delta \cdot n-1}\over 2}\right\rfloor}\binom{n}{i}(q-1)^i\right]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Singleton bound ===
{{main article|Singleton bound}}
The Singleton bound is that the sum of the rate and the relative distance of a block code cannot be much larger than 1:
:&lt;math&gt; R + \delta \le  1+\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, every block code satisfies the inequality &lt;math&gt;k+d \le n+1 &lt;/math&gt;.
[[Reed–Solomon code]]s are non-trivial examples of codes that satisfy the singleton bound with equality.

=== Plotkin bound ===
{{main article|Plotkin bound}}
For &lt;math&gt;q=2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R+2\delta\le1&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;k + 2d \le n&lt;/math&gt;.

For the general case, the following Plotkin bounds holds for any &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^{n} &lt;/math&gt; with distance {{mvar|d}}:

# If &lt;math&gt;d=\left(1-{1 \over q}\right)n, |C| \le 2qn &lt;/math&gt;
# If &lt;math&gt;d &gt; \left(1-{1 \over q}\right)n, |C| \le {qd \over {qd -\left(q-1\right)n}} &lt;/math&gt;

For any {{mvar|q}}-ary code with distance &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R \le 1- \left({q \over {q-1}}\right) \delta + o\left(1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Gilbert–Varshamov bound ===
{{main article|Gilbert–Varshamov bound}}
&lt;math&gt;R\ge1-H_q\left(\delta\right)-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;0 \le \delta \le 1-{1\over q}, 0\le \epsilon \le 1- H_q\left(\delta\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; H_q\left(x\right) ~\overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}~ -x\cdot\log_q{x \over {q-1}}-\left(1-x\right)\cdot\log_q{\left(1-x\right)} &lt;/math&gt; is the {{mvar|q}}-ary entropy function.

=== Johnson bound ===
{{main article|Johnson bound}}
Define &lt;math&gt;J_q\left(\delta\right) ~\overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}~ \left(1-{1\over q}\right)\left(1-\sqrt{1-{q \delta \over{q-1}}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;J_q\left(n, d, e\right)&lt;/math&gt; be the maximum number of codewords in a Hamming ball of radius {{mvar|e}} for any code &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n&lt;/math&gt; of distance {{mvar|d}}.

Then we have the ''Johnson Bound'' : &lt;math&gt;J_q\left(n,d,e\right)\le qnd&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;{e \over n} \le {{q-1}\over q}\left( {1-\sqrt{1-{q \over{q-1}}\cdot{d \over n}}}\, \right)=J_q\left({d \over n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Elias–Bassalygo bound ===
{{main article|Elias Bassalygo bound}}
: &lt;math&gt;R={\log_q{|C|} \over n} \le 1-H_q\left(J_q\left(\delta\right)\right)+o\left(1\right) &lt;/math&gt;

== Sphere packings and lattices ==

Block codes are tied to the [[sphere packing problem]] which has received some attention over the years. In two dimensions, it is easy to visualize. Take a bunch of pennies flat on the table and push them together. The result is a hexagon pattern like a bee's nest. But block codes rely on more dimensions which cannot easily be visualized. The powerful [[Binary Golay code|Golay code]] used in deep space communications uses 24 dimensions. If used as a binary code (which it usually is), the dimensions refer to the length of the codeword as defined above.

The theory of coding uses the ''N''-dimensional sphere model. For example, how many pennies can be packed into a circle on a tabletop or in 3 dimensions, how many marbles can be packed into a globe. Other considerations enter the choice of a code. For example, hexagon packing into the constraint of a rectangular box will leave empty space at the corners. As the dimensions get larger, the percentage of empty space grows smaller. But at certain dimensions, the packing uses all the space and these codes are the so-called perfect codes. There are very few of these codes.

Another property is the number of neighbors a single codeword may have.&lt;ref name=schlegel&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Trellis and turbo coding
 | author = Christian Schlegel and Lance Pérez
 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE
 | year = 2004

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Again, consider pennies as an example. First we pack the pennies in a rectangular grid. Each penny will have 4 near neighbors (and 4 at the corners which are farther away). In a hexagon, each penny will have 6 near neighbors. Respectively, in three and four dimensions, the maximum packing is given by the [[12-face]] and [[24-cell]] with 12 and 24 neighbors, respectively. When we increase the dimensions, the number of near neighbors increases very rapidly. In general, the value is given by the [[kissing number]]s.

The result is that the number of ways for noise to make the receiver choose
a neighbor (hence an error) grows as well. This is a fundamental limitation
of block codes, and indeed all codes. It may be harder to cause an error to
a single neighbor, but the number of neighbors can be large enough so the
total error probability actually suffers.&lt;ref name=schlegel/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3614">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]], '''block walking''' is a method useful in thinking about sums of combinations graphically as "walks" on [[Pascal's triangle]]. As the name suggests, block walking problems involve counting the number of ways an individual can walk from one corner A of a city block to another corner B of another city block given restrictions on the number of blocks the person may walk, the directions the person may travel, the distance from A to B, et cetera.

==An example block walking problem==

Suppose such an individual, say "Fred", must walk exactly ''k'' blocks to get to a point B that is exactly ''k'' blocks from A. It is convenient to regard Fred's starting point A as the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, of a [[lattice (group)|rectangular array]] of [[lattice points]] and B as some lattice point &lt;math&gt;(e,n)&lt;/math&gt;, e units "East" and ''n'' units "North" of A, where &lt;math&gt;e+n=k&lt;/math&gt; and both &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative.

===Solution by brute force===
A [[brute force (mathematics)|"brute force"]] solution to this problem may be obtained by systematically counting the number of ways Fred can reach each point &lt;math&gt;X=(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;0 \le x_1 \le e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \le x_{2} \le n&lt;/math&gt;

without backtracking (i.e. only traveling North or East from one point to another) until a pattern is observed. For example, the number of ways Fred could go from &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; or (0,1) is exactly one;  to (1,1) is two; to (2,0) or (0,2) is one; to (1,2) or (2,1) is three; and so on. Actually, you could receive the number of ways to get to a particular point by adding up the number of ways you can get to the point south of it and the number of ways you can get to the point west of it.(With the starting point being zero and all the points directly north and south of it one.) In general, one soon discovers that the number of paths from A to any such X corresponds to an entry of [[Pascal's Triangle]].

===Combinatorial solution===
Since the problem involves counting a finite, discrete number of paths between lattice points, it is reasonable to assume a [[Combinatorial proof|combinatorial solution]] exists to the problem. Towards this end, we note that for Fred to still be on a path that will take him from A to B over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; blocks, at any point X he must either travel along one of the unit vectors &lt;1,0&gt; and &lt;0,1&gt;. For the sake of clarity, let &lt;math&gt;E=\langle 1,0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N=\langle 0,1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Given the coordinates of B, regardless of the path Fred travels he must walk along the vectors E and N exactly &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times, respectively. As such, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct rearrangements of the word
:&lt;math&gt; \overbrace{ EE \cdots E }^{e\text{ times}}\underbrace{ NN \cdots N }_{n \text{ times}}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; indistinct objects from a group of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the total number of paths Fred could take from A to B traveling only &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; blocks is
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{k}{e}=\binom{k}{n}=\frac{k!}{e! n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other problems with known block walking combinatorial proofs==
* Proving that
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n { n \choose k}^2\ = { 2n \choose n} &lt;/math&gt;
: can be done with a straightforward application of block walking.&lt;ref&gt;Lehoczky, Sandor and Richard Rusczyk. ''The Art of Problem Solving, Volume II''. Page 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7255">In the mathematical field of [[convex geometry]], the '''Busemann–Petty problem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Herbert|last=Busemann|authorlink=Herbert Busemann|first2=Clinton Myers|last2=Petty|author2-link=Clinton Myers Petty |year=1956|loc=problem 1}}, asks whether it is true that a symmetric [[convex body]] with larger central hyperplane sections has larger volume. More precisely, if ''K'', ''T'' are symmetric convex bodies in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Vol}_{n-1} \, (K \cap A) \leq \mathrm{Vol}_{n-1} \, (T \cap A) &lt;/math&gt;

for every hyperplane ''A'' passing through the origin, is it true that Vol&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''K''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;Vol&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''T''?

Busemann and Petty showed that the answer is positive if ''K'' is a ball. In general, the answer is positive in dimensions at most 4, and negative in dimensions at least&amp;nbsp;5.

==History==

{{harvs|txt|last=Larman|author2-link=Claude Ambrose Rogers|first2=Claude Ambrose |last2=Rogers|year=1975}} showed that the Busemann–Petty  problem has a negative solution in dimensions at least 12, and this bound was reduced to dimensions at least 5 by several other authors. {{harvtxt|Ball|1988}} pointed out a particularly simple counterexample: all sections of the unit volume cube have measure at most {{radic|2}}, while in dimensions at least 10 all central sections of the unit volume ball have measure at least {{radic|2}}. {{harvtxt|Lutwak|1988}} introduced [[intersection body|intersection bodies]], and showed that  the Busemann–Petty problem has a positive solution in a given dimension if and only if every symmetric convex body is an intersection body. An intersection body is a star body whose radial function in a given direction ''u'' is the volume of the hyperplane section ''u''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''K'' for some fixed star body ''K''. 
{{harvtxt|Gardner|1994}} used Lutwak's result to show that the Busemann–Petty problem has a positive solution if the dimension is 3. {{harvtxt|Zhang|1994}} claimed incorrectly that the unit cube in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is not an intersection body, which would have implied that the  Busemann–Petty problem has a negative solution if the dimension is at least 4. However {{harvtxt|Koldobsky|1998a}}  showed that a centrally symmetric star-shaped body is an intersection body if and only if the function 1/||''x''|| is a positive definite distribution, where ||x|| is the homogeneous function of degree 1 that is 1 on the boundary of the body, and {{harvtxt|Koldobsky|1998b}} used this to show that the unit balls l{{su|b=''n''|p=''p''}}, 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞ in ''n''-dimensional space with the [[Lp norm|l&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm]] are intersection bodies for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 but are not intersection bodies for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5, showing that Zhang's result was incorrect. {{harvtxt|Zhang|1999}} then showed that the  Busemann–Petty problem has a positive solution in dimension 4.
{{harvs|txt | last1=Gardner | first1=Richard J. | last2=Koldobsky | first2=A. | last3=Schlumprecht | first3=T. | title=An analytic solution to the Busemann-Petty problem on sections of convex bodies | doi=10.2307/120978 | mr=1689343  | year=1999 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=149 | issue=2 | pages=691–703}} gave a uniform solution for all dimensions.

In [[computational mathematics]], '''computer algebra''', also called '''symbolic computation''' or '''algebraic computation''', is a scientific area that refers to the study and development of [[algorithm]]s and [[software]] for manipulating [[expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]] and other [[mathematical object]]s. Although computer algebra could be considered a subfield of [[scientific computing]], they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on [[numerical computation]] with approximate [[floating point number]]s, while symbolic computation emphasizes ''exact'' computation with expressions containing [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s that have no given value and are manipulated as symbols.

[[Software]] applications that perform symbolic calculations are called ''[[computer algebra system]]s'', with the term ''system'' alluding to the complexity of the main applications  that include, at least, a method to represent mathematical data in a computer, a user programming language (usually different from the language used for the implementation), a dedicated memory manager, a [[user interface]] for the input/output of mathematical expressions, a large set of [[function (computer science)|routines]] to perform usual operations, like simplification of expressions, [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] using [[chain rule]], [[polynomial factorization]], [[indefinite integration]], etc.

Computer algebra is widely used to experiment in mathematics and to design the formulas that are used in numerical programs. It is also used for complete scientific computations, when purely numerical methods fail, as in [[public key cryptography]], or for some [[non-linear]] problems.

== Terminology ==

Some authors distinguish ''computer algebra'' from ''symbolic computation'' using the latter name to refer to kinds of symbolic computation other than the computation with mathematical [[formula]]s. Some authors use ''symbolic computation'' for the computer science aspect of the subject and "computer algebra" for the mathematical aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Stephen M. | last = Watt | date = 2006 | url = http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~watt/pub/reprints/2006-tc-sympoly.pdf | title = Making Computer Algebra More Symbolic (Invited) | conference = Proc. Transgressive Computing 2006: A conference in honor or Jean Della Dora, (TC 2006) | pages = 43–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages the name of the field is not a direct translation of its English name. Typically, it is called ''calcul formel'' in French, which means "formal computation". This name reflects the ties this field has with [[formal methods]].

Symbolic computation has also been referred to, in the past, as ''symbolic manipulation'', ''algebraic manipulation'', ''symbolic processing'', ''symbolic mathematics'', or ''symbolic algebra'', but these terms, which also refer to non-computational manipulation, are no longer used in reference to computer algebra.

== Scientific community ==
There is no [[learned society]] that is specific to computer algebra, but this function is assumed by the [[special interest group]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] named [[SIGSAM]] (Special Interest Group
on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigsam.org SIGSAM official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several annual conferences on computer algebra, the premier being [[ISSAC]] (International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation), which is regularly sponsored by SIGSAM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigsam.org/conferences/index.phtml SIGSAM list of conferences]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several journals specializing in computer algebra, the top one being [[Journal of Symbolic Computation]] founded in 1985 by [[Bruno Buchberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation: Mathematical Methods |last=Cohen |first=Joel S. | date = 2003 |publisher=AK Peters, Ltd. |location= |isbn=978-1-56881-159-8 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several other journals that regularly publish articles in computer algebra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigsam.org/journals.phtml SIGSAM list of journals]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data representation ===

As [[numerical software]] is highly efficient for approximate [[numerical computation]], it is common, in computer algebra, to emphasize ''exact'' computation with exactly represented data. Such an exact representation implies that, even when the size of the output is small, the intermediate data generated during a computation may grow in an unpredictable way. This behavior is called ''expression swell''. To obviate this problem, various methods are used in the representation of the data, as well as in the algorithms that manipulate them.

==== Numbers ====
The usual numbers systems used in [[numerical computation]] are [[floating point]] numbers and [[integers]] of a fixed bounded size. None of these is convenient for computer algebra, due to expression swell.

Therefore, the basic numbers used in computer algebra are the integers of the mathematicians, commonly represented by an unbounded signed sequence of [[numerical digit|digits]] in some [[radix|base of numeration]], usually the largest base allowed by the [[machine word]]. These integers allow to define the [[rational number]]s, which are [[irreducible fraction]]s of two integers.

Programming an efficient implementation of the arithmetic operations is a hard task. Therefore, most free [[computer algebra system]]s and some commercial ones, like [[Maple (software)]], use the [[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library|GMP library]], which is thus a ''de facto'' standard.

==== Expressions ====

Except for [[number]]s and [[variable (mathematics)|variables]], every [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expression]] may be viewed as the symbol of an operator followed by a [[sequence]] of operands. In computer algebra software, the expressions are usually represented in this way. This representation is very flexible, and many things, that seem not to be mathematical expressions at first glance, may be represented and manipulated as such. For example, an equation is an expression with “=” as an operator, a matrix may be represented as an expression with “matrix” as an operator and its rows as operands.

Even programs may be considered and represented as expressions with operator “procedure” and, at least, two operands, the list of parameters and the body, which is itself an expression with “body” as an operator and a sequence of instructions as operands. Conversely, any mathematical expression may be viewed as a program. For example, the expression {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} may be viewed as a program for the addition, with {{mvar|''a''}} and {{mvar|''b''}} as parameters. Executing this program consists in ''evaluating'' the expression for given values of {{mvar|''a''}} and {{mvar|''b''}}; if they do not have any value—that is they are indeterminates—, the result of the evaluation is simply its input.

This process of delayed evaluation is fundamental in computer algebra. For example, the operator “=” of the equations is also, in most computer algebra systems, the name of the program of the equality test: normally, the evaluation of an equation results in an equation, but, when an equality test is needed,—either explicitly asked by the user through an “evaluation to a Boolean” command, or automatically started by the system in the case of a test inside a program—then the evaluation to a boolean 0 or 1 is executed.

As the size of the operands of an expression is unpredictable and may change during a working session, the sequence of the operands is usually represented as a sequence of either [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] (like in [[Macsyma]]) or entries in a [[hash table]] (like in [[Maple (software)|Maple]]).

=== Simplification ===

The raw application of the basic rules of [[derivative|differentiation]] with respect to {{math|''x''}} on the expression &lt;math&gt;a^x&lt;/math&gt; gives the result 
:&lt;math&gt; x\cdot a^{x-1}\cdot 0 + a^x\cdot \left (1\cdot \log a + x\cdot \frac{0}{a} \right).&lt;/math&gt; 
Such a complicated expression is clearly not acceptable, and a procedure of simplification is needed as soon as one works with general expressions.

This simplification is normally done through [[rewriting|rewriting rules]]. There are several classes of rewriting rules that have to be considered. The simplest consists in the rewriting rules that always reduce the size of the expression, like {{math|''E'' &amp;minus; ''E'' → 0}} or {{math|sin(0) → 0}}. They are systematically applied in the computer algebra systems.

The first difficulty occurs with [[associative operation]]s like addition and multiplication. The standard way to deal with associativity is to consider that addition and multiplication have an arbitrary number of operands, that is that {{math|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''}} is represented as {{math|"+"(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}}. Thus {{math|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'')}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}} are both simplified to {{math|"+"(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}}, which is displayed {{math|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''}}. What about {{math|''a'' &amp;minus; ''b'' + ''c''}}? To deal with this problem, the simplest way is to rewrite systematically {{math|&amp;minus;''E''}}, {{math|''E'' &amp;minus; ''F''}}, {{math|''E''/''F''}} as, respectively, {{math|(&amp;minus;1)⋅''E''}}, {{math|''E'' + (&amp;minus;1)⋅''F''}}, {{math|''E''⋅''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In other words, in the internal representation of the expressions, there is no subtraction nor division nor unary minus, outside the representation of the numbers.

A second difficulty occurs with the [[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication. The problem is to recognize quickly the [[like terms]] in order to combine or canceling them. In fact, the method for finding like terms, consisting of testing every pair of terms, is too costly for being practicable with very long sums and products. For solving this problem, [[Macsyma]] sorts the operands of sums and products with a function of comparison that is designed in order that like terms are in consecutive places, and thus easily detected. In [[Maple (software)|Maple]], the [[hash function]] is designed for generating collisions when like terms are entered, allowing to combine them as soon as they are introduced. This design of the hash function allows also to recognize immediately the expressions or subexpressions that appear several times in a computation and to store them only once. This allows not only to save some memory space, but also to speed up computation, by avoiding repetition of the same operations on several identical expressions.

Some rewriting rules sometimes increase and sometimes decrease the size of the expressions to which they are applied. This is the case of [[distributivity]] or [[Trigonometric identity#Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities|trigonometric identities]]. For example, the distributivity law allows rewriting &lt;math&gt;(x+1)^4 \rightarrow x^4+4x^3+6x^2+4x+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1) \rightarrow x^5-1.&lt;/math&gt; As there is no way to make a good general choice of applying or not such a rewriting rule, such rewritings are done only when explicitly asked for by the user. For the distributivity, the computer function that apply this rewriting rule is generally called "expand". The reverse rewriting rule, called "factor", requires a non-trivial algorithm, which is thus a key function in computer algebra systems (see [[Polynomial factorization]]).

== Mathematical aspects ==

In this section we consider some fundamental mathematical questions that arise as soon as one wants to manipulate [[expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]] in a computer. We consider mainly the case of the [[Multivariate polynomial|multivariate]] [[rational fraction]]s. This is not a real restriction, because, as soon as the [[irrational function]]s appearing in an expression are simplified, they are usually considered as new indeterminates. For example, 
:&lt;math&gt;(\sin(x+y)^2+ \log(z^2-5))^3&lt;/math&gt; 
is viewed as a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;\sin(x+y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log(z^2-5)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Equality ===
There are two notions of equality for [[expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]]. The ''syntactic equality'' is the equality of the expressions which means that they are written (or represented in a computer) in the same way. Being trivial, the syntactic equality is rarely considered by mathematicians, although it is the only equality that is easy to test with a program. The ''semantic equality'' is when two expressions represent the same mathematical object, like in
:&lt;math&gt; (x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2.&lt;/math&gt;

It is known from [[Richardson's theorem]] that there may not exist an algorithm that decides if two expressions representing numbers are semantically equal, if exponentials and logarithms are allowed in the expressions. Therefore, (semantical) equality may be tested only on some classes of expressions such as the [[polynomial]]s and [[rational fraction]]s.

To test the equality of two expressions, instead of designing specific algorithms, it is usual to put expressions in some ''[[canonical form]]'' or to put their difference in a ''normal form'', and to test the syntactic equality of the result.

Unlike in usual mathematics, "canonical form" and "normal form" are not synonymous in computer algebra.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, J. H., Siret, Y., &amp; Tournier, É. (1988). Computer algebra. London: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''canonical form'' is such that two expressions in canonical form are semantically equal if and only if they are syntactically equal, while a ''normal form'' is such that an expression in normal form is semantically zero only if it is syntactically zero. In other words, zero has a unique representation by expressions in normal form.

Normal forms are usually preferred in computer algebra for several reasons. Firstly, canonical forms may be more costly to compute than normal forms. For example, to put a polynomial in canonical form, one has to expand by [[distributivity]] every product, while it is not necessary with a normal form (see below). Secondly, It may be the case, like for expressions involving radicals, that a canonical form, if it exists, depends on some arbitrary choices and that these choices may be different for two expressions that have been computed independently. This may make impracticable the use of a canonical form.

==History==
At the beginning of computer algebra, circa 1970, when the long-known [[algorithm]]s were first put on computers, they turned out to be highly inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Erich|last1=Kaltofen|chapter=Factorization of polynomials|title=Computer Algebra|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1982|editor1-first =B. |editor1-last =Buchberger|editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Loos|editor3-first=G. |editor3-last=Collins|citeseerx = 10.1.1.39.7916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a large part of the work of the researchers in the field consisted in revisiting classical [[algebra]] in order to make it [[Computable function|effective]] and to discover [[algorithmic efficiency|efficient algorithms]] to implement this effectiveness. A typical example of this kind of work is the computation of [[polynomial greatest common divisor]]s, which is required to simplify fractions. Surprisingly, the classical [[Euclid's algorithm]] turned out to be inefficient for polynomials over infinite fields, and thus new algorithms needed to be developed. The same was also true for the classical algorithms from [[linear algebra]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''conchospiral''' is a three-dimensional [[spiral]]. In [[cylindrical coordinates]], it is described by the parametric equations:
:&lt;math&gt;r=\mu^t a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\theta=t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z=\mu^t c.&lt;/math&gt;
The projection of a conchospiral on the (''r'', θ)-plane is a [[logarithmic spiral]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''covering set''' for a [[sequence]] of [[integer]]s refers to a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[prime number]]s such that ''every'' term in the sequence is [[division (mathematics)|divisible]] by ''at least one'' member of the set.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, Richard; ''Unsolved Problems in Number Theory''; pp. 119–121. {{ISBN|0387208607}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "covering set" is used only in conjunction with sequences possessing [[exponential growth]].

==Sierpinski and Riesel numbers==
The use of the term "covering set" is related to [[Sierpinski number|Sierpinski]] and [[Riesel number]]s. These are [[Even and odd numbers|odd]] [[natural number]]s {{mvar|k}} for which the formula {{math|{{mvar|k}} 2&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} (Sierpinski number) or {{math|{{mvar|k}} 2&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} (Riesel number) produces no prime numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, David; ''Prime Numbers: The Most Mysterious Figures in Math''; pp. 212, 219. {{ISBN|1118045718}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1960 it has been known that there exists an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of both Sierpinski and Riesel numbers (as solutions to families of [[congruence relation|congruences]] based upon the set {{math|{3, 5, 17, 257, 641, 65537, 6700417} }}{{ref label|Fermat|a|a}}&lt;ref&gt;Sierpiński, Wacław (1960); ‘Sur un problème concernant les nombres’; ''Elemente der Mathematik'', 15(1960); pp. 73–96&lt;/ref&gt;) but, because there are an infinitude of numbers of the form {{math|{{mvar|k}} 2&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} or {{math|{{mvar|k}} 2&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} for any {{mvar|k}}, one can only prove {{mvar|k}} to be a Sierpinski or Riesel number through showing that ''every'' term in the sequence {{math|{{mvar|k}} 2&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} or {{math|{{mvar|k}} 2&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is divisible by one of the prime numbers of a covering set.

These covering sets form from prime numbers that in [[binary numeral system#Representing real numbers|base 2]] have short periods. To achieve a complete covering set, [[Wacław Sierpiński]] showed that a sequence can repeat no more frequently than every 24 numbers. A repeat every 24 numbers give the covering set {{math|{3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241} }}, while a repeat every 36 terms can give several covering sets: {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73}; {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 109}; {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 73, 109} and {3, 5, 7, 13, 37, 73, 109}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irvinemclean.com/maths/siercvr.htm Covering Sets for Sierpiński Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Riesel numbers have the same covering sets as Sierpinski numbers.

==Other covering sets==
Covering sets are also used to prove the existence of composite Fibonacci sequences ([[primefree sequence]]).

The concept of a covering set can easily be generalised to other sequences which turn out to be much simpler.

In the following examples + is used as it is in [[regular expression]]s to mean 1 or more. For example, 91&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;3 means the set {{math|{913, 9113, 91113, 911113…} }}

An example are the following eight sequences:
* (29·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 191) / 9 or 32&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;01
* (37·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + 359) / 9 or 41&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;51
* (46·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + 629) / 9 or 51&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;81
* (59·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 293) / 9 or 65&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;23
* (82·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + 17) / 9 or 91&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;3
* (85·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + 41) / 9 or 94&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;9
* (86·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + 31) / 9 or 95&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;9
* (89·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + 593) / 9 or 98&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;23

In each case, every term is divisible by one of the primes {{math|{3, 7, 11, 13} }}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofnumbers.com/deplat.htm Plateau and Depression Primes]&lt;/ref&gt; These primes can be said to form a covering set exactly analogous to Sierpinski and Riesel numbers.&lt;ref name="difficulty"&gt;[http://mada.la.coocan.jp/nrr/prime/primedifficulty.txt Sequences by Prime Difficulty]&lt;/ref&gt; The covering set {{math|{3, 7, 11, 37} }} is found for several similar sequences,&lt;ref name="difficulty"/&gt; including:
* (38·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 137) / 9 or 42&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;07
* (4·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 337) / 9 or 4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;07
* (73·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + 359) / 9 or 81&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;51

An even simpler case can be found in the sequence:

* (76·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 67) / 99 ('''''n must be odd''''') or (76&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;7 [Sequence: 7, 767, 76767, 7676767, 767676767 etc.]

Here, it can be shown that if:
* w is of form {{math|3 {{mvar|k}}}} (n = {{math|6 {{mvar|k}} + 1}}): (76)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;7 is divisible by 7
* w is of form {{math|3 {{mvar|k}} + 1}} (n = {{math|6 {{mvar|k}} + 3}}): (76)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;7 is divisible by 13
* w is of form {{math|3 {{mvar|k}} + 2}} (n = {{math|6 {{mvar|k}} + 5}}): (76)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;7 is divisible by 3

Thus we have a covering set with only three primes {3, 7, 13}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofnumbers.com/undulat.htm Smoothly Undulating Palindromic Primes]&lt;/ref&gt; This is only possible because the sequence gives integer terms ''only for odd n''.

A covering set also occurs in the sequence:

* (343·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) / 9 or 381&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Here, it can be shown that:
* If n = {{math|3 {{mvar|k}} + 1}}, then {{math|(343·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) / 9}} is divisible by 3.
* If n = {{math|3 {{mvar|k}} + 2}}, then {{math|(343·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) / 9}} is divisible by 37.
* If n = {{math|3 {{mvar|k}}}}, then {{math|(343·10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) / 9}} is algebraic factored as {{math|((7·10&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|k}}&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) / 3)·((49·10&lt;sup&gt;2{{mvar|k}}&lt;/sup&gt; + 7·10&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|k}}&lt;/sup&gt; + 1) / 3)}}.
Since {{math|(7·10&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|k}}&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) / 3}} can be written as 23&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,  for the sequence 381&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, we have a covering set of {3, 37, 23&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;} – a covering set with ''infinitely many'' terms.&lt;ref name="difficulty"/&gt;

'''Daniel J. Kleitman''' (born October 4, 1934)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6YNUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Kleitman,+Daniel+J%22+AND+%221934%22&amp;dq=%22Kleitman,+Daniel+J%22+AND+%221934%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-KHFTY7mG8bL0AHJibSmBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg Kleitman, Daniel J in ''American Men of Science'', vol. 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[professor]] of [[applied mathematics]] at [[MIT]]. His research interests include [[combinatorics]], [[graph theory]], [[genomics]], and [[operations research]].

== Biography ==
Kleitman was born in [[New York, New York]], in 1934. received his [[PhD]] in [[Physics]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1958 under Nobel Laureates [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Roy Glauber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=12895}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the "k" in [[G. W. Peck]], a pseudonym for a group of six mathematicians that includes Kleitman. Formerly a physics professor at [[Brandeis University]],&lt;ref name="mit-home-page"/&gt; Kleitman was encouraged by [[Paul Erdős]] to change his field of study to mathematics. Perhaps humorously, Erdős once asked him, "Why are you ''only'' a physicist?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Kleitman joined the applied mathematics faculty at MIT in 1966, and was promoted to professor in 1969.&lt;ref name="mit-home-page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-math.mit.edu/people/profile.php?pid=135|title=MIT Mathematics - Daniel Kleitman|publisher=www-math.mit.edu|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleitman coauthored at least six papers with Erdős, giving him an [[Erdős number]] of 1.

He was a math advisor and extra for the film ''[[Good Will Hunting]].''&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Kleitman, [http://www.ams.org/notices/199804/review-saul.pdf "My Career in the Movies,"], ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'', '''45''', 502 (April 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Minnie Driver]], who appeared in ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', also appeared in ''[[Sleepers (film)|Sleepers]]'' with [[Kevin Bacon]], Kleitman has a [[Bacon number]] of 2. Adding the two numbers results in an [[Erdős–Bacon number]] of 3, tied for lowest currently.&lt;ref name="erdos-bacon"&gt;{{cite web | last = Grossman | first = Jerry | url = https://oakland.edu/enp/related/ | title = Items of Interest Related to Erdös Numbers | website = The Erdös Number Project | publisher = [[Oakland University]] | accessdate = 24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EPCC''', formerly the '''Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre''', is a supercomputing centre based at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Since its foundation in 1990, its stated mission has been to ''accelerate the effective exploitation of novel computing throughout industry, academia and commerce''.

The University has supported [[high performance computing|high-performance computing (HPC)]] services since 1982. {{as of|2013}}, through EPCC, it supports the UK’s national high-end computing system, ARCHER (Advanced Research Computing High End Resource), and the UK Research Data Facility (UK-RDF).

== Overview ==
EPCC's activities include: consultation and [[software development]] for [[industry]] and [[academia]]; [[research]] into high-performance computing; hosting advanced computing facilities and supporting their [[user (computing)|users]]; [[training]] and [[education]] .

The Centre offers two Masters programmes: MSc in High-Performance Computing and MSc in High-Performance Computing with Data Science .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/msc]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a member of the [[Globus Alliance]] and, through its involvement with the OGSA-DAI project, it works with the [[Open Grid Forum]] DAIS-WG.

Around half of EPCC’s annual turnover comes from collaborative projects with industry and commerce. In addition to privately funded projects with businesses, EPCC receives funding from [[Scottish Enterprise]], the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] and the [[European Commission]].

== History ==
EPCC was established in 1990, following on from the earlier [[Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer Project]] and chaired by [[Jeffery Collins]] from 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/staff/2015/jeffrey-collins-011015|title=Jeffrey Collins Obituary, University of Edinburgh|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 to 2016 EPCC was part of the University's School of Physics &amp; Astronomy, becoming an independent Centre of Excellence within the University's College of Science and Engineering in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/about-us/history/ EPCC History]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was extensively involved in all aspects of [[Grid computing]] including: developing Grid [[middleware]] and [[software architecture|architecture]] tools to facilitate the uptake of [[e-Science]]; developing business applications and collaborating in scientific applications and demonstration projects.

The Centre was a founder member of the UK’s National e-Science Centre (NeSC), the hub of Grid and e-Science activity in the UK. EPCC and NeSC were both partners in [[OMII-UK]], which offers consultancy and products to the UK e-Science community. EPCC was also a founder partner of the Numerical Algorithms and Intelligent Software Centre (NAIS).

EPCC has hosted a variety of [[supercomputers]] over the years, including several [[Meiko Computing Surface]]s, a [[Thinking Machines Corporation|Thinking Machines]] CM-200 [[Connection Machine]], and a number of [[Cray]] systems including a [[Cray T3D]] and [[Cray T3E|T3E]].

== High-performance computing facilities ==
EPCC manages a collection of HPC systems including ARCHER (the UK’s national high-end computing system) and a variety of smaller HPC systems. These systems are all available for industry use on a pay-per-use basis.

Current systems hosted by EPCC include:
* ARCHER: As of 2014, the ARCHER facility is based around a [[Cray XC30]] supercomputer that provides the central computational resource. It is supported by a number of additional components including: high-performance parallel filesystems, pre- and post-processing facilities, external login nodes, and UK-RDF, a large, resilient, long-term data facility.
* [[Blue Gene/Q]]: As of 2013, this system consists of 6144 compute nodes housed in 6 frames. Each node comprises a 16 core Powerpc64 A2 processor, with 16GB memory per node, giving a total of 98,304 cores and a peak performance of 1.26 PetaFlops. It is part of the [[DiRAC|Distributed Research utilising Advanced Computing (DiRAC)]] consortium.

Recent systems hosted by EPCC include:
* [[HECToR]]: The 2010 system (Phase 2b, XT6) was the first production Cray XT6 24-core system in the world. It was contained in 20 cabinets and comprised a total of 464 compute blades. Each blade contained four compute nodes, each with two 12-core AMD Opteron 2.1&amp;nbsp;GHz Magny Cours processors. This amounted to a total of 44,544 cores. Each 12-core socket was coupled with a Cray SeaStar2 routing and communications chip. This was upgraded in late 2010 to the Cray Gemini interconnect. Each 12-core processor shared 16Gb of memory, giving a system total of 59.4 Tb. The theoretical peak performance of the phase 2b system was over 360 Tflops. HECToR was decommissioned in 2014.
* [[HPCx]]: Launched in 2002, when it was ranked ninth-fastest system in the world. HPCx was an [[IBM System p|IBM eServer p5 575]] [[cluster (computing)|cluster]], located at [[Daresbury Laboratory]]. It latterly operated under the complementarity capability computing scheme, preferably hosting workload which can not easily be accommodated on the HECToR system. EPCC supported the HPCx and HECToR systems on behalf of the UK research councils, making them available to UK academics and industry.
* [[Blue Gene]] : Launched in 2005, EPCC's Blue Gene/L was the first Blue Gene system available outside the United States. EPCC operated this 2048-compute core service for the University of Edinburgh.
* [[QCDOC]]: One of the world’s most powerful systems dedicated to the numerical investigation of [[quantum chromodynamics]], which describes the interactions between [[quarks]] and [[gluons]]. It was developed in collaboration with a consortium of UK lattice physicists (UKQCD), [[Columbia University]] (NY), [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Riken Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and [[IBM]].
* Maxwell: Maxwell was an innovative, award-winning [[FPGA]]-based supercomputer built by the FPGA High Performance Computing Alliance (FHPCA). Maxwell comprised 32 blades housed in an [[IBM BladeCenter]]. Each blade comprised one [[Xeon]] processor and two FPGAs. The FPGAs were connected by a fast communication subsystem which enabled the total of 64 FPGAs to be connected together in an 8×8 [[toroid]]al mesh. The processors were connected together via a [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus.

'''Eduard Study''', more properly '''Christian Hugo Eduard Study''' (March 23, 1862 – January 6, 1930), was a German [[mathematician]] known for work on [[invariant theory]] of ternary forms (1889) and for the study of [[spherical trigonometry]]. He is also known for contributions to space geometry, hypercomplex numbers, and criticism of early physical chemistry.

Study was born in [[Coburg]] in the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]]. His family was of [[Jewish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Bergmann, ''Transcending Tradition: Jewish Mathematicians in German Speaking Academic Culture'', Springer (2012), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Bonn]].

==Career==
Eduard Study began his university career in Jena, Strasbourg, Leipzig, and Munich. He loved to study biology, especially entomology. He was awarded the doctorate in mathematics at the [[University of Munich]] in 1884. [[Paul Gordan]], an expert in [[invariant theory]] was at Leipzig, and Study returned there as Privatdozent. In 1888 he moved to Marburg and in 1893 embarked on a speaking tour in the U.S.A. He appeared at the first [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in Chicago as part of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Case, Bettye Anne|editor-link=Bettye Anne Case|title=A Century of Mathematical Meetings|chapter=''Come to the Fair: The Chicago Mathematical Congress of 1893'' by David E. Rowe and Karen Hunger Parshall|year=1996|publisher=American Mathematical Society|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnkYqxyWGz8C&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in mathematics at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Back in Germany, in 1894, he was appointed extraordinary professor at Göttingen. Then he gained the rank of full professor in 1897 at Greifswald. In 1904 he was called to the [[University of Bonn]] as the position held by [[Rudolf Lipschitz]] was vacant. There he settled until retirement in 1927.

He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1904 at Heidelberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=''Kürzeste Wege im komplexen Gebiet'' von E. Study|title=Verhandlungen des dritten Mathematiker-Kongresses in Heidelberg von 8. bis 13. August 1904|pages=313–321|location=Leipzig|publisher=B. G.

Study|title=Proceedings of the Fifth International Congress of Mathematicians (Cambridge, 22—25 August 1912)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1913|volume=vol. 2|pages=122–125|chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.aag4063.0831.001;view=1up;seq=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euclidean space group and dual quaternions==
In 1891 Eduard Study published "Of Motions and Translations, in two parts". It treats  the [[Euclidean group]] E(3). The second part of his article
introduces the [[associative algebra]] of [[dual quaternion]]s, that is numbers

:&lt;math&gt;q = a + bi + cj + dk \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'',&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''d'' are [[dual numbers]] and  {1,&amp;nbsp;''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'',&amp;nbsp;''k''} multiply as in the [[quaternion group]]. Actually Study uses notation such that

:&lt;math&gt;e_0 = 1,\  e_1 = i,\  e_2 = j,\  e_3 = k, \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _0 = \varepsilon ,\  \varepsilon _1 = \varepsilon i,\  \varepsilon _2 = \varepsilon j,\  \varepsilon _3 = \varepsilon k. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The multiplication table is found on page 520 of volume 39 (1891) in [[Mathematische Annalen]] under the title "Von Bewegungen und Umlegungen, I. und II. Abhandlungen".
Eduard Study cites [[William Kingdon Clifford]] as an earlier source on these [[biquaternion]]s.  In 1901 Study published ''Geometrie der Dynamen''&lt;ref&gt;E. Study (1903) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=03150002 Geometrie der Dynamen]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, from ''Historical Math Monographs'' at [[Cornell University]]&lt;/ref&gt; also using dual quaternions. In 1913 he wrote a review article treating both E(3) and [[elliptic geometry]]. This article, "Foundations and goals of analytical kinematics"&lt;ref&gt;E. Study (1913), Delphinich translator, [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/study-analytical_kinematics.pdf "Foundations and goals of analytical kinematics"] from Neo-classical physics&lt;/ref&gt; develops the field of [[kinematics]], in particular exhibiting an element of E(3) as a [[screw theory#Homography|homography of dual quaternions]].

Study's use of [[abstract algebra]] was noted in ''A History of Algebra'' (1985) by [[B. L. van der Waerden]]. On the other hand, Joe Rooney recounts these developments in relation to kinematics.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Rooney [http://oro.open.ac.uk/8455/01/chapter4(020507).pdf William Kingdon Clifford], Department of Design and Innovation, the Open University, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypercomplex numbers==
{{Main|Hypercomplex number}}
Study showed an early interest in systems of complex numbers and their application to transformation groups with his article in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;E. Study (1890) D.H. Delphenich translator, [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/study_-_complex_numbers_and_transformation_groups.pdf "On systems of complex numbers and their applications to the theory of transformation groups"]&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed this popular subject again in 1898 in ''[[Klein's encyclopedia]]''. The essay explored [[quaternion]]s and other hypercomplex number systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Study E | year = 1898 | title = Theorie der gemeinen und höhern komplexen Grössen | url = | journal = [[Klein's encyclopedia|Encyclopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften]] I A | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 147–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This 34 page article was expanded to 138 pages in 1908 by [[Élie Cartan]], who surveyed the hypercomplex systems in ''Encyclopédie des sciences mathématiques pures et appliqueés''. Cartan acknowledged Eduard Study's guidance, in his title, with the words "after Eduard Study".

In the 1993 biography of Cartan by Akivis and Rosenfeld, one reads:&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Akivis &amp; B.A. Rosenfeld (1993) ''Élie Cartan (1869 — 1951)'', [[American Mathematical Society]], pp.&amp;nbsp;68–9&lt;/ref&gt;
: [Study] defined the algebra °'''H''' of 'semiquaternions' with the units 1, ''i'', ''ε'', ''η'' having the properties  &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1, \ \varepsilon ^2 = 0, \ i \varepsilon = - \varepsilon i = \eta. \! &lt;/math&gt;
: Semiquaternions are often called 'Study's quaternions'.

In 1985 Helmut Karzel and Günter Kist developed "Study's quaternions" as the kinematic algebra corresponding to the [[group of motions]] of the Euclidean plane. These quaternions arise in "Kinematic algebras and their geometries" alongside ordinary quaternions and the ring of [[2 × 2 real matrices]] which Karzel and Kist cast as the kinematic algebras of the elliptic plane and hyperbolic plane respectively. See the "Motivation and Historical Review" at page 437 of ''Rings and Geometry'', R. Kaya editor.

Some of the other hypercomplex systems that Study worked with are [[dual numbers]], [[dual quaternion]]s, and [[split-biquaternion]]s, all being
[[associative algebra]]s over '''R'''.

==Ruled surfaces==
Study's work with [[dual number]]s and [[line coordinates]] was noted by [[Heinrich Guggenheimer]] in 1963 in his book ''Differential Geometry'' (see pages 162–5). He cites and proves the following theorem of Study: The oriented lines in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are in one-to-one correspondence with the points of the dual unit sphere in '''D'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Later he says "A differentiable curve '''A'''(''u'') on the dual unit sphere, depending on a ''real'' parameter ''u'', represents a differentiable family of straight lines in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: a [[ruled surface]]. The lines '''A'''(''u'') are the ''generators'' or ''rulings'' of the surface." Guggenheimer also shows the representation of the Euclidean motions in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by orthogonal dual matrices.

==Hermitian form metric==
In 1905 Study wrote "Kürzeste Wege im komplexen Gebiet" (Shortest paths in the complex domain) for [[Mathematische Annalen]] (60:321–378). Some of its contents were anticipated by [[Guido Fubini]] a year before. The distance Study refers to is a [[Sesquilinear form#Hermitian form|Hermitian form]] on [[complex projective space]]. Since then this [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] has been called the [[Fubini–Study metric]]. Study was careful in 1905 to distinguish the hyperbolic and elliptic cases in Hermitian geometry.

==Valence theory==
Somewhat surprisingly Eduard Study is known by practitioners of [[quantum chemistry]]. Like [[James Joseph Sylvester]], [[Paul Gordan]] believed that invariant theory could contribute to the understanding of [[valence (chemistry)|chemical valence]]. In 1900 Gordan and his student G. Alexejeff contributed an article on an analogy between the [[angular momentum coupling|coupling problem for angular momenta]] and their work on invariant theory to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie]]'' (v. 35, p.&amp;nbsp;610). In 2006 Wormer and Paldus summarized Study's role as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Paul E.S. Wormer  and [[Josef Paldus]] (2006) [http://www.theochem.ru.nl/files/dbase/aqc-51-59-2006.pdf Angular Momentum Diagrams] Advances in Quantum Chemistry, v. 51, pp.&amp;nbsp;51–124&lt;/ref&gt;
: The analogy, lacking a physical basis at the time, was criticised heavily by the '''mathematician E. Study''' and ignored completely by the chemistry community of the 1890s. After the advent of quantum mechanics it became clear, however, that chemical valences arise from electron-spin couplings ... and that electron spin functions are, in fact, binary forms of the type studied by [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients|Gordan and Clebsch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9791">In [[number theory]], the '''Mordell conjecture''' is the conjecture made by {{harvs|txt|last=Mordell|authorlink=Louis Mordell|year=1922}} that a curve of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] greater than 1 over the field '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s has only finitely many [[rational points]]. In 1983 it was proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gerd Faltings|first=Gerd|last=Faltings|year1=1983|year2=1984}}, and is now known as '''Faltings's theorem'''. The conjecture was later generalized by replacing '''Q''' by any [[number field]].

==Background==
Let ''C'' be a [[non-singular]] algebraic curve of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' over '''Q'''. Then the set of rational points on ''C'' may be determined as follows:

* Case ''g'' = 0: no points or infinitely many; ''C'' is handled as a [[conic section]].
* Case ''g'' = 1: no points, or ''C'' is an [[elliptic curve]] and its rational points form a [[finitely generated abelian group]] (''Mordell's Theorem'', later generalized to the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]]). Moreover [[Mazur's torsion theorem]] restricts the structure of the torsion subgroup.
* Case ''g'' &gt; 1: according to the Mordell conjecture, now Faltings's theorem, ''C'' has only a finite number of rational points.

==Proofs==
Faltings's original proof used the known reduction to a case of the [[Tate conjecture]], and a number of tools from [[algebraic geometry]], including the theory of [[Néron model]]s. A very different proof, based on diophantine approximation, was found by {{harvs|txt|last=Vojta|authorlink=Paul Vojta|year=1991}}. A more elementary variant of Vojta's proof was given by {{harvs|txt|last1=Bombieri|author1-link=Enrico Bombieri|year=1990}}.

==Consequences==
Faltings's 1983 paper had as consequences a number of statements which had previously been conjectured:

* The ''Mordell conjecture'' that a curve of genus greater than 1 over a number field has only finitely many rational points;
* The ''Shafarevich conjecture'' that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of abelian varieties of fixed dimension and fixed polarization degree over a fixed number field with [[good reduction]] outside a given finite set of [[place (mathematics)|place]]s; and
* The ''Isogeny theorem'' that [[abelian varieties]] with isomorphic [[Tate module]]s (as '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;-modules with Galois action) are [[Isogeny|isogenous]].

The reduction of the Mordell conjecture to the Shafarevich conjecture was due to {{harvs|txt|last=Paršin|first=A. N.| authorlink=Aleksei Nikolaevich Parshin |year=1971}}. A sample application of Faltings's theorem is to a weak form of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]: for any fixed ''n'' &gt; 4 there are at most finitely many primitive integer solutions to ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, since for such ''n'' the curve ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''1'' has genus greater than 1.

==Generalizations==
Because of the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]], Faltings's theorem can be reformulated as a statement about the intersection of a curve ''C'' with a finitely generated subgroup Γ of an abelian variety ''A''. Generalizing by replacing ''C'' by an arbitrary subvariety of ''A'' and ''Γ'' by an arbitrary finite-rank subgroup of ''A'' leads to the [[Mordell–Lang conjecture]], which was proved by {{harvs|txt|last=Faltings|year1=1991|year2=1994}}.

Another higher-dimensional generalization of Faltings's theorem is the [[Glossary of arithmetic and diophantine geometry#B|Bombieri–Lang conjecture]] that if ''X'' is a [[pseudo-canonical variety]] (i.e., a variety of general type) over a number field ''k'', then ''X''(''k'') is not [[Zariski topology|Zariski]] [[dense set|dense]] in ''X''. Even more general conjectures have been put forth by [[Paul Vojta]].

The Mordell conjecture for function fields was proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Yuri Ivanovich Manin|last=Manin|year=1963}} and by {{harvs|txt|last=Grauert|authorlink=Hans Grauert|year=1965}}. In 1990, {{harvs|txt|last=Coleman|authorlink=Robert F. Coleman|year=1990}} found and fixed a gap in Manin's proof.

In [[computational biology]], '''gene prediction''' or '''gene finding''' refers to the process of identifying the regions of genomic DNA that encode [[genes]]. This includes protein-coding [[gene]]s as well as [[RNA gene]]s, but may also include prediction of other functional elements such as [[regulatory regions]]. Gene finding is one of the first and most important steps in understanding the genome of a species once it has been [[Sequencing|sequenced]].

In its earliest days, "gene finding" was based on painstaking experimentation on living cells and organisms. Statistical analysis of the rates of [[homologous recombination]] of several different genes could determine their order on a certain [[chromosome]], and information from many such experiments could be combined to create a [[genetic map]] specifying the rough location of known genes relative to each other. Today, with comprehensive genome sequence and powerful computational resources at the disposal of the research community, gene finding has been redefined as a largely computational problem.

Determining that a sequence is functional should be distinguished from determining [[Protein function prediction|the function]] of the gene or its product. Predicting the function of a gene and confirming that the gene prediction is accurate still demands ''[[in vivo]]'' experimentation&lt;ref name="Sleator2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sleator RD | title = An overview of the current status of eukaryote gene prediction strategies | journal = Gene | volume = 461 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–4 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20430068 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2010.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[gene knockout]] and other assays, although frontiers of [[bioinformatics]] research {{citation needed|date=March 2013}} are making it increasingly possible to predict the function of a gene based on its sequence alone.

Gene prediction is one of the key steps in [[genome annotation]], following [[sequence assembly]], the filtering of non-coding regions and repeat masking.&lt;ref name="Yandell2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yandell M, Ence D | title = A beginner's guide to eukaryotic genome annotation | journal = Nature Reviews.

Gene prediction is closely related to the so-called 'target search problem' investigating how [[DNA-binding proteins]] ([[transcription factors]]) locate specific [[binding sites]] within the [[genome]].&lt;ref name=redding2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Redding S, Greene EC | title = How do proteins locate specific targets in DNA? | journal = Chemical Physics Letters | volume = 570 | pages = 1–11 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 24187380 | pmc = 3810971 | doi = 10.1016/j.cplett.2013.03.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sokolov2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sokolov IM, Metzler R, Pant K, Williams MC | title = Target search of N sliding proteins on a DNA | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 895–902 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 15908574 | pmc = 1366639 | doi = 10.1529/biophysj.104.057612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many aspects of structural gene prediction are based on current understanding of underlying [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] processes in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] such as gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[translation (biology)|translation]],  [[protein–protein interaction]]s and [[Regulation of gene expression|regulation processes]], which are subject of active research in the various [[omics]] fields such as [[transcriptomics]],  [[proteomics]], [[metabolomics]], and more generally [[Structural genomics|structural]] and [[Functional genomics|functional]] [[genomics]].

== Empirical methods ==
In empirical (similarity, homology or evidence-based) gene finding systems, the target genome is searched for sequences that are similar to extrinsic evidence in the form of the known [[expressed sequence tags]], [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), [[protein]] products, and homologous or orthologous sequences. Given an mRNA sequence, it is trivial to derive a unique genomic DNA sequence from which it had to have been [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]. Given a protein sequence, a  family of possible coding DNA sequences can be derived by reverse translation of the [[genetic code]]. Once candidate DNA sequences have been determined, it is a relatively straightforward algorithmic problem to efficiently search a target genome for matches, complete or partial, and exact or inexact. Given a sequence, local alignment algorithms such as [[BLAST]], [[FASTA]] and [[Smith–Waterman algorithm|Smith-Waterman]] look for regions of similarity between the target sequence and possible candidate matches. Matches can be complete or partial, and exact or inexact. The success of this approach is limited by the contents and accuracy of the sequence database.

A high degree of similarity to a known messenger RNA or protein product is strong evidence that a region of a target genome is a protein-coding gene. However, to apply this approach systemically requires extensive sequencing of mRNA and protein products. Not only is this expensive, but in complex organisms, only a subset of all genes in the organism's genome are expressed at any given time, meaning that extrinsic evidence for many genes is not readily accessible in any single cell culture. Thus, to collect extrinsic evidence for most or all of the genes in a complex organism requires the study of many hundreds or thousands of [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|cell types]], which presents further difficulties. For example, some human genes may be expressed only during development as an embryo or fetus, which might be difficult to study for ethical reasons.

Despite these difficulties, extensive transcript and protein sequence databases have been generated for human as well as other important model organisms in biology, such as mice and yeast. For example, the [[RefSeq]] database contains transcript and protein sequence from many different species, and the [[Ensembl]] system comprehensively maps this evidence to human and several other genomes. It is, however, likely that these databases are both incomplete and contain small but significant amounts of erroneous data.

New high-throughput [[transcriptome]] sequencing technologies such as [[RNA-Seq]] and [[ChIP-sequencing]] open opportunities for incorporating additional extrinsic evidence into gene prediction and validation, and allow structurally rich and more accurate alternative to previous methods of measuring [[gene expression]] such as [[expressed sequence tag]] or [[DNA microarray]].

Major challenges involved in gene prediction involve dealing with sequencing errors in raw DNA data, dependence on the quality of the [[sequence assembly]], handling short reads, [[frameshift mutation]]s, [[overlapping gene]]s and incomplete genes.

In prokaryotes it's essential to consider [[horizontal gene transfer]] when searching for gene sequence homology. An additional important factor underused in current gene detection tools is existence of gene clusters—[[operon]]s in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Most popular gene detectors treat each gene in isolation, independent of others, which is not biologically accurate.

== ''Ab initio'' methods ==
Ab Initio gene prediction is an intrinsic method based on gene content and signal detection. Because of the inherent expense and difficulty in obtaining extrinsic evidence for many genes, it is also necessary to resort to ''[[ab initio]]'' gene finding, in which the [[genomic]] [[DNA sequence]] alone is systematically searched for certain tell-tale signs of protein-coding genes. These signs can be broadly categorized as either ''signals'', specific sequences that indicate the presence of a gene nearby, or ''content'', statistical properties of the protein-coding sequence itself. ''Ab initio'' gene finding might be more accurately characterized as gene ''prediction'', since extrinsic evidence is generally required to conclusively establish that a putative gene is functional.
[[File:Gene Prediction.png|thumb|This picture shows how Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can be used for gene prediction. Gene prediction is the process of determining where a coding gene might be in a genomic sequence. Functional proteins must begin with a Start codon (where DNA transcription begins), and end with a Stop codon (where transcription ends). By looking at where those codons might fall in a DNA sequence, one can see where a functional protein might be located. This is important in gene prediction because it can reveal where coding genes are in an entire genomic sequence. In this example, a functional protein can be discovered using ORF3 because it begins with a Start codon, has multiple amino acids, and then ends with a Stop codon, all within the same reading frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms|last=Madigan|first=Michael T.|last2=Martinko|first2=John M.|last3=Bender|first3=Kelly S.|last4=Buckley|first4=Daniel H.|last5=Stahl|first5=David | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Pearson|year=2015|isbn=9780321897398|edition=14th|location=Boston }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the genomes of [[prokaryotes]], genes have specific and relatively well-understood [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequences (signals), such as the [[Pribnow box]] and [[transcription factor]] [[binding site]]s, which are easy to systematically identify. Also, the sequence coding for a protein occurs as one contiguous [[open reading frame]] (ORF), which is typically many hundred or thousands of [[base pair]]s long. The statistics of [[stop codon]]s are such that even finding an open reading frame of this length is a fairly informative sign. (Since 3 of the 64 possible codons in the genetic code are stop codons, one would expect a stop codon approximately every 20–25 codons, or 60–75 base pairs, in a [[random sequence]].) Furthermore, protein-coding DNA has certain [[Frequency|periodicities]] and other statistical properties that are easy to detect in sequence of this length. These characteristics make prokaryotic gene finding relatively straightforward, and well-designed systems are able to achieve high levels of accuracy.

''Ab initio'' gene finding in [[eukaryotes]], especially complex organisms like humans, is considerably more challenging for several reasons. First, the promoter and other regulatory signals in these genomes are more complex and less well-understood than in prokaryotes, making them more difficult to reliably recognize. Two classic examples of signals identified by eukaryotic gene finders are [[CpG island]]s and binding sites for a [[Polyadenylation|poly(A) tail]].

Second, [[RNA splicing|splicing]] mechanisms employed by eukaryotic cells mean that a particular protein-coding sequence in the genome is divided into several parts ([[exons]]), separated by non-coding sequences ([[introns]]). (Splice sites are themselves another signal that eukaryotic gene finders are often designed to identify.) A typical protein-coding gene in humans might be divided into a dozen exons, each less than two hundred base pairs in length, and some as short as twenty to thirty. It is therefore much more difficult to detect periodicities and other known content properties of protein-coding DNA in eukaryotes.

Advanced gene finders for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes typically use complex [[probabilistic model]]s, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMMs) to combine information from a variety of different signal and content measurements. The [[GLIMMER]] system is a widely used and highly accurate gene finder for prokaryotes. [[GeneMark]] is another popular approach. Eukaryotic ''ab initio'' gene finders, by comparison, have achieved only limited success; notable examples are the [[GENSCAN]] and [[geneid]] programs. The SNAP gene finder is HMM-based like Genscan, and attempts to be more adaptable to different organisms, addressing problems related to using a gene finder on a genome sequence that it was not trained against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korf I | title = Gene finding in novel genomes | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 5 | pages = 59 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15144565 | pmc = 421630 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-5-59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few recent approaches like mSplicer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rätsch G, Sonnenburg S, Srinivasan J, Witte H, Müller KR, Sommer RJ, Schölkopf B | title = Improving the Caenorhabditis elegans genome annotation using machine learning | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = e20 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17319737 | pmc = 1808025 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CONTRAST,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross SS, Do CB, Sirota M, Batzoglou S | title = CONTRAST: a discriminative, phylogeny-free approach to multiple informant de novo gene prediction | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = R269 | date = 2007-12-20 | pmid = 18096039 | pmc = 2246271 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-12-r269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[mGene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schweikert G, Behr J, Zien A, Zeller G, Ong CS, Sonnenburg S, Rätsch G | title = mGene.web: a web service for accurate computational gene finding | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W312–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19494180 | pmc = 2703990 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp479 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19494180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also use [[machine learning]] techniques like [[support vector machines]] for successful gene prediction. They build a [[discriminative model]] using [[hidden Markov support vector machine]]s or [[conditional random field]]s to learn an accurate gene prediction scoring function.

''Ab Initio'' methods have been benchmarked, with some approaching 100% sensitivity,&lt;ref name=Yandell2012 /&gt; however as the sensitivity increases, accuracy suffers as a result of increased [[Type I and type II errors#False positive error|false positives]].

===Other signals===
Among the derived signals used for prediction are statistics resulting from the sub-sequence statistics like [[k-mer]] statistics, [[Isochore (genetics)]] or [[Compositional domain]] GC composition/uniformity/entropy, sequence and frame length, Intron/Exon/Donor/Acceptor/Promoter and [[Ribosomal binding site]] vocabulary,  [[Fractal dimension]], [[Fourier transform]] of a pseudo-number-coded DNA, [[Z-curve]] parameters and certain run features.&lt;ref name="Saeys2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saeys Y, Rouzé P, Van de Peer Y | title = In search of the small ones: improved prediction of short exons in vertebrates, plants, fungi and protists | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 414–20 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17204465 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl639 | url = http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/23/4/414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that signals other than those directly detectable in sequences may improve gene prediction. For example, the role of [[secondary structure]] in the identification of regulatory motifs has been reported.&lt;ref name="Hiller2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiller M, Pudimat R, Busch A, Backofen R | title = Using RNA secondary structures to guide sequence motif finding towards single-stranded regions | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 17 | pages = e117 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16987907 | pmc = 1903381 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl544 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been suggested that RNA secondary structure prediction helps splice site prediction.&lt;ref name="Patterson2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patterson DJ, Yasuhara K, Ruzzo WL | title = Pre-mRNA secondary structure prediction aids splice site prediction | journal = Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

=== Neural networks ===

[[Artificial neural networks]] are computational models that excel at [[machine learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. Neural networks must be [[Artificial neural network#Learning|trained]] with example data before being able to generalise for experimental data, and tested against benchmark data. Neural networks are able to come up with approximate solutions to problems that are hard to solve algorithmically, provided there is sufficient training data. When applied to gene prediction, neural networks can be used alongside other ''ab initio'' methods to predict or identify biological features such as splice sites.&lt;ref name="Goel2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goel N, Singh S, Aseri TC | title = A comparative analysis of soft computing techniques for gene prediction | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 438 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–21 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23529114 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One approach&lt;ref name="Johansen2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=Splice Site Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks|journal=Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics|series=Lec Not Comp Sci|volume=5488|year=2009|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02504-4_9|pages=102–113|last1=Johansen|first1=∅Ystein|last2=Ryen|first2=Tom|last3=Eftes∅l|first3=Trygve|last4=Kjosmoen|first4=Thomas|last5=Ruoff|first5=Peter|isbn=978-3-642-02503-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves using a sliding window, which traverses the sequence data in an overlapping manner. The output at each position is a score based on whether the network thinks the window contains a donor splice site or an acceptor splice site. Larger windows offer more accuracy but also require more computational power. A neural network is an example of a signal sensor as its goal is to identify a functional site in the genome.

== Combined approaches ==
Programs such as [http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html Maker] combine extrinsic and ''ab initio'' approaches by mapping protein and [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] data to the genome to validate ''ab initio'' predictions. [http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/ Augustus], which may be used as part of the Maker pipeline, can also incorporate hints in the form of EST alignments or protein profiles to increase the accuracy of the gene prediction.

== Comparative genomics approaches ==
As the entire genomes of many different species are sequenced, a promising direction in current research on gene finding is a [[comparative genomics]] approach.

This is based on the principle that the forces of [[natural selection]] cause genes and other functional elements to undergo mutation at a slower rate than the rest of the genome, since mutations in functional elements are more likely to negatively impact the organism than mutations elsewhere.  Genes can thus be detected by comparing the genomes of related species to detect this evolutionary pressure for conservation. This approach was first applied to the mouse and human genomes, using programs such as SLAM, SGP and TWINSCAN/N-SCAN and CONTRAST.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross SS, Do CB, Sirota M, Batzoglou S | title = CONTRAST: a discriminative, phylogeny-free approach to multiple informant de novo gene prediction | language = En | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = R269 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18096039 | pmc = 2246271 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-12-r269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple informants ===

TWINSCAN examined only human-mouse synteny to look for orthologous genes. Programs such as N-SCAN and CONTRAST allowed the incorporation of alignments from multiple organisms, or in the case of N-SCAN, a single alternate organism from the target. The use of multiple informants can lead to significant improvements in accuracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CONTRAST is composed of two elements. The first is a smaller classifier, identifying donor splice sites and acceptor splice sites as well as start and stop codons. The second element involves constructing a full model using machine learning. Breaking the problem into two means that smaller targeted data sets can be used to train the classifiers,
and that classifier can operate independently and be trained with smaller windows. The full model can use the independent classifier, and not have to waste computational time or model complexity re-classifying intron-exon boundaries. The paper in which CONTRAST is introduced proposes that their method (and those of TWINSCAN, etc.) be classified as ''de novo'' gene assembly, using alternate genomes, and identifying it as distinct from ''ab initio'', which uses a target 'informant' genomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Comparative gene finding can also be used to project high quality annotations from one genome to another. Notable examples include Projector, GeneWise, GeneMapper and GeMoMa. Such techniques now play a central role in the annotation of all genomes.

== Pseudogene prediction ==

[[Pseudogenes]] are close relatives of genes, sharing very high sequence homology, but being unable to code for the same [[protein]] product. Whilst once relegated as byproducts of [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]], increasingly, as regulatory roles are being uncovered, they are becoming predictive targets in their own right.&lt;ref name="Alexander2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander RP, Fang G, Rozowsky J, Snyder M, Gerstein MB | title = Annotating non-coding regions of the genome | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 559–71 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20628352 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudogene prediction utilises existing sequence similarity and ab initio methods, whilst adding additional filtering and methods of identifying pseudogene characteristics.

Sequence similarity methods can be customised for pseudogene prediction using additional filtering to find candidate pseudogenes. This could use disablement detection, which looks for nonsense or frameshift mutations that would truncate or collapse an otherwise functional coding sequence.&lt;ref name="Svensson2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Svensson O, Arvestad L, Lagergren J | title = Genome-wide survey for biologically functional pseudogenes | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = e46 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16680195 | pmc = 1456316 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, translating DNA into proteins sequences can be more effective than just straight DNA homology.&lt;ref name="Alexander2010" /&gt;

Content sensors can be filtered according to the differences in statistical properties between pseudogenes and genes, such as a reduced count of CpG islands in pseudogenes, or the differences in G-C content between pseudogenes and their neighbours. Signal sensors also can be honed to pseudogenes, looking for the absence of introns or polyadenine tails.  
&lt;ref name="Zhang2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Z, Gerstein M | title = Large-scale analysis of pseudogenes in the human genome | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 328–35 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15261647 | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2004.06.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metagenomic gene prediction ==

[[Metagenomics]] is the study of genetic material recovered from the environment, resulting in sequence information from a pool of organisms. Predicting genes is useful for [[Metagenomics#Comparative metagenomics|comparative metagenomics]].

Metagenomics tools also fall into the basic categories of using either sequence similarity approaches (MEGAN4) and ab initio techniques (GLIMMER-MG).

Glimmer-MG&lt;ref name="Kelley2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelley DR, Liu B, Delcher AL, Pop M, Salzberg SL | title = Gene prediction with Glimmer for metagenomic sequences augmented by classification and clustering | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = e9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22102569 | pmc = 3245904 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension to [[GLIMMER]] that relies mostly on an ab initio approach for gene finding and by using training sets from related organisms. The prediction strategy is augmented by classification and clustering gene data sets prior to applying ab initio gene prediction methods. The data is clustered by species. This classification method leverages techniques from metagenomic phylogenetic classification. An example of software for this purpose is, Phymm, which uses interpolated markov models—and PhymmBL, which integrates BLAST into the classification routines.

MEGAN4&lt;ref name="Huson2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huson DH, Mitra S, Ruscheweyh HJ, Weber N, Schuster SC | title = Integrative analysis of environmental sequences using MEGAN4 | journal = Genome Research | volume = 21 | issue = 9 | pages = 1552–60 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21690186 | pmc = 3166839 | doi = 10.1101/gr.120618.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a sequence similarity approach, using local alignment against databases of known sequences, but also attempts to classify using additional information on functional roles, biological pathways and enzymes. As in single organism gene prediction, sequence similarity approaches are limited by the size of the database.

FragGeneScan and MetaGeneAnnotator are popular gene prediction programs based on [[Hidden Markov model]]. These predictors account for sequencing errors, partial genes and work for short reads.

Another fast and accurate tool for gene prediction in metagenomes is MetaGeneMark&lt;ref name=”Zhu2010”&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu W, Lomsadze A, Borodovsky M | title = Ab initio gene identification in metagenomic sequences | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 38 | issue = 12 | pages = e132 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20403810 | pmc = 2896542 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. This tool is used by the DOE Joint Genome Institute to annotate IMG/M, the largest metagenome collection to date.

In physics, '''geometrothermodynamics (GTD)''' is a formalism developed in 2007 by Hernando Quevedo to describe the properties of [[thermodynamic]] systems in terms of concepts of differential geometry.&lt;ref name=quev07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quevedo | first=Hernando|year=2007|title=Geometrothermodynamics|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=48|pages=013506|arxiv=physics/0604164 |bibcode=2007JMP....48a3506Q|doi=10.1063/1.2409524}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consider a  thermodynamic system in the framework of classical equilibrium thermodynamics. The states of thermodynamic equilibrium are considered as points of an abstract equilibrium space in which a Riemannian metric can be introduced in several ways. In particular, one can introduce [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] metrics like the [[Fisher information metric]], the [[Weinhold metric]], the [[Ruppeiner metric]] and others, whose components are calculated as the Hessian of a particular [[thermodynamic potential]]. 

Another possibility is to introduce metrics which are independent of the thermodynamic potential, a property which is shared by all thermodynamic systems in classical thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Callen|first=Herbert B.| title=Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics
|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|year=1985 | isbn=0-471-86256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a change of thermodynamic potential is equivalent to a [[Legendre transformation]], and Legendre transformations do not act in the equilibrium space, it is necessary to introduce an auxiliary space to correctly handle the Legendre transformations. This is the so-called thermodynamic phase space. If the phase space is equipped with a Legendre invariant Riemannian metric, a smooth map can be introduced that induces a thermodynamic metric in the equilibrium manifold. The thermodynamic metric can then be used with different thermodynamic potentials without changing the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold.  One expects the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold to be related to the macroscopic physical properties. 

The details of this relation can be summarized in three main points:
#Curvature is a measure of the thermodynamical interaction.
#Curvature singularities correspond to curvature phase transitions. 
#Thermodynamic geodesics correspond to quasi-static processes.

==Geometric aspects==
{{complex|section|date=June 2018}}

The main ingredient of GTD is a (2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; 
with coordinates &lt;math&gt;Z^A=\{\Phi,E^a,I^a\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary thermodynamic potential, &lt;math&gt;E^a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, are the
extensive variables, and &lt;math&gt;I^a&lt;/math&gt; the intensive variables. It is also
possible to introduce in a canonical manner the fundamental
one-form &lt;math&gt;\Theta = d\Phi - \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b&lt;/math&gt; (summation over repeated indices) with &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}={\rm
diag}(+1,\ldots,+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;\Theta \wedge
(d\Theta)^n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of thermodynamic
degrees of freedom of the system, and is invariant with respect to
Legendre transformations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arnold|first=V.I.
| title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics 
|publisher=[[Springer Verlag]]|year=1989 | isbn=0-387-96890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\{Z^A\}\longrightarrow \{\widetilde{Z}^A\}=\{\tilde \Phi, \tilde E ^a, \tilde I ^ a\}\ ,\quad
\Phi = \tilde \Phi - \delta_{kl} \tilde E ^k \tilde I ^l ,\quad
E^i = - \tilde I ^{i}, \quad 
  E^j = \tilde E ^j,\quad   
 I^{i} = \tilde E ^i , \quad 
 I^j = \tilde I ^j \ ,
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i\cup j&lt;/math&gt; is any disjoint decomposition of the set of indices &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt;k,l= 1,\ldots,i&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, for &lt;math&gt;i=\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
the total Legendre transformation and the identity, respectively.
It is also assumed that in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T} &lt;/math&gt; 
there exists a metric &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; which is also
invariant with respect to Legendre transformations. The triad
&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{T},\Theta,G)&lt;/math&gt; defines a Riemannian [[contact manifold]] which is
called the thermodynamic phase space (phase manifold). The space of
thermodynamic equilibrium states (equilibrium manifold)  is an
n-dimensional [[Riemannian submanifold]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}\subset \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;
induced by a smooth map &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\mathcal{E}\rightarrow\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\{E^a\} \mapsto \{\Phi,E^a,I^a\}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;I^a= I^a(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;,  such that &lt;math&gt; \varphi^*(\Theta)=\varphi^*(d\Phi
- \delta_{ab}I^{a}dE^{b})=0 &lt;/math&gt; holds, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi^*&lt;/math&gt; is the
pullback of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is naturally equipped
with the Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt;g=\varphi^*(G)&lt;/math&gt;. The purpose of GTD is
to demonstrate that the geometric properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; are
related to the thermodynamic properties of a system with fundamental
thermodynamic equation &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;.
The condition of invariance with respect total Legendre transformations leads to the metrics

: &lt;math&gt;
G^I = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, (\xi_{ab} E^a I^b)\left( \delta_{cd} dE^c d I^d\right)\ ,\quad
\delta_{ab}={\rm diag}(1,\ldots,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
G^{II} = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, (\xi_{ab} E^a I^b)\left( \eta_{cd} dE^c d I^d\right)\ ,\quad
\eta_{ab}={\rm diag}(-1,1,\ldots,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\xi_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant diagonal matrix that can be expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\eta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary Legendre invariant function of &lt;math&gt;Z^A&lt;/math&gt;. The metrics &lt;math&gt;G^I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^{II}&lt;/math&gt; have been used to describe thermodynamic systems with first and second order phase transitions, respectively. The most general metric which is invariant with respect to partial Legendre transformations is

: &lt;math&gt;
G^{III} = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, ( E_a I_a)^{2k+1} \left( dE^a d I^a\right)\ ,
\quad
 E_a= \delta_{ab} E^b \ , 
\quad I_a = \delta_{ab} I^b \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

The components of the corresponding metric for the equilibrium manifold &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal E} &lt;/math&gt; can be computed as

: &lt;math&gt;
g_{ab} = \frac{\partial Z^A}{\partial E^a}\frac{\partial Z^B}{\partial E^b} G_{AB}\ .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
GTD has been applied to describe laboratory systems like the ideal gas, van der Waals gas, the Ising model, etc., more exotic systems like black holes in different gravity theories,&lt;ref name=qstv11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quevedo | first1=H.|last2=Sanchez | first2=A. |last3=Taj | first3=S.|last4=Vazquez | first4=A. |year=2011|title=Phase transitions in Geometrothermodynamics|journal=Gen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26119">In [[mathematics]], '''incidence geometry''' is the study of [[incidence structure]]s. A geometric structure&lt;!--Do not wikilink, the redirect is inappropriate--&gt; such as the [[Euclidean plane]] is a complicated object that involves concepts such as length, angles, continuity, betweenness, and [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]]. An ''incidence structure'' is what is obtained when all other concepts are removed and all that remains is the data about which points lie on which lines. Even with this severe limitation, theorems can be proved and interesting facts emerge concerning this structure. Such fundamental results remain valid when additional concepts are added to form a richer geometry. It sometimes happens that authors blur the distinction between a study and the objects of that study, so it is not surprising to find that some authors refer to incidence structures as incidence geometries.&lt;ref&gt;As, for example, L. Storme does in his chapter on Finite Geometry in {{harvtxt|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidence structures arise naturally and have been studied in various areas of mathematics. Consequently there are different terminologies to describe these objects. In [[graph theory]] they are called [[hypergraph]]s, and in [[Combinatorial design|combinatorial design theory]] they are called [[block design]]s. Besides the difference in terminology, each area approaches the subject differently and is interested in questions about these objects relevant to that discipline. Using geometric language, as is done in incidence geometry, shapes the topics and examples that are normally presented. It is, however, possible to translate the results from one discipline into the terminology of another, but this often leads to awkward and convoluted statements that do not appear to be natural outgrowths of the topics. In the examples selected for this article we use only those with a natural geometric flavor.

A special case that has generated much interest deals with finite sets of points in the [[Euclidean plane]] and what can be said about the number and types of (straight) lines they determine. Some results of this situation can extend to more general settings since only incidence properties are considered.

== Incidence structures ==
{{main|incidence structure}}

An ''incidence structure'' {{math|(''P'', ''L'', I)}} consists of a set {{math|''P''}} whose elements are called ''points'', a disjoint set {{math|''L''}} whose elements are called ''lines'' and an ''incidence relation'' {{math|I}} between them, that is, a subset of {{math|''P'' × ''L''}} whose elements are called ''flags''.&lt;ref&gt;Technically this is a rank two incidence structure, where rank refers to the number of types of objects under consideration (here, points and lines). Higher ranked structures are also studied, but several authors limit themselves to the rank two case, and we shall do so here.&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|(''A'', ''l'')}} is a flag, we say that {{math|''A''}} is ''incident with'' {{math|''l''}} or that {{math|''l''}} is incident with {{math|''A''}} (the relation is symmetric), and write {{math|''A'' I ''l''}}. Intuitively, a point and line are in this relation if and only if the point is ''on'' the line. Given a point {{math|''B''}} and a line {{math|''m''}} which do not form a flag, that is, the point is not on the line, the pair {{math|(''B'', ''m'')}} is called an ''anti-flag''.

===Distance in an incidence structure===
There is no natural concept of distance (a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]) in an incidence structure. However, a combinatorial metric does exist in the corresponding [[Levi graph|incidence graph (Levi graph)]], namely the length of the shortest [[Path (graph theory)|path]] between two vertices in this [[bipartite graph]]. The distance between two objects of an incidence structure – two points, two lines or a point and a line – can be defined to be the distance between the corresponding vertices in the incidence graph of the incidence structure.

Another way to define a distance again uses a graph-theoretic notion in a related structure, this time the ''collinearity graph'' of the incidence structure. The vertices of the collinearity graph are the points of the incidence structure and two points are joined if there exists a line incident with both points. The distance between two points of the incidence structure can then be defined as their distance in the collinearity graph.

When distance is considered in an incidence structure, it is necessary to mention how it is being defined.

== Partial linear spaces ==
Incidence structures that are most studied are those that satisfy some additional properties (axioms), such as [[projective plane]]s, [[Affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine planes]], [[generalized polygon]]s, [[partial geometry|partial geometries]] and [[near polygon]]s. Very general incidence structures can be obtained by imposing "mild" conditions, such as:

A [[partial linear space]] is an incidence structure for which the following axioms are true:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorhouse|loc=pg.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every pair of distinct points determines at most one line.
* Every line contains at least two distinct points.

In a partial linear space it is also true that every pair of distinct lines meet in at most one point. This statement does not have to be assumed as it is readily proved from axiom one above.

Further constraints are provided by the regularity conditions:

'''RLk''': Each line is incident with the same number of points. If finite this number is often denoted by {{math|''k''}}.

'''RPr''': Each point is incident with the same number of lines. If finite this number is often denoted by {{math|''r''}}.

The second axiom of a partial linear space implies that {{math|''k'' &gt; 1}}. Neither regularity condition implies the other, so it has to be assumed that {{math|''r'' &gt; 1}}.

A finite partial linear space satisfying both regularity conditions with {{math|''k'', ''r'' &gt; 1}} is called a ''tactical configuration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors refer to these simply as ''[[configuration (geometry)|configurations]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A common notation refers to {{math|(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}-''configurations''. In the special case where {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''}} (and hence, {{math|1=''r'' = ''k''}}) the notation {{math|(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is often simply written as {{math|(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

[[File:Sample Incidence.jpg|thumb|Simplest non-trivial linear space]]

A [[Linear space (geometry)|''linear space'']] is a partial linear space such that:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorhouse|loc=pg. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every pair of distinct points determines exactly one line.

Some authors add a "non-degeneracy" (or "non-triviality") axiom to the definition of a (partial) linear space, such as:

* There exist at least two distinct lines.&lt;ref&gt;There are several alternatives for this "non-triviality" axiom. This could be replaced by "there exist three points not on the same line" as is done in {{harvtxt|Batten|Beutelspacher|1993|loc=pg. 1}}. There are other choices, but they must always be ''existence'' statements that rule out the very simple cases to exclude.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is used to rule out some very small examples (mainly when the sets {{math|''P''}} or {{math|''L''}} have fewer than two elements) that would normally be exceptions to general statements made about the incidence structures. An alternative to adding the axiom is to refer to incidence structures that do not satisfy the axiom as being ''trivial'' and those that do as ''non-trivial''.

Each non-trivial linear space contains at least three points and three lines, so the simplest non-trivial linear space that can exist is a triangle.

A linear space having at least three points on every line is a [[Sylvester–Gallai configuration|Sylvester–Gallai design]].

== Fundamental geometric examples ==
Some of the basic concepts and terminology arises from geometric examples, particularly [[projective plane]]s and [[Affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine planes]].

===Projective planes===
{{main|projective plane}}
A ''projective plane'' is a linear space in which:
* Every pair of distinct lines meet in exactly one point,
and that satisfies the non-degeneracy condition:
* There exist four points, no three of which are [[collinear]].

There is a [[bijection]] between {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''L''}} in a projective plane. If {{math|''P''}} is a finite set, the projective plane is referred to as a ''finite'' projective plane. The '''order''' of a finite projective plane is {{math|1=''n'' = ''k'' – 1}}, that is, one less than the number of points on a line. All known projective planes have orders that are [[prime power]]s. A projective plane of order {{math|''n''}} is an {{math|((''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n'' + 1)&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} configuration.

The smallest projective plane has order two and is known as the ''Fano plane''.
[[File:Fano plane.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Projective plane of order 2 &lt;br&gt; the Fano plane&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Fano plane ====
{{main|Fano plane}}

This famous incidence geometry was developed by the Italian mathematician [[Gino Fano]]. In his work&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=G.|last=Fano|title=Sui postulati fondamentali della geometria proiettiva|year=1892|journal=Giornale di Matematiche|volume= 30|pages=106–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; on proving the independence of the set of axioms for [[Projective space|projective ''n''-space]] that he developed,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collino|Conte|Verra|2013|loc=p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; he produced a finite three-dimensional space with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes, in which each line had only three points on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malkevitch}} Finite Geometries? an AMS Featured Column&lt;/ref&gt; The planes in this space consisted of seven points and seven lines and are now known as [[Fano plane]]s.

The Fano plane cannot be represented in the [[Euclidean plane]] using only points and straight line segments (i.e., it is not realizable). This is a consequence of the [[Sylvester–Gallai theorem]], according to which every realizable incidence geometry must include an ''ordinary line'', a line containing only two points. The Fano plane has no such line (that is, it is a [[Sylvester–Gallai configuration]]), so it is not realizable.{{sfnp|Aigner|Ziegler|2010}}

A [[complete quadrangle]] consists of four points, no three of which are collinear. In the Fano plane, the three points not on a complete quadrangle are the diagonal points of that quadrangle and are collinear. This contradicts the ''Fano axiom'', often used as an axiom for the Euclidean plane, which states that the three diagonal points of a complete quadrangle are never collinear.

===Affine planes===

{{main|affine plane (incidence geometry)}}

An ''affine plane'' is a linear space satisfying:
* For any point {{math|''A''}} and line {{math|''l''}} not incident with it (an '''anti-flag''') there is exactly one line {{math|''m''}} incident with {{math|''A''}} (that is, {{math|''A'' I ''m''}}), that does not meet {{math|''l''}} (known as [[Playfair's axiom]]),
and satisfying the non-degeneracy condition:
* There exists a triangle, i.e. three non-collinear points.

The lines {{math|''l''}} and {{math|''m''}} in the statement of Playfair's axiom are said to be ''parallel''. Every affine plane can be uniquely extended to a projective plane. The ''order'' of a finite affine plane is {{math|''k''}}, the number of points on a line. An affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} is an {{math|((''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;, (''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} configuration.
[[File:Hesse configuration.svg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Affine plane of order 3 &lt;br&gt; (Hesse configuration)&lt;/center&gt;]]

====Hesse configuration====
{{main|Hesse configuration}}

The affine plane of order three is a {{math|(9&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 12&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} configuration. When embedded in some ambient space it is called the '''[[Hesse configuration]]'''. It is not realizable in the Euclidean plane but is realizable in the [[complex projective plane]] as the nine [[inflection point]]s of an [[elliptic curve]] with the 12 lines incident with triples of these.

The 12 lines can be partitioned into four classes of three lines apiece where, in each class the lines are mutually disjoint. These classes are called ''parallel classes'' of lines. Adding four new points, each being added to all the lines of a single parallel class (so all of these lines now intersect), and one new line containing just these four new points produces the projective plane of order three, a {{math|(13&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}} configuration. Conversely, starting with the projective plane of order three (it is unique) and removing any single line and all the points on that line produces this affine plane of order three (it is also unique).

Removing one point and the four lines that pass through that point (but not the other points on them) produces the {{math|(8&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} [[Mobius-Kantor configuration|Möbius–Kantor configuration]].

==Partial geometries==
[[File:GQ(2,2), the Doily.svg|thumb|Partial geometry pg(2,2,1)]]
{{main|Partial geometry}}

Given an integer {{math|''α'' ≥ 1}}, a tactical configuration satisfying:
* For every anti-flag {{math|(''B'', ''m'')}} there are {{math|''α''}} flags {{math|(''A'', ''l'')}} such that {{math|''B'' I ''l''}} and {{math|''A'' I ''m''}},
is called a ''partial geometry''. If there are {{math|''s'' + 1}} points on a line and {{math|''t'' + 1}} lines through a point, the notation for a partial geometry is {{math|pg(''s'', ''t'', ''α'')}}.

If {{math|1=''α'' = 1}} these partial geometries are [[generalized quadrangle]]s.

If {{math|1=''α'' = ''s'' +  1}} these are called [[Steiner system]]s.

==Generalized polygons==
{{main|Generalized polygon}}

For {{math|''n'' &gt; 2}},&lt;ref&gt;The use of {{math|''n''}} in the name is standard and should not be confused with the number of points in a configuration.&lt;/ref&gt; a '''generalized {{math|''n''}}-gon''' is a partial linear space whose incidence graph {{math|Γ}} has the property:
* The [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]] of {{math|Γ}} (length of the shortest [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]) is twice the [[Diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] of {{math|Γ}} (the largest distance between two vertices, {{math|''n''}} in this case).

A ''generalized 2-gon'' is an incidence structure, which is not a partial linear space, consisting of at least two points and two lines with every point being incident with every line. The incidence graph of a generalized 2-gon is a complete bipartite graph.

A generalized {{math|''n''}}-gon contains no [[Polygon|ordinary {{math|''m''}}-gon]] for {{math|2 ≤ ''m'' &lt; ''n''}} and for every pair of objects (two points, two lines or a point and a line) there is an ordinary {{math|''n''}}-gon that contains them both.

Generalized 3-gons are projective planes. Generalized 4-gons are called [[generalized quadrangle]]s. By the Feit-Higman theorem the only finite generalized {{math|''n''}}-gons with at least three points per line and three lines per point have {{math|''n''}} = 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8.

==Near polygons==
{{main|Near polygon}}
For a non-negative integer {{math|''d''}} a '''near {{math|2''d''}}-gon''' is an incidence structure such that:
* The maximum distance (as measured in the collinearity graph) between two points is {{math|''d''}}, and
* For every point {{math|''X''}} and line {{math|''l''}} there is a unique point on {{math|''l''}} that is closest to {{math|''X''}}.

A near 0-gon is a point, while a near 2-gon is a line. The collinearity graph of a near 2-gon is a [[complete graph]]. A near 4-gon is a generalized quadrangle (possibly degenerate). Every finite generalized polygon except the projective planes is a near polygon. Any connected bipartite graph is a near polygon and any near polygon with precisely two points per line is a connected bipartite graph. Also, all [[Polar space|dual polar spaces]] are near polygons.

Many near polygons are related to [[finite simple groups]] like the [[Mathieu group]]s and the [[Janko group J2]]. Moreover, the generalized 2''d''-gons, which are related to [[Groups of Lie type]], are special cases of near 2''d''-gons.

==Möbius planes==
{{main|Möbius plane}}
An abstract Mōbius plane (or inversive plane) is an incidence structure where, to avoid possible confusion with the terminology of the classical case, the lines are referred to as ''cycles'' or ''blocks''.

Specifically, a Möbius plane is an incidence structure of points and cycles such that:
* Every triple of distinct points is incident with precisely one cycle.
* For any flag {{math|(''P'', ''z'')}} and any point {{math|''Q''}} not incident with {{math|''z''}} there is a unique cycle {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{math|''P'' I ''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Q'' I ''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|1=''z'' ∩ ''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; =  {''P''}}}. (The cycles are said to ''touch'' at {{math|''P''}}.)
* Every cycle has at least three points and there exists at least one cycle.

The incidence structure obtained at any point {{math|''P''}} of a Möbius plane by taking as points all the points other than {{math|''P''}} and as lines only those cycles that contain {{math|''P''}} (with {{math|''P''}} removed), is an affine plane. This structure is called the ''residual'' at {{math|''P''}} in design theory.

A finite Möbius plane of ''order'' {{math|''m''}} is a tactical configuration with {{math|1=''k'' = ''m'' + 1}} points per cycle that is a [[block design|3-design]], specifically a {{math|3-(''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, ''m'' + 1, 1)}} block design.

== Line–Line matrix ==
The line–line matrix indicates the number of common points for each line-pair. The line–line matrix for the Fano plane is:

[[File:Fano Line.jpg|center]]

The line–line matrix can be obtained from the incidence matrix. If ''N'' is the incidence matrix and ''N&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the transpose of the incidence matrix, then the line–line matrix is the matrix product, ''L'' = ''N&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'' × ''N''.

== Point–Point matrix ==
The point–point matrix indicates the number of lines common to each point-pair. The point–point matrix for the Fano plane is as follows:

[[File:Fano Point.jpg|center]]

The point–point matrix can also be derived from the incidence matrix. If ''N'' is the incidence matrix and ''N&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the transpose of the incidence matrix, then the point–point matrix is the product ''P'' = ''N'' × ''N&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''.
--&gt;

==Incidence theorems in the Euclidean plane==

===The Sylvester-Gallai theorem===
{{main|Sylvester-Gallai theorem}}
A question raised by [[J.J. Sylvester]] in 1893 and finally settled by [[Tibor Gallai]] concerned incidences of a finite set of points in the Euclidean plane.

'''Theorem (Sylvester-Gallai)''': A finite set of points in the Euclidean plane is either [[collinear]] or there exists a line incident with exactly two of the points.

A line containing exactly two of the points is called an ''ordinary line'' in this context. Sylvester was probably led to the question while pondering about the embeddability of the Hesse configuration.

=== The de Bruijn–Erdős theorem ===
{{main|De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (incidence geometry)}}

A related result is the [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (incidence geometry)|de Bruijn–Erdős theorem]]. [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]] and [[Paul Erdős]] proved the result in the more general setting of projective planes, but it still holds in the Euclidean plane. The theorem is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/about/author.html Weisstein, Eric W.], [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/deBruijn-ErdosTheorem.html "de Bruijn–Erdős Theorem"] from [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ MathWorld]&lt;/ref&gt;

::In a [[projective plane]], every non-collinear set of {{math|''n''}} points determines at least {{math|''n''}} distinct lines.

As the authors pointed out, since their proof was combinatorial, the result holds in a larger setting, in fact in any incidence geometry in which there is a unique line through every pair of distinct points. They also mention that the Euclidean plane version can be proved from the Sylvester-Gallai theorem using [[Mathematical induction|induction]].

===The Szemerédi–Trotter theorem ===
{{main|Szemerédi–Trotter theorem}}

A bound on the number of flags determined by a finite set of points and the lines they determine is given by:

'''Theorem (Szemerédi–Trotter)''': given {{math|''n''}}  points and {{math|''m''}} lines in the plane, the number of flags (incident point-line pairs) is:

:&lt;math&gt;O \left ( n^{\frac{2}{3}} m^{\frac{2}{3}} + n + m \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

and this bound cannot be improved, except in terms of the implicit constants.

This result can be used to prove Beck's theorem.

===Beck's theorem===
{{main|Beck's theorem (geometry)}}

Beck's theorem says that finite collections of points in the plane fall into one of two extremes; one where a large fraction of points lie on a single line, and one where a large number of lines are needed to connect all the points.

The theorem asserts the existence of positive constants {{math|''C'', ''K''}} such that given any {{math|''n''}} points in the plane, at least one of the following statements is true:

# There is a line that contains at least {{sfrac|''n''|''C''}} of the points.
# There exist at least {{sfrac|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''K''}} lines, each of which contains at least two of the points.

In Beck's original argument, {{math|''C''}} is 100 and {{math|''K''}} is an unspecified constant; it is not known what the optimal values of {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''K''}} are.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], an '''induced topology''' on a [[topological space]] is a [[topology]] which makes the inducing [[Function_(mathematics)|function]] [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]] from/to this topological space.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X_0, X_1&lt;/math&gt; be sets, &lt;math&gt;f:X_0\to X_1&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt; is a topology on &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;, then a '''topology coinduced on''' &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; '''by''' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{U_1\subseteq X_1 | f^{-1}(U_1)\in\tau_0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; is a topology on &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;, then a '''topology induced on''' &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; '''by''' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{f^{-1}(U_1) | U_1\in\tau_1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The easy way to remember the definitions above is to notice that finding an [[inverse image]] is used in both. This is because inverse image preserves [[union (set theory)|union]] and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. Finding a [[direct image]] does not preserve intersection in general. Here is an example where this becomes a hurdle. Consider a set &lt;math&gt;X_0=\{-2, -1, 1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt; with a topology &lt;math&gt;\{\{-2, -1\}, \{1, 2\}\}&lt;/math&gt;, a set &lt;math&gt;X_1=\{-1, 0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;f:X_0\to X_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(-2)=-1, f(-1)=0, f(1)=0, f(2)=1&lt;/math&gt;. A set of subsets &lt;math&gt;\tau_1=\{f(U_0)|U_0\in\tau_0\}&lt;/math&gt; is not a topology, because &lt;math&gt;\{\{-1, 0\}, \{0, 1\}\} \subseteq \tau_1&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\{-1, 0\} \cap \{0, 1\} \notin \tau_1&lt;/math&gt;.

There are equivalent definitions below.

A topology &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; coinduced on &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[finest topology]] such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] &lt;math&gt;(X_0, \tau_0) \to (X_1, \tau_1)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a particular case of the [[final topology]] on &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;.

A topology &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt; induced on &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coarsest topology]] such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] &lt;math&gt;(X_0, \tau_0) \to (X_1, \tau_1)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a particular case of the [[initial topology]] on &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==

* The [[quotient topology]] is the topology coinduced by the quotient map.
* If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an [[inclusion map]], then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; induces on &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; a [[subspace topology]].

The IWOTA meetings provide opportunities for participants (including young [[research]]ers) to present their own work in invited and contributed talks, to interact with other [[research]]ers from around the globe, and to broaden their knowledge of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/201501/rnoti-p74.pdf#page=4 | title = Notices of the American Mathematical Society | series = Vol. 62, No. 1 | date = 2015 | page = 4 | publisher = [[American Mathematical Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition, IWOTA emphasizes cross-disciplinary interaction among [[mathematician]]s, [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] and [[Mathematical physics|mathematical physicists]]. In the even years, the IWOTA workshop is a satellite meeting to the biennial International Symposium on the Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS).&lt;ref name="mtns"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Levan, N. | title=International Symposium on Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems : August 5-7, 1981, Miramar-Sheraton Hotel, Santa Monica, California | publisher=Western Periodicals Co | location=North Hollywood, California | year=1981 | page=iii | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rJQAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the humble beginnings in the early 80's,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the IWOTA workshops grew to become one of the largest continuing conferences attended by the community of researchers in [[operator theory]].&lt;ref name="image"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ilasic.org/IMAGE/IMAGES/image52.pdf#page=35|title = IMAGE, the Bulletin of the International Linear Algebra Society | date=2014| page=35 | publisher=International Linear Algebra Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of IWOTA==

===First IWOTA Meeting===
The International Workshop on Operator Theory and its Applications was started on August 1, 1981,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; adjacent to the International Symposium on Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS)&lt;ref name="mtns" /&gt; with goal of exposing [[operator theory|operator theorists]] even [[Pure mathematics|pure]] ones to recent developments in [[engineering]] (especially ''[[H-infinity methods in control theory]]'') which had a great intersection with [[operator theory]]. [[Israel Gohberg]] was the visionary and driving force of IWOTA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Langer |first=Heinz |editor1 = Bart, Harm | editor2 = Hempfling, Thomas | editor3 = Kaashoek, Marinus A. | title = Israel Gohberg and Friends: On the Occasion of his 80th Birthday|pages=249–252 |chapter=VI.2. The Vienna University of Technology at Vienna, Austria | publisher = [[Birkhäuser | Birkhäuser Verlag]]| location = Basel| isbn = 9783764387334 | url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783764387334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and president of the IWOTA Steering Committee. From the beginning, J. W. Helton and M. A. Kaashoek served as vice presidents of the steering committee.

===West Meets East===
Besides the excitement of mathematical discovery over the decades at IWOTA, there was great excitement when the [[Iron Curtain|curtain]] between [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]] and Western operator theorists fell. Until 1990, these two collections of extremely strong mathematicians seldom met due to the tight [[Human rights in the Soviet Union#Freedom of movement|restrictions on travel]] from and in the [[Communist state|communist countries]]. When the [[Iron Curtain|curtain]] dropped, the western mathematicians knew the classic Soviet papers but had a spotty knowledge of much of what else their counterparts were doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Landau |first=Henry J. |editor1 = Bart, Harm | editor2 = Hempfling, Thomas | editor3 = Kaashoek, Marinus A. | title = Israel Gohberg and Friends: On the Occasion of his 80th Birthday|pages=309–310 |chapter=To Israel |   publisher = [[Birkhäuser | Birkhäuser Verlag]]| location = Basel| isbn = 9783764387334 | url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783764387334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Gohberg|Gohberg]] was one of the operator theorists who knew both sides and he guided IWOTA, a western institution, in bringing (and funding) many prominent [[Post-Soviet states|FSU bloc]] operator theorists to speak at the meetings. As the IWOTA programs demonstrate,&lt;ref name = "program"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.gmu.ge/iwota2015/Files/Program_IWOTA_2015.pdf | title=IWOTA-2015 Program | date=2015 | publisher=Georgian Mathematical Union, [[Georgian National Academy of Sciences]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; this significantly accelerated the cultures' mutual assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;

===IWOTA Proceedings===
[[Proceedings]] of the IWOTA workshops appear in the [[Springer Science+Business Media|''Springer'']] / [[Birkhäuser|''Birkhäuser Verlag'']] book series ''Operator Theory: Advances and Applications (OTAA)''&lt;ref name="OTAA" /&gt; (founder: [[Israel Gohberg]]). While [[engineering]] conference [[proceedings]] often are handed to participants as they arrive and contain short papers on each conference talk, the IWOTA [[proceedings]] follow [[Academic conference|mathematics conference]] tradition and contain a modest number of papers and are published several years after the conference.

===Funding Sources===
IWOTA has received support from many sources, including the [[National Science Foundation]]&lt;ref name="NSF0126746" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSF0536873" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Travel Support for IWOTA 2004 | url = https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0422952&amp;HistoricalAwards=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The IWOTA Steering Committee==
IWOTA is directed by a steering committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = International Workshop on Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA)| url = http://math.wustl.edu/~iwota}}&lt;/ref&gt; which chooses the site for the next meeting, elects the chief local organizer(s) and insures the appearance of the enduring themes of IWOTA. The sub-themes of an IWOTA workshop and the lecturers are chosen by the local organizing committee after hearing the steering committee's board. The board consists of its vice presidents: Joseph A. Ball, J. William Helton (Chair), M. A. Kaashoek, Igor Klep, Christiane Tretter, Victor Vinnikov and Hugo J. Woerdeman. In addition, past chief organizers who remain active in IWOTA are members of the steering committee. The board governs IWOTA with consultation and the consent of the full steering committee. Honorary members of the steering committee, elected in 2016, are: Israel Gohberg (deceased), Leiba Rodman (deceased), Tsuyoshi Ando, Harry Dym,  Ciprian Foiaş, Heinz Langer, Nikolai Nikolski.

==Future IWOTA Meetings==
* IWOTA 2019 will be held at the [[University of Lisbon]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. Main organizer is Amélia Bastos. Dates are July 22-26, 2019
* IWOTA 2020 will be held at [[Lancaster University]] in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[United Kingdom]]. Main organizer is Gordon Blower. Dates are August 17-21, 2020

==Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture==

The Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture was introduced in August 2016 and honors the legacy of Israel Gohberg, whose research crossed borders between operator theory, linear algebra, and related fields. This lecture is in collaboration with the International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS)| url = http://www.ilasic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series of lectures will be delivered at IWOTA and ILAS Conferences, in different years, in the approximate ratio two-thirds at IWOTA and one-third at ILAS. The first three lectures will take place at IWOTA 2020, ILAS 2022, and IWOTA 2024. Donations for the Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture Fund are most welcome and can be submitted via the ILAS donation form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS) donation form | url = http://ilasic.org/misc/donationform.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations are tax deductible in the United States.

'''Jacobus Hendricus ("Jack") van Lint''' (1 September 1932 – 28 September 2004) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] mathematician, [[professor]] at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], of which he was [[rector magnificus]] from 1991 till 1996.

He gained his Ph.D. from [[Utrecht University]] in 1957 under the supervision of [[Fred van der Blij]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=51426}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was professor of mathematics at [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] from 1959 to 1997.

He was appointed a full professor at [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] at the age of 26 years. His field of research was initially [[number theory]], but he worked mainly in [[combinatorics]] and [[coding theory]].&lt;ref&gt;B. van Asch, A. Blokhuis, H. Hollmann, W. Kantor, H. van Tilborg, Jack van Lint (1932-2004): A survey of his scientific work,
''[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]]'', Series A, 113 (2006), 1594-1613&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Lint was honored with a great number of awards. He became a member of [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001629 |title=Jacob Hendricus van Lint (1932 - 2004) |language=Dutch |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; received four honorary doctorates, was an honorary member of the Royal Netherlands Mathematics Society (Koninklijk Wiskundig Genootschap), and received a [[Knighthood]].

The '''KOI-18''' is a hand-held [[paper tape]] reader developed by the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] as a  [[fill device]] for loading [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]], or "crypto variables," into security devices, such as [[encryption]] systems. It can read 8-level paper or [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET]] tape, which is manually pulled through the reader slot by the operator. It is battery powered and has no internal storage, so it can load keys of different lengths, including the 128-bit keys used by more modern systems. The KOI-18 can also be used to load keys into other fill devices that do have internal storage, such as the [[KYK-13]] and [[AN/CYZ-10]]. The KOI-18 only supports the DS-102 interface.

A similar device was developed by Prof. [[Jean-Daniel Nicoud]] for the [[Smaky]] 4 in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/core/backissues/pdf/core_3_1.pdf CORE 3.1, Computer History Museum, February 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103023359/http://www.computerhistory.org/core/backissues/pdf/core_3_1.pdf |date=2013-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smaky.ch/chapitre.php?id=lami_4 Smaky.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">In [[probability theory]], '''Kolmogorov's Three-Series Theorem''', named after [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], gives a criterion for the [[almost sure]] [[convergence of random variables|convergence]] of an [[infinite series]] of [[random variable]]s in terms of the convergence of three different series involving properties of their [[probability distribution]]s. Kolmogorov's three-series theorem, combined with [[Kronecker's lemma]], can be used to give a relatively easy proof of the [[Strong Law of Large Numbers#Strong law|Strong Law of Large Numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Durrett, Rick.

== Statement of the theorem ==

Let (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; be [[independent random variables]]. The random series ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''=1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; [[convergence of random variables|converges]] [[almost surely]] in ℝ if and only if the following conditions hold for some A &gt; 0:

'''i.'''   ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;[[File:U+2119.svg|9px]](|X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;| &amp;ge; A) converges

'''ii.'''  Let Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:= X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;{|X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;| &amp;le; A}&lt;/sub&gt;, then ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;E(Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;),  the series of [[expected value]]s of Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; , converges

'''iii.'''  ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;var(Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) converges

== Proof ==

=== Sufficiency of conditions ("if") ===

Condition (i) and [[Borel–Cantelli]] give that [[almost surely]] X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for n large, hence ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; converges if and only if ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; converges. Conditions (ii)-(iii) and [[Kolmogorov's Two-Series Theorem]] give the almost sure convergence of ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Necessity of conditions ("only if") ===

Suppose that ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; converges almost surely.

Without condition (i), by Borel–Cantelli there would exist some A &gt; 0 such that almost surely {|X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;| &amp;ge; A} for infinitely many values n, but then the series would diverge. Therefore, we must have condition (i).

We see that condition (iii) implies condition (ii): [[Kolmogorov's two-series theorem]] along with condition (i) applied to the case A = 1 gives the convergence of ∑&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;#120124;(Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)). So given the convergence of ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, we have ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#120124;(Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)  converges, so condition (ii) is implied.

Thus, it only remains to demonstrate the necessity of condition (iii), and we will have obtained the full result. It is equivalent to check condition (iii) for the series ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; Y'&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) where for each n, Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and Y'&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are [[IID]]—that is, to employ the assumption that  &amp;#120124;(Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0, since Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a sequence of random variables bounded by 2, converging almost surely, and with &amp;#120141;ar(Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = 2&amp;#120141;ar(Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). So we wish to check that if ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; converges, ∑&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n=1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#120141;ar(Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) converges as well. This is a special case of a more general result from [[martingale theory]] with summands equal to the increments of a [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] sequence and the same conditions (&amp;#120124;(Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0, series of the [[variance]]s converging, summands [[Bounded set|bounded]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Rongfeng. Lecture notes. http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~matsr/ProbI/Lecture4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Loève, "Probability theory", Princeton Univ. Press (1963) pp. Sect. 16.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Feller, "An introduction to probability theory and its applications", 2, Wiley (1971) pp. Sect. IX.9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
As an illustration of the theorem, consider the example of the ''[[Harmonic series (mathematics)#Random harmonic series|harmonic series with random signs]]'':
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^\infty \pm \frac{1}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here, "&lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt;" means that each term &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; is taken with a random sign that is either &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; with respective probabilities &lt;math&gt;1/2,\ 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and all random signs are chosen independently. Letting &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; in the theorem denote a random variable that takes the values &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1/n&lt;/math&gt; with equal probabilities, one can check easily that the conditions of the theorem are satisfied, so it follows that the harmonic series with random signs converges almost surely. On the other hand, the analogous series of (for example) square root reciprocals with random signs, namely
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^\infty \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},&lt;/math&gt;

''diverges'' almost surely, since condition (3) in the theorem is not satisfied. Note that this is different from the behavior of the analogous series with ''alternating'' signs, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, which does converge.

'''Molecular symmetry''' in [[chemistry]] describes the [[symmetry]] present in [[molecule]]s and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry.  Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry, as it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's [[chemical property|chemical properties]], such as its [[molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] and its allowed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic transitions]]. Many university level textbooks on [[physical chemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], and [[inorganic chemistry]] devote a chapter to symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Chemistry'', Third Edition John P. Lowe, Kirk Peterson {{ISBN|0-12-457551-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach'' by Donald A. McQuarrie, John D.

The predominant framework for the study of molecular symmetry is [[group theory]]. Symmetry is useful in the study of [[molecular orbital]]s, with applications such as the [[Hückel method]], [[ligand field theory]], and the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rule]]s. Another framework on a larger scale is the use of [[crystal system]]s to describe [[crystallography|crystallographic]] symmetry in bulk materials.  
 
Many techniques for the practical assessment of molecular symmetry exist, including [[X-ray crystallography]] and various forms of [[spectroscopy]]. [[Spectroscopic notation]] is based on symmetry considerations.

=== Elements ===
The point group symmetry of a molecule can be described by 5 types of [[symmetry element]]. 
{{anchor|axis}}
* '''Symmetry axis''': an axis around which a [[rotation]] by &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{360^\circ} {n} &lt;/math&gt; results in a molecule indistinguishable from the original.  This is also called an ''n''-fold '''rotational axis''' and abbreviated C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples are the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axis in [[water]] and the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis in [[ammonia]]. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest ''n'' is called the '''principal axis''', and by convention is aligned with the z-axis in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].
* '''Plane of symmetry''': a plane of reflection through which an identical copy of the original molecule is generated.  This is also called a [[mirror plane]] and abbreviated [[Sigma|σ]] (sigma = Greek "s", from the German 'Spiegel' meaning mirror).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newton.ex.ac.uk/research/qsystems/people/goss/symmetry/CharacterTables.html |title=Symmetry Operations and Character Tables  |last= |first= |date=2001 |website=University of Exeter |access-date=29 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water has two of them: one in the plane of the molecule itself and one [[perpendicular]] to it. A symmetry plane [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] with the principal axis is dubbed ''vertical'' (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and one perpendicular to it ''horizontal'' (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed [[Dihedral angle|dihedral]] (σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). A symmetry plane can also be identified by its Cartesian orientation, e.g., (xz) or (yz).
* '''Center of symmetry''' or '''inversion center''', abbreviated ''i''.  A molecule has a center of symmetry when, for any atom in the molecule, an identical atom exists diametrically opposite this center an equal distance from it. In other words, a molecule has a center of symmetry when the points (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,-z) correspond to identical objects. For example, if there is an oxygen atom in some point (x,y,z), then there is an oxygen atom in the point (-x,-y,-z).  There may or may not be an atom at the inversion center itself.  Examples are [[xenon tetrafluoride]]  where the inversion center is at the Xe atom, and [[benzene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) where the inversion center is at the center of the ring.
* '''Rotation-reflection axis''': an axis around which a  rotation by &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{360^\circ} {n} &lt;/math&gt;, followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to it, leaves the molecule unchanged.  Also called  an ''n''-fold '''improper rotation axis''', it is abbreviated S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples are present in tetrahedral [[silicon tetrafluoride]], with three S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axes, and the [[staggered conformation]] of [[ethane]] with one S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; axis.
* '''Identity''', abbreviated to E, from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;lang=de&amp;searchLoc=0&amp;cmpType=relaxed&amp;sectHdr=on&amp;spellToler=on&amp;search=einheit&amp;relink=on LEO Ergebnisse für "einheit"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This symmetry element simply consists of no change: every molecule has this element. While this element seems physically trivial, it must be included in the list of symmetry elements so that they form a mathematical [[group (mathematics)|group]], whose definition requires inclusion of the identity element. It is so called because it is analogous to multiplying by one (unity). In other words, E is a property that any object needs to have regardless of its symmetry properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|last=Pfenning|first=Brian|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118859025|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operations ===
[[Image:Xenon-tetrafluoride-3D-vdW.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[xenon tetrafluoride|XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], with square planar geometry, has 1 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis and 4 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axes orthogonal to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. These five axes plus the mirror plane perpendicular to the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis define the D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry group of the molecule.]]  
The five symmetry elements have associated with them five types of '''[[symmetry operation]]''', which leave the molecule in a state indistinguishable from the starting state. They are sometimes distinguished from symmetry elements by a [[caret]] or [[circumflex]]. Thus, Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and Ê is the identity operation. A symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it. For example, the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis of the [[square planar molecular geometry|square]] [[xenon tetrafluoride]] (XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule is associated with two Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotations (90°) in opposite directions and a Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation (180°). Since Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to Ê, Ŝ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to σ and Ŝ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''î'',  all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations.

== Symmetry groups ==

===Groups===
The symmetry operations of a molecule (or other object) form a ''[[group (mathematics)|group]]'', which is a mathematical structure usually denoted in the form (''G'',*) consisting of a set  ''G''  and a binary combination operation say '*' satisfying certain properties listed below.

In a '''symmetry group''', the group elements are the symmetry operations (''not'' the symmetry elements), and the binary combination consists of applying first one symmetry operation and then the other. An example is the sequence of a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotation about the z-axis and a reflection in the xy-plane, denoted σ(xy)C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. By convention the order of operations is from right to left.

A symmetry group obeys the defining properties of any group.

(1) ''closure'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For every pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''G'', the ''product'' ''x''*''y'' is also in ''G''. &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  ( in symbols, for every two elements ''x'', ''y''∈''G'', ''x''*''y'' is also in ''G'' ). &lt;br&gt;This means that the group is ''closed'' so that combining two elements produces no new elements. Symmetry operations have this property because a sequence of two operations will produce a third state indistinguishable from the second and therefore from the first, so that the net effect on the molecule is still a symmetry operation.&lt;br&gt;
(2) ''associative'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For every ''x'' and ''y'' and ''z'' in ''G'', both (''x''*''y'')*''z'' and ''x''*(''y''*''z'')  result with the same element in ''G''.  &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, (''x''*''y'')*''z'' = ''x''*(''y''*''z'' ) for every ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' ∈ ''G'')&lt;br&gt;
(3) ''existence of identity'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
There must be an element ( say ''e'' ) in  ''G'' such that product any element of ''G'' with ''e'' make no change to the element.  &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, ''x''*''e''=''e''*''x''= ''x'' for every ''x''∈ ''G'' )&lt;br&gt;
(4) ''existence of inverse'' property: &lt;br&gt;   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For each element ( ''x'' ) in  ''G'', there must be an element ''y'' in  ''G'' such that product  of  ''x'' and ''y'' is the identity element ''e''. &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, for each  ''x''∈''G''  there is a ''y'' ∈ ''G'' such that ''x''*''y''=''y''*''x''= ''e'' for every ''x''∈''G'' )

The ''order'' of a group is the number of elements in the group. For groups of small orders, the group properties can be easily verified by considering its composition table, a table whose rows and columns correspond to elements of the group and whose entries correspond to their products.

===Point groups and permutation-inversion groups===
[[File:Pt Group chart 2.png|thumb|800px|Chart for determining Point Group]]
The successive application (or ''composition'') of one or more symmetry operations of a molecule has an effect equivalent to that of some single symmetry operation of the molecule. For example, a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation followed by a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reflection is seen to be a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;' symmetry operation: σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;*C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'. (Note that "Operation A followed by B to form C" is written BA = C).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, the set of all symmetry operations (including this composition operation) obeys all the properties of a group, given above. So (''S'',''*'') is a group, where ''S'' is the set of all symmetry operations of some molecule, and * denotes the composition (repeated application) of symmetry operations.

This group is called the [[point group]] of that molecule, because the set of symmetry operations leave at least one point fixed (though for some symmetries an entire axis or an entire plane remains fixed). In other words, a point group is a group that summarizes all symmetry operations that all molecules in that category have.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The symmetry of a crystal, by contrast, is described by a [[space group]] of symmetry operations, which includes [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] in space.

One can determine the symmetry operations of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one USES a point group, the operations in it are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the operations are interpreted as rotating and/or reflecting the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these operations commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. They are "symmetry operations" for that vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]&lt;ref name=Longuet-Higgins1963&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H.C. | year = 1963 | title = The symmetry groups of non-rigid molecules | url = | journal = Molecular Physics | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 445–460 | doi = 10.1080/00268976300100501 | bibcode = 1963MolPh...6..445L }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relation between point groups and permutation-inversion groups is explained in this pdf file [https://chemphys.ca/pbunker/PointGroupspdffile.html Link] .

===Examples of point groups===
Assigning each molecule a point group classifies molecules into categories with similar symmetry properties. For example, PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, POF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; all share identical symmetry operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-85910-0|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all can undergo the identity operation E, two different C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rotation operations, and three different σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; plane reflections without altering their identities, so they are placed in one point group, C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;, with order 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-85910-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) also share identical symmetry operations. They both undergo the identity operation E, one C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation, and two σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reflections without altering their identities, so they are both placed in one point group, C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;, with order 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miessler|first1=Gary|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780321811059}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification system helps scientists to study molecules more efficiently, since chemically related molecules in the same point group tend to exhibit similar bonding schemes, molecular bonding diagrams, and spectroscopic properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Representations ===

The symmetry operations can be [[group representation|represented in many ways]]. A convenient representation is by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. For any vector representing a point in Cartesian coordinates, left-multiplying it gives the new location of the point transformed by the symmetry operation. Composition of operations corresponds to matrix multiplication. Within a point group, a multiplication of the matrices of two symmetry operations leads to a matrix of another symmetry operation in the same point group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; example this is:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
     -1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 \\
      \end{bmatrix}
   }_{C_{2}} \times
 \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 }_{\sigma_{v}} = 
 \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
   -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 }_{\sigma'_{v}}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Although an infinite number of such representations exist, the [[irreducible representation]]s (or "irreps") of the group are commonly used, as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations.

== Character tables ==

{{Main|List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups}}

For each point group, a '''character table''' summarizes information on its symmetry operations and on its irreducible representations. As there are always equal numbers of irreducible representations and classes of symmetry operations, the tables are square.

The table itself consists of '''characters''' that represent how a particular irreducible representation transforms when a particular symmetry operation is applied.  Any symmetry operation in a molecule's point group acting on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged.  But, for acting on a general entity, such as a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] or an [[Atomic orbital|orbital]], this need not be the case.  The vector could change sign or direction, and the orbital could change type.  For simple point groups, the values are either 1 or &amp;minus;1: 1 means that the sign or phase (of the vector or orbital) is unchanged by the symmetry operation (''symmetric'') and &amp;minus;1 denotes a sign change (''asymmetric'').

The representations are labeled according to a set of conventions:

* A, when rotation around the principal axis is symmetrical
* B, when rotation around the principal axis is asymmetrical
* E and T are doubly and triply degenerate representations, respectively
* when the point group has an inversion center, the subscript g ({{lang-de|gerade}} or even) signals no change in sign, and the subscript u (''ungerade'' or uneven) a change in sign, with respect to inversion.
* with point groups C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt; the symbols are borrowed from [[angular momentum]] description: [[sigma|Σ]], [[Pi (letter)|Π]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]].

The tables also capture information about how the Cartesian basis vectors, rotations about them, and quadratic functions of them transform by the symmetry operations of the group, by noting which irreducible representation transforms in the same way.  These indications are conventionally on the righthand side of the tables.  This information is useful because chemically important orbitals (in particular ''p'' and ''d'' orbitals) have the same symmetries as these entities.

The character table for the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry point group is given below:

{| class="wikitable" 
 ! C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; || E || C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;(xz) || σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'(yz) || || 
 |-
 | A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || ''z'' 
 | ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
 |-
 | A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || &amp;minus;1 || R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; || ''xy''
 |-
 | B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || ''x'', R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; || ''xz''
 |-
 | B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || &amp;minus;1 || 1 || ''y'', R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; || ''yz''
|}
 
Consider the example of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which has the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry described above.  The 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; [[atomic orbital|orbital]] of oxygen has B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry as in the fourth row of the character table above, with x in the sixth column). It is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switches sign with a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'(yz) operation, but remains unchanged with the other two operations (obviously, the character for the identity operation is always +1). This orbital's character set is thus {1, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1}, corresponding to the B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; irreducible representation. Likewise, the 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is seen to have the symmetry of the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; irreducible representation (''i.e''.: none of the symmetry operations change it), 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the  3''d''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; orbital A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  These assignments and others are noted in the rightmost two columns of the table.

== Historical background ==

[[Hans Bethe]] used characters of point group operations in his study of [[ligand field theory]] in 1929, and [[Eugene Wigner]] used group theory to explain the selection rules of [[atomic spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Group Theory and its application to the quantum mechanics of atomic spectra'', E. P. Wigner, Academic Press Inc. (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The first character tables were compiled by [[László Tisza]] (1933), in connection to vibrational spectra. [[Robert Mulliken]] was the first to publish character tables in English (1933), and [[E. Bright Wilson]] used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational [[normal mode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Correcting Two Long-Standing Errors in Point Group Symmetry Character Tables'' Randall B. Shirts [[J. Chem. Educ.]] 2007, 84, 1882. [http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2007/Nov/abs1882.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The complete set of 32 crystallographic point groups was published in 1936 by Rosenthal and Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenthal | first1 = Jenny E. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. M. | year = 1936 | title = Group Theory and the Vibrations of Polyatomic Molecules | url = | journal = Rev. Mod. Phys. | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 317–346 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.8.317 | bibcode=1936RvMP....8..317R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular nonrigidity==
{{See also|Fluxional molecule}}
Point groups are useful for describing ''rigid'' molecules which undergo only small oscillations about a single equilibrium geometry, and for which the distorting effects of molecular rotation can be ignored, so that the symmetry operations all correspond to simple geometrical operations. However [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]] has introduced a more general type of symmetry group suitable not only for rigid molecules but also for ''non-rigid'' molecules that tunnel between equivalent geometries (called ''versions'') and which can also allow for the distorting effects of molecular rotation.&lt;ref name=Longuet-Higgins1963/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen (2005), ''Fundamentals of Molecular Symmetry'' (Institute of Physics Publishing) {{ISBN|0-7503-0941-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are known as ''permutation-inversion'' groups, because the symmetry operations in them are energetically feasible permutations of identical nuclei, or  inversion  with respect to the center of mass, or a combination of the two.

For example, [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) has three equivalent [[staggered conformation]]s. Tunneling between the conformations occurs at ordinary temperatures by ''internal rotation'' of one [[methyl group]] relative to the other. This is not a rotation of the entire molecule about the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis. Although each conformation has D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, as in the table above, description of the internal rotation and associated quantum states and energy levels requires the more complete permutation-inversion group G&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;.

Similarly, [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has two equivalent pyramidal (C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;) conformations which are interconverted by the process known as [[nitrogen inversion]]. This is not an inversion in the sense used for point group symmetry operations of rigid molecules (i.e., the inversion of vibrational displacements and electronic coordinates in the center of mass) since NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has no inversion center. Rather it the inversion of all nuclei and electrons in the center of mass (close to the nitrogen atom), which happens to be energetically feasible for this molecule. The appropriate permutation-inversion group to be used in this situation is D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;(M) which is isomorphic with the point group D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;.

Additionally, as examples, the [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; molecules have highly symmetric equilibrium structures with T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; point group symmetries respectively; they lack permanent electric dipole moments but they do have very weak pure rotation spectra because of rotational
centrifugal distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.K.G | year = 1971 | title = Forbidden rotational spectra of polyatomic molecules | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 546-544 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(71)90255-4 | bibcode = 1971JMoSp..40..536W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Oldani | first = M.|display-authors=etal | year = 1985 | title =Pure rotational spectra of methane and methane-d4 in the vibrational ground state observed by microwave Fourier transform spectroscopy| url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 110 | issue = 1| pages = 93-105 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(85)90215-2 | bibcode = 1985JMoSp.110...93O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permutation-inversion groups required for the complete study of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;(M) and D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;(M), respectively.

A second and less general approach to the symmetry of nonrigid molecules is due to Altmann.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann S.L. (1977) ''Induced Representations in Crystals and Molecules'', Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flurry&gt;Flurry, R.L. (1980) ''Symmetry Groups'', Prentice-Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-880013-8}}, pp.115-127&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach the symmetry groups are known as ''Schrödinger supergroups'' and consist of two types of operations (and their combinations): (1) the geometric symmetry operations (rotations, reflections, inversions) of rigid molecules, and (2) ''isodynamic operations'', which take a nonrigid molecule into an energetically equivalent form by a physically  reasonable process such as rotation about a single bond (as in ethane) or a molecular inversion (as in ammonia).&lt;ref name=Flurry/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''n'' conjecture}}
In [[number theory]] the '''''n'' conjecture''' is a conjecture stated by {{Harvtxt|Browkin|Brzeziński|1994}} as a generalization of the [[abc conjecture|''abc'' conjecture]] to more than three integers.

==Formulations==

Given &lt;math&gt; {n \ge 3}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n \in \mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy three conditions:
: (i) &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)=1&lt;/math&gt;
: (ii) &lt;math&gt; {a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n=0}&lt;/math&gt;
: (iii) no proper subsum of &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt; {0}&lt;/math&gt;

'''First formulation'''

The ''n'' conjecture states that for every &lt;math&gt; {\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a constant &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt;, depending on &lt;math&gt; {n} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; {\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt;, such that:
&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{max}(|a_1|,|a_2|,...,|a_n|)&lt; C_{n,\varepsilon}\operatorname{rad}(|a_1| \cdot |a_2| \cdot ... \cdot |a_n|)^{2n - 5 + \varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{rad}(m)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[radical of an integer|radical]] of the integer &lt;math&gt; {m} &lt;/math&gt;, defined as the product of the distinct [[prime factors]] of &lt;math&gt; {m} &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Second formulation'''

Define the ''quality'' of &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n}&lt;/math&gt; as
: &lt;math&gt; q(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)= \frac{\log(\operatorname{max}(|a_1|,|a_2|,...,|a_n|))}{\log(\operatorname{rad}(|a_1| \cdot |a_2| \cdot ... \cdot |a_n|))} &lt;/math&gt;
The ''n'' conjecture states that &lt;math&gt;\limsup q(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)= 2n-5 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Stronger form==
{{Harvtxt|Vojta|1998}} proposed a stronger variant of the ''n'' conjecture, where setwise coprimeness of &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n}&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by pairwise coprimeness of &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n}&lt;/math&gt;.

There are two different formulations of this '''''strong n'' conjecture'''.

Given &lt;math&gt; {n \ge 3}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n \in \mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy three conditions:
: (i) &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n}&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise coprime
: (ii) &lt;math&gt; {a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n=0}&lt;/math&gt;
: (iii) no proper subsum of &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt; {0}&lt;/math&gt;

'''First formulation'''

The ''strong n'' conjecture states that for every &lt;math&gt; {\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a constant &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt;, depending on &lt;math&gt; {n} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; {\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt;, such that:
&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{max}(|a_1|,|a_2|,...,|a_n|)&lt; C_{n,\varepsilon}\operatorname{rad}(|a_1| \cdot |a_2| \cdot ... \cdot |a_n|)^{1 + \varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Second formulation'''

Define the ''quality'' of &lt;math&gt; {a_1,a_2,...,a_n}&lt;/math&gt; as
: &lt;math&gt; q(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)= \frac{\log(\operatorname{max}(|a_1|,|a_2|,...,|a_n|))}{\log(\operatorname{rad}(|a_1| \cdot |a_2| \cdot ... \cdot |a_n|))} &lt;/math&gt;
The ''strong n'' conjecture states that &lt;math&gt;\limsup q(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)= 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6390">'''OpenMath''' is the name of a [[document markup language|markup language]] for specifying the meaning of [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[formulae]]. Among other things, it can be used to complement [[MathML]], a standard which mainly focuses on the presentation of formulae, with information about their semantic meaning. OpenMath can be encoded in [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] or in a binary format.

== Coverage ==

OpenMath consists of the definition of "OpenMath Objects", which is an abstract datatype for describing the logical structure of a mathematical formula and the definition of "OpenMath Content Dictionaries", or collections of names for mathematical concepts. The names available from the latter type of collections are specifically intended for use in extending MathML, and conversely, a basic set of such "Content Dictionaries" has been designed to be compatible with the small set of mathematical concepts defined in Content MathML, the non-presentational subset of MathML.

== History ==

OpenMath has been developed in a long series of workshops and (mostly European) research projects that began in 1993 and continues through today. The OpenMath 1.0 Standard was released in February 2000, and revised as OpenMath 1.1 in October 2002. Two years later, the OpenMath 2.0 Standard was released in June 2004. OpenMath 1 fixed the basic language architecture, while OpenMath2 brought better XML integration, structure sharing and liberalized the notion of OpenMath Content dictionaries.

== OpenMath Society ==

The OpenMath Effort is governed by the [http://www.openmath.org/society/index.html OpenMath Society], based in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors. Membership is by invitation of the Societies Executive Committee, which welcomes self-nominations of individuals who have worked on OpenMath-related issues in research or application.  As of 2007, [[Michael Kohlhase]] is president of the OpenMath society. He succeeded Arjeh M. Cohen, who was the first president.

== Example ==

The well-known [[quadratic formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

would be marked up like this in OpenMath (the representation is an expression tree made up from functional elements like &lt;tt&gt;OMA&lt;/tt&gt; for function application or &lt;tt&gt;OMV&lt;/tt&gt; for variables):

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;OMOBJ xmlns="http://www.openmath.org/OpenMath"&gt;
  &lt;OMA cdbase="http://www.openmath.org/cd"&gt;
    &lt;OMS cd="relation1" name="eq"/&gt;
    &lt;OMV name="x"/&gt;
    &lt;OMA&gt;
      &lt;OMS cd="arith1" name="divide"/&gt;
      &lt;OMA&gt;
        &lt;OMS cdbase="http://www.example.com/mathops" cd="multiops" name="plusminus"/&gt;
        &lt;OMA&gt;
          &lt;OMS cd="arith1" name="unary_minus"/&gt;
          &lt;OMV name="b"/&gt;
        &lt;/OMA&gt;
        &lt;OMA&gt;
          &lt;OMS cd="arith1" name="root"/&gt;
          &lt;OMA&gt;
            &lt;OMS cd="arith1" name="minus"/&gt;
            &lt;OMA&gt;
              &lt;OMS cd="arith1" name="power"/&gt;
              &lt;OMV name="b"/&gt;
              &lt;OMI&gt;2&lt;/OMI&gt;
            &lt;/OMA&gt;
            &lt;OMA&gt;
              &lt;OMS cd="arith1" name="times"/&gt;
              &lt;OMI&gt;4&lt;/OMI&gt;
              &lt;OMV name="a"/&gt;
              &lt;OMV name="c"/&gt;
            &lt;/OMA&gt;
          &lt;/OMA&gt;
        &lt;/OMA&gt;
      &lt;/OMA&gt;
      &lt;OMA&gt;
        &lt;OMS cd="arith1" name="times"/&gt;
        &lt;OMI&gt;2&lt;/OMI&gt;
        &lt;OMV name="a"/&gt;
      &lt;/OMA&gt;
    &lt;/OMA&gt;
  &lt;/OMA&gt;
&lt;/OMOBJ&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the expression tree above symbols—i.e. elements like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;OMS cd="arith1" name="times"/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;—stand for mathematical functions that are applied to sibling expressions in an &lt;tt&gt;OMA&lt;/tt&gt; which are interpreted as arguments. The &lt;tt&gt;OMS&lt;/tt&gt; element is a generic extension element that means whatever is specified in the content dictionary referred to in the &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; attribute (this document can be found at the URI specified in the innermost &lt;tt&gt;cdbase&lt;/tt&gt; attribute dominating the respective &lt;tt&gt;OMS&lt;/tt&gt; element. In the example above, all symbols come from the content dictionary for arithmetics (&lt;tt&gt;arith1&lt;/tt&gt;, see below), except for the &lt;tt&gt;plusminus&lt;/tt&gt;, which comes from a non-standard place, hence the &lt;tt&gt;cdbase&lt;/tt&gt; attribute here.

== OpenMath Content Dictionaries ==

Content Dictionaries are structured XML documents that define mathematical symbols that can be referred to by &lt;nowiki&gt;OMS&lt;/nowiki&gt; elements in OpenMath Objects. The OpenMath 2 standard does not prescribe a canonical encoding for content dictionaries, but only requires an infrastructure sufficient for unique referencing  in &lt;nowiki&gt;OMS&lt;/nowiki&gt; elements. OpenMath provides a very basic XML encoding that meets these requirements, and a set of specific content dictionaries for some areas of mathematics, in particular covering the K-14 fragment covered by content MathML.

For more richly structured content dictionaries (and generally for arbitrary mathematical documents) the [[OMDoc]] format extends OpenMath by a “statement level” (including structures like definitions, theorems, proofs and examples, as well as means for interrelating them) and a “theory level”, where a theory is a collection of several contextually related statements. OMDoc's theories are designed to be compatible to OpenMath content dictionaries, but they can also be set into inheritance and import relations.

==Criticism==

OpenMath is criticised for being inadequate for general mathematics, exposing not enough formal precision to capture the intricacies of numerics, lacking a proof-of-concept and as an inferior technology to already established approaches of encoding mathematical semantics, amongst other presumed shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/openmathcrit.pdf|title=A Critique of OpenMath and Thoughts on Encoding Mathematics|author=Richard J. Fateman|date=2001-01-17|accessdate=2015-04-25|publisher=University of California|place=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''''p''-adic Teichmüller theory''' describes the "uniformization" of [[p-adic|''p''-adic]] curves and their [[Moduli_spaces|moduli]], generalizing the usual [[Teichmüller theory]] that describes the [[Uniformization theorem|uniformization]] of [[Riemann surfaces]] and their moduli. It was introduced and developed by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Shinichi Mochizuki|first=Shinichi|last=Mochizuki|year1=1996|year2=1999}}.

The first problem is to reformulate the Fuchsian [[Uniformization theorem|uniformization]] of a complex Riemann surface (an isomorphism from the upper half plane to a universal covering space of the surface) in a way that makes sense for ''p''-adic curves. The existence of a Fuchsian uniformization is equivalent to the existence of a canonical [[indigenous bundle]] over the Riemann surface: the unique indigenous bundle that is invariant under complex conjugation and whose [[monodromy]] representation is quasi-Fuchsian. For ''p''-adic curves the analogue of complex conjugation is the [[Frobenius endomorphism]], and the analogue of the quasi-Fuchsian condition is an integrality condition on the indigenous line bundle. So ''p''-adic Teichmüller theory, the ''p''-adic analogue the Fuchsian uniformization of Teichmüller theory, is the study of integral Frobenius invariant indigenous bundles.

In [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]], '''percolation''' (from [[Latin]] ''percōlāre'', "to filter" or "trickle through") refers to the movement and [[filtration|filtering]] of fluids through porous materials.

==Background==
During the last decades, [[percolation theory]], the mathematical study of percolation, has brought new understanding and techniques to a broad range of topics in physics, materials science, [[complex network]]s, [[epidemiology]], and other fields. For example, in [[geology]], percolation refers to filtration of water through soil and permeable rocks. The water flows to [[groundwater recharge|recharge]] the [[groundwater]] in the [[water table]] and [[aquifer]]s. In places where [[infiltration basin]]s or [[septic drain field]]s are planned to dispose of substantial amounts of water, a [[percolation test]] is needed beforehand to determine whether the intended structure is  likely to succeed or fail.

Percolation typically exhibits [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]. [[Statistical physics]] concepts such as scaling theory, [[renormalization]], [[phase transition]], [[critical phenomena]] and [[fractal]]s are used to characterize percolation properties. [[Combinatorics]] is commonly employed to study [[percolation threshold]]s.

Due to the complexity involved in obtaining exact results from analytical models of percolation, computer simulations are typically used.  The current fastest algorithm for percolation was published in 2000 by [[Mark Newman]] and Robert Ziff.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Newman | first = Mark | last2 = Ziff | first2 = Robert | title = Efficient Monte Carlo Algorithm and High-Precision Results for Percolation | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 85 | issue = 19 | pages = 4104–4107 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.4104 | pmid=11056635|arxiv = cond-mat/0005264 |bibcode = 2000PhRvL..85.4104N| citeseerx = 10.1.1.310.4632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* Coffee percolation, where the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma.
* Movement of weathered material down on a slope under the earth's surface.

* Dental percolation, increase rate of decay under crowns because of a conducive environment for strep mutants and lactobacillus
* Potential sites for septic systems are tested by the "[[Percolation_test|perk test]]". Example/theory: A hole (usually 6–10 inches in diameter) is dug in the ground surface (usually 12–24" deep). Water is filled in to the hole, and the time is measured for a drop of one inch in the water surface. If the water surface quickly drops, as usually seen in poorly-graded sands, then it is a potentially good place for a septic "[[Septic_drain_field|leach field]]". If the hydraulic conductivity of the site is low (usually in clayey and loamy soils), then the site is undesirable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4367">A '''probabilistic metric space''' is a generalization of [[metric spaces]] where the [[distance]] has no longer values in non-negative [[real number]]s, but in distribution functions.    

Let ''D+'' be the set of all [[probability distribution function]]s F such that F(0) = 0 (F is a nondecreasing, left
[[continuous mapping]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; into [0, 1] such that [[Maximum|max]](F) = 1).

The [[ordered pair]] (S,F) is said to be a probabilistic metric space if S is a [[nonempty set]] and F: S×S →
D+ (F(p, q) is denoted by F&lt;sub&gt;p,q&lt;/sub&gt; for every (p, q) ∈ S × S) satisfies the following conditions:
*F&lt;sub&gt;u,v&lt;/sub&gt;(x) = 1 for every x &gt; 0 ⇔ u = v (u, v ∈ S).
*F&lt;sub&gt;u,v&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;v,u&lt;/sub&gt; for every u, v ∈ S.
*F&lt;sub&gt;u,v&lt;/sub&gt;(x) = 1 and F&lt;sub&gt;v,w&lt;/sub&gt;(y) = 1 ⇒ F&lt;sub&gt;u,w&lt;/sub&gt;(x + y) = 1 f or u, v, w ∈ S and x, y ∈ R+.

==Probability metric of random variables==

A probability metric ''D'' between two [[random variable]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' may be defined e.g. as: 

:&lt;math&gt;D(X, Y) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty |x-y|F(x, y) \, dx dy&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''(''x'', ''y'') denotes the joint probability density function of random variables ''X'' and ''Y''. Obviously if ''X'' and ''Y'' are independent from each other the equation above transforms into:

:&lt;math&gt;D(X, Y) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty |x-y|f(x)g(y) \, dx dy&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''(''x'') and ''g''(''y'') are probability density functions of ''X'' and ''Y'' respectively.

One may easily show that such probability metrics do not satisfy the first [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] axiom or satisfies is only if, and only if, both of its arguments ''X'', ''Y'' are certain events described by [[Dirac delta]] density [[probability distribution function]]s. In this case:

:&lt;math&gt;D(X, Y) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty |x-y|\delta(x-\mu_x)\delta(y-\mu_y) \, dx dy = |\mu_x-\mu_y|&lt;/math&gt;

the probability metric simply transforms into the metric between [[expected value]]s &lt;math&gt;\mu_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_y&lt;/math&gt; of the variables ''X'' and ''Y''. 

For all other [[random variable]]s ''X'', ''Y'' the probability metric does not satisfy the [[identity of indiscernibles]] condition required to be satisfied by the metric of the [[metric space]], that is:

:&lt;math&gt;D\left(X, X\right) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Probability_metric_DNN.png|thumb|right|325px|
Probability metric between two random variables ''X'' and ''Y'', both having [[normal distribution]]s and the same [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 0, \sigma = 0.2, \sigma = 0.4, \sigma = 0.6, \sigma = 0.8, \sigma = 1&lt;/math&gt; (beginning with the bottom curve).
&lt;math&gt;m_{xy} = |\mu_x-\mu_y|&lt;/math&gt; denotes a distance between [[mean]]s of ''X'' and ''Y''.]]

===Example===

For example if both [[probability distribution function]]s of random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[normal distribution]]s (N) having the same [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, integrating &lt;math&gt;D\left(X, Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; yields to:

:&lt;math&gt;
D_{NN}(X, Y) = \mu_{xy} + \frac{2\sigma}{\sqrt\pi}\operatorname{exp}\left(-\frac{\mu_{xy}^2}{4\sigma^2}\right)-\mu_{xy} \operatorname{erfc} \left(\frac{\mu_{xy}}{2\sigma}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{xy} = \left|\mu_x-\mu_y\right|&lt;/math&gt;,

and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{erfc}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the complementary [[error function]].

In this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mu_{xy}\to 0} D_{NN}(X, Y) = D_{NN}(X, X) = \frac{2\sigma}{\sqrt\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

==Probability metric of random vectors==

The probability metric of random variables may be extended into metric ''D''('''X''', '''Y''') of [[random vector]]s '''X''', '''Y''' by substituting &lt;math&gt;|x-y|&lt;/math&gt; with any metric operator ''d''('''x''','''y'''):

:&lt;math&gt;D(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}) =\int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})F(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \, d\Omega_x d\Omega_y&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''('''X''', '''Y''') is the joint probability density function of random vectors '''X''' and '''Y'''.
For example substituting ''d''('''x''','''y''') with [[Euclidean metric]] and providing the vectors '''X''' and '''Y''' are mutually independent would yield to:

:&lt;math&gt;D(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}) =\int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \sqrt{\sum_i|x_i-y_i|^2} F(\mathbf{x})G(\mathbf{y}) \, d\Omega_x d\Omega_y&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16704">In [[logic]], '''proof by contradiction''' is a form of [[Mathematical proof|proof]], and more specifically a form of '''indirect proof''', that establishes the [[Truth#Formal theories|truth]] or [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of a [[proposition]].  It starts by assuming that the opposite proposition is true, and then shows that such an assumption leads to a [[contradiction]]. Proof by contradiction is also known as '''indirect proof''', '''apagogical argument''', '''proof by assuming the opposite''', and '''''reductio ad impossibilem'''''. It is a particular kind of the more general form of argument known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.&lt;ref name=Hardy&gt;[[G. H. Hardy]],  ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]; Cambridge University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|9780521427067}}.  ''[https://www.math.ualberta.ca/mss/misc/A%20Mathematician's%20Apology.pdf PDF p.19].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Cohen, "Introduction to Logic", [https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/120/Chapter5.pdf Chapter 5] "proof by contradiction ... Also called indirect proof or reductio ad absurdum ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. H. Hardy]] described proof by contradiction as "one of a mathematician's finest weapons", saying "It is a far finer gambit than any [[gambit|chess gambit]]: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game."&lt;ref name=Hardy/&gt;

==Principle==
Proof by contradiction is based on the [[law of noncontradiction]] as first formalized as a metaphysical principle by [[Aristotle]]. Noncontradiction is also a theorem in [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. This states that an assertion or mathematical statement cannot be both true and false. That is, a proposition ''Q'' and its negation &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''Q'' ("not-''Q''") cannot both be true. In a proof by contradiction, it is shown that the denial of the  statement being proved results in such a contradiction.  It has the form of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' argument.  If ''P'' is the proposition to be proved:
#''P'' is assumed to be false, that is &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''P'' is true.
#It is shown that &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''P'' implies two mutually contradictory assertions, ''Q'' and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''Q''.
#Since ''Q'' and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''Q'' cannot both be true, the assumption that ''P'' is false must be wrong, and ''P'' must be true.

An alternate form derives a contradiction with the statement to be proved itself:
#''P'' is assumed to be false.
#It is shown that &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''P'' implies ''P''.
#Since ''P'' and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''P'' cannot both be true, the assumption must be wrong and ''P'' must be true.

An [[existence proof]] by contradiction assumes that some object doesn't exist, and then proves that this would lead to a contradiction; thus, such an object must exist. Although it is quite freely used in mathematical proofs, not every [[philosophy of mathematics|school of mathematical thought]] accepts this kind of [[nonconstructive proof]] as universally valid.

=== Law of the excluded middle ===
{{main|Law of the excluded middle}}
Proof by contradiction also depends on the [[law of the excluded middle]], also first formulated by Aristotle. This states that either an assertion or its negation must be true
:&lt;math&gt;\forall P \vdash (P \lor \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt;
:(For all propositions ''P'', either ''P'' or not-''P'' is true)
That is, there is no other truth value besides "true" and "false" that a proposition can take. Combined with the principle of noncontradiction, this means that exactly one of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; is true. In proof by contradiction, this permits the conclusion that since the possibility of &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; has been excluded, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must be true.

The law of the excluded middle is accepted in virtually all formal logics; however, some [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionist]] mathematicians do not accept it, and thus reject proof by contradiction as a proof technique.

== Relationship with other proof techniques ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Proof by contradiction is closely related to [[proof by contrapositive]], and the two are sometimes confused, though they are distinct methods. The main distinction is that a proof by contrapositive applies only to statements &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; that can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., implications), whereas the technique of proof by contradiction applies to statements &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of any form:
* '''Proof by contradiction (general)''': assume &lt;math&gt; \lnot P&lt;/math&gt; and derive a contradiction. 
::This corresponds, in the framework of [[propositional logic]], to the equivalence &lt;math&gt;P \equiv \lnot\lnot P \equiv \lnot P \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is the logical contradiction, or ''false'' value.

In the case where the statement to be proven ''is'' an implication &lt;math&gt; A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;, let us look at the differences between direct proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction:
* '''Direct proof''': assume &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; and show &lt;math&gt; B&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Proof by contrapositive''': assume &lt;math&gt; \lnot B&lt;/math&gt; and show &lt;math&gt; \lnot A&lt;/math&gt;. 
::This corresponds to the equivalence &lt;math&gt; A\rightarrow B \equiv \lnot B\rightarrow \lnot A&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Proof by contradiction''': assume &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lnot B&lt;/math&gt; and derive a contradiction. 
::This corresponds to the equivalences &lt;math&gt; A\rightarrow B \equiv \lnot \lnot (A\rightarrow B) \equiv \lnot (A\rightarrow B) \rightarrow \bot \equiv (A\land \lnot B) \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

===Irrationality of the square root of 2===

A classic proof by contradiction from mathematics is the [[Square root of 2#Proof by infinite descent|proof that the square root of 2 is irrational]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/q1.html|title=Why is the square root of 2 irrational?|last=Alfeld|first=Peter|date=16 August 1996|work=Understanding Mathematics, a study guide|publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Utah|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it were [[rational number|rational]], it could be expressed as a fraction ''a''/''b'' in [[lowest terms]], where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[integers]], at least one of which is [[odd number|odd]]. But if ''a''/''b'' = {{radic|2}}, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; must be even. Because the square of an odd number is odd, that in turn implies that ''a'' is even. This means that ''b'' must be odd because a/b is in lowest terms.

On the other hand, if ''a'' is even, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a multiple of 4.  If ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a multiple of 4 and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a multiple of 4, and therefore ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is even, and so is ''b''.

So ''b'' is odd and even, a contradiction.  Therefore, the initial assumption—that {{radic|2}} can be expressed as a fraction—must be false.

===The length of the hypotenuse===
The method of proof by contradiction has also been used to show that for any [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|non-degenerate]] [[right triangle]], the length of the hypotenuse is less than the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/313Hfall12/resources/week2a-pp4.pdf|title=Logic, Sets, and Functions: Honors|last=Stone|first=Peter|work=Course materials|publisher=Department of Computer Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=6 February 2013|location=pp 14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proof relies on the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. Letting ''c'' be the length of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' the lengths of the legs, the claim is that ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''.

The claim is negated to assume that ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''. Squaring both sides results in (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or, equivalently, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''ab''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A triangle is non-degenerate if each edge has positive length, so it may be assumed that ''a'' and ''b'' are greater than 0. Therefore, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''ab''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[transitive relation]] may be reduced to ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is known from the Pythagorean theorem that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This results in a contradiction since strict inequality and equality are [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]. The latter was a result of the Pythagorean theorem and the former the assumption that ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''. The contradiction means that it is impossible for both to be true and it is known that the Pythagorean theorem holds. It follows that the assumption that ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c'' must be false and hence ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c'', proving the claim.

===No least positive rational number===

&lt;!---redundant, compared with the lead---distinction between proving p and ¬p doesn't matter in classical logic; rule for proving p isn't accepted in intuitionistic logic---
Say we wish to disprove proposition ''p''. The procedure is to show that assuming ''p'' leads to a logical contradiction. Thus, according to the law of non-contradiction, ''p'' must be false.

Say instead we wish to prove proposition ''p''. We can proceed by assuming "not ''p''" (i.e. that ''p'' is false), and show that it leads to a logical contradiction. Thus, according to the law of non-contradiction, "not ''p''" must be false, and so, according to the [[law of the excluded middle]], ''p'' is true.

In symbols:

To disprove ''p'': one uses the [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (''p'' → (''R'' ∧ ¬''R'')) → ¬''p'', where ''R'' is any proposition and the ∧ symbol is taken to mean "and". Assuming ''p'', one proves ''R'' and ''¬R'', and concludes from this that ''p'' → (''R'' ∧ ¬''R''). This and the tautology together imply ''¬p''.

To prove ''p'': one uses the tautology (¬''p'' → (''R'' ∧ ¬''R'')) → ''p'' where ''R'' is any proposition. Assuming ¬''p'', one proves ''R'' and ¬''R'', and concludes from this that ¬''p'' → (''R'' ∧ ¬''R''). This and the tautology together imply ''p''.

For a simple example of the first kind,
---&gt;
Consider the proposition, ''P'': "there is no smallest rational number greater than 0". In a proof by contradiction, we start by assuming the opposite, ¬''P'': that there ''is'' a smallest rational number, say,&amp;nbsp;''r''.

Now ''r''/2 is a rational number greater than 0 and smaller than ''r''.  But that contradicts our initial assumption, ¬''P'', that ''r'' was the ''smallest'' rational number. (In the above symbolic argument, "''r'' is the smallest rational number" would be ''Q'' and "''r''/2  is a rational number smaller than ''r''" would be ¬''Q''.)
So we can conclude that the original proposition, ''P'', must be true — "there is no smallest rational number greater than 0".
&lt;!---redundant---
[Note: the choice of which statement is ''R'' and which is ¬''R'' is arbitrary.]
---&gt;
&lt;!---doubtful distinction between proving p and ¬p---
It is common to use this first type of argument with propositions such as the one above, concerning the ''non''-existence of some mathematical object. One assumes that such an object exists, and then proves that this would lead to a contradiction; thus, such an object does not exist.
---&gt;

==Notation==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hand of Eris]]. --&gt;
Proofs by contradiction sometimes end with the word "Contradiction!".  [[Isaac Barrow]] and Baermann used the notation Q.E.A., for "''quod est absurdum''" ("which is absurd"), along the lines of [[Q.E.D.]], but this notation is rarely used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=1175481|title=Math Forum Discussions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=1. A board is no reliable source. 2. It's more likely that it was "Q. E. D." and "Q. E. A." (with spaces) in those older times, not "Q.E.D." (without spaces). Also: It should be the case, that also other people (like Leibniz) used "Q. E. A." or at least "quod est absurdum".|date=December 2015}} A graphical symbol sometimes used for contradictions is a downwards zigzag arrow "lightning" symbol (U+21AF: ↯), for example in Davey and Priestley.&lt;ref&gt;B. Davey and H.A. Priestley, Introduction to lattices and order, Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others sometimes used include a pair of [[Hand of Eris|opposing arrows]] (as &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\!\leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow\!\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;), struck-out arrows (&lt;math&gt;\nleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;), a stylized form of hash (such as U+2A33: ⨳), or the "reference mark" (U+203B: ※).&lt;ref&gt;The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List, pg. 20.  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Hardegree, ''Introduction to Modal Logic'', Chapter 2, pg. II–2.  https://web.archive.org/web/20110607061046/http://people.umass.edu/gmhwww/511/pdf/c02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The "up tack" symbol (U+22A5: ⊥) used by philosophers and logicians (see contradiction) also appears, but is often avoided due to its usage for [[orthogonality]].

==Principle of explosion==
{{main|Principle of explosion}}
A curious logical consequence of the principle of non-contradiction is that a contradiction implies any statement; if a contradiction is accepted as true, any proposition (or its negation) can be proved from it.&lt;ref name="Ferguson1"&gt;{{cite book
 | last1  = Ferguson
 | first1 = Thomas Macaulay

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is known as the [[principle of explosion]] ({{lang-la|ex falso quodlibet|links=no}}, "from a falsehood, anything [follows]", or ''{{lang|la|ex contradictione sequitur quodlibet}}'', "from a contradiction, anything follows"), or the principle of pseudo-scotus.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall Q: (P \land \lnot P) \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;
:(for all Q, P and not-P implies Q)
Thus a contradiction in a [[axiomatic system|formal axiomatic system]] is disastrous; since any theorem can be proven true it destroys the conventional meaning of truth and falsity.

The discovery of contradictions at the foundations of mathematics at the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Russell's paradox]], threatened the entire structure of mathematics due to the principle of explosion.  This motivated a great deal of work during the 20th century to create consistent axiomatic systems to provide a logical underpinning for mathematics.  This has also led a few philosophers such as [[Newton da Costa]], [[Walter Carnielli]] and [[Graham Priest]] to reject the principle of non-contradiction, giving rise to theories such as [[paraconsistent logic]] and [[dialethism]], which accepts that there exist statements that are both true and false.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10106">'''Pursuit-evasion''' (variants of which are referred to as '''cops and robbers''' and '''graph searching''') is a family of problems in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] in which one group  attempts to track down members of another group in an environment. Early work on problems of this type modeled the environment geometrically.&lt;ref name="CITEREFIsaacs1965"&gt;{{Harvnb|Isaacs|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, [[Torrence Parsons]] introduced a formulation whereby movement is constrained by a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parsons|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geometric formulation is sometimes called '''continuous pursuit-evasion''', and the graph formulation '''discrete pursuit-evasion''' (also called '''graph searching'''). Current research is typically limited to one of these two formulations.

==Discrete formulation==
In the discrete formulation of the pursuit-evasion problem, the environment is modeled as a graph.

===Problem definition===
There are innumerable possible variants of pursuit-evasion, though they tend to share many elements. A typical, basic example is as follows (cops and robber games): Pursuers and evaders occupy [[node (graph theory)|nodes]] of a graph. The two sides take alternate turns, which consist of each member either staying put or moving along an [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] to an adjacent node. If a pursuer occupies the same node as an evader the evader is captured and removed from the graph. The question usually posed is how many pursuers are necessary to ensure the eventual capture of all the evaders. If one pursuer suffices, the graph is called a [[cop-win graph]]. In this case, a single evader can always be captured in time linear to the number of ''n'' nodes of the graph. Capturing ''r'' evaders with ''k'' pursuers can take in the order of ''rn'' time as well, but the exact bounds for more than one pursuer are still unknown.

Often the movement rules are altered by changing the velocity of the evaders. This velocity is the maximum number of edges that an evader can move along in a single turn. In the example above, the evaders have a velocity of one. At the other extreme is the concept of [[Infinity|infinite]] velocity, which allows an evader to move to any node in the graph so long as there is a [[path (graph theory)|path]] between its original and final positions that contains no nodes occupied by a pursuer. Similarly some variants arm the pursuers with "helicopters" which allow them to move to any vertex on their turn.

Other variants ignore the restriction that pursuers and evaders must always occupy a node and allow for the possibility that they are positioned somewhere along an edge. These variants are often referred to as sweeping problems, whilst the previous variants would fall under the category of searching problems.

===Variants===
Several variants are equivalent to important graph parameters. Specifically, finding the number of pursuers necessary to capture a single evader with infinite velocity in a graph ''G'' (when pursuers and evader are not constrained to move turn by turn, but move simultaneously) is equivalent to finding the [[treewidth]] of ''G'', and a winning strategy for the evader may be described in terms of a [[haven (graph theory)|haven]] in ''G''. If this evader is invisible to the pursuers then the problem is equivalent to finding the [[pathwidth]] or vertex separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finding the number of pursuers necessary to capture a single invisible evader in a graph ''G'' in a single turn (that is, one movement by the pursuers from their initial deployment) is equivalent to finding the size of the minimum [[dominating set]] of ''G'', assuming the pursuers can initially deploy wherever they like (this later assumption holds when pursuers and evader are assumed to move turn by turn).

The board game [[Scotland Yard (board game)|Scotland Yard]] is a variant of the pursuit-evasion problem.

===Complexity===
The complexity of several pursuit-evasion variants, namely how many pursuers are needed to clear a given graph and how a given number of pursuers should move on the graph to clear it with either a minimum sum of their travel distances or minimum task-completion time, has been studied by [[Nimrod Megiddo]], [[S. L. Hakimi]], [[Michael R. Garey]], [[David S. Johnson]], and [[Christos H. Papadimitriou]] (J. ACM 1988),  and  R. Borie, C. Tovey and S. Koenig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Borie|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-player pursuit-evasion games===
Solving multi-player pursuit-evasion games has also received increased attention. See [[R Vidal et al.]], [[Chung and Furukawa]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831180125/http://cmr.mech.unsw.edu.au/people/AlexChung/cfchung.htm], [[Hespanha et al.]] and the references therein. [[Marcos A. M. Vieira and Ramesh Govindan and Gaurav S. Sukhatme]] provided an algorithm that computes the minimal completion time strategy for pursuers to capture all evaders when all players make optimal decisions based on complete knowledge. This algorithm can also be applied to when evader are significantly faster than pursuers. Unfortunately, these algorithms do not scale beyond a small number of robots. To overcome this problem, [[Marcos A. M. Vieira and Ramesh Govindan and Gaurav S. Sukhatme]] design and implement a partition algorithm where pursuers capture evaders by decomposing the game into multiple multi-pursuer single-evader games.

==Continuous formulation==
In the continuous formulation of pursuit-evasion games, the environment is modeled geometrically, typically taking the form of the [[Euclidean plane]] or another [[manifold]]. Variants of the game may impose maneuverability constraints on the players, such as a limited range of speed or acceleration. Obstacles may also be used.

==Applications==
One of the initial applications of the pursuit-evasion problem was missile guidance systems formulated by [[Rufus Isaacs (game theorist)|Rufus Isaacs]] at the RAND Corporation.&lt;ref name="CITEREFIsaacs1965" /&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''right [[conoid]]''' is a [[ruled surface]] generated by a family of [[straight line]]s that all intersect [[perpendicular]]ly to a fixed straight line, called the ''axis'' of the right conoid.

Using a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in [[three-dimensional space]], if we take the z-axis to be the axis of a right conoid, then the right conoid can be represented by the [[parametric equation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;x=v\cos u, y=v\sin u, z=h(u) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''h''(''u'') is some [[function (mathematics)|function]] for representing the ''height'' of the moving line.

==Examples==
[[Image:Conoid.gif|right|thumb|300px|Generation of a typical right conoid]]

A typical example of right conoids is given by the parametric equations
: &lt;math&gt;x=v\cos u, y=v\sin u, z=2\sin u&lt;/math&gt;

The image on the right shows how the coplanar lines generate the right conoid.

Other right conoids include:
*[[Helicoid]]: &lt;math&gt;x=v\cos u, y=v\sin u, z=cu.&lt;/math&gt;
*[[Whitney umbrella]]: &lt;math&gt;x=vu, y=v, z=u^2.&lt;/math&gt;
*[[Wallis’s conical edge]]: &lt;math&gt;x=v\cos u, y=v \sin u, z=c\sqrt{a^2-b^2\cos^2u}.&lt;/math&gt;
*[[Plücker’s conoid]]: &lt;math&gt; x=v\cos u, y=v\sin u, z=c\sin nu.&lt;/math&gt;
*[[hyperbolic paraboloid]]: &lt;math&gt; x=v, y=u, z=uv&lt;/math&gt; (with x-axis and y-axis as its axes).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26045">{{About|the ring of symmetric functions in algebraic combinatorics|general properties of symmetric functions|symmetric function}}
In [[algebra]] and in particular in [[algebraic combinatorics]], the '''ring of symmetric functions''' is a specific limit of the rings of [[symmetric polynomial]]s in ''n'' indeterminates, as ''n'' goes to infinity. This [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] serves as universal structure in which relations between symmetric polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number ''n'' of indeterminates (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions). Among other things, this ring plays an important role in the [[representation theory of the symmetric group]].

The ring of symmetric functions can be given a coproduct and a bilinear form making it into a positive selfadjoint graded [[Hopf algebra]] that is both commutative and cocommutative.

== Symmetric polynomials ==

{{main | Symmetric polynomial }}

The study of symmetric functions is based on that of symmetric polynomials. In a [[polynomial ring]] in some finite set of indeterminates, a polynomial is called ''symmetric'' if it stays the same whenever the indeterminates are permuted in any way. More formally, there is an [[group action|action]] by [[ring homomorphism|ring automorphism]]s of the [[symmetric group]] ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the polynomial ring in ''n'' indeterminates, where a permutation acts on a polynomial by simultaneously substituting each of the indeterminates for another according to the permutation used. The [[Invariant (mathematics)#Unchanged under group action|invariants]] for this action form the subring of symmetric polynomials. If the indeterminates are ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then examples of such symmetric polynomials are

: &lt;math&gt;X_1+X_2+\cdots+X_n, \, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;X_1^3+X_2^3+\cdots+X_n^3, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;X_1X_2\cdots X_n. \, &lt;/math&gt;

A somewhat more complicated example is
''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; +''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; +''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; +''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; +...
where the summation goes on to include all products of the third power of some variable and two other variables. There are many specific kinds of symmetric polynomials, such as [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s, [[power sum symmetric polynomial]]s, [[monomial symmetric polynomial]]s, [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]]s, and [[Schur polynomial]]s.

== The ring of symmetric functions ==
Most relations between symmetric polynomials do not depend on the number ''n'' of indeterminates, other than that some polynomials in the relation might require ''n'' to be large enough in order to be defined. For instance the [[Newton's identities|Newton's identity]] for the third power sum polynomial ''p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' leads to
:&lt;math&gt;p_3(X_1,\ldots,X_n)=e_1(X_1,\ldots,X_n)^3-3e_2(X_1,\ldots,X_n)e_1(X_1,\ldots,X_n)+3e_3(X_1,\ldots,X_n),&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; denote elementary symmetric polynomials; this formula is valid for all natural numbers ''n'', and the only notable dependency on it is that ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 whenever ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''. One would like to write this as an identity 
:&lt;math&gt;p_3=e_1^3-3e_2 e_1 + 3e_3&lt;/math&gt;
that does not depend on ''n'' at all, and this can be done in the ring of symmetric functions. In that ring there are elements ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for all integers ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, and any element of the ring can be given by a polynomial expression in the elements ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Definitions ===

A '''ring of symmetric functions''' can be defined over any commutative ring ''R'', and will be denoted Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;; the basic case is for ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''. The ring Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is in fact a [[graded ring|graded]] ''R''-[[Algebra over a ring|algebra]]. There are two main constructions for it; the first one given below can be found in (Stanley, 1999), and the second is essentially the one given in (Macdonald, 1979).

==== As a ring of formal power series ====

The easiest (though somewhat heavy) construction starts with the ring of [[Formal power series#Power series in several variables|formal power series]] &lt;math&gt;R[[X_1,X_2,...]]&lt;/math&gt; over ''R'' in infinitely (countably) many indeterminates; the elements of this power series ring are formal infinite sums of terms, each of which consists of a coefficient from ''R'' multiplied by a monomial, where each monomial is a product of finitely many finite powers of indeterminates. One defines Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; as its subring consisting of those power series ''S'' that satisfy 
#''S'' is invariant under any permutation of the indeterminates, and
#the degrees of the monomials occurring in ''S'' are bounded.
Note that because of the second condition, power series are used here only to allow infinitely many terms of a fixed degree, rather than to sum terms of all possible degrees. Allowing this is necessary because an element that contains for instance a term ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; should also contain a term ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''i''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 in order to be symmetric. Unlike the whole power series ring, the subring Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is graded by the total degree of monomials: due to condition&amp;nbsp;2, every element of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is a finite sum of [[Homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] elements of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; (which are themselves infinite sums of terms of equal degree). For every ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, the element ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the formal sum of all products of ''k'' distinct indeterminates, which is clearly homogeneous of degree ''k''.

==== As an algebraic limit ====

Another construction of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; takes somewhat longer to describe, but better indicates the relationship with the rings ''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;'''S'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of symmetric polynomials in ''n'' indeterminates. For every ''n'' there is a surjective [[ring homomorphism]] ρ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; from the analogous ring ''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;'''S'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with one more indeterminate onto ''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;'''S'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, defined by setting the last indeterminate ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; to&amp;nbsp;0. Although ρ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has a non-trivial kernel, the nonzero elements of that kernel have degree at least &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; (they are multiples of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that the restriction of ρ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to elements of degree at most ''n'' is a bijective linear map, and ρ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''. The inverse of this restriction can be extended uniquely to a ring homomorphism φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; from ''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;'''S'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to ''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;'''S'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as follows for instance from the [[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]]. Since the images φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,...,''n'' are still [[algebraically independent]] over&amp;nbsp;''R'', the homomorphism φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is injective and can be viewed as a (somewhat unusual) inclusion of rings; applying φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to a polynomial amounts to adding all monomials containing the new indeterminate obtained by symmetry from monomials already present. The ring Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is then the "union" ([[direct limit]]) of all these rings subject to these inclusions. Since all φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are compatible with the grading by total degree of the rings involved, Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; obtains the structure of a graded ring.

This construction differs slightly from the one in (Macdonald, 1979). That construction only uses the surjective morphisms ρ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; without mentioning the injective morphisms φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: it constructs the homogeneous components of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; separately, and equips their direct sum with a ring structure using the ρ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also observed that the result can be described as an [[inverse limit]] in the category of ''graded'' rings. That description however somewhat obscures an important property typical for a ''direct'' limit of injective morphisms, namely that every individual element (symmetric function) is already faithfully represented in some object used in the limit construction, here a ring ''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;'''S'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It suffices to take for ''d'' the degree of the symmetric function, since the part in degree ''d'' of that ring is mapped isomorphically to rings with more indeterminates by φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''d''. This implies that for studying relations between individual elements, there is no fundamental difference between symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions.

=== Defining individual symmetric functions ===

It should be noted that the name "symmetric function" for elements of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[misnomer]]: in neither construction the elements are functions, and in fact, unlike symmetric polynomials, no function of independent variables can be associated to such elements (for instance ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would be the sum of all infinitely many variables, which is not defined unless restrictions are imposed on the variables). However the name is traditional and well established; it can be found both in (Macdonald, 1979), which says (footnote on p.&amp;nbsp;12)
&lt;blockquote&gt;The elements of Λ (unlike those of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are no longer polynomials: they are formal infinite sums of monomials. We have therefore reverted to the older terminology of symmetric functions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(here Λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the ring of symmetric polynomials in ''n'' indeterminates), and also in (Stanley, 1999).

To define a symmetric function one must either indicate directly a power series as in the first construction, or give a symmetric polynomial in ''n'' indeterminates for every natural number ''n'' in a way compatible with the second construction. An expression in an unspecified number of indeterminates may do both, for instance
:&lt;math&gt;e_2=\sum_{i&lt;j}X_iX_j\,&lt;/math&gt;
can be taken as the definition of an elementary symmetric function if the number of indeterminates is infinite, or as the definition of an elementary symmetric polynomial in any finite number of indeterminates. Symmetric polynomials for the same symmetric function should be compatible with the morphisms ρ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (decreasing the number of indeterminates is obtained by setting some of them to zero, so that the coefficients of any monomial in the remaining indeterminates is unchanged), and their degree should remain bounded. (An example of a family of symmetric polynomials that fails both conditions is &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt;; the family &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i=1}^n(X_i+1)&lt;/math&gt; fails only the second condition.) Any symmetric polynomial in ''n'' indeterminates can be used to construct a compatible family of symmetric polynomials, using the morphisms ρ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' to decrease the number of indeterminates, and φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n'' to increase the number of indeterminates (which amounts to adding all monomials in new indeterminates obtained by symmetry from monomials already present).

The following are fundamental examples of symmetric functions.
* The '''monomial symmetric functions''' ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...) is a sequence of non-negative integers, only finitely many of which are non-zero. Then we can consider the [[monomial]] defined by α: ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;=''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.... Then ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is the symmetric function determined by ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. the sum of all monomials obtained from ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; by symmetry. For a formal definition, define β~α to mean that the sequence β is a permutation of the sequence α and set
::&lt;math&gt;m_\alpha=\sum\nolimits_{\beta\sim\alpha}X^\beta.&lt;/math&gt;
:This symmetric function corresponds to the [[monomial symmetric polynomial]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for any ''n'' large enough to have the monomial ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;. The distinct monomial symmetric functions are parametrized by the [[integer partition]]s (each ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; has a unique representative monomial ''X''&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt; with the parts λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in weakly decreasing order). Since any symmetric function containing any of the monomials of some ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; must contain all of them with the same coefficient, each symmetric function can be written as an ''R''-linear combination of monomial symmetric functions, and the distinct monomial symmetric functions therefore form a basis of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; as ''R''-[[module (mathematics)|module]].
* The '''elementary symmetric functions''' ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, for any natural number ''k''; one has ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X^\alpha=\Pi_{i=1}^kX_i&lt;/math&gt;. As a power series, this is the sum of all distinct products of ''k'' distinct indeterminates. This symmetric function corresponds to the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]] ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for any ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''k''.
* The '''power sum symmetric functions''' ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, for any positive integer ''k''; one has ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sub&gt;, the monomial symmetric function for the monomial ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. This symmetric function corresponds to the [[power sum symmetric polynomial]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;+...+''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for any ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.
* The '''complete homogeneous symmetric functions''' ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, for any natural number ''k''; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of all monomial symmetric functions ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; where α is a [[integer partition|partition]] of&amp;nbsp;''k''. As a power series, this is the sum of ''all'' monomials of degree ''k'', which is what motivates its name. This symmetric function corresponds to the [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]] ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for any ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''k''.
* The '''Schur functions''' ''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; for any partition λ, which corresponds to the [[Schur polynomial]] ''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for any ''n'' large enough to have the monomial ''X''&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt;.

There is no power sum symmetric function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: although it is possible (and in some contexts natural) to define &lt;math&gt;p_0(X_1,\ldots,X_n)=\Sigma_{i=1}^nX_i^0=n&lt;/math&gt; as a symmetric ''polynomial'' in ''n'' variables, these values are not compatible with the morphisms ρ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The "discriminant" &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(\prod_{i&lt;j}(X_i-X_j))^2&lt;/math&gt; is another example of an expression giving a symmetric polynomial for all ''n'', but not defining any symmetric function. The expressions defining [[Schur polynomial]]s as a quotient of alternating polynomials are somewhat similar to that for the discriminant, but the polynomials ''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) turn out to be compatible for varying ''n'', and therefore do define a symmetric function.

=== A principle relating symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions ===

For any symmetric function ''P'', the corresponding symmetric polynomials in ''n'' indeterminates for any natural number ''n'' may be designated by ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). The second definition of the ring of symmetric functions implies the following fundamental principle:

:If ''P'' and ''Q'' are symmetric functions of degree ''d'', then one has the identity &lt;math&gt;P=Q&lt;/math&gt; of symmetric functions if and only one has the identity ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Q''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;) of symmetric polynomials in ''d'' indeterminates. In this case one has in fact ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Q''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''any'' number ''n'' of indeterminates.

This is because one can always reduce the number of variables by substituting zero for some variables, and one can increase the number of variables by applying the homomorphisms φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; the definition of those homomorphisms assures that φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) (and similarly for ''Q'') whenever ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''d''. See [[Newton's identities#Derivation of the identities|a proof of Newton's identities]] for an effective application of this principle.

== Properties of the ring of symmetric functions ==

=== Identities ===

The ring of symmetric functions is a convenient tool for writing identities between symmetric polynomials that are independent of the number of indeterminates: in Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; there is no such number, yet by the above principle any identity in Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; automatically gives identities the rings of symmetric polynomials over ''R'' in any number of indeterminates. Some fundamental identities are
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k(-1)^ie_ih_{k-i}=0=\sum_{i=0}^k(-1)^ih_ie_{k-i}\quad\mbox{for all }k&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;
which shows a symmetry between elementary and complete homogeneous symmetric functions; these relations are explained under [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]].
:&lt;math&gt;ke_k=\sum_{i=1}^k(-1)^{i-1}p_ie_{k-i}\quad\mbox{for all }k\geq0,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[Newton identities]], which also have a variant for complete homogeneous symmetric functions:
:&lt;math&gt;kh_k=\sum_{i=1}^kp_ih_{k-i}\quad\mbox{for all }k\geq0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Structural properties of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ===
Important properties of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; include the following.

# The set of monomial symmetric functions parametrized by partitions form a basis of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; as graded ''R''-[[module (mathematics)|module]], those parametrized by partitions of ''d'' being homogeneous of degree ''d''; the same is true for the set of Schur functions (also parametrized by partitions).
# Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[isomorphic]] as a graded ''R''-algebra to a polynomial ring ''R''[''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...] in infinitely many variables, where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given degree&amp;nbsp;''i'' for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, one isomorphism being the one that sends ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; for every&amp;nbsp;''i''.
# There is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutory]] [[automorphism]] ω of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; that interchanges the elementary symmetric functions ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the complete homogeneous symmetric function ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i''. It also sends each power sum symmetric function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and it permutes the Schur functions among each other, interchanging ''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; where λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is the transpose partition of λ.

Property 2 is the essence of the [[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]]. It immediately implies some other properties:
* The [[subring]] of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; generated by its elements of degree at most ''n'' is isomorphic to the ring of symmetric polynomials over ''R'' in ''n'' variables;
* The [[Hilbert–Poincaré series]] of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\prod_{i=1}^\infty\frac1{1-t^i}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Partition (number theory)#Generating function|generating function]] of the [[integer partition]]s (this also follows from property&amp;nbsp;1);
* For every ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, the ''R''-module formed by the homogeneous part of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; of degree ''n'', modulo its intersection with the subring generated by its elements of degree strictly less than ''n'', is free of rank&amp;nbsp;1, and (the image of) ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a generator of this ''R''-module;
* For every family of symmetric functions (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in which ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is homogeneous of degree&amp;nbsp;''i'' and gives a generator of the free ''R''-module of the previous point (for all ''i''), there is an alternative isomorphism of graded ''R''-algebras from ''R''[''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...] as above to Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; that sends ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;; in other words, the family (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; forms a set of free polynomial generators of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;.

This final point applies in particular to the family (''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of complete homogeneous symmetric functions. 
If ''R'' contains the field&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; of [[rational number]]s, it applies also to the family (''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of power sum symmetric functions. This explains why the first ''n'' elements of each of these families define sets of symmetric polynomials in ''n'' variables that are free polynomial generators of that ring of symmetric polynomials.

The fact that the complete homogeneous symmetric functions form a set of free polynomial generators of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; already shows the existence of an automorphism&amp;nbsp;ω sending the elementary symmetric functions to the complete homogeneous ones, as mentioned in property&amp;nbsp;3. The fact that ω is an involution of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; follows from the symmetry between elementary and complete homogeneous symmetric functions expressed by the first set of relations given above.

The ring of symmetric functions Λ&lt;sub&gt;'''''Z'''''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Exp ring]] of the integers '''Z'''. It is also a [[Λ-ring|lambda-ring]] in a natural fashion; in fact it is the universal lambda-ring in one generator.

=== Generating functions ===

The first definition of Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; as a subring of &lt;math&gt;R[[X_1, X_2, ...]]&lt;/math&gt; allows the [[generating function]]s of several sequences of symmetric functions to be elegantly expressed. Contrary to the relations mentioned earlier, which are internal to Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, these expressions involve operations taking place in ''R''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...;''t''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; but outside its subring Λ&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;{{brackets|''t''}}, so they are meaningful only if symmetric functions are viewed as formal power series in indeterminates ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. We shall write "(''X'')" after the symmetric functions to stress this interpretation.

The generating function for the elementary symmetric functions is
:&lt;math&gt;E(t)=\sum_{k\geq0}e_k(X)t^k=\prod_{i=1}^\infty(1+X_it).&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly one has for complete homogeneous symmetric functions
:&lt;math&gt;H(t)=\sum_{k\geq0}h_k(X)t^k=\prod_{i=1}^\infty\left(\sum_{k\geq0}(X_it)^k\right)=\prod_{i=1}^\infty\frac1{1-X_it}.&lt;/math&gt;
The obvious fact that &lt;math&gt;E(-t)H(t)=1=E(t)H(-t)&lt;/math&gt; explains the symmetry between elementary and complete homogeneous symmetric functions.
The generating function for the power sum symmetric functions can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\sum_{k&gt;0}p_k(X)t^k=\sum_{k&gt;0}\sum_{i=1}^\infty(X_it)^k=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{X_it}{1-X_it}=\frac{tE'(-t)}{E(-t)}=\frac{tH'(t)}{H(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
((Macdonald, 1979) defines ''P''(''t'') as Σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')''t''&lt;sup&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and its expressions therefore lack a factor ''t'' with respect to those given here). The two final expressions, involving the formal derivatives of the generating functions ''E''(''t'') and ''H''(''t''), imply Newton's identities and their variants for the complete homogeneous symmetric functions. These expressions are sometimes written as
:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=-t\frac d{dt}\log(E(-t))= t\frac d{dt}\log(H(t)),&lt;/math&gt;
which amounts to the same, but requires that ''R'' contain the rational numbers, so that the logarithm of power series with constant term&amp;nbsp;1 is defined (by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\log(1-tS)=-\sum_{i&gt;0}\frac1i(tS)^i&lt;/math&gt;).

'''[[Disphenoid]]al''' or '''Seesaw''' is a type of [[molecular geometry]] where there are four bonds to a central atom with overall C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[symmetry group|symmetry]]. The name "seesaw" comes from the observation that it looks like a [[seesaw|playground seesaw]]. Most commonly, four bonds to a central atom result in [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] or, less commonly, [[Square planar molecular geometry|square planar geometry]]. The seesaw geometry, just like its name, is unusual.

It occurs when a molecule has a [[steric number]] of 5, with the central atom being bonded to 4 other [[atom]]s and 1 [[lone pair]] (AX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;E in [[VSEPR theory#AXE method|AXE notation]]). An atom bonded to 5 other atoms (and no lone pairs) forms a [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|trigonal bipyramid]]; but in this case one of the atoms is replaced by a lone pair. The atom replaced is always an equatorial atom, because the [[Lone pair|lone pairs]] repel other electrons more strongly than atoms do.

==Structure==
Compounds with disphenoidal geometry (See-Saw Geometry) have two types of [[Ligand|ligands]]: axial and equatorial. The axial pair lie along a common bond axis so that are related by a bond angle of 180°. The equatorial pair of ligands is situated in a plane orthogonal to the axis of the axial pair. Typically the bond distance to the axial ligands is longer than to the equatorial ligands. The ideal angle between the axial ligands and the equatorial ligands is 90°; whereas the ideal angle between the two equatorial ligands themselves is 120°.

Disphenoidal molecules, like trigonal bipyramidal ones, are subject to [[Berry pseudorotation]]. Thus, the &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectrum of [[Sulfur tetrafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] (like that of PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) consists of single resonance near room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Walter G. |last1=Klemperer |first2=Jeanne K. |last2=Krieger |first3=Michael D. |last3=McCreary |first4=E.

In [[multivariate statistics]] and the [[cluster analysis|clustering]] of data, '''spectral clustering''' techniques make use of the [[Spectrum of a matrix|spectrum]] ([[eigenvalues]]) of the [[similarity matrix]] of the data to perform [[dimensionality reduction]] before clustering in fewer dimensions. The similarity matrix is provided as an input and consists of a quantitative assessment of the relative similarity of each pair of points in the dataset.

In application to image segmentation, spectral clustering is known as [[segmentation-based object categorization]].

== Definitions ==

Given an enumerated set of data points, the [[similarity matrix]] may be defined as a symmetric matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; represents a measure of the similarity between data points with indices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. The general approach to spectral clustering is to use a standard [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] method (there are many such methods, ''k''-means is discussed [[Spectral clustering#Relationship with k-means|below]]) on relevant [[eigenvector]]s of a [[Laplacian matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. There are many different ways to define a Laplacian which have different mathematical interpretations, and so the clustering will also have different interpretations. The eigenvectors that are relevant are the ones that correspond to smallest several eigenvalues of the Laplacian except for the smallest eigenvalue which will have a value of 0. For computational efficiency, these eigenvectors are often computed as the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest several eigenvalues of a function of the Laplacian.

Spectral clustering is well known to relate to partitioning of a mass-spring system, where each mass is associated with a data point and each spring stiffness corresponds to a weight of an edge describing a similarity of the two related data points. Specifically, the classical reference &lt;ref&gt;J. Demmel, [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267/lecture20/lecture20.html], CS267: Notes for Lecture 23, April 9, 1999, Graph Partitioning, Part 2&lt;/ref&gt; explains that the eigenvalue problem describing transversal vibration modes of a mass-spring system is exactly the same as the eigenvalue problem for the graph [[Laplacian matrix]] defined as 
: &lt;math&gt;L:=D-A&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diagonal matrix
:&lt;math&gt;D_{ii} = \sum_j A_{ij}.&lt;/math&gt;
The masses that are tightly connected by the springs in the mass-spring system evidently move together from the equilibrium position in low-frequency vibration modes, so that the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian can be used for meaningful clustering of the masses. 

A popular related spectral clustering technique is the '''[[Segmentation based object categorization#Normalized cuts|normalized cuts algorithm]]''' or ''Shi–Malik algorithm'' introduced by Jianbo Shi and Jitendra Malik,&lt;ref&gt;Jianbo Shi and Jitendra Malik, [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~malik/papers/SM-ncut.pdf "Normalized Cuts and Image Segmentation"], IEEE Transactions on PAMI, Vol. 22, No. 8, Aug 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly used for [[segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]]. It partitions points into two sets &lt;math&gt;(B_1,B_2)&lt;/math&gt; based on the [[eigenvector]] &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the second-smallest [[eigenvalue]] of the 
[[Laplacian matrix#Symmetric normalized Laplacian|symmetric normalized Laplacian]] defined as

: &lt;math&gt;L^\text{norm}:=I-D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

A mathematically equivalent algorithm &lt;ref&gt;Marina Meilă &amp; Jianbo Shi, "[http://www.citeulike.org/user/mpotamias/article/498897 Learning Segmentation by Random Walks]", Neural Information Processing Systems 13 (NIPS 2000), 2001, pp. 873–879.&lt;/ref&gt; takes the [[eigenvector]] corresponding to the largest [[eigenvalue]] of the [[adjacency matrix|random walk normalized adjacency]] matrix &lt;math&gt;P = D^{-1}A&lt;/math&gt;. 

Knowing the eigenvectors, partitioning may be done in various ways, such as by computing the median &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of the components of the second smallest eigenvector &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and placing all points whose component in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is greater than &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the rest in &lt;math&gt;B_2&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm can be used for [[hierarchical clustering]] by repeatedly partitioning the subsets in this fashion.

== Algorithms ==

If the similarity matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has not already been explicitly constructed, the efficiency of spectral clustering may be improved if the solution to the corresponding eigenvalue problem is performed in a [[Matrix-free methods|matrix-free fashion]] (without explicitly manipulating or even computing the similarity matrix), as in the [[Lanczos algorithm]].

For large-sized graphs, the second eigenvalue  of the (normalized) graph [[Laplacian matrix]] is often [[ill-conditioned]], leading to slow convergence of iterative eigenvalue solvers. [[Preconditioner#Preconditioning for eigenvalue problems|Preconditioning]] is a key technology accelerating the convergence, e.g., in the matrix-free [[LOBPCG]] method. Spectral clustering has been successfully applied on large graphs by first identifying their [[community structure]], and then clustering communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zare|first=Habil |author2=P.

Spectral clustering is closely related to [[nonlinear dimensionality reduction]], and dimension reduction techniques such as locally-linear embedding can be used to reduce errors from noise or outliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Free software to implement spectral clustering is available in large open source projects like [[Scikit-learn]] &lt;ref&gt;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#spectral-clustering&lt;/ref&gt; using [[LOBPCG]] with [[multigrid]] [[preconditioning]] or [[ARPACK]], [[Apache Spark#MLlib Machine Learning Library\MLlib|MLlib]] for pseudo-eigenvector clustering using the [[power iteration]] method,&lt;ref&gt;http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-clustering.html#power-iteration-clustering-pic&lt;/ref&gt; and [[R (programming language)|R]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kernlab&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with ''k''-means ==
The kernel ''k''-means problem is an extension of the ''k''-means problem where the input data points are mapped non-linearly into a higher-dimensional feature space via a kernel function &lt;math&gt;k(x_i,x_j) = \varphi^T(x_i)\varphi(x_j)&lt;/math&gt;. The weighted kernel ''k''-means problem further extends this problem by defining a weight &lt;math&gt;w_r&lt;/math&gt; for each cluster as the reciprocal of the number of elements in the cluster,
:&lt;math&gt;
\max_{\{C_s\}} \sum_{r=1}^k w_r \sum_{x_i,x_j \in C_r} k(x_i,x_j).
&lt;/math&gt;
Suppose &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix of the normalizing coefficients for each point for each cluster &lt;math&gt;F_{ij} = w_r&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;i,j \in C_r&lt;/math&gt; and zero otherwise. Suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the kernel matrix for all points. The weighted kernel ''k''-means problem with n points and k clusters is given as,
:&lt;math&gt;
\max_F \operatorname{trace} (KF)
&lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt;
F = G_{n\times k}G_{k\times n}^T
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
G^TG = I
&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}(G) = k&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, there are identity constrains on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; given by,
:&lt;math&gt;
F\cdot \mathbb{I} = \mathbb{I}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt; represents a vector of ones.
:&lt;math&gt;
F^T\mathbb{I} = \mathbb{I}
&lt;/math&gt;
This problem can be recast as,
:&lt;math&gt;
\max_G \operatorname{trace}(G^TG).
&lt;/math&gt;
This problem is equivalent to the spectral clustering problem when the identity constraints on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; are relaxed. In particular, the weighted kernel ''k''-means problem can be reformulated as a spectral clustering (graph partitioning) problem and vice versa. The output of the algorithms are eigenvectors which do not satisfy the identity requirements for indicator variables defined by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, post-processing of the eigenvectors is required for the equivalence between the problems.&lt;ref name="dhillon2004kernel"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Transforming the spectral clustering problem into a weighted kernel ''k''-means problem greatly reduces the computational burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhillon|first=Inderjit|author2=Yuqiang Guan |author3=Brian Kulis |title=Weighted Graph Cuts without Eigenvectors:  A Multilevel Approach|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date=November 2007|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1–14|doi=10.1109/tpami.2007.1115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They said that a clustering was an (α, ε)-clustering if the [[Conductance (graph)|conductance]] of each cluster (in the clustering) was at least α and the weight of the inter-cluster edges was at most ε fraction of the total weight of all the edges in the graph. They also look at two approximation algorithms in the same paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4664">In [[modal logic]], '''standard translation''' is a way of transforming formulas of modal logic into formulas of [[first-order logic]] which capture the meaning of the modal formulas. Standard translation is [[Recursive definition|defined inductively]] on the structure of the formula. In short, [[atomic formula]]s are mapped onto [[Unary operation|unary]] [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s and the objects in the first-order language are the [[Accessibility relation|accessible worlds]]. The [[logical connective]]s from [[propositional logic]] remain untouched and the modal operators are transformed into first-order formulas according to their [[Kripke semantics|semantics]].

== Definition ==

Standard translation is defined as follows:

*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(p) \equiv P(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is an [[atomic formula]]; P(x) is true when &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; holds in world &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(\top) \equiv \top&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(\bot) \equiv \bot&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(\neg \varphi) \equiv \neg ST_x(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(\varphi \wedge \psi) \equiv ST_x(\varphi) \wedge ST_x(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(\varphi \vee \psi) \equiv ST_x(\varphi) \vee ST_x(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(\varphi \rightarrow \psi) \equiv ST_x(\varphi) \rightarrow ST_x(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(\Diamond_m \varphi) \equiv \exists y ( R_m(x, y) \wedge ST_y(\varphi))&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;ST_x(\Box_m \varphi) \equiv \forall y ( R_m(x, y) \rightarrow ST_y(\varphi))&lt;/math&gt;

In the above, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the world from which the formula is evaluated. Initially, a [[Free variables and bound variables|free variable]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is used and whenever a modal operator needs to be translated, a fresh variable is introduced to indicate that the remainder of the formula needs to be evaluated from that world. Here, the subscript &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; refers to the [[accessibility relation]] that should be used: normally, &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; refer to a relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Kripke semantics|Kripke model]] but more than one accessibility relation can exist (a [[multimodal logic]]) in which case subscripts are used. For example, &lt;math&gt;\Box_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond_a&lt;/math&gt; refer to an accessibility relation &lt;math&gt;R_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Box_b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond_b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_b&lt;/math&gt; in the model. Alternatively, it can also be placed inside the modal symbol.

== Example ==

As an example, when standard translation is applied to &lt;math&gt;\Box \Box p&lt;/math&gt;, we expand the outer box to get

: &lt;math&gt;\forall y ( R(x, y) \rightarrow ST_y(\Box p))&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that we have now moved from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to an accessible world &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and we now evaluate the remainder of the formula, &lt;math&gt;\Box p&lt;/math&gt;, in each of those accessible worlds.

The whole standard translation of this example becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\forall y ( R(x, y) \rightarrow (\forall z ( R(y, z) \rightarrow P(z))))&lt;/math&gt;

which precisely captures the semantics of two boxes in modal logic. The formula &lt;math&gt;\Box \Box p&lt;/math&gt; holds in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; when for all accessible worlds &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and for all accessible worlds &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, the predicate &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the formula is also true when no such accessible worlds exist. In case &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has no accessible worlds then &lt;math&gt;R(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is false but the whole formula is [[Vacuous truth|vacuously true]]: an [[Logical implication|implication]] is also true when the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is false.

== Standard translation and modal depth ==

The [[modal depth]] of a formula also becomes apparent in the translation to first-order logic. When the modal depth of a formula is ''k'', then the first-order logic formula contains a 'chain' of ''k'' transitions from the starting world &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The worlds are 'chained' in the sense that these worlds are visited by going from accessible to accessible world. Informally, the number of transitions in the 'longest chain' of transitions in the first-order formula is the modal depth of the formula.

The modal depth of the formula used in the example above is two. The first-order formula indicates that the transitions from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and from &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are needed to verify the validity of the formula. This is also the modal depth of the formula as each modal operator increases the modal depth by one.

An '''''ε''-net''' (pronounced [[epsilon]]-net) in [[computational geometry]] is the approximation of a general set by a collection of simpler subsets. In [[probability theory]] it is the approximation of one probability distribution by another.

== Background ==

[[File:Unit square ɛ-net.svg|right|thumb|An ε-net with ε&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/4 of the unit square in the range space where the ranges are closed filled rectangles.]]
Let ''X'' be a set and R be a set of subsets of ''X''; such a pair is called a ''range space'' or [[hypergraph]], and the elements of ''R'' are called ''ranges'' or ''hyperedges''. An '''ε-net''' of a subset ''P'' of ''X'' is a subset ''N'' of ''P'' such that any range ''r''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;R with |''r''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''P''|&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''ε''|''P''| intersects&amp;nbsp;''N''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For example, suppose ''X'' is the set of points in the two-dimensional plane, ''R'' is the set of closed filled rectangles (products of closed intervals), and ''P'' is the unit square [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Then the set N consisting of the 8 points shown in the adjacent diagram is a 1/4-net of P, because any closed filled rectangle intersecting at least 1/4 of the unit square must intersect one of these points. In fact, any (axis-parallel) square, regardless of size, will have a similar 8-point 1/4-net.

For any range space with finite [[VC dimension]] ''d'', regardless of the choice of P, there exists an ε-net of ''P'' of size

: &lt;math&gt;O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon} \log \frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right);&lt;/math&gt;

because the size of this set is independent of ''P'', any set ''P'' can be described using a set of fixed size.

This facilitates the development of efficient [[approximation algorithm]]s. For example, suppose we wish to estimate an upper bound on the area of a given region, that falls inside a particular rectangle ''P''. One can estimate this to within an additive factor of ''ε'' times the area of ''P'' by first finding an ''ε''-net of ''P'', counting the proportion of elements in the ε-net falling inside the region with respect to the rectangle ''P'', and then multiplying by the area of&amp;nbsp;''P''. The runtime of the algorithm depends only on ''ε'' and not&amp;nbsp;''P''. One straightforward way to compute an ε-net with high probability is to take a sufficient number of random points, where the number of random points also depends only on&amp;nbsp;''ε''. For example, in the diagram shown, any rectangle in the unit square containing at most three points in the 1/4-net has an area of at most&amp;nbsp;3/8&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5/8.

ε-nets also provide approximation algorithms for the [[NP-complete]] [[hitting set problem|hitting set]] and [[set cover problem|set cover]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Probability theory ==

Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability distribution]] over some set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. An '''&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-net''' for a class &lt;math&gt;H \subseteq 2^X&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is any subset &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that
for any &lt;math&gt;h \in H&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(h) \ge \varepsilon \quad \Longrightarrow \quad S\cap h \neq \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; approximates the probability distribution.

A stronger notion is &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approximation. An '''&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approximation''' for class &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subset &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;h \in H&lt;/math&gt; it holds

:&lt;math&gt;\left| P(h) - \frac{|S \cap h|}{|S|} \right| &lt; \varepsilon .&lt;/math&gt;
