The '''1972 Olympics Black Power Salute''' was a political protest by two US Olympic runners [[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] and [[Wayne Collett]] during the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] at the [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]].  This event is sometimes referred to as "The Forgotten Protest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedendurance.com/2011/02/01/vince-matthews-and-wayne-collette-1972-the-forgotten-protest/|title=Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett 1972 – The Forgotten Protest?|author=Jimson Lee|work=SpeedEndurance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event came four years after the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/24/sport/olympics-norman-black-power/|title=The third man: The forgotten Black Power hero|author=James Montague, CNN|date=24 April 2012|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the games==
Matthews was a 1968 Olympian who had retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ma/vince-matthews-1.html|title=Vince Matthews|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was frustrated by problems that included having to pay his own travel to the US Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hartmann | first=D. | title=Race, Culture, and the Revolt of the Black Athlete: The 1968 Olympic Protests and Their Aftermath | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-226-31855-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KNvIe2JE0vIC&amp;pg=PA241 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protest==
Both runners refused to stand for the US National Anthem.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schiller | first=K. | last2=Young | first2=C. | title=The 1972 Munich Olympics and the Making of Modern Germany | publisher=University of California Press | series=Weimar and now | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-520-26213-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxEQEqnXdRAC&amp;pg=PT134 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They subsequently stroked their beards, and twirled their medals as they left the stadium.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; The crowd booed both runners for their display.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/17/local/la-me-wayne-collett18-2010mar18|title=Wayne Collett dies at 60; UCLA sprinter won silver medal at '72 Olympics|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reaction==
The [[Associated Press]] noted that the casual behavior of Matthews and Collett during the playing of the anthem as "disrespectful," and described the conduct as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Collett, bare-footed, leaped from the No. 2 tier to the No. 1 stand beside his teammate.  They stood sideways to the flag, twirling their medals, with Matthews stroking his chin. Their shoulders slumped, neither stood erect nor looked at the flag. ... As whistles and catcalls continued, Collett raised a clenched fist to the crowd before entering the portal of the dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milburn, Matthews Win Gold, But U.S. Trails|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=September 8, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gpwcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mWYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5359,2754393&amp;dq=wayne+collett&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Markus reported in the Chicago Tribune on September 9, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/09/09/page/229/|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Matthews] was angry at Coach Bill Bowerman-as most of the U.S. trackmen seem to be-because Bowerman had hinted he would like to remove him from the place he had earned in the 400-meter field. He was angry that he had been forced to train on his own in unsuitable facilities, had to travel 4 or 5 times from N.Y. to the west coast in order to get any kind of competition, and had been put down by some of the press as a drag on America's hopes for a 400-meter sweep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Chicago Tribune further reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/09/09/page/227/|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Matthews said his and Collett's actions were directed at the U.S. coaching staff, not the flag or the National Anthem. "We were just mad about a lot of things. We didn't think it would blow up like this. We were asked to apologize. I'm not really sorry for what I did. I'm sorry for the way people took it [hoots and whistles from the stands when the anthem finished]. What I tried to get across to the Olympic Committee was if it was pre-meditated I could have done something better than that. It was just something that happened. We didn't realize the implications to the people in the stands."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview after the medal ceremony with the [[American Broadcasting Company]], Collett said the [[national anthem]] meant nothing to him.&lt;ref name=MJ&gt;{{cite news|author=Chuck Johnson|title=Matthews, Collett Barred for Conduct on Victory Stand|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=September 8, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cMAdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oygEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7196,4127118&amp;dq=wayne+collett&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He explained that he had felt unable to honor the anthem, because of the struggle faced by [[African American]]s at the time: "I couldn't stand there and sing the words because I don't believe they're true. I wish they were. I believe we have the potential to have a beautiful country, but I don't think we do." The pair were banned from future Olympic competition by the IOC; since [[John Smith (sprinter)|John Smith]] had pulled a hamstring 80 meters into the final while leading and had been ruled unfit to run, the USA were now unable to field a team in the [[4 × 400 metres relay|4 × 400 m relay]] and were forced to scratch from the event.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;

===Athlete statements===
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wasn't acting any differently than I usually do, but we were like goldfish in a fishbowl, in front of all those people. If they wanted me to stand at attention, I could've probably done that, but it wouldn't be me, and I was led to believe that the Olympics was for the athlete. We consider ourselves athletes, not politicians, or marching bands. Our athletic competition was over, and we were both happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/merron/030205.html|title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Violating the Olympic spirit|work=go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==After the games==
Matthews was banned from all future Olympic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Vincent+Matthews+banned&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=njf4IVrOwi&amp;sig=JH18ql10zlU9ayOguLiIDL6LvMg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xF8uVY3-KsuKyATe4YGACA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vincent%20Matthews%20banned&amp;f=false%7ctitle=Jet%7cwork=google.com|title=Jet|work=google.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both runners in fact received a lifelong ban from the IOC and the USOC.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; This banning likely cost the US medals in the 4x400.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; Both runners were eventually elected to the Black Olympian Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KdbR4eqgfEC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=Vincent+Matthews+Wayne+Collett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiCNVyOHE4&amp;sig=X8bd-DGcrE-KxhtW7acoiCA9AME&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UmIuVYuuEouoyQSArYHIAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Vincent%20Matthews%20Wayne%20Collett&amp;f=false|title=Black Enterprise|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOC President [[Avery Brundage]] stated the actions of Matthews and Collett made for  a "disgusting display."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/wayne-collett-athlete-who-staged-a-black-power-protest-at-the-1972-olympic-games-1956018.html|title=Wayne Collett: Athlete who staged a Black Power protest at the 1972 Olympic Games|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; This display by the athletes would be overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Collett went on to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; In 2011, Matthews was elected to the USATF Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatf.org/halloffame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=249|title=USATF - Hall of Fame|work=usatf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Action theory''' (or '''theory of action''') is an area in [[philosophy]] concerned with [[Theory|theories]] about the processes [[Causality|causing]] [[Will (philosophy)|willful]] [[Motor system|human bodily movements]] of a more or less complex kind. This [[List of academic disciplines|area of thought]] involves epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, jurisprudence, and philosophy of mind, and has attracted the strong interest of philosophers ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Third Book). With the advent of [[psychology]] and later [[neuroscience]], many theories of action are now subject to [[empirical test]]ing.

Philosophical action theory, or the '''philosophy of action''', should not be confused with [[sociological]] theories of [[social action]], such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] established by [[Talcott Parsons]].

== Overview ==
Basic action theory typically describes action as behavior caused by an ''agent'' in a particular ''situation''. The agent's ''desires'' and ''beliefs'' (e.g. my wanting a glass of water and believing the clear liquid in the cup in front of me is water) lead to bodily behavior (e.g. reaching over for the glass). In the simple theory (see [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]), the desire and belief jointly cause the action. [[Michael Bratman]] has raised problems for such a view and argued that we should take the concept of intention as basic and not analyzable into beliefs and desires.

In some theories a desire plus a belief about the means of satisfying that desire are always what is behind an action. Agents aim, in acting, to maximize the satisfaction of their desires. Such a theory of prospective rationality underlies much of [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s within the more sophisticated framework of [[rational choice]]. However, many theories of action argue that rationality extends far beyond calculating the best means to achieve one's ends. For instance, a belief that I ought to do X, in some theories, can directly cause me to do X without my having to want to do X (i.e. have a desire to do X). Rationality, in such theories, also involves responding correctly to the reasons an agent perceives, not just acting on wants.

While action theorists generally employ the language of [[causality]] in their theories of what the nature of action is, the issue of what causal determination comes to has been central to controversies about the nature of [[free will]].

Conceptual discussions also revolve around a precise definition of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] in philosophy. Scholars may disagree on which bodily movements fall under this category, e.g. whether thinking should be analysed as action, and how complex actions involving several steps to be taken and diverse intended consequences are to be summarised or decomposed.

The '''Bengali Language Movement''' in Manbhum was a movement in [[Manbhum]] district, present day [[Purulia district]] of West Bengal state, during the late 1940s to mid-1950s, to fight for [[Bengali language]] and to protest against the forcible imposition of [[Hindi language]] to the Bengali speaking people.

== Background ==
In 1765, the nominal Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] was defeated to the [[British East India Company]] in the [[Battle of Buxar]]. He granted "Diwani" (right to collect revenue) of Bengal (which included [[Bihar]] to the East India Company.{{cn|date=April 2014}} The East India Company started Tax-Collection process in the Jungal-Mahal area. To have a greater Control over the area, East India Company split the area into smaller districts like Panchet (1773), Jungle-Mahal (1805) and Manbhum (1833).{{cn|date=April 2014}} The Manbhum District was formed with an area of 7,896 square miles. The district of Manbhum was again split in 1845, 1846, 1871 and finally in 1879, and as a result the area of Manbhum was reduced to 4,112 square miles.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purulia.nic.in/distAdmin/departments/dico/bhasa_andolon.html|title=HISTORICAL EVENT: BHASA ANDOLON|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Partition of Bengal was started in 1905, and, as an effect of that, a new state, Bihar-Odisha, was formed. The Manbhum District was included to the Bihar-Odisha. The whole district started protesting against the inclusion. The language movement or Bhasa Andolon had started as a demand to include Manbhum District as a part of Bengal.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt;

== Early days of movement ==
At the time of [[independence of India]] in 1947, Manbhum district was a part of Bihar. From 1948 Bengali speaking peoples of Manbhum district started suffering as restrictions on Bengali language as well as forcible imposition of Hindi language over Bengali speaking people had started. Bengali officers of Manbhum district were transferred to the others districts of Bihar, D.I. of school issued notice to teach Hindi from Primary classes, Bengali department was closed in zilla school. Installation of notice board in Hindi language become Compulsory for the schools and business establishment. Presenting the Domicile Certificate became mandatory for the Bengalis of Manbhum District. Hindi was declared as official language of Manbhum District.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt;

== The Movement ==
After seeing the plight of Bengali speaking people, a proposal to make the Bengali as the language of Manbhum district has given. But it was defeated in 43–55&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt; at the Congress Party on 30 May 1948. On 14 June 1948 the Lok Sevak Sangha was established to protect Bengali Language as well as to fight for forcible imposition of Hindi Language over the Bengali Language as the state policy of the then Bihar government. The government restricted the use of Bengali language in education to the Bengali speaking people of Manbhum District. The government banned rallies also. All these incident sparked the protest to the fullest in Manbhum District.

Lok Sevak Sangha started the agitation in various level.

* Satyagraha Andolan (Non-violent agitation) (1949–1951)
* Hal Joal Andolan
* Tusu Satyagraha Andolan (9 Jan – 8 Feb 1954)
   
Thousands of Bengali people of Manbhum district with the song ''Shun Bihari-bhai / Tora Rakhte Larbi / Dang Dekhai… … (O Bihari-brothers/ You cannot keep us in Bihar / We are showing you sticks… …)'' went to jail. The Bar association, Purulia Municipality and Communist party also joined this agitation.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt;

== Post Movement Effect ==
As an effect of this agitation a commission named "State Re Organization Commission" was set up by the Central government on 23 December 1953. The Commission held hearing in Manbhum district on 5 February 1955 and submitted its report on 10 October 1955. In its report the commission proposed the formation of a new district "Purulia", primarily dominated by Bengali speaking people to West Bengal from erstwhile Manbhum district of Bihar.The new Purulia district comprised 19 Police stations from the then Manbhum district. But as a Special request from TISCO the then Chief minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chndra Roy gave consent for accession of three police station (Patamda, Ichagarh and Chandil) to the Bihar.

On 1 November 1956 with 16 Police stations, 2007 square mile area and with a population of {{formatnum:1169097}} the new district Purulia was acceded to West Bengal.&lt;ref name="purulia.gov.in" /&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], '''Bodhisattva''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|oʊ|d|iː|ˈ|s|ʌ|t|v|ə}} {{respell|BOH|dee|SUT|və}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bodhisattva "Bodhisattva"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Sanskrit]] term for anyone who has generated [[Bodhicitta]], a spontaneous wish and compassionate mind to attain [[Buddhahood]] for the benefit of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow'': A Practical Guide to Helping Others, page 1, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-50-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in [[Buddhist art]].

==Origins and outlines==
In early Buddhism, the term ''bodhisattva'' was primarily used to refer specifically to [[Gautama Buddha]] (a contemporary of [[Mahavira]]) in his former life.&lt;ref name="AC75"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda |authorlink=Ananda Coomaraswamy |title=Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism |year=1975 |publisher=University Books |location=Boston|page=225 |lccn=64056434 |quote="[T]he term Bodhisattva, or Wisdom-being, first used of [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]] between the Going-forth and the attainment of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nibbāna]], came to mean a Buddha-designate...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70982/bodhisattva|title=bodhisattva - Buddhist ideal|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jataka tales]], which are the stories of the Buddha's past lives, depict the various attempts of the bodhisattva to embrace qualities like self-sacrifice and morality.&lt;ref name="Brit" /&gt; The bodhisattva is also called a pusa. This is one who had achieved Buddhahood but chooses to remain in merciful attachment to the world. In Sanskrit this is called a Avalokitesvara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feuchtwang |first1=Stephan |title=Religions in the Modern World |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |pages=154 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Jataka tales]], the term "bodhisattva" originally referred to the pre-enlightened practitioner of austerities that surpassed [[Śrāvakayāna]] and [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]] by far and completed the "Bodhisattvayāna" ([[Mahayana|Mahayāna Buddhism]]). [[Mount Potalaka]], for example, is one of Bodhisattvayana. The term for practitioners who have not yet reached Bodhisattvayāna was not fixed, but the terms ''Śrāvaka-Bodhisattva'' (聲聞菩薩) and ''Pratyekabuddha-Bodhisattva'' (縁覚菩薩) had already appeared in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]]s of early Indian Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/ddb-sat2.php?key=%E5%A3%B0%E8%81%9E%E8%8F%A9%E8%96%A9&amp;mode=search&amp;uarsers%5B0%5D=%E9%98%BF%E5%90%AB%E9%83%A8 聲聞菩薩 (Śrāvaka-Bodhisattva)]. 阿含部 (Āgama); Text Database of [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]]. (accessed: January 15, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/ddb-sat2.php?key=%E7%B8%81%E8%A6%9A%E8%8F%A9%E8%96%A9&amp;mode=search&amp;uarsers%5B0%5D=%E9%98%BF%E5%90%AB%E9%83%A8 縁覚菩薩 (Pratyekabuddha-Bodhisattva)]. 阿含部 (Āgama); Text Database of Taishō Tripiṭaka. (accessed: January 15, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahayana Buddhism did not place much emphasis in honoring the Śrāvakayāna or Pratyekabuddhayāna since they were classified as part of the "[[Hinayana]]", but praise of the general Bodhisattvayāna was commonplace. Because Hinayana was disliked and the terms Śrāvaka-Bodhisattva or Pratyekabuddha-Bodhisattva were not widely used, while usage of the general term "bodhisattva" had grown in popularity. Nevertheless, "bodhisattva" retained an implied reference to someone on the path to become an [[arhat]] or [[pratyekabuddha]]. In contrast, the goal of the bodhisattva path is to achieve ''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism|samyaksambodhi]].'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gethin|first1=Rupert|title=The foundations of Buddhism|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [England]|isbn=0-19-289223-1|pages=224–234|edition=1. publ. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and Theravāda Buddhism==

&lt;!-- "Merit § Merit and Nirvana" links here --&gt;
[[File:Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara-BMA.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of [[Avalokiteśvara]]. [[Sri Lanka]], ca. 750 CE.]]

In [[early Buddhism]], the equivalent [[Pali]] term ''bodhisatta'' is used in the [[Pāli Canon]] to refer to Gautama Buddha in his previous lives&lt;ref&gt;Basham, A.L. (1981). The evolution of the concept of the bodhisattva. In: Leslie S Kawamura, The Bodhisattva doctrine in Buddhism, Published for the Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion by Wilfred Laurier University Press, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and as a young man in his current life in the period during which he was working towards his own [[moksha|liberation]]. During his discourses, to recount his experiences as a young aspirant he regularly uses the phrase "When I was an unenlightened bodhisatta..." The term therefore connotes a being who is "bound for enlightenment", in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the Pāli canon, the bodhisatta is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are featured in the Jataka tales.

According to the Theravāda monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the bodhisattva path is not taught in the earliest strata of Buddhist texts such as the Pali [[Nikayas]] (and their counterparts such as the Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]]) which instead focus on the ideal of the [[Arahant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/arahantsbodhisattvas.html|title=Arahants, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later [[Theravada#Scriptures|Theravada literature]], the term "bodhisatta" is used fairly frequently in the sense of someone on the path to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nt.med.ncku.edu.tw/biochem/lsn/newrain/books/sou/sou1.htm 南傳菩薩道（上）] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410162534/http://nt.med.ncku.edu.tw/biochem/lsn/newrain/books/sou/sou1.htm |date=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The later tradition of commentary also recognizes two additional types of bodhisattas: the ''paccekabodhisatta'', who will attain [[Pratyekabuddha|Paccekabuddhahood]], and the ''savakabodhisatta'', who will attain enlightenment as a disciple of a Buddha. In the 1st-2nd century BCE Sri Lankan work, the [[Buddhavamsa]], the idea of the person who makes a Bodhisatta vow to become a fully enlightened Buddha out of compassion for all sentient  beings is presented. Another related concept outlined in the Buddhavamsa and in another text called the [[Cariyapitaka]] is the need to cultivate certain Bodhisatta perfections or [[paramitas]]

[[Image:DevoteeDetail.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Probable early image of a Bodhisattva ([[Bimaran casket]], 50 CE).&lt;ref name="Crossroads"&gt;"The crossroads of Asia", edited by Ellizabeth Errington and [[Joe Cribb]], The ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, {{ISBN|0951839918}}, p.189-190&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Kings of [[Sri Lanka]] were often described as bodhisattvas, starting at least as early as Sirisanghabodhi (r. 247-249), who was renowned for his compassion, took vows for the welfare of the citizens, and was regarded as a [[Mahāsattva|mahāsatta]] (Sanskrit ''mahāsattva''), an epithet used almost exclusively in Mahayana Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''Buddha in the Crown : Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Traditions of Sri Lanka.'' 1991. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Many other Sri Lankan kings from the 3rd until the 15th century were also described as bodhisattvas and their royal duties were sometimes clearly associated with the practice of the Ten Pāramitās.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''Buddha in the Crown : Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Traditions of Sri Lanka.'' 1991. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravadin [[bhikkhu]] and scholar [[Walpola Rahula]] stated that the bodhisattva ideal has traditionally been held to be higher than the state of a ''śrāvaka'' not only in Mahayana but also in Theravada Buddhism. He also quotes the 10th century king of Sri Lanka, [[List of Sri Lankan monarchs#House of Lambakanna II .28691.E2.80.931017.29|Mahinda IV]] (956-972 CE), who had the words inscribed "none but the bodhisattvas will become kings of a prosperous Lanka," among other examples.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''Buddha in the Crown : Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Traditions of Sri Lanka.'' 1991. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|But the fact is that both the Theravada and the Mahayana unanimously accept the Bodhisattva ideal as the highest...Although the Theravada holds that anybody can be a Bodhisattva, it does not stipulate or insist that all must be Bodhisattva which is considered not practical.|Walpola Rahula, ''Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha126.htm|title=Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism (from ''Gems of Buddhist Wisdom'')|author=Rahula, Walpola|publisher=Buddhist Missionary Society, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in [[Thailand]] are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas.
{{quote|Cholvijarn observes that prominent figures associated with the [[Dhammakaya Movement|Self perspective]] in Thailand have often been famous outside scholarly circles as well, among the wider populace, as Buddhist meditation masters and sources of miracles and sacred [[amulet]]s. Like perhaps some of the early Mahāyāna forest hermit monks, or the later Buddhist Tantrics, they have become people of power through their meditative achievements. They are widely revered, worshipped, and held to be [[arhat]]s or (note!) bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 1989, page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Jeffrey Samuels, it "may more accurately portray the differences that exist between the two yanas by referring  to Mahayana Buddhism as a vehicle in which the bodhisattva ideal is more universally applied, and  to Theravada Buddhism as a vehicle in which the bodhisattva ideal is reserved for and appropriated by certain exceptional people."&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, J. THE BODHISATTVA IDEAL IN THERAVAADA, BUDDHIST THEORY AND PRACTICE: A REEVALUATION OF THE BODHISATTVA-`SRAAVAKA OPPOSITION; Philosophy East and West Volume 47, Number 3 July 1997 P.399-415 (C) by University of Hawai'i Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Mahāyāna Buddhism==

===Bodhisattva ideal===
[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva.
According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' ("Great Vehicle") was originally even an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', or the "Bodhisattva Vehicle."&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174"&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'' contains a simple and brief definition for the term ''bodhisattva'', which is also the earliest known Mahāyāna definition.&lt;ref&gt;Mall, Linnart. ''Studies in the Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita and Other Essays.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2005. pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. ''A history of Indian Buddhism: from Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2007. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is given as the following.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. ''The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines and its Verse Summary.'' Grey Fox Press. 2001. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Because he has enlightenment as his aim, a bodhisattva-[[mahāsattva]] is so called.}}

The earliest depiction of the Bodhisattva path in texts such as the [[Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra]] describe it as an arduous, difficult monastic path suited only for the few which is nevertheless the most glorious path one can take. Three kinds of Bodhisattvas are mentioned in the early Mahayana texts: the forest, city, and monastery Bodhisattvas - with forest dwelling being promoted a superior, even necessary path in sutras such as the Ugraparipṛcchā and the [[Samadhiraja Sutra|Samadhiraja]] sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Rastrapalapariprccha sutra also promotes a solitary life of meditation in the forests, far away from the distractions of the householder life. The Rastrapala is also highly critical of monks living in monasteries and in cities who are seen as not practicing meditation and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ratnagunasamcayagatha also says the Bodhisattva should undertake ascetic practices ([[dhutanga]]), "wander freely without a home", practice the [[paramitas]] and train under a guru in order to perfect his meditation practice and realization of [[prajnaparamita]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 255.&lt;/ref&gt; These texts seem to indicate the initial Bodhisattva ideal was associated with a strict forest [[asceticism]].

Mahāyāna Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas and to take the [[bodhisattva vows]]. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] by practicing the six perfections.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others'', pages 4-12, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-50-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indelibly entwined with the bodhisattva vow is [[parinamana|merit transference]] (''pariṇāmanā'').

In the ''[[Lotus Sūtra]]'', life in this world is compared to people living in a house that is on fire. People take this world as reality pursuing worldly projects and pleasures without realizing that the house is ablaze and will soon burn down (due to the inevitability of suffering). A bodhisattva is one who has a determination to free sentient beings from [[samsara]] and its cycle of death, rebirth and suffering. This type of mind is known as the [[bodhicitta|mind of awakening]] (''bodhicitta'').

A commonly repeated misconception in Western literature is that bodhisattvas delay their own liberation. This confusion is based on a misreading of several different scriptural concepts and narratives. One of these is the Tibetan teaching on three types of motivation for generating bodhicitta. According to [[Patrul Rinpoche]]'s 19th century ''Words of My Perfect Teacher'' (''Kun bzang bla ma'i gzhal lung''), a bodhisattva might be motivated in one of three ways. They are:
# King-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha first in order to then help sentient beings.
# Boatman-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha at the same time as other sentient beings.
# Shepherd-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha only after all other sentient beings have done so.

These three are not types of people, but rather types of motivation. According to Patrul Rinpoche, the third quality of intention is most noble though the mode by which buddhahood actually occurs is the first; that is, it is only possible to teach others the path to enlightenment once one has attained enlightenment oneself.&lt;ref&gt; ''Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of A Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism.'' Translated by The Padmakara Translation Group. (Walnut Creek: Altamira, 1994), 218. &lt;/ref&gt; The ritualized formulation of the bodhisattva vow also reflects this order (becoming a buddha so that one can then teach others to do the same). A bodhisattva vow ritual text attributed to [[Nāgārjuna]], of the second-third century CE, states the vow as follows: "Just as the past tathāgata arhat samyaksambuddhas, when engaging in the behavior of a bodhisattva, generated the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom, in the same way, I whose name is so-and-so, from this time forward, generate the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom." &lt;ref&gt; Nagārjuna. ''Byang chub mchog tu sems bskyed pa'i cho ga (Bodhicittotpadaviddhi, Ritual for Generating the Intention for Supreme Buddhahood).'' Toh. 3966 Tengyur, mdo, ''gi''. (sems can thams cad bsgral ba dang/ sems can thams cad dgrol ba dang/ sems can thams cad dbugs dbyung ba dang/ sems can thams cad yongs su mya ngan las 'da' ba dang/ sems can thams cad thams cad mkhyen pa'i ye shes la dgod pa'i slad du ci ltar bla na med pa yang dag par rdzogs pa'i byang chub tu thugs bskyed pa de bzhin du bdag ming 'di zhes bgyi ba yang dus 'di nas bzung)  &lt;/ref&gt; 

Another reason for the misconception that a bodhisattva "delays" liberation is that a bodhisattva rejects the liberation of the śravaka and pratyekabuddha, described in Mahāyāna literature as either inferior (as in [[Asaṅga]]'s fourth century ''[[Yogācārabhūmi]]'') or nonexistent (as in the ''Lotus Sūtra'').&lt;ref&gt; "bodhisattva" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 135. &lt;/ref&gt; That a bodhisattva has the option to pursue such a lesser path, but instead chooses the long path towards buddhahood is one of the five criteria for one to be considered a bodhisattva. The other four are: being human, being a man, making a vow to become a buddha in the presence of a previous buddha, and receiving a prophecy from that buddha. 

The six perfections that constitute bodhisattva practice should not be confused with the actual acts of benefiting beings that the bodhisattva vows to accomplish once he or she is a buddha. The six perfections are a mental transformation and need not actually benefit anyone. This is seen in the story of [[Vessantara]], an incarnation of Śākyamuni Buddha while he was still a bodhisattva, who commits the ultimate act of generosity by giving away his children to an evil man who mistreats them. Vessantara's actual acts do not benefit beings; in fact, he causes direct harm. However, the merit from his perfection of generosity fructifies in his lifetime as Śākyamuni Buddha when he attains complete enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt; "Vessantara" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 965. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten grounds===

According to many traditions within Mahāyāna Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or ''[[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bhūmis]].'' Below is the list of the ten ''bhūmis'' and their descriptions according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' and ''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation,'' a treatise by [[Gampopa]], an influential teacher of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] [[Kagyu]] school. (Other schools give slightly variant descriptions.)

Before a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of five paths:
#the path of accumulation
#the path of preparation

The ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths
#''bhūmi'' 1 the path of insight
#''bhūmis'' 2-7 the path of meditation
#''bhūmis'' 8-10 the path of no more learning

The chapter of ten grounds in the ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'' refers to 52 stages. The 10 grounds are:

#'''Great Joy:''' It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this ''bhūmi'' the bodhisattvas practice all [[paramita|perfections]] (''pāramitās''), but especially emphasizing [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]] (''dāna'').
#'''Stainless:''' In accomplishing the second ''bhūmi'', the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this ''bhūmi'' is named "stainless". The emphasized perfection is [[śila|moral discipline]] (''śīla'').
#'''Luminous:''' The light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva who accomplishes the third ''bhūmi''. The emphasized perfection is [[kṣanti|patience]] (''{{IAST|kṣānti}}'').
#'''Radiant:''' This ''bhūmi'' it is said to be like a radiating light that fully burns that which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is [[vīrya|vigor]] (''vīrya'').
#'''Very difficult to train:''' Bodhisattvas who attain this ground strive to help sentient beings attain maturity, and do not become emotionally involved when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection is [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|meditative concentration]] (''dhyāna'').
#'''Obviously Transcendent:''' By depending on the perfection of wisdom, [the bodhisattva] does not abide in either ''[[saṃsāra|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]]'' or ''[[nirvāṇa|{{IAST|nirvāṇa}}]]'', so this state is "obviously transcendent".  The emphasized perfection is [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''prajñā'').
#'''Gone afar:''' Particular emphasis is on the perfection of [[upaya|skillful means]] (''upāya''), to help others.
#'''Immovable:''' The emphasized virtue is aspiration. This "immovable" ''bhūmi'' is where one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.
#'''Good Discriminating Wisdom:''' The emphasized virtue is power.
#'''Cloud of Dharma:''' The emphasized virtue is the practice of primordial wisdom.

After the ten ''bhūmis'', according to Mahāyāna Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment and becomes a Buddha.

With the 52 stages, the ''[[Shurangama Sutra|Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'' recognizes 57 stages. With the 10 grounds, various [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] schools recognize 3–10 additional grounds, mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_more.asp?lm2=603|title=ԲϢ - Ŀ ļ|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908080747/http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_more.asp?lm2=603|archive-date=8 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akanistha.blogspot.com/2009/08/blog-post_4818.html|title=吉祥鄔金密嚴寺|author=鄔金旺度|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a ''[[mahāsattva]]''. Some bodhisattvas such as [[Samantabhadra]] are also said to have already attained buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111105090211/http://wisdom.buddhistdoor.com/alankwan/2009/09/13/459-%E5%9B%A0%E5%9C%B0%E8%8F%A9%E8%96%A9%E5%92%8C%E6%9E%9C%E5%9C%B0%E8%8F%A9%E8%96%A9/ 459 因地菩薩和果地菩薩]&lt;/ref&gt;

===School doctrines===

Some sutras said a beginner would take 3–22 countless eons (''[[asaṃkhyeya|mahāsaṃkhyeya]] [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]'') to become a buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinawts.com/list/budedu1/082718255.htm 三大阿僧祇劫] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121061430/http://www.chinawts.com/list/budedu1/082718255.htm |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaa.org.tw/Chen_voice/a_2008_11_25.pdf 成佛的目的是到每一個世界去度眾生.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411014117/http://aaa.org.tw/Chen_voice/a_2008_11_25.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwayue.org.tw/lama/question4_08.htm 即身成就與三大阿僧祇劫之修行] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526210637/http://www.hwayue.org.tw/lama/question4_08.htm |date=May 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pure Land Buddhism]] suggests buddhists go to the [[pure land]]s to practice as bodhisattvas. [[Tiantai]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], [[Zen]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] schools say they teach ways to attain buddhahood within one karmic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bukon.idv.tw/mantra/b11.htm|title=顯教與密教|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yinshun.org/Enlightenment/1997/1997oct/1999oct1.htm 「無諍之辯」導讀]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various traditions within Buddhism believe in specific bodhisattvas. Some bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen as separate entities. For example, [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] believe in various forms of [[Chenrezig]], who is [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]] in Sanskrit, [[Guanyin]] in China, Gwan-eum in Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and [[Kannon]] in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the [[Dalai Lama]]s and the [[Karmapa]]s to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.

[[Ksitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]] is another popular bodhisattva in Japan and China. He is known for aiding those who are lost. His greatest compassionate vow is:

{{quote|If I do not go to the hell to help the suffering beings there, who else will go? ... if the hells are not empty I will not become a Buddha. Only when all living beings have been saved, will I attain [[Bodhi]].}}

The place of a bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] or the acts of [[Dharma]], is known as a ''[[bodhimaṇḍa]]'', and may be a site of [[pilgrimage]]. Many temples and monasteries are famous as bodhimaṇḍas. Perhaps the most famous bodhimaṇḍa of all is the [[Bodhi Tree]] under which [[Shakyamuni|Śākyamuṇi]] achieved buddhahood. In the tradition of [[Chinese Buddhism]], there are four mountains that are regarded as bodhimaṇḍas for bodhisattvas, with each site having major monasteries and being popular for pilgrimages by both monastics and laypeople. These four bodhimandas are:

* [[Putuoshan|Mount Putuo]]: Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva
* [[Mount Emei]]: Samantabhadra Bodhisattva
* [[Mount Wutai]]: Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva
* [[Mount Jiuhua]]: Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva

'''4 Great Bodhisattvas''' (in Chinese Buddhism)&amp;nbsp;

四大菩薩. &amp;nbsp;(菩薩 is short for菩提薩埵)

In this order: Compassion, Wisdom, Vow and Practice. 

悲 智 願 行&amp;nbsp;

1, [[Avalokitesvara]] Bodhisattva 觀世音 菩薩 short: 觀音 菩薩

Stands for Great Compassion.

2, [[Manjusri]] Bodhisattva&amp;nbsp; 文殊師利 菩薩 short: 文殊 菩薩

Stands for Great Wisdom.

3, [[Ksitigarbha]] Bodhisattva&amp;nbsp; 地藏 菩薩

Stands for Great Vow.

4, [[Samantabhadra]] Bodhisattva 普賢 菩薩

Stands for Great Practice.

'''Common employment''' was an historical defence in [[English tort law]] that said workers implicitly undertook the risks of being injured by their co-workers, with whom they were in "common employment". The [[US labor law]] terminology was the "'''fellow servant rule'''".

==Development==
The operation of the doctrine [[Precedent|was seen first]] in ''[[Priestly v Fowler]]'' in the United Kingdom. In the United States the doctrine was seen in ''[[Farwell v. Boston &amp; Worcester R.R. Corp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;45 Mass. 49 (1842)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fellow-Servant+Rule freedictionary.com's article].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bunker Hill Mining Company]] operated by the fellow servant doctrine.  According to Katherine Aiken, "persons engaged in the same common pursuit for the same employer were fellow servants and companies were not liable for injuries where a fellow servant was at fault.  Thus, either the miner himself or his coworker was ultimately responsible for accidents."  Between March 1893 and Feb. 1894, 15 fatalities occurred at the mine.&lt;ref name="Aiken"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aiken |first1=Katherine |title=Idaho's Bunker Hill: the rise and fall of a great mining company, 1885-1981 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman |isbn=9780806138985 |pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was abolished altogether by the [[Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948]] in the United Kingdom.

The doctrine has been superseded in the United States by [[worker's compensation]] laws, by which a worker can file for a [[quasi-tort]], regardless of their co-worker's fault.

The results of these analyses had often been questioned by defence lawyers and the press, so the FBI finally asked the [[United States National Academy of Science]]'s [[Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy]] to research the scientific merit of the process.

In 2004 the Board's study was summarized in "Forensic Analysis: Weighing Bullet Lead Evidence."  The Board determined that the chemical analyses were being performed correctly and were probably sufficient to determine correlation between two bullets from separate sources (the analysis used [[Atomic emission spectroscopy|plasma-optical emission spectroscopy]] to identify trace elements in the bullets).  The report also concluded that the seven trace elements selected for the analyses (arsenic, antimony, tin, copper, bismuth, silver and cadmium) are acceptable for sample correlation.  The report finally concluded that the procedure is the best available method for such correlations.  The greatest [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]] in the report was that the [[Statistics|statistical]] tests as applied by the FBI could cause confusion and misinterpretation when transmitted to prosecutors or when explained to a trial jury.  Because of the significance of this weakness, the report concluded that the analysis should be used with caution.  This report helped the FBI decide in 2004 to voluntarily cease offering the analysis to law-enforcement entities. The National Academy of Sciences never required that the FBI stop using the test.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;

''CNN PRESENTS Encore Presentation: Reasonable Doubt'' examined the unreliability of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=CNN PRESENTS-Encore Presentation: ''Reasonable Doubt''| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/07/cp.01.html | publisher=CNN | date=Aired May 7, 2006| accessdate=May 31, 2013| format=transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been discontinued as of September 1, 2005.&lt;ref name="FBI Press Release"&gt;{{cite press release| title=FBI Laboratory Announces Discontinuation of Bullet Lead Examinations| url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-laboratory-announces-discontinuation-of-bullet-lead-examinations| publisher=FBI National Press Office| date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. government]] has fought releasing the list of the estimated 2,500 cases over three decades in which it performed the analysis, which may have led to [[false conviction]]s. According to the FBI, only 20% of the 2,500 tests performed introduced the CBLA results into evidence at trial.&lt;ref name="FBI Press Release" /&gt;

On 17 December 2008, Jimmy Ates was released from a Florida prison after serving ten years on the conviction of having murdered his wife, a conviction obtained largely on the strength of a bullet-lead analysis.  His conviction was overturned as a consequence of the 2004 report.&lt;ref name=Bohaty&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bohaty| first=Rochelle F.

'''Counter-terrorism''' (also spelled '''counterterrorism''') incorporates the practice, [[military tactics]], techniques, and strategy that government, military, law enforcement, business, and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] use to combat or prevent [[terrorism]]. Counter-terrorism strategies include attempts to counter financing of terrorism.

If [[Definitions of terrorism|terrorism]] is part of a broader [[insurgency]], counter-terrorism may employ [[counter-insurgency]] measures. The [[United States Armed Forces]] use the term [[foreign internal defense]] for programs that support other countries in attempts to suppress insurgency, lawlessness, or subversion or to reduce the conditions under which these threats to security may develop.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Introduction to Foreign Internal Defense|url=https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-22-D01-FID-Introduction.pdf|journal=Curtis E.

== History ==
[[File:Special Irish Branch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Special Branch]] detectives on an undercover operation at the [[London Docks]], 1911.]]
In response to the escalating [[Fenian dynamite campaign|terror campaign]] in Britain carried out by the militant [[Fenians|Irish Fenians]] in the 1880s, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], established the first counter-terrorism unit ever. The [[Special Irish Branch]] was initially formed as a section of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] of the [[Metropolitan Police|London Metropolitan Police]] in 1883, to combat Irish republican terrorism through infiltration and subversion.

Harcourt envisioned a permanent unit dedicated to the prevention of politically motivated violence through the use of modern techniques such as [[undercover operation|undercover infiltration]]. This pioneering branch was the first to be trained in counter-terrorism techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dMMAQAAQBAJ|title=Counter-Terrorism, Human Rights and the Rule of Law: Crossing Legal Boundaries in Defence of the State|author=Aniceto Masferrer, Clive Walker|year=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning ==

=== Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ===
{{See also|Intelligence cycle management|Intelligence analysis|HUMINT|Counterintelligence}}
Most counter-terrorism strategies involve an increase in standard police and domestic intelligence. The central activities are traditional: [[telephone tapping|interception of communications]], and the tracing of persons. New technology has, however, expanded the range of [[Manhunt (military)|military]] and [[manhunt (law enforcement)|law enforcement]] operations.

[[File:לוחמי הקומנדו הימי.JPG|left|thumb|[[Shayetet 13]], the Israeli naval special forces.]]
Domestic intelligence is often directed at specific groups, defined on the basis of origin or religion, which is a source of political controversy. [[Mass surveillance]] of an entire population raises objections on [[civil liberties]] grounds. [[Homegrown terrorism|Homegrown terrorists]], especially [[Lone-wolf fighter|lone wolves]] are often harder to detect because of their citizenship or legal status and ability to stay under the radar.

To select the effective action when terrorism appears to be more of an isolated event, the appropriate government organizations need to understand the source, motivation, methods of preparation, and tactics of terrorist groups. Good intelligence is at the heart of such preparation, as well as political and social understanding of any grievances that might be solved. Ideally, one gets information from inside the group, a very difficult challenge for [[HUMINT]] because [[Clandestine cell system|operational terrorist cells]] are often small, with all members known to one another, perhaps even related.&lt;ref name=Feiler2007&gt;{{cite journal

[[Counterintelligence]] is a great challenge with the security of cell-based systems, since the ideal, but nearly impossible, goal is to obtain a [[Clandestine HUMINT|clandestine source]] within the cell. Financial tracking can play a role, as can [[SIGINT|communications intercept]], but both of these approaches need to be balanced against legitimate expectations of privacy.

=== Legal contexts ===
{{Main article|Anti-terrorism legislation}}
In response to the growing legislation.
; {{UK}}
* The United Kingdom has had anti-terrorism legislation in place for more than thirty years. The [[Prevention of Violence Act 1939]] was brought in response to an Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of violence under the [[S-Plan]]. This act had been allowed to expire in 1953 and was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] a response to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. From 1974 to 1989 the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually.
* In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent [[Terrorism Act 2000]], which contained many of their powers, and then the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].
* The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was formally introduced into the Parliament November 19, 2001 two months after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States. It received royal assent and went into force on December 13, 2001. On December 16, 2004 the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] it remained in force. The [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the [[Terrorism Act 2006]] creates new offences related to terrorism, and amends existing ones. The Act was drafted in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], and like its predecessors some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial.

Since 1978 the UK's terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared [[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]], whose often influential reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full.
;{{US}}
* U.S. legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of [[deadly force]] by law enforcement organizations.
* Search and seizure is governed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].
* The U.S. passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] after the September 11 attacks, as well as a range of other legislation and [[executive orders]] relating to national security.
* The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate anti-terrorism, as well as national response to major natural disasters and accidents.
* The [[Posse Comitatus Act]] limits domestic employment of the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]], requiring Presidential approval prior to deploying the Army and/or the Air Force. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] policy also applies this limitation to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]], because the Posse Comitatus Act doesn't cover naval services, even though they are federal military forces. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] can be employed domestically on Presidential order, as was done during the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[Beltway Sniper]] incidents.
* External or international use of lethal force would require a [[Presidential finding]].
* In February 2017, sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the U.S. government program [[Countering Violent Extremism Task Force|Countering Violent Extremism]] (CVE) to solely focus on Islamist extremism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources], Reuters 2017-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;

; {{AUS}}
* Australia has passed several anti-terrorism acts. In 2004, a bill comprising three acts [[Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004|Anti-terrorism Act, 2004, (No 2) and (No 3)]] was passed. Then Attorney-General, [[Philip Ruddock]], introduced the ''Anti-terrorism bill, 2004'' on March 31. He described it as ''"a bill to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects&amp;nbsp;– a task made more urgent following the recent tragic [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombings in Spain]]."'' He said that Australia's counter-terrorism laws "require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism." The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] supplemented the powers of the earlier acts. The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year. The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005#The "Shoot to Kill" Clause|Australian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2005]] included a "shoot-to-kill" clause. In a country with entrenched [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] traditions, the measures are controversial and have been criticized by [[civil libertarian]]s and [[Islam]]ic groups. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

; {{ISR}}
* Israel monitors a list of designated [[terrorist organization]]s and has laws forbidding membership in such organizations, funding or helping them in any way.
* On December 14, 2006 the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] ruled [[Israeli targeted killings|targeted killings]] were a permitted form of self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/Files_ENG/02/690/007/a34/02007690.a34.htm Summary of Israeli Supreme Court Ruling on Targeted Killings] December 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016 the Israeli [[Knesset]] passed a comprehensive law against terrorism, forbidding any kind of terrorism and support of terrorism, and setting severe punishments for terrorists. The law also regulate legal efforts against terrorism.&lt;ref name="Israel-ani-terror-law"&gt;{{cite news|title=Terror bill passes into law|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Terror-bill-passes-into-law-456857|accessdate=June 16, 2016|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|agency=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Walker Lindh Custody.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Walker Lindh]] was captured as an enemy combatant during the United States' [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]].]]
One of the primary difficulties of implementing effective counter-terrorist measures is the waning of civil liberties and individual privacy that such measures often entail, both for citizens of, and for those detained by states attempting to combat terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/accountability-and-transparency-in-the-united-states-counter-terrorism-strategy/ | title=Accountability and Transparency in the United States' Counter-Terrorism Strategy | date=22 January 2015 | publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism - The Hague (ICCT) | accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, measures designed to tighten security have been seen as [[abuses of power]] or even violations of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lydia-canaan/fighting-terrorism-withou_b_9513034.html Lydia Canaan, ''The Huffington Post'', March 21, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of these problems can include prolonged, incommunicado detention without judicial review or long periods of 'preventive detention';&lt;ref&gt;de Londras, Detention in the War on Terrorism: Can Human Rights Fight Back? (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; risk of subjecting to torture during the transfer, return and extradition of people between or within countries; and the adoption of security measures that restrain the rights or freedoms of citizens and breach principles of non-discrimination.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt; Examples include:
* In November 2003 [[Malaysia]] passed new counter-terrorism laws that were widely criticized by local human rights groups for being vague and overbroad. Critics claim that the laws put the basic rights of free expression, association, and assembly at risk. Malaysia persisted in holding around 100 alleged militants without trial, including five Malaysian students detained for alleged terrorist activity while studying in Karachi, Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt;
* In November 2003 a Canadian-Syrian national, Maher Arar, alleged publicly that he had been tortured in a Syrian prison after being handed over to the Syrian authorities by U.S.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt;
* In December 2003 Colombia's congress approved legislation that would give the military the power to arrest, tap telephones and carry out searches without warrants or any previous judicial order.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt;
* Images of unpopular treatment of detainees in US custody in Iraq and other locations have encouraged international scrutiny of US operations in the war on terror.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* Hundreds of foreign nationals remain in prolonged indefinite detention without charge or trial in Guantánamo Bay, despite international and US constitutional standards some groups believe outlaw such practices.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* Hundreds of people suspected of connections with the [[Taliban]] or al Qa'eda remain in long-term detention in Pakistan or in US-controlled centers in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* China has used the "war on terror" to justify its policies in the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region to stifle Uighur identity.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* In Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen and other countries, scores of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in connection with suspected terrorist acts or links to opposition armed groups.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* Until 2005 eleven men remained in high security detention in the UK under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;

Many would argue that such violations could exacerbate rather than counter the terrorist threat.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt; Human rights advocates argue for the crucial role of human rights protection as an intrinsic part to fight against terrorism.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/preventive-counter-terrorism-measures-and-non-discrimination-in-the-european-union-the-need-for-systematic-evaluation/ |title=Preventive Counter-Terrorism Measures and Non-Discrimination in the European Union: The Need for Systematic Evaluation |date=2 July 2011 |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism-The Hague (ICCT) | accessdate= 6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests, as proponents of [[human security]] have long argued, that respecting human rights may indeed help us to incur security. [[Amnesty International]] included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the Madrid Agenda arising from the Madrid Summit on Democracy and Terrorism (Madrid March 8–11, 2005):

{{quote|Democratic principles and values are essential tools in the fight against terrorism. Any successful strategy for dealing with terrorism requires terrorists to be isolated. Consequently, the preference must be to treat terrorism as criminal acts to be handled through existing systems of law enforcement and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We recommend: (1) taking effective measures to make impunity impossible either for acts of terrorism or for the abuse of human rights in counter-terrorism measures. (2) the incorporation of human rights laws in all anti-terrorism programmes and policies of national governments as well as international bodies."&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005"&gt;Amnesty International (2005): "Counter-terrorism and criminal law in the EU. [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior61/013/2005/en/ online] &lt;/ref&gt;}}

While international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states, proponents of human rights (as well as [[human security]]) have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation. They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the international effort to cooperate to combat terrorism.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004"&gt;Human Rights News (2004): "Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism", in the Briefing to the 60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/01/29/global7127.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preemptive neutralization ===
Some countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy. This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack. [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Russia]] have taken this approach, while Western European states generally do not.

Another major method of preemptive neutralization is [[interrogation]] of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots, targets, the identity of other terrorists, whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement. Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase [[suggestibility]], such as [[sleep deprivation]] or drugs. Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment, or due to the confusion brought on by it. These methods are not tolerated by European powers. In 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the [[Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978)|Ireland v. United Kingdom]] case that [[five techniques|such methods]] amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, and that such practices were in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] Article 3 (art. 3).

==== Non-military ====
The [[human security]] paradigm outlines a non-military approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity. Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and [[sustainability]] for all people. Such activities empower citizens providing 'freedom from fear' and 'freedom from want'.

This can take many forms including the provision of clean drinking water, education, vaccination programs, provision of food and shelter and protection from violence, military or otherwise. Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors including governments, [[NGOs]], and citizens.

[[Foreign internal defense]] programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government. FID can involve both non-military and military aspects of counter-terrorism.

A 2017 study found that "governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Foreign Aid as a Counterterrorism Tool - Burcu Savun, Daniel C. Tirone,|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717704952|language=en|doi=10.1177/0022002717704952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Military ====
[[File:U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Ryan Burks, a squad leader with Fox Company, 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, Regimental Combat Team 7, provides security during a mission rehearsal at Camp Bastion, Helmand province 130527-M-QZ858-089.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines in Afghanistan]]
Terrorism has often been used to justify military intervention in countries like Pakistan where terrorists are said to be based. That was the main stated justification for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]]. It was also a stated justification for the [[second Russian invasion of Chechnya]].

Military intervention has not always been successful in stopping or preventing future terrorism, like during the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Mau Mau uprising]], and most of the campaigns against the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] during the [[Irish Civil War]], the [[S-Plan]], the [[Border Campaign (IRA)]] and [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. Although military action can disrupt a terrorist group's operations temporarily, it sometimes doesn't end the threat completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Thus repression by the military in itself (particularly if it is not accompanied by other measures) usually leads to short term victories, but tend to be unsuccessful in the long run (e.g. the French's doctrine described in [[Roger Trinquier]]'s book ''Modern War''&lt;ref name=Trinquier&gt;{{cite web

However, new methods (see the new ''Counterinsurgency'' Field Manual&lt;ref name = FM3-24&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = US Department of the Army | first1 = John A. | last1 = Nagl | first2 = David H.| last2 = Petraeus | first3 = James F. | last3 =Amos |first4 = Sarah | last4 = Sewall

== Preparation ==
Police, fire, and emergency medical response organizations have obvious roles. Local [[firefighter]]s and emergency medical personnel (often called "first responders") have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks, although police may deal with threats of such attacks.

=== Target-hardening ===

Whatever the target of terrorists, there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark, or reducing the damage of attacks. One method is to place [[Hostile vehicle mitigation]] to enforce protective standoff distance outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and [[truck bomb]]ing. Another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Aircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights, and have reinforced doors, which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening. UK [[railway stations]] removed their [[waste container|rubbish bins]] in response to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] threat, as convenient locations for depositing bombs.

Scottish stations removed theirs after the [[7 July 2005 London Bombings]] as a precautionary measure. The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] purchased bomb-resistant barriers after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Iron Dome Intercepts Rockets from the Gaza Strip.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Dome]] air defense system. It intercepts artillery rockets fired by terrorist onto Israeli cities and towns.]]
As [[Israel]] is suffering from constant shelling of its cities, towns and settlements by [[artillery rocket]]s from the [[Gaza Strip]] (mainly by [[Hamas]], but also by other Palestinian factions) and [[Lebanon]] (mainly by [[Hezbollah]]), Israel developed several defensive measures against artillery, rockets and missiles. These include building a [[bomb shelter]] in every building and [[school]], but also deploying active protection systems like the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow ABM]], [[Iron Dome]] and [[David's Sling]] batteries which intercept the incoming threat in the air. [[Iron Dome]] has successfully intercepted hundreds of [[Qassam rocket]]s and [[Grad rocket]]s fired by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.

A more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked. Terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] or the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Industrial chemicals in manufacturing, shipping, and storage need greater protection, and some efforts are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put this risk into perspective, the first [[Poison gas in World War I#1915: large scale use and lethal gases|major lethal chemical attack in WWI]] used 160 tons of chlorine. Industrial shipments of chlorine, widely used in water purification and the chemical industry, travel in 90 or 55 ton tank cars.

To give one more example, the North American electrical grid has already demonstrated, in the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], its vulnerability to natural disasters coupled with inadequate, possibly insecure, [[SCADA]] (supervisory control and data acquisition) networks. Part of the vulnerability is due to deregulation leading to much more interconnection in a grid designed for only occasional power-selling between utilities. A small number of terrorists, attacking key power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers, could wreak havoc.

Equipping likely targets with containers (i.e., bags) of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by suicide bombers. The technique was apparently used on a limited scale by British authorities in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | title = Suicide bombing 'pig fat threat

 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach stems from the idea that Muslims perpetrating the attack would not want to be "soiled" by the lard in the moment prior to dying. The idea has been suggested more recently as a deterrent to suicide bombings in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/57793
 | title = Swine: Secret Weapon Against Islamic Terror?

 | journal = ArutzSheva
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual effectiveness of this tactic is probably limited as it is possible that a sympathetic Islamic scholar could issue a [[fatwa]] proclaiming that a suicide bomber would not be polluted by the swine products.

=== Command and control ===
In North America and other continents, for a threatened or completed terrorist attack, the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is apt to be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response. ICS has varied levels of escalation, such as might be needed for multiple incidents in a given area (&lt;!-- This bracket is unbalanced! Please correct.--&gt;e.g., [[Attacks on the London Underground#2005 terrorist bomb attacks|the 2005 bombings in London]] or the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], or all the way to a [[National Response Plan]] invocation if national-level resources are needed. National response, for example, might be needed for a nuclear, biological, radiological, or large chemical attack.

=== Damage mitigation ===
[[Fire department]]s, perhaps supplemented by public works agencies, utility providers (e.g., gas, water, electricity), and heavy construction contractors, are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack.

=== Local security ===
Again under an incident command model, local police can isolate the incident area, reducing confusion, and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists, often using [[#Counter-terrorism tactical units|specialized counter-terrorist tactical units]].  Bringing in such units will normally involve civil or military authority beyond the local level.

=== Medical services ===
[[Emergency medical services]] will triage, treat, and transport the more seriously affected victims to hospitals, which will also need to have mass casualty and [[triage]] plans in place.

[[Public health surveillance|Public health agencies]], from local to national level, may be designated to deal with identification, and sometimes mitigation, of possible biological attacks, and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination.

== Tactical units ==
[[File:UTK PGK broke the door.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Malaysia Police]] ''Pasukan Gerakan Khas'' officers]]

Today, many countries have [[List of special police units|special units]] designated to handle terrorist threats. Besides various [[security agency|security agencies]], there are [[Special Weapons And Tactics|elite tactical units]], also known as [[Special Mission Unit|special mission units]], whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks.
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:NSG Air Assault Mumbai Attacks.jpg|left|thumb|224x224px|[[National Security Guard|NSG]] commandos launching their assault on terrorist occupied [[Nariman House]] during the [[2008 Mumbai Attacks]]]] --&gt;
Such units perform both in preventive actions, [[hostage rescue]] and responding to on-going attacks. Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counter-terrorist teams. Tactics, techniques and procedures for [[Manhunt (military)|manhunting]] are under constant development.

Most of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area, or threaten to do so. It is far harder to deal with assassination, or even reprisals on individuals, due to the short (if any) warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These units are specially trained in [[military tactics|tactics]] and are very well equipped for [[close quarters battle|CQB]] with emphasis on stealth and performing the mission with minimal casualties. The units include take-over force (assault teams), [[sniper]]s, [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] experts, dog handlers and intelligence officers. See [[Counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism organizations]] for national command, intelligence, and incident mitigation.

The majority of counter-terrorism operations at the tactical level, are conducted by state, federal and national [[police|law enforcement agencies]] or [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]. In some countries, the military may be called in as a last resort. Obviously, for countries whose military are legally permitted to conduct police operations, this is a non-issue, and such counter-terrorism operations are conducted by their military.

See [[counter-intelligence]] for command, intelligence and warning, and incident mitigation aspects of counter-terror.

=== Designing Anti-terrorism systems ===

[[File:Transparent garbage bins at Central station.jpg|thumb|Transparent garbage bin installed at Central station in Sydney so police can check its contents]]

The scope for Anti-terrorism systems is very large in physical terms (long borders, vast areas, high traffic volumes in busy cities, etc.) as well as in other dimensions, such as type and degree of terrorism threat, political and diplomatic ramifications, and legal issues. In this environment, the development of a persistent Anti-terrorism protection system is a daunting task. Such a system should bring together diverse state-of-the-art technologies to enable persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and enable potential actions. Designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project.

A particular design problem for this system is that it will face many [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the future. The threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more. A potential solution is to incorporate [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as [[uncertainty]] unfolds and updated information arrives. And the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario, but an array of scenarios. Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available. Using these '[[real options]]' will create a flexible Anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01160.x| title = Reducing Risk Through Real Options in Systems Design: The Case of Architecting a Maritime Domain Protection System| year = 2009| last1 = Buurman | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = S. | last3 = Babovic | first3 = V. | journal = Risk Analysis| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 366–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law enforcement/Police ===
While some countries with longstanding terrorism problems, such as Israel, have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks,&lt;ref&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark (2000). Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in other nations, counter-terrorism is a relatively more recent objective of civilian police and law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="Deflem"&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 2010. The Policing of Terrorism: Organizational and Global Perspectives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu and Samantha Hauptman. 2013. "Policing International Terrorism." Pp. 64–72 in Globalisation and the Challenge to Criminology, edited by Francis Pakes. London: Routledge. [http://deflem.blogspot.com/2013/01/policinginternationalterrorism.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some civil-libertarians and criminal justice scholars have called-out efforts of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism as futile and expensive&lt;ref name="HelmsCostanzaJohnson"&gt;Helms, Ronald; Costanza, S.E and Johnson, N.. 2011. "Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror." http://www.palgrave-journals.com/sj/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/sj20116a.html&lt;/ref&gt; or as threats to civil liberties,&lt;ref name="HelmsCostanzaJohnson" /&gt; other scholars have begun describing and analyzing the most important dimensions of the policing of terrorism as an important dimension of counterterrorism, especially in the post-9/11 era, and have argued how police institutions view terrorism as a matter of crime control.&lt;ref name="Deflem" /&gt; Such analyses bring out the civilian police role in counterterrorism next to the military model of a 'war on terror'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bayer. 2010.

=== Counter-Terrorism and American Law Enforcement ===
[[File:FBI Hostage Rescue Team Agents bei einer Übung.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hostage Rescue Team]] agents]]
Pursuant to passage of the [[Homeland Security Act of 2002]], federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies began to systemically reorganize.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, S.E., Kilburn Jr., John C. 2005. "Symbolic Security, Moral Panic and Public Sentiment: Toward a sociology of Counterterrorism", Journal of Social and Ecological Boundaries, 1(2): 106–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, M. 2004. "Social Control and the Policing of Terrorism Foundations for a sociology of Counterterrorism." American Sociologist. 35 (2): 75–92. [http://deflem.blogspot.com/2004/08/social-control-and-policing-of.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Two primary federal agencies (the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS)) house most of the federal agencies that are prepared to combat domestic and international terrorist attacks. These include the [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]], the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] and the [[FBI]].

Following suit from federal changes pursuant to 9/11, however, most state and local law enforcement agencies began to include a commitment to "fighting terrorism" in their mission statements.&lt;ref&gt;DeLone, Gregory J. 2007. "Law Enforcement Mission Statements Post September 11." Police Quarterly 10(2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathieu Deflem. 2010. The Policing of Terrorism: Organizational and Global Perspectives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Local agencies began to establish more patterned lines of communication with federal agencies.  Some scholars have doubted the ability of local police to help in the war on terror and suggest their limited manpower is still best utilized by engaging community and targeting street crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, Ronald;  Costanza, S.E and Johnson, N. 2011. "Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror." http://www.palgrave-journals.com/sj/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/sj20116a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While counter-terror measures (most notably heightened airport security, immigrant [[Racial profiling|profiling]]&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, D., J. Hoopes, and T.L. Quinlan.  2003 "Defining racial profiling in a post-September 11 world." American Criminal Law Review. 40(3): 1195–1233.&lt;/ref&gt; and border patrol) have been adapted during the last decade, to enhance counter-terror in law enforcement, there have been remarkable limitations to assessing the actual utility/effectiveness of law enforcement practices that are ostensibly preventative.&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn, John C, Jr; Costanza, S.E.; Metchik, Eric and Borgeson, Kevin (2011) "Policing Terror Threats and False Positives:  Employing a Signal Detection Model to Examine Changes in National and Local Policing Strategy between 2001–2007" Security Journal 24, 19–36&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while sweeping changes in counter-terrorism rhetoric redefined most American post 9/11 law enforcement agencies in theory, it is hard to assess how well such hyperbole has translated into practice.

In [[intelligence-led policing]](ILP) efforts, the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e.: Neighborhood Watch, Gun Abatement, Foot Patrols, etc.) is usually to assess total financial costs against clearance rates or arrest rates. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena,&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn Jr., John C. and Costanza, S.E.  2009  "Immigration and Homeland Security"  published in Battleground: Immigration (Ed: Judith Ann Warner); Greenwood Publishing, Ca.&lt;/ref&gt; measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security. Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas in a way that is accessible.

=== Military ===

{{details| List of special forces units}}
[[File:ARW 30th Anniversary - 4478058309.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ireland|Irish]] [[Army Ranger Wing]] operators during counter-terrorism training exercise.]]Given the nature of operational counter-terrorism tasks national military organizations do not generally have dedicated units whose sole responsibility is the prosecution of these tasks. Instead the counter-terrorism function is an element of the role, allowing flexibility in their employment, with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context.

In some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena; [[United States Department of Defense]] policy, based on the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], forbids domestic counter-terrorism operations by the U.S. military. Units allocated some operational counter-terrorism task are frequently [[Special Forces]] or similar assets.

In cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. such as the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]], the British police formally turned responsibility over to the [[Special Air Service]] when the situation went beyond police capabilities.

[[File:UMANA Debutante Ball 2010.jpeg|thumb|Traditional [[Ukrainian American]] debutante ball at Chicago's [[Palmer House]] Hotel.]]

A '''debutante''' or '''deb''' (from {{lang-fr|débutante}}, "female beginner") is a young woman of  [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] or upper-class family background who has reached maturity and, as a new [[adult]], comes out into society at a formal "debut" or possibly [[debutante ball]]. Originally, the term meant the woman was old enough to be [[marriage|married]], and part of the purpose of her coming out was to display her to eligible [[bachelor]]s and their families with a view to marriage within a select circle.

==Australia==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Harrison Fisher illustration - The Princess Elopes by Harold MacGrath - Project Gutenberg eText 17391.jpg|thumb|Harrison Fisher illustration, from ''The Princess Elopes'' by [[Harold MacGrath]]]]
In [[Australia]], débutante balls (or colloquially "deb balls") are usually organised by high schools, church groups or service clubs, such as Lions or Rotary. The girls who take part are in either Year 10, 11 or 12 at high school (i.e. aged between 15 and 18). The event is often used as a fund-raiser for local charities.

The Australian debutante wears a white or pale-coloured gown similar to a wedding dress. However, the dress does not come with a train on the skirt, and the debutante does not wear a veil. The boy wears [[black tie]] or another formal dress suit.

It is customary for the female to ask a male to the débutante ball, with males not being able to "do the deb" unless they are asked. The débutantes and their partners must learn how to [[ballroom dance]]. Débutante balls are almost always held in a reception centre, school hall, the function room of a sporting or other community organisation venue e.g. [[Returned and Services League of Australia#Licensed clubs|RSL club]], or [[ballroom]]. Usually they are held late in the year and consist of dinner, dancing, and speeches.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the last débutantes were presented at Court in 1958, after which Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] abolished the ceremony. Attempts were made to keep the tradition going by organising a series of parties for young girls who might otherwise have been presented at Court in their first season (to which suitable young men were also invited) by [[Peter Townend (editor)|Peter Townend]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the withdrawal of royal patronage made these occasions increasingly insignificant, and scarcely distinguishable from any other part of the social season.&lt;ref&gt;The semi-autobiographical novel ''Past Imperfect'' by Julian Fellowes 2008 is an informative description of partaking in 'The Season' in these final years compared to its height.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression "débutante", or "deb" for short, has continued to be used, especially in the [[mass media|press]], to refer to young girls of marriageable age who participate in a semi-public upper class social scene. The expression "deb's delight" is applied to good looking unmarried young men from similar backgrounds.

The presentation of débutantes to the Sovereign at [[Court of St. James's|Court]] marked the start of the British [[Season (society)|social season]]. Applications for young women to be presented at court were required to be made by ladies who themselves had been presented to the Sovereign; the young woman's mother, for example, or someone known to the family. A mother-in-law who herself had been presented might, for example, present her new daughter-in-law.

The presentation of debutantes at court was also a way for young girls of marriageable age to be presented to suitable [[bachelors]] and their families in the hopes of finding a suitable husband. Bachelors, in turn, used the court presentation as a chance to find a suitable wife. Those who wanted to be presented at court were required to apply for permission to do so; if the application was accepted, they would be sent a royal summons from the [[Lord Chamberlain]] to attend the Presentation on a certain day. According to [[Debrett's]], the proceedings on that day always started at 10&amp;nbsp;am. As well as débutantes, older women, and married women who had not previously been presented could be presented at Court.

On the day of the court presentation, the débutante and her sponsor would be announced, the debutante would curtsy to the Sovereign, and then she would leave without turning her back.

The [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court dress]] has traditionally been a white [[Evening gown|evening dress]], but shades of ivory and pink were acceptable. The white dress featured short sleeves and white gloves, a veil attached to the hair with three white [[ostrich]] feathers, and a train, which the débutante would hold on her arm until she was ready to be presented. Débutantes would also wear [[pearls]] but many would also wear jewellery that belonged to the family.

After the débutantes were presented to the monarch, they would attend the [[Season (society)|social season]]. The season consisted of events such as afternoon [[tea party (social gathering)|tea parties]], [[polo]] matches, races at [[Ascot Racecourse|Royal Ascot]], and [[ball (dance)|balls]]. Many débutantes would also have their own "coming-out party" or, alternatively, a party shared with a sister or other member of family.

===American debutante balls===
[[File:58th International Debutante Ball 2012, New York City (Waldorf-Astoria Hotel).jpg|thumb|58th International Debutante Ball, 2012, New York City (Waldorf-Astoria Hotel)]]
A [[Cotillion ball|cotillion]] or débutante ball in the United States is a formal presentation of young ladies, débutantes, to "[[upper class|polite society]]", typically hosted by a charity or society. The ladies introduced can vary from the ages of 16 to 18 (younger ages are more typical of Southern regions, while older are more common place in the North). In some areas 15- and 16-year-olds are called "junior débutantes".

One of the most prestigious, the most exclusive and the most expensive debutante balls in the world is the invitation-only [[International Debutante Ball]] held at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City, where girls from prominent world families are presented to [[High society (social class)|high society]]. The International Debutante Ball has presented [[princess]]es, countesses, baronesses and many European royalty and [[Aristocracy|aristocrats]] as debutantes to high society, including [[Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia]], Vanessa [[House of Bismarck|von Bismarck]] (great-great-granddaughter of [[Otto von Bismarck]]), Princess Natalya Elisabeth Davidovna [[Obolensky]] (granddaughter of the [[Ivan Obolensky (son)|Prince Ivan Obolensky]], who is the Chairman of the International Debutante Ball and himself the grandson of [[John Jacob Astor IV]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; founder of the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria Hotel]]), Princess Ines de [[Bourbon-Parma|Bourbon Parme]], Countess Magdalena [[Habsburg-Lothringen]] (great-great-granddaughter of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth "Sisi" of Austria]]) and Lady Henrietta Seymour (daughter of the [[Duke of Somerset|Duke and Duchess of Somerset]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In vogue on NYSD|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/legacy/partypictures/2007/01_08_07/partypictures01_08_07.php|publisher=NYSD|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daughters and granddaughters of [[billionaire]] businessmen, American politicians, senators, congressmen, ambassadors and even many [[United States presidents|United States Presidents]] have also been presented at the International Debutante Ball; for example, [[Tricia Nixon Cox|Tricia Nixon]], [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower|Julie Nixon]], [[Jennie Eisenhower]], Ashley Walker [[Bush family|Bush]] (granddaughter of [[President George H. W. Bush]] and niece of [[President George W. Bush]]), Lucinda Robb (granddaughter of [[President Lyndon B. Johnson]]), Christine Colby (daughter of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director [[William Colby]]), Hollister Knowlton (future wife of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director [[David Petraeus]]), Charlotte and Catherine Forbes (granddaughters of [[Malcolm Forbes]]) and Christina Huffington (daughter of [[Arianna Huffington]] of the Huffington Post).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christine M.

To gain entrance to a debutante ball, débutantes must usually be recommended by a distinguished committee or sponsored by an established member of élite society, typically their mothers or other female relatives. Wearing white gowns and satin or kid gloves, the débutantes stand in a receiving line, and then are introduced individually to the audience. The débutante is announced and then is walked around the stage, guided by her father who then presents her. Her younger male escort then joins her and escorts her away. Each débutante brings at least one escort, sometimes two. Many débutante balls select escorts and then pair them with the debs to promote good social pairings. Cotillions may be elaborate formal affairs and involve not only "debs" but junior débutantes, escorts and ushers, flower girls and pages as well. Every débutante must perform a [[Curtsey|curtsy]] also known as the St. James Bow or a full court bow, with the exception of [[Texas]] débutantes who are presented at the [[International Debutante Ball]] at New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria Hotel]], who perform the "[[Texas dip|Texas Dip]]". This gesture is made as the young woman is formally presented. Débutante balls exist in nearly every major city in the United States but are more common and larger affairs in the American South. The Christmas Cotillion in Savannah, Georgia, first held in 1817, is the oldest débutante ball in the United States. Many cities such as Dallas and Atlanta have several balls in a season. Dallas, for example, is home of the traditional Idlewild organisation, as well as more modern organisations such as the Dallas Symphony Orchestra Presentation Ball and La Fiesta de las Seis Banderas, both of which benefit charities. The [[The National Debutante Cotillion and Thanksgiving Ball|National Cotillion and Thanksgiving Ball of Washington, DC.]], hosted by Mary-Stuart Montague Price, has met every November for over 60 years with proceeds going to Children's Hospital.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], a débutante is usually presented during the Carnival season. In New York City, there are still several deb balls. One that draws from all over the world is the International Debutante Ball. Also, there are other charity and social balls such as the Infirmary (benefits the local hospital), the Society of Mayflower Descendants Ball, and the [[Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York]] Ball (founded 1835). As an alternative to a ball, and more commonly in the old North, a young woman might have her own "coming-out party", given by her parents.&lt;ref&gt;However, in the case of Helen Barney, the term "débutante ball" was applied to the "coming-out party" given her by her uncle, [[William Collins Whitney]], at his home at 871 Fifth Avenue in New York City on 5 January 1901. Cleveland Amory, ''Who Killed Society?'', pp. 502–503. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a collective ball, which would be only held at a certain time of the year, such a party could be at any time of the year, but might well be scheduled around the débutante's birthday or graduation from high school or university. In theory, the only women who could be invited would be those who had already made their débuts, thus affording a sort of rank-order to the débutante season. "Old-money" families often send their preteen sons and daughters to dancing classes, called cotillion, and etiquette lessons in preparation for these parties, which launch their children into society and act as major networking events. Even less grand débutante balls typically require debs to attend a few lessons in social dance, comportment, and in executing their curtsy.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The African American community has a long tradition of charitable events and activities since the early 20th century. A large portion of these activities happened during social events and formal activities, namely, cotillions and debutante balls. It was at these events that those African Americans who had the means to expand their wealth were able to meet with other successful African Americans, and make social and political and economic connections. These formal cotillion and debutante balls still thrive as a viable outlet for those seeking success to participate in one of the most traditional vestiges of the [[African American upper class]].&lt;ref name=CotillionsColor&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Adrienne |title=About Cotillions of Color |url=http://cotillionsofcolor.wordpress.com/about/ |work=Cotillions of Color |accessdate=28 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308082738/http://cotillionsofcolor.wordpress.com/about/ |archivedate=8 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DrewNews&gt;{{cite web|last=Hann|first=Christopher|title=The Lost History of Black Cotillions|url=http://www.drew.edu/news/2010/11/15/thelosthistoryofblackcotillions|work=Drew News|publisher=Drew University|accessdate=28 February 2014|date=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews&gt;{{cite news|last=Casimir|first=Leslie|title=COTILLIONS MAKE A COMEBACK Courtly Tradition Updated By African-Americans|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/cotillions-comeback-courtly-tradition-updated-african-americans-article-1.639641|accessdate=28 February 2014|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=18 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Ukrainian American|Ukrainian émigré organisations in the United States]] such as the [[Ukrainian American Medical Association of North America]], the [[Ukrainian Engineers' Society of America]], [[Plast|Plast Ukrainian Scouting Organization]], and the [[Ukrainian Youth Association|Ukrainian American Youth Association]] have hosted annual [[black-tie]] debutante balls since [[World War II|the Second World War]] as fundraisers and introduce young Ukrainian ladies between the ages of 16 and 18 to their local Ukrainian communities. [[Ukrainian American]] debutante balls take place in many American cities such as Chicago, [[Philadelphia]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], Washington D.C., and [[Detroit]]. Besides the traditional [[waltz]] of the debutantes, one of the highlights of these balls is the [[Kolomyjka]] which usually takes place past midnight wherein every guest has the opportunity to spontaneously demonstrate their [[Ukrainian dance]] skills such as the [[Hopak]] or [[Arkan (dance)|Arkan]]. [[Kolomyjka]] dances tend to last upwards of a half-hour of nonstop [[Ukrainian dance|folk dancing]], ultimately returning to the traditional [[ball (dance)|black-tie ball]] atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In most areas of the United States, the debutante ball and coming out party have largely been replaced with a combination of the senior [[prom]] and the graduation party (see [[Academic graduation by country]]) which extend the "coming out" to include young adult males. The senior prom is a black-tie dance hosted by the school for high schoolers in their last year, seen as a teenage rite of passage. Prom season tends to last from April until May. Upon their child's graduation from high school, parents may throw him or her a high school graduation party to celebrate the achievement and the child's ascension into "adulthood". Graduation party season may last from May until June of each year, with multiple parties held each weekend, and the parent's coworkers, extended family, and members of the community are invited for networking, rather than solely the honoree's friends. Instead of a ball, these parties usually follow an informal [[open house (common school event)]] reception model or may be a [[garden party]], with guests coming and going as they please. Cash gifts and advice for the honoree are expected in most communities and it is considered insulting to decline attendance.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Debutante balls in U.S. television and films===
Several television series focused on young people from wealthy families include episodes with débutante events. "[[The Debut (The O.C. episode)|The Debut]]," an episode of ''[[The O.C.]]'' (a drama about upper middle class Californians), featured a representation of an American débutante ball. "[[Hi, Society]]," (season 1 episode 10), "[[They Shoot Humphreys, Don't They?]]," (season 3 episode 9), "[[Riding in Town Cars with Boys]] (season 5, episode 10), and "Monstrous Ball" (season 6, episode 5) of ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'', also from ''The O.C.'' creator [[Josh Schwartz]], features a débutante ball in New York City. "[[Presenting Lorelai Gilmore]]", an episode of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' shows [[Rory Gilmore]] as a débutante. She makes her debut at a [[Daughters of the American Revolution|Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR)]] débutante ball that her grandmother helped put together. In ''[[The Critic]]'', Jay Sherman's younger sister Margo is persuaded to reluctantly attend her débutante ball.

Crime dramas also have investigated début-related murders. "Zoo York," an episode of ''[[CSI: NY]]'', featured the CSI team investigating the murder of a débutante. Medical examiner Evan Zao comments that he attended a débutante ball. "Debut", an episode of ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', tells the story of a young girl who is murdered the night of her débutante ball. In an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', entitled "Streetwise", detectives investigated the rape and murder of a débutante.

Films with débutante themes include ''[[Metropolitan (1990 film)|Metropolitan]]'', [[Whit Stillman]]'s début feature film, a [[comedy of manners]] set during the deb season in Manhattan, and ''[[What a Girl Wants (film)|What a Girl Wants]]'', a 2003 film in which [[Amanda Bynes]] plays an American teen whose estranged father is a British Lord, and who is presented at a coming out party after being reunited with her mother. In another movie featuring Bynes, ''[[She's The Man]]'', the main character attends a debutantes preparation program throughout the movie which ends with the Debutante's ball''. [[Something New (film)|Something New]]'', a romantic comedy has a cotillion scene of upper class African Americans on the west coast. ''[[The Debut]]'', a film considered to be an accurate snapshot of contemporary Filipino American life, touches upon a wide variety of cultural themes within the plot of an informal débutante event. The 1992 film ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' is centred around the reconciliation of [[Gomez Addams|Gomez]] and [[Fester Addams]], who had had a falling out as teenagers when Gomez had wooed both his date and Fester's (Flora and Fauna Amore, the [[siamese twins]]) at the débutante ball.  In the 1994 film ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]'', a 'coming-out' party is thrown, Aunt March is also seen talking to Marmee about when Meg will be introduced into society.

In the premiere of ''[[The City (MTV series)|The City]]'', [[Whitney Port]]'s reality show, her co-worker [[Olivia Palermo]] describes her first pair of [[Manolo Blahnik]] shoes that she wore to her "Deb" back when she was 18 years of age.

In the [[Disney Channel]] made-for-TV movie ''Cow Belles'', starring Aly &amp; AJ, one of their characters gets kicked out of the ball for not having enough money.

In an episode of the Nickelodeon television series [[CatDog]], there is an entire story based on the debutante of the character Shriek, a member of a gang called the Greaser Dogs who happens to come from a wealthy family.

In season 4, episode 11, "Time's Arrow" of the Netflix original series [[BoJack Horseman]], Bojack's elderly mother with dementia, Beatrice Sugarman, recalls the time she met Bojack's father, Butterscotch Horseman, after he crashed her debutante ball.

==Latin America==
{{see also|Quinceañera}}

In Mexico, Dominican Republic, Panama, Puerto Rico and Paraguay, débutantes are young girls who take part in a ''Festival de Debutantes'', or a "Quince Años" upon their fifteenth birthday.

In Brazil and Mexico, such events are called ''Baile de Debutante'' (Spanish and Portuguese) or ''Festa de Debutante'' (only Portuguese), or ''Quince Años'' (Spanish) or ''Quinze Anos'' (Portuguese).

'''''Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information''''' is a popular [[science book]] by [[Vlatko Vedral]] published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2010. Vedral examines [[information theory]] and proposes [[information]] as the most fundamental building block of reality. He argues what a useful framework this is for viewing all natural and [[physical phenomena]]. In building out this framework the books touches upon the origin of information, the idea of [[entropy]], the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]], the replication of DNA, development of [[social networks]], [[quantum]] behaviour at the micro and macro level, and the very role of [[indeterminism]] in the universe. The book finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The ideas address concepts related to the nature of [[particles]], time, [[determinism]], and of reality itself.

==Contents==

==="Creation Ex Nihilo: Something from Nothing"===
Vedral believes in the principle that information is physical. ''[[Creation ex nihilo]]'' comes from [[Catholic]] dogma, the idea being that God created the universe out of nothing. Vedral says that invoking a supernatural being as an explanation for creation does not explain reality because the supernatural being would have to come into existence itself too somehow presumably from nothing (or else from an infinite regression of supernatural beings), thus of course the reality can come from nothing without a supernatural being. [[Occam's razor]] principle favours the simplest explanation. Vedral believes information is the fundamental building block of reality as it occurs at the macro level (economics, human behaviour etc.) as well as the subatomic level. Vedral argues that information is the only candidate for such a building block that can explain its own existence as information generates additional information that needs to be compressed thus generating more information. 'Annihilation of everything' is a more fitting term than ''creation ex nihilo'' Vedral states, as compression of possibilities is the process of how new information is created.

==="Information for all Seasons"===
Vedral uses an [[Italo Calvino]] philosophical story about a [[tarot]]-like card game as the kernel for his metaphor of conscious life arriving ''[[in medias res]]'' to a pre-existing contextual reality. In this game the individual observers/players (Vedral suggests: quantum physics, thermodynamics, biology, sociology, economics, philosophy) lay down cards with ambiguous meanings as an attempt to communicate messages to deduce meaning out of the other players' interactions. The results (information) of previous rounds establish contextual rules for observers/players in subsequent rounds. The point of this game is not established until the last card has been played as later cards can change the meaning of previous events, as in the case of the quantum explanation for the [[photoelectric effect]] instantly disproving [[classical physics]]. Vedral points out that in our reality there is no last card.

==="Back to Basics: Bits and Pieces"===
[[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] or information content measured as the surprise value of a particular event, is essentially inversely proportional to the logarithm of the event's probability, i = log(1/p). [[Claude Shannon]]'s information theory arose from research at [[Bell labs]], building upon [[George Boole|George Boole's]] digital logic. As information theory predicts common and easily predicted words tend to become shorter for optimal communication channel efficiency while less common words tend to be longer for redundancy and [[error correction]]. Vedral compares the process of life to [[John von Neumann]]'s self replicating [[automata]]. These are enduring information carriers that will survive wear and tear of the individual by producing copies that can in turn go on to produce more copies.

==="Digital Romance: Life is a Four-Letter Word"===
Genetic code as an efficient digital information store, containing built in [[codon]] redundancy for error correction in transcription.

==="Murphy’s Law: I Knew this Would Happen to Me"===
Examines the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics and the process of information increasing entropy. [[Maxwell's Demon]] was thought to be a way around this inevitability, however such a demon would run out of information storage space and have to delete unwanted data thus having to do work to do so, increasing entropy.

==="Place Your Bets: In It to Win It"===
[[Blackjack]] as controlled risk taking using Shannon's information theory probability formulas. Casino as a ′cool′ financial entropy source and the gambler as a ′hot′ financial source, once again the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics means the flow is almost always from hot to cold in the long run. For managed risk spread bets widely and in high risk high reward investments (assuming a known probability), this is the Log optimal portfolio approach.

==="Social Informatics: Get Connected or Die Tryin’"===
[[Six degrees of separation]] means well connected people tend to be more successful as their social networks expose them to more chances to make choices they want. [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] precommitment as strategy in social and self-control, for example burning your bridges by buying gym membership to help motivated self win over lazy self. [[Mutual information]] resulting in [[phase transitions]] in social and political demography as well as physical systems, like water freezing into ice at a particular critical temperature or magnetic fields spontaneously aligning in certain atoms when cooling from a molten state.

==="Quantum Schmuntum: Lights, Camera, Action!"===
Vedral examines the basis of [[quantum information]], the [[qubit]], and examines [[one-time pad]] quantum cryptography as the most secure form of [[encryption]] because of its uncomputability. [[Quantum entanglement]] demonstrates the importance of mutual information in defining outcomes in a reality.

==="Surfing the Waves: Hyper-Fast Computers"===
[[Quantum computers]] offer a search advantage over classical computers by searching many database elements at once as a result of quantum [[Quantum superposition|superpositions]]. A sufficiently advanced quantum computer would break current encryption methods by factorizing large numbers several orders of magnitude faster than any existing classical computer. Any computable problem may be expressed as a general quantum search algorithm although classical computers may have an advantage over quantum search when using more efficient tailored classical [[algorithms]]. The issue with quantum computers is that a measurement must be made to determine if the problem is solved which collapses the superposition. Vedral points out that unintentional interaction with the environment can be mitigated with redundancy, and this would be necessary if we were to scale up current quantum computers to achieve greater utility, i.e. to utilize 10 qubits have a 100 atom quantum system so that if one atom decoheres a consensus will still be held by the other 9 for the state of the same qubit.

==="Children of the Aimless Chance: Randomness versus Determinism"===
[[Randomness]] is key to generating new sources of surprise in a reality. Compression of these new sources to discard unimportant information is the [[deterministic]] element and organising principle.

==="Sand Reckoning: Whose Information is It, Anyway?"===
The information content of the universe as measured in [[bit]]s or [[qubits]]. Vedral uses the initial effort of [[Archimedes]] of Syracuse in calculating the [[The Sand Reckoner|amount of sand]] that could theoretically fit inside the universe and compares it to a modern-day attempt to calculate the bit content of the universe. Vedral however sees this content as ultimately limitless as possibly maximum entropy is never reached as compression of complexity is an open ended process and random events will continue to occur. As Vedral sees information as the ultimate building block of physical reality, he speculates that information originating at any scale can force outcomes in all other scales to abide where mutual information is shared. For example, a human performed macro-level scientific test in search of a behaviour in a quantum particle could set parameters for that type of particle in the future when subjected to a similar test.

==="Destruction ab Toto: Nothing from Something"===
The information basis for ''creation ex nihilo''. According to [[John von Neumann]], starting trivially from an [[empty set]] of numbers an [[Infinity|infinite]] sequence of numbers can [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] their way out. An empty set creates the number 1 by observing an empty set within itself which is enough of a basis for distinguishability. It creates the number 2 by observing an empty set within the second empty set and the number 1, and so on. Vedral sees this not as creation but as [[data compression]], as every event of a reality breaks the [[symmetry]] of the pre-existing formlessness. Science is the process of describing a large amount of observed phenomena in a compressed programmatic way to predict future outcomes, and in this process of data compression science creates new information by eliminating all contrary possibilities to explain those phenomena.

==Synopsis==
The book explains the world as being made up of information. The Universe and its workings are the ebb and flow of information. We are all transient patterns of information, passing on the recipe for our basic forms to future generations using a four-letter [[Digital data|digital]] code called [[DNA]]. In this engaging and mind-stretching account, Vlatko Vedral considers some of the deepest questions about the Universe and considers the implications of interpreting it in terms of information. He explains the nature of information, the idea of entropy, and the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]]. He describes the bizarre effects of quantum behaviour - effects such as '[[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]]', which [[Einstein]] called 'spooky action at a distance' and explores cutting edge work on the harnessing quantum effects in hyperfast [[quantum computers]], and how recent evidence suggests that the weirdness of the quantum world, once thought limited to the tiniest scales, may reach into the macro world. Vedral finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The answers he considers are exhilarating, drawing upon the work of distinguished physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] and his concept of “[[it from bit]]”. The ideas challenge our concept of the nature of particles, of time, of determinism, and of reality itself.

'''Dihydrotestosterone''' ('''DHT''', '''5α-dihydrotestosterone''', '''5α-DHT''', '''androstanolone''' or '''stanolone''') is an [[endogenous]] [[androgen]] [[sex steroid]] and [[steroid hormone|hormone]]. The [[enzyme]] [[5α-reductase]] catalyzes the [[biosynthesis|formation]] of DHT from [[testosterone]] in certain [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s including the [[prostate gland]], [[seminal vesicles]], [[epididymis|epididymides]], [[skin]], [[hair follicle]]s, [[liver]], and [[brain]]. This enzyme mediates reduction of the C4-5 [[double bond]] of testosterone. Relative to testosterone, DHT is considerably more potent as an [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR).

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, DHT has been used as a [[medication]], for instance in the treatment of [[hypogonadism|low testosterone levels in men]]; for information on DHT as a medication, see the [[androstanolone]] article.

==Biological function==
DHT is biologically important for [[sexual differentiation]] of the [[male genitalia]] during [[embryogenesis]], maturation of the penis and scrotum at [[puberty]], [[hair growth|growth]] of [[facial hair|facial]], [[body hair|body]], and [[pubic hair]], and development and maintenance of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. It is produced from the less potent testosterone by the [[enzyme]] [[5α-reductase]] in select tissues, and is the primary androgen in the genitals, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, skin, and hair follicles.&lt;ref name="pmid16985920" /&gt;

DHT signals mainly in an [[intracrine]] and [[paracrine]] manner in the tissues in which it is produced, playing only a minor role, if any, as a circulating [[endocrine]] hormone.&lt;ref name="pmid1551803"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horton R | title = Dihydrotestosterone is a peripheral paracrine hormone | journal = J.

In addition to normal biological functions, DHT also plays an important causative role in a number of [[androgen-dependent condition]]s including hair conditions like [[hirsutism]] (excessive facial/body hair growth) and [[pattern hair loss]] (androgenic alopecia or pattern baldness) and [[prostate disease]]s such as [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) and [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name="pmid16985920" /&gt; [[5α-Reductase inhibitor]]s, which prevent DHT synthesis, are effective in the prevention and treatment of these conditions.&lt;ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22333687"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Azzouni F, Mohler J|year=2012|title=Role of 5α-reductase inhibitors in benign prostatic diseases|url=|journal=Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis.|volume=15|issue=3|pages=222–30|doi=10.1038/pcan.2012.1|pmid=22333687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22446342" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KatsambasLotti2015" /&gt;

===5α-Reductase deficiency===
{{See also|5α-Reductase deficiency}}

Much of the biological role of DHT has been elucidated in studies of individuals with [[congenital]] [[5α-reductase deficiency|5α-reductase type II deficiency]], an [[intersex condition]] caused by a [[loss-of-function mutation|loss-of-function]] [[genetic mutation|mutation]] in the [[gene]] encoding [[5α-reductase type II]], the major enzyme responsible for the production of DHT in the body.&lt;ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Ulrike | last1 = Blume-Peytavi | first2 = David A. | last2 = Whiting | first3 = Ralph M. | last3 = Trüeb | name-list-format = vanc | title=Hair Growth and Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHrX2-huQCoC&amp;pg=PA161|date=26 June 2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-46911-7|pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25321150"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Okeigwe I, Kuohung W | title = 5-Alpha reductase deficiency: a 40-year retrospective review | journal = Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 483–7 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25321150 | doi = 10.1097/MED.0000000000000116 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16985920"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marks LS | title = 5α-reductase: history and clinical importance | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 6 Suppl 9 | issue = | pages = S11–21 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16985920 | pmc = 1472916 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by a defective and non-functional 5α-reductase type II enzyme and a partial but majority loss of DHT production in the body.&lt;ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25321150" /&gt; In the condition, circulating testosterone levels are within or slightly above the normal male range, but DHT levels are low (around 30% of normal),&lt;ref name="HeesakkersChapple2016" /&gt;{{Better citation needed|date=July 2017}} and the ratio of circulating testosterone to DHT is greatly elevated (at about 3.5 to 5&amp;nbsp;times higher than normal).&lt;ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /&gt;

Genetic males (46,XY) with 5α-reductase type II deficiency are born with [[undervirilization]] including [[pseudohermaphroditism]] (ambiguous genitalia), [[pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias]], and usually [[cryptorchidism|undescended testes]]. Their external genitalia are female-like, with [[micropenis]] (a small, [[clitoris]]-like [[phallus]]), a partially unfused, [[labia]]-like [[scrotum]], and a blind-ending, shallow [[vagina|vaginal pouch]].&lt;ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /&gt; Due to their lack of conspicuous [[male genitalia]], genetic males with the condition are typically raised as girls.&lt;ref name="pmid25321150" /&gt; At the time of [[puberty]] however, they develop striking phenotypically masculine [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s including partial virilization of the genitals (enlargement of the phallus into a near-functional penis and [[testicular descent|descent of the testes]]), [[voice deepening]], typical male [[human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] development,&lt;ref name="pmid23431485" /&gt; and no [[menstruation]], [[breast development]], or other signs of [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] that occur during female puberty.&lt;ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25321150" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16985920" /&gt; In addition, normal [[libido]] and [[spontaneous erection]]s develop,&lt;ref name="pmid12573814" /&gt; they usually show a [[sexual orientation|sexual preference]] for females, and almost all develop a male [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid431680"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Imperato-McGinley J, Peterson RE, Gautier T, Sturla E | title = Androgens and the evolution of male-gender identity among male pseudohermaphrodites with 5alpha-reductase deficiency | journal = N.

Nonetheless, males with 5α-reductase type II deficiency exhibit signs of continued undervirilization in a number of domains. [[Facial hair]] was absent or sparse in a relatively large group of [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] males with the condition. However, more facial hair has been observed in patients with the disorder from other parts of the world, although facial hair was still reduced relative to that of other men in the same communities. The divergent findings may reflect racial differences in androgen-dependent hair growth. A female pattern of [[androgenic hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], with [[terminal hair]] largely restricted to the [[axilla]]e and lower [[pubic area|pubic triangle]], is observed in males with the condition. No temporal recession of the hairline or [[androgenic alopecia]] (pattern hair loss or baldness) has been observed in any of the cases of 5α-reductase type II deficiency that have been reported, whereas this is normally seen to some degree in almost all Caucasian males.&lt;ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /&gt; Individuals with 5α-reductase type II deficiency were initially reported to have no incidence of [[acne]],&lt;ref name="Melmed2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16985920" /&gt; but subsequent research indicated normal [[sebum]] [[secretion]] and acne incidence.&lt;ref name="pmid23431485"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marchetti PM, Barth JH | title = Clinical biochemistry of dihydrotestosterone | journal = Ann.

In genetic males with 5α-reductase type II deficiency, the [[prostate gland]] is rudimentary or absent, and if present, remains small, underdeveloped, and unpalpable throughout life.&lt;ref name="Melmed2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8630237" /&gt; In addition, neither BPH nor prostate cancer have been reported in these individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid22333687" /&gt; Genetic males with the condition generally show [[oligozoospermia]] due to undescended testes, but [[spermatogenesis]] is reported to be normal in those with testes that have descended, and there are case instances of men with the condition successfully fathering children.&lt;ref name="pmid12573814"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Imperato-McGinley J, Zhu YS | title = Androgens and male physiology the syndrome of 5alpha-reductase-2 deficiency | journal = Mol.

Unlike males, genetic females with 5α-reductase type II deficiency are phenotypically normal.

==Biological activity==
DHT is a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[agonist]] of the AR, and is in fact the most potent known [[endogenous]] [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] of the receptor. It has an [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] (K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.25 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;nM for the human AR, which is about 2- to 3-fold higher than that of [[testosterone]] (K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.4 to 1.0&amp;nbsp;nM)&lt;ref name="MozayaniRaymon2011"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Ashraf | last1 = Mozayani | first2 = Lionel | last2 = Raymon | name-list-format = vanc | title = Handbook of Drug Interactions: A Clinical and Forensic Guide | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NhBJ6kg_uP0C&amp;pg=PA656 | date = 18 September 2011 | publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-61779-222-9|pages=656–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 15–30&amp;nbsp;times higher than that of [[adrenal androgen]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn1-903737-05-2"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Hemat RA | title = Principles Of Orthomolecularism | publisher = Urotext | location = | year = 2004 | pages = | isbn = 1-903737-05-2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ED_xI-CEzFYC&amp;dq=DHT+is+3+times+more+potent+than+testosterone%3B+testosterone+is+5-10+times+more+potent+than+adrenal+androgens | page = 426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[dissociation rate]] of DHT from the AR is 5-fold slower than that of testosterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grino PB, Griffin JE, Wilson JD | title = Testosterone at high concentrations interacts with the human androgen receptor similarly to dihydrotestosterone | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 1165–72 | date = February 1990 | pmid = 2298157 | doi = 10.1210/endo-126-2-1165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[EC50|EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] of DHT for activation of the AR is 0.13&amp;nbsp;nM, which is about 5-fold stronger than that of testosterone (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.66&amp;nbsp;nM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Peter A. | last = Wilderer | name-list-format = vanc | title = Treatise on Water Science, Four-Volume Set | chapter = Bioassays for Estrogenic and Androgenic Effects of Water Constituents | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HSPtBDpRSXMC&amp;pg=PT1805 | date = 1 September 2010 | publisher = Newnes | isbn = 978-0-444-53199-5 | pages = 1805– }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[bioassay]]s, DHT has been found to be 2.5- to 10-fold more potent than testosterone.&lt;ref name="MozayaniRaymon2011" /&gt;

Unlike other androgens such as testosterone, DHT cannot be converted by the enzyme [[aromatase]] into an [[estrogen]] like [[estradiol]]. Therefore, it is frequently used in research settings to distinguish between the effects of testosterone caused by binding to the AR and those caused by testosterone's conversion to estradiol and subsequent binding to and activation of ERs.&lt;ref name="pmid10332569"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swerdloff RS, Wang C | title = Dihydrotestosterone: a rationale for its use as a non-aromatizable androgen replacement therapeutic agent | journal = Baillière's Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 501–6 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 10332569 | doi = 10.1016/s0950-351x(98)80267-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although DHT cannot be aromatized, it is still transformed into metabolites with significant ER affinity and activity. These are 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are predominant agonists of the ERβ.&lt;ref name="pmid22231829" /&gt;

===Distribution===
The [[plasma protein binding]] of DHT is more than 99%. In men, approximately 0.88% of DHT is unbound and hence free, while in premenopausal women, about 0.47–0.48% is unbound. In men, DHT is bound 49.7% to [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG), 39.2% to [[human serum albumin|albumin]], and 0.22% to [[corticosteroid-binding globulin]] (CBG), while in premenopausal women, DHT is bound 78.1–78.4% to SHBG, 21.0–21.3% to albumin, and 0.12% to CBG. In late pregnancy, only 0.07% of DHT is unbound in women; 97.8% is bound to SHBG while 2.15% is bound to albumin and 0.04% is bound to CBG.&lt;ref name="NieschlagBehre2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7195404"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dunn JF, Nisula BC, Rodbard D|date=July 1981|title=Transport of steroid hormones: binding of 21 endogenous steroids to both testosterone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin in human plasma |journal=J.

===Metabolism===
{{See also|Testosterone#Metabolism}}

DHT is inactivated in the liver and extrahepatic tissues like the skin into [[3α-androstanediol]] and [[3β-androstanediol]] by the enzymes [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] and [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Melmed2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12810547"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizner TL, Lin HK, Peehl DM, Steckelbroeck S, Bauman DR, Penning TM | title = Human type 3 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (aldo-keto reductase 1C2) and androgen metabolism in prostate cells | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 144 | issue = 7 | pages = 2922–32 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12810547 | doi = 10.1210/en.2002-0032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[metabolite]]s are in turn converted, respectively, into [[androsterone]] and [[epiandrosterone]], then [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugated]] (via [[glucuronidation]] and/or [[sulfation]]), released into [[circulatory system|circulation]], and [[excretion|excreted]] in [[urine]].&lt;ref name="Melmed2016" /&gt;

Unlike testosterone, DHT cannot be [[aromatized]] into an [[estrogen]] like estradiol, and for this reason, has no propensity for estrogenic effects.&lt;ref name="WeinerGallagher2003"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Irving B. | last1 = Weiner | first2 = Michela | last2 = Gallagher | name-list-format = vanc | title=Handbook of Psychology, Biological Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07UXE4gG3PcC&amp;pg=PA333|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-38403-8|pages=333–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excretion===
DHT is [[excretion|excreted]] in the [[urine]] as [[metabolite]]s, such as [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugate]]s of [[3α-androstanediol]] and [[androsterone]].&lt;ref name="SchillComhaire2006"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Wolf-Bernhard | last1 = Schill | first2 = Frank H. | last2 = Comhaire | first3 = Timothy B. | last3 = Hargreave | name-list-format = vanc | title = Andrology for the Clinician|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ts_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243|date=26 August 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-33713-3|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melmed2016" /&gt;

===Levels===
Serum DHT levels are about 10% of those of testosterone, but levels in the prostate gland are 5- to 10-fold higher than those of testosterone due to a more than 90% conversion of testosterone into DHT by locally expressed 5α-reductase.&lt;ref name="HayWass2009"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Ian D. | last1 = Hay | first2 = John A.

==Chemistry==
DHT, also known as 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, is a [[natural product|naturally occurring]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] with a [[ketone group]] at the C3 position and a [[hydroxyl group]] at the C17β position. It is the [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of testosterone in which the [[double bond]] between the C4 and C5 positions has been [[redox|reduced]] or [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]].

In the [[United States]], the '''exclusionary rule''' is a legal rule, based on [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]]. The rule prevents [[evidence (law)|evidence]] collected or analyzed in violation of the [[defendant]]'s [[constitutional right]]s from being used in a [[Court|court of law]]. This may be considered an example of a [[prophylactic rule]] formulated by the judiciary in order to protect a constitutional right. The exclusionary rule may also, in some circumstances at least, be considered to follow directly from the constitutional language, such as the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s command that no person "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself" and that no person "shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law".&lt;ref name=Re&gt;Re, Richard. [http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vol127_re.pdf "The Due Process Exclusionary Rule: A new textual foundation for a rule in crisis"], ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Vol. 127, p. 1885 (2014).  ''See also'' [http://harvardlawreview.org/2014/05/regarding-res-revisionism/ "Regarding Re’s Revisionism: Notes on The Due Process Exclusionary Rule"], ''Harvard Law Review'', Vol. 127, p. 302 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The exclusionary rule is grounded in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] and it is intended to protect citizens from illegal searches and seizures."&lt;ref&gt;Berg, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusionary rule is also designed to provide a [[Legal remedy|remedy]] and disincentive, which is short of criminal prosecution in response to [[Prosecution|prosecutor]]s and [[police]] who illegally gather evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] compelled to [[self-incrimination]]. The exclusionary rule also protects against violations of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]], which guarantees the [[right to counsel]].

Most states also have their own exclusionary remedies for illegally obtained evidence under their state constitutions and/or statutes, some of which predate the federal constitutional guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures and compelled self-incrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leonetti|first=Carrie|title=Independent and Adequate: Maryland's State Exclusionary Rule for Illegally Obtained Evidence|journal=University of Baltimore Law Review|date=Winter 2009|volume=38|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule is occasionally referred to as a [[legal technicality]] because it allows defendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed. In this respect, it is similar to the explicit rule in the Fifth Amendment protecting people from [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Double jeopardy|double jeopardy]].
In strict cases, when an illegal action is used by police/prosecution to gain any incriminating result, ''all'' evidence whose recovery stemmed from the illegal action—this evidence is known as "[[fruit of the poisonous tree]]"—can be thrown out from a jury (or be grounds for a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] if too much information has been irrevocably revealed).

The exclusionary rule applies to all persons within the United States regardless of whether they are citizens, immigrants (legal or illegal), or visitors.

==History of the rule==
Up until the [[American Revolution|independence of the United States]], the courts of England excluded self-incriminating evidence that was provided as a result of official compulsion, regardless of its reliability.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Davies, Thomas. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=992830 “Farther and Farther from the Original Fifth Amendment: The Recharacterization of the Right Against Self-Incrimination as a 'Trial Right' in Chavez V. Martinez”], ''Tennessee Law Review'', Volume 70, pages 987–1045 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Chief Justice Mansfield]] explained as follows:{{cquote|[I]n civil causes, the court will force parties to produce evidence which may prove against themselves; or leave the refusal to do it (after proper notice) as a strong presumption, to the jury....But in a criminal or penal cause, the defendant is never forced to produce any evidence; though he should hold it in his hands in court.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe v. Harvey'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=gtUsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2484 98 Eng. Rep. 302] (K.B. 1769).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Chief Justice Mansfield also explained that "If any evidence or confession has been extorted from her, it will be of no prejudice to her on the trial."&lt;ref&gt;''Rudd's Case'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WYw0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA123&amp;dq=%22If+any+evidence+or+confession+has+been+extorted%22&amp;ei=re9SSYjOFIjcygTjncH2Cw#PRA1-PA115,M1 168 Eng. Rep. 160] (K.B. 1775).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a defendant could sue to suppress and regain possession of at least some types of illegally seized evidence, in a [[common law]] action for [[replevin]].&lt;ref name="Warden"&gt;''Warden v. Hayden'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/387/294.html 387 U.S. 294] (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 1783 case of ''Ceglinski v. Orr'', the English courts declined to suppress evidence obtained by illegal coercion. In the ''Warickshall'' case, evidence was gathered as a result of an involuntary confession, and the court held that the evidence (but not the confession itself) could be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;''King v. Warickshall'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nwg-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA286 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235] (K.B. 1783).&lt;/ref&gt; It is questionable whether the ''Warickshall'' rule became known in the United States before 1789 (when the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]] was written), and whether it applied to confessions obtained by both governmental and private parties.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; In any event, no decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has ever endorsed the ''Warickshall'' rule as a constitutional matter.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;

Generally speaking, [[English law]] before 1789 did not provide as strong an exclusionary rule as the one that later developed under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], regarding unlawful searches and seizures.&lt;ref name="Warden"/&gt; The Fourth Amendment, after all, was partly a reaction against English law including the [[general warrant]] and the [[writs of assistance]].&lt;ref name="Warden" /&gt;

In the 1886 case of ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Zoo v. United States'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/116/616.html 116 U.S. 616] (1886).&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court addressed compulsory production of business papers, and the Court excluded those papers based on a combination of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. ''Boyd'' was closely limited to its facts, and several years later the Court stated that the Fourth Amendment does not extend to "excluding testimony" about wrongful searches and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v. New York'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/192/585.html 192 U.S. 585] (1904).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in ''Bram v. United States'',&lt;ref&gt;''Bram v. United States'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/168/532.html 168 U.S. 532] (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; that involuntary confessions are inadmissible as evidence. The Court in ''Bram'' did not announce a strong version of the exclusionary rule that would apply uniformly to exclude all evidence gathered in violation of the Bill of Rights, but instead announced a weak version that excluded only self-incriminating testimony that was compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The distinction between testimonial versus other self-incriminating evidence is a matter of continuing debate.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;''United States v. Hubbell'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=530&amp;page=27 530 U.S. 27] (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring): "A substantial body of evidence suggests that the Fifth Amendment privilege protects against the compelled production not just of incriminating testimony, but of any incriminating evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a strong version of the exclusionary rule was addressed and adopted by the federal courts, it had already been adopted by at least one state court, namely the [[Iowa Supreme Court]], as that court would later describe:{{cquote|The genesis of Iowa’s exclusionary rule was a civil case, ''Reifsnyder v. Lee'', 44 Iowa 101 (1876).... The first application of the exclusionary rule in a criminal context occurred in the ''Height'' case, decided in 1902. ''Height'' involved a physical exam of the defendant against his will. 117 Iowa at 652, 91 N.W. at 935. This court held that the examination of the defendant violated the due process clause of the Iowa Constitution, as well as article 1, section 8’s prohibition of unreasonable searches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=ia&amp;vol=sc%5C20000907%5C99-0412&amp;invol=1 ''Iowa v. Cline''], 617 N.W.2d 277, 285-86
(Iowa 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1914, the U.S. Supreme Court announced a strong version of the exclusionary rule, in the case of ''[[Weeks v. United States]]'', under the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;''Weeks v. United States'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/232/383.html 232 U.S. 383] (1914).&lt;/ref&gt; This decision, however, created the rule only on the federal level. The "''Weeks'' rule," which made an exception for cases at the state level, was adopted by numerous states at a time during [[prohibition]]. In adopting the rule, actions by states often reflected attitudes towards prohibition, which was enacted by adoption of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and was enforced through the [[Volstead Act]]. Concerns about privacy violations also extended to other instances where criminal sanctions were permitted for "victimless" crime, such as illegal gambling or narcotics violations.&lt;ref name="Allen1961"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exclusionary Rule in the American Law of Search and Seizure, The Exclusionary Rule Regarding Illegally Seized Evidence|author=Allen, Francis A.|journal=Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science|volume=52|issue=3|year=1961|pages=246–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine in the case of ''[[Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Silverthorne Lumber v. United States'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/251/385.html 251 U.S. 385] (1920).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court stated that allowing evidence gathered as an indirect result of an unconstitutional search and seizure "reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words".

''[[Wolf v. Colorado]]'' {{Ussc|338|25|1949|el=no}}  ruled that states were not required to adopt the exclusionary rule. Despite the ruling, some states adopted the exclusionary rule. In 1955, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled in ''People v. Cahan''&lt;ref&gt;(1955) 44 Cal.2d 434&lt;/ref&gt; that the exclusionary rule applied for cases in the state of California. By 1960, 22 states had adopted the rule without substantial qualifications: California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming. Michigan also had an exclusionary rule, but with limitations for some narcotics and firearms evidence. In Alabama, Maryland, and South Dakota, the exclusionary rule applied in some situations.&lt;ref name="Allen1961"/&gt;

It was not until ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|367|643|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 that the exclusionary rule was also held to be binding on the [[U.S. state|states]] through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which guarantees [[due process]]. Up until ''Mapp'', the exclusionary rule had been rejected by most states.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Paul. [http://www.law.utah.edu/_personfiles/57/HIGHLIGHTS/C1993utahlr751.pdf "The Mysterious Creation of Search and Seizure Exclusionary Rules Under State Constitutions: The Utah Example,"] ''Utah Law Review'', No. 3, page 751, 756 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Utah v. Strieff]] dealt with the exclusionary rule and outstanding warrants and was viewed to be generally favorable towards police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-the-exclusionary-rule-is-weakened-but-it-still-lives/|title=Opinion analysis: The exclusionary rule is weakened but it still lives|date=2016-06-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21701170-supreme-court-weakens-law-against-unreasonable-searches-amended|title=Amended|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of the rule==
The exclusionary rule does not apply in a [[Civil law (common law)|civil case]], in a [[grand jury]] proceeding, or in a [[parole]] revocation hearing.

Even in a criminal case, the exclusionary rule does not simply bar the introduction of all evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendment. In ''[[Hudson v. Michigan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hudson v. Michigan]]'', 547 U.S. 586, 126 S.Ct. 2159 (June 15, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] wrote for the U.S. Supreme Court:

{{Cquote|Suppression of evidence, however, has always been our last resort, not our first impulse. The exclusionary rule generates "substantial social costs," ''[[United States v. Leon]]'', 468 U.S. 897, 907 (1984), which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large. We have therefore been "cautious against expanding" it, ''[[Colorado v. Connelly]]'', 479 U.S. 157, 166 (1986), and "have repeatedly emphasized that the rule's 'costly toll' upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging [its] application," ''[[Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott]]'', 524 U.S. 357, 364–365 (1998) (citation omitted). We have rejected "indiscriminate application" of the rule, Leon, supra, at 908, and have held it to be applicable only "where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served," ''[[United States v. Calandra]]'', 414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974){{spaced ndash}}that is, "where its deterrence benefits outweigh its 'substantial social costs,'" Scott, supra, at 363, (quoting Leon, supra, at 907). Whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case is an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct.}}

Limitations on the exclusionary rule have included the following:
* Evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendant by a private person is admissible. The exclusionary rule is designed to protect privacy rights, with the Fourth Amendment applying specifically to government officials.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burdeau v. McDowell]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=256&amp;invol=465 256 U.S. 465] (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence can only be suppressed if the illegal search violated the person's own (the person making the court motion) constitutional rights. The exclusionary rule does not apply to privacy rights of a third party.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Jeffers]]'' and ''[[Jones v. United States (1960)|Jones v. United States]]'' clarify the standing requirements.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a narrow exception to this standing requirement, the ''[[jus tertii]]'' standing exception.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Singleton v. Wulff Et Al.'', 96 S. Ct. 2868, 428 U.S. 106 (U.S. 1976); "The Assertion of Constitutional Jus Tertii: A Substantive Approach", Robert Allen Sedler, ''California Law Review'', Vol. 70, No. 6 (Dec., 1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;1308–1344; "Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii", 88 ''Harv.L.Rev''. 423, (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The defendant cannot take advantage of the situation (police breaching rules) to turn the case to his advantage, in face of other evidence against himself.  This falls under the exigent circumstances exception.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Walder v. United States]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Silver Platter doctrine which was ruled unconstitutional in the case of ''[[Elkins v. United States]]'' in 1960. State officials that obtained evidence illegally were allowed to turn over evidence to federal officials, and have that evidence be admitted into trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wolf v. Colorado]]'' {{Ussc|338|25|1949|el=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'' held that if the evidence obtained in the unlawful search would almost definitely have been found eventually even without said search ([[inevitable discovery]]), the evidence may be brought forth in court.
* If police officers acting in good faith (''bona fides'') rely upon a defective search warrant, then the evidence acquired may still be used under the [[good-faith exception]].

The exclusionary rule is not applicable to non-U.S. nationals residing outside of U.S. borders. In ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', {{Ussc|504|655|1992|el=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court decided that property owned by aliens in a foreign country is admissible in court. Certain persons in the U.S. receive limited protections, such as prisoners, probationers, parolees, and persons crossing U.S. borders. Corporations, by virtue of being, also have limited rights under the Fourth Amendment (see [[corporate personhood]]).

In the case of [[Florida v. Jimeno]] it was found that the evidence found to convict Jimeno, although at first was not admissible, later was found to in fact be admissible since it passed the test of reasonable standards.  The defendant consented to a search of his car, and when the officer searched a package and found drugs, it was not said to be in violation because a reasonable person would expect illegal narcotics to be kept in a package or container.&lt;ref name=Oyez&gt;{{cite web| title =FLORIDA v. JIMENO | work =Oyez| year =1991| url =https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1990/1990_90_622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and defense==

The exclusionary rule as it has developed in the United States has been long criticized. Judge [[Benjamin Cardozo]], Chief Judge of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] between 1927 and 1932, stated that under the rule, "The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered." The judge noted that many states had rejected the rule, but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;''People of the State of New York v. John Defore'', 150 N.E. 585 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Tom, Judge, United States District Court Western District of Louisiana |last1=Stagg |authorlink=Tom Stagg|location=Shreveport, La. |date=July 15, 1991 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/02/opinion/l-when-politics-topples-precedent-that-s-chaos-cardozo-in-context-787691.html |title=Letter to the Editor|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fairamendment.us/Fair%20or%20Foul.htm |title=Fair or Foul?

By the 1980s, the exclusionary rule remained controversial and was strongly opposed by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. But, some opponents began seeking to have the rule modified, rather than abolished altogether. The case, ''[[Illinois v. Gates]]'', before the Supreme Court brought the exclusionary rule for reconsideration. The Supreme Court also considered allowing exceptions for errors made by police in [[good faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nestlerode|first1=Jana|date=Winter-Spring 2010|title=Handcuffing America's Fourth Amendment: ERODING THE INTENT OF THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE|url=http://tiafp.org/restricted/TheForensicDigestVol2Issue1.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|journal=|publisher=Journal of the Academy of Forensic Nursing Science|volume=2|issue=1|pages=22–35|accessdate=January 7, 2013|via=|work=The Forensic Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Reagan administration also asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] to ease the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusionary-Rule Fight Moves to Supreme Court |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1983-01-26 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/us/exclusionary-rule-fight-moves-to-supreme-court.html |last=Taylor |first=Stuart, Jr. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the exclusionary rule be replaced with [[restitution]] to victims of [[police misconduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=32|publisher=Emory L.

A major criticism of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is that it allegedly defies the original intent of the Constitution.  Yale Law Professor [[Akhil Amar]], for example, has argued that "nothing in the text, history, or structure of the Fourth Amendment" supports the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Akhil Reed Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure: First Principles 91 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics like Amar, Oaks and Wilkey point to the fact that the text of the Fourth Amendment does not indicate that illegally seized evidence must be excluded.  Some legal historians argue that the Constitution's Framers intended only that victims of unreasonable searches or seizures could file civil lawsuits.

In 2009, Roger Roots presented evidence that the idea of exclusion can be found in the earliest set of law books published in American history.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Roots, "The Originalist Case for the Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule", ''[[Gonzaga Law Review]]'', Vol. 45, pp. 1-66 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Roots elaborated that certain eighteenth-century British law books and pamphlets which discuss the exclusion of illegally seized evidence circulated widely in the American colonies and were owned by numerous prominent Framing-era lawyers and statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Roots, "The Framers' Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule: The Mounting Evidence", ''[[Nevada Law Journal]]'', Vol. 15, pp. 42-76 (2014) http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=roger_roots&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2014, Professor Richard Re proposed that the Due Process Clause provides an ample basis for the Exclusionary Rule.&lt;ref name=Re /&gt;

'''''Fighting Fantasy''''' is a series of single-player [[role-playing]] [[gamebook]]s created by [[Steve Jackson (UK game designer)|Steve Jackson]] and [[Ian Livingstone]]. The first volume in the series was published in [[paperback]] by [[Puffin Books|Puffin]] in 1982.

The series distinguished itself by mixing [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style storytelling with a dice-based role-playing element included within the books themselves. The caption on many of the covers claimed each title was an adventure "in which YOU are the hero!" The majority of the titles followed a fantasy theme, although [[science fiction]], [[post-apocalyptic]], [[superhero]], and modern [[Horror fiction|horror]] gamebooks were also published. The popularity of the series led to the creation of merchandise such as [[action figure]]s, [[board game]]s, role-playing game systems, magazines, [[novel]]s, and [[video game]]s.

Puffin ended the series in 1995, but the rights to the series were eventually purchased by Wizard Books in 2002. Wizard published new editions of the original books and also commissioned six new books over two series, ending in 2012. The rights were then acquired by Scholastic in 2017, which has since published two new titles and reissued ten of the original books with new artwork.

==Overview==
The main text of each gamebook does not progress in a linear fashion, but rather is divided into a series of numbered sections (usually 400, though a few are shorter or longer). Beginning at the first section, the reader typically must pick one of a series of options provided by the text, each option being detailed at a separate non-sequential numbered section (e.g. the reader may be presented with a choice to turn from Section 1 directly to either Section 83 or Section 180) which in turn provides an outcome for the option chosen. The book continues in this fashion until their character is killed in combat, is stopped by the story, or completes the story.  “''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebooks empower the reader, who felt the anxiety or joy of being fantasy heroes themselves – they lived or died by their decisions. And if at first you don’t succeed, try and try again,” said Ian Livingstone of the format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://damiengwalter.com/2012/08/28/fighting-fantasy-interview-with-ian-livingstone/|title=I interviewed Ian Livingstone creator of Fighting Fantasy about the future of gaming|last=Walter|first=Damien G.|date=2012-08-28|website=Nomad Writer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebook tasks players with completing a quest. A successful play usually ends with the player reaching the final numbered section of the book. In some cases this can only be achieved by obtaining various story items (e.g. gems in ''[[Deathtrap Dungeon]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasygamebooks.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=9 |title=FF3: Deathtrap Dungeon |publisher=Fightingfantasygamebooks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of the titles only feature one path to the solution.

All ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebooks are illustrated, including full-page pieces and smaller, repeated images scattered throughout the book as breaks or space fillers between sections. Regular contributors (excluding Scholastic editions) included [[Les Edwards]], Terry Oakes, [[Russ Nicholson]], Leo Hartas, [[Ian Miller (illustrator)|Ian Miller]], [[John Blanche]], Martin McKenna, and [[Iain McCaig]].

=== System ===
Each ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebook requires the reader to create their character, randomly assigning scores to three statistics (Skill, Stamina, and Luck). These, in conjunction with rolling six-sided dice, are used to resolve skill challenges and the combat sections. Some titles use additional statistics or conflict resolution mechanics; most also require the reader to keep an inventory of items.

=== Setting ===
Most early ''Fighting Fantasy'' titles were set in locations later revealed to be on the same continent called Allansia. Later on a whole world named Titan was developed with subsequent gamebooks set on three main continents - Allansia, Khul and the Old World. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.fightingfantasy.com/ffbadv2.htm |title=Titan |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901091834/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/ffbadv2.htm |archivedate=September 1, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other titles are set in unrelated fantasy, horror, modern day, and sci-fi environments.

==Publication history==
In 1980, Steve Jackson (not to be confused with the [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|US-based game designer of the same name]]) and Ian Livingstone attended a [[Games Day]], and after meeting with a [[Penguin Books]] editor Geraldine Cook decided to create a series of single-player gamebooks. Their first submission, ''The Magic Quest'', was a short adventure intended to demonstrate the style of game. ''The Magic Quest'' was eventually accepted by Penguin, although the authors devoted a further six months to expanding and improving upon their original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#format |title=Fighting Fantasy FAQ |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127132716/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#format |archivedate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/ian_livingstone_and_steve_jackson_interview/|title=Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson interview|last=Hamblin|first=Jon|date=2007-08-24|website=Gamesradar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puffin Books (1982–1995)===
The end result was ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' and, after several rewrites, the book was accepted and published in 1982 under Penguin's children's imprint, Puffin Books. Following the success of this title,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#sold |title=Fighting Fantasy FAQ |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127132716/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#sold |archivedate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson and Livingstone began writing individually to create additional ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebooks. In 1983, ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]'' and ''[[The Forest of Doom]]'' were published, by Jackson and Livingstone respectively. Four more titles followed: ''[[Starship Traveller]]'' (the first title with a [[science fiction]] setting), ''[[City of Thieves (gamebook)|City of Thieves]]'', ''[[Deathtrap Dungeon]]'' and ''[[Island of the Lizard King]]''. In 1984, a decision was made to hire more writers to continue the series: Steve Jackson (the U.S.-based founder and owner of [[Steve Jackson Games]]) was the first, followed by others such as Andrew Chapman, [[Carl Sargent]] (aka Keith Martin), [[Marc Gascoigne]], and [[Peter Darvill-Evans]]. Jackson and Livingstone, however, continued to be involved and approved all cover and internal illustrations within the UK.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#version |title=Fighting Fantasy FAQ |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127132716/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#version |archivedate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{main|Steve Jackson's Sorcery!}}
Jackson wrote a self-contained four-part series titled ''Steve Jackson's Sorcery!'' (1983-1985), which combined the use of combat and sorcery, and introduced the continent later known as the Old World. These featured dice images at the bottom of each page, making it possible for the player to randomly flip through the pages for the equivalent of a dice roll (the ''Fighting Fantasy'' titles published by Wizard Books used the same device). 

Andrew Chapman and Martin Allen also wrote a two-book, two-player adventure titled ''[[Clash of the Princes]]'' (1986). There were also [[List of Fighting Fantasy gamebooks|several supplemental books]] produced that provided more information about the ''Fighting Fantasy'' universe, including a comprehensive bestiary of monsters and a sample adventure. 

Although the ''Fighting Fantasy'' titles had successful sales&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#Concept |title=created |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127132716/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#Concept |archivedate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the increasing dominance of [[video game]]s in the 1990s caused a gradual decline. The series was scheduled to conclude with ''[[Return to Firetop Mountain]]'' (book 50, Livingstone, 1992), but due to strong sales of that volume, ten more books were scheduled. Nine were published, the series ending with ''[[Curse of the Mummy]]'' (1995). ''[[Bloodbones]]'', the tenth scheduled title (meant to have been book 60 in the series) was cancelled, but was eventually published by Wizard Books as part of their later reprinting efforts.

===Wizard Books===
====Series 1 (2002–2007)====
In 2002, Wizard Books acquired the rights to the ''Fighting Fantasy'' series and reprinted many of the original titles in a revised order (initially only the gamebooks actually written by Jackson and/or Livingstone were published), starting with ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain''. They also incorporated the ''Sorcery!'' miniseries, as books 9, 11, 13, and 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasycollector.co.uk/wizard_covers.htm |title=Wizard Covers |publisher=Fightingfantasycollector.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new title, ''[[Eye of the Dragon]]'' (by Ian Livingstone) was released in 2005, followed by ''Bloodbones'' in 2006 and ''Howl of the Werewolf'' in 2007. This series used a new logo, the rationale being that the old covers did not suit the modern market.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Interview with Simon Flynn on the official Fighting Fantasy website
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

2007 also marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of ''Fighting Fantasy'', and to commemorate the event Wizard Books published a special hardcover edition of ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' that used the original 1982 cover image and contained extra material such as the dungeon solution and a commentary on ''Fighting Fantasy'' by Livingstone. This series concluded that same year, ending with 29 books.

====Series 2 (2009–2012)====
Wizard Books then began again with a new series of reprints in 2009, again featuring a different cover art style, and again starting with ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain''. These books were physically larger than prior releases, being produced in [[Paperback#Types|B-format]] (like the original ''Advanced Fighting Fantasy'' volumes). Three other original titles were added during this run,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=9 |title=Gamebooks |publisher=Fighting Fantasy |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''Blood of the Zombies'' by Ian Livingstone to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Blood-Zombies-Fighting-Fantasy-Livingstone/dp/1848314051/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347829123&amp;sr=1-1 |title=Blood of the Zombies |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series was 17 books long, although ''Blood of the Zombies'', the last volume released, is unnumbered and packaged differently than the rest.

===Scholastic Books (2017–    )===
A new Fighting Fantasy book by Ian Livingstone, ''The Port of Peril'', was published in August 2017 by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fightingfantasy.com/copy-of-ff-gamebooks-1|title=FF Press Releases|last=|first=|date=|website=Fighting Fantasy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic also released five of the original books. Instead of reusing the original artwork or its style, Scholastic commissioned new artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beastsofwar.com/fighting-fantasy/books-relaunching-scholastic/ Beastsofwar.com] (Retrieved 3 August 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018 a further six titles were published, including a new adventure by author [[Charlie Higson]], entitled ''The Gates of Death''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fightingfantasy.com/charlie-higson-interview|title=Interview with Charlie Higson bestselling author of The Gates of Death|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Fighting Fantasy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/04/fighting-fantasy-game-books-charlie-higson-interview|title=Dare YOU face the orcs? 80s game books Fighting Fantasy return|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2018-04-04|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
=== Printed ===
''[[Warlock (magazine)|Warlock]]'' magazine (first published by Puffin Books and later Games Workshop) provided additional information on the ''Fighting Fantasy'' universe, and each issue featured a short gamebook adventure, new rules, monsters, reviews and comic strips. It was published from 1983 to 1986 and ran for 13 issues in the UK. It was also published in other countries, and continued in Japan until 1997.

In 1984, Steve Jackson published a [[tabletop roleplaying game|roleplaying game]], ''Fighting Fantasy – The Introductory Role-playing Game''. A second game was published in 1989: ''[[Advanced Fighting Fantasy]]'' (AFF). AFF was re-released as a new and further expanded edition by Arion Games in 2011.

In 1985, Steve Jackson wrote a picture gamebook with the title ''Tasks of Tantalon'', in which the player was required to solve a series of puzzles which were presented as large, full-colour pictures containing hidden clues to be located and assembled.

''[[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain (board game)|The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'' (1986) and ''[[Legend of Zagor#Other references|Legend of Zagor]]'' (1993) were released as [[board game]]s by [[Games Workshop]] and [[Parker Brothers]] respectively.

In 1992, the ''Fighting Fantasy 10th Anniversary Yearbook'' (a diary with articles, trivia and a gamebook) complete with a boxed set of dice and character sheets was published.

In 2003, Jamie Wallis (not to be confused with [[James Wallis (games designer)|James Wallis]]) adapted eight ''Fighting Fantasy'' and ''Sorcery!'' gamebooks to the ''[[D20 System]]''. These adventures were published by Myriador (now defunct, though PDFs are still available for purchase from Greywood Publishing via third-party online retailers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfandfantasy.co.uk/php/gallery2a.php?subsection=38 |title=Fighting Fantasy: d20 Role Playing Game Conversions |publisher=SFandFantasy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Sorcery! (video game)}}
Cambridge-based studio [[Inkle (video game company)|Inkle]] released another interactive version of ''The Shamutanti Hills'' for [[iOS]] in May 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inklestudios.com/sorcery Inkle Studios project page]&lt;/ref&gt; and has since gone on to release all four parts of Sorcery! on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.

The video game ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain: Goblin Scourge Edition'' was released by Tin Man Games for the Nintendo Switch on Sep 13, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-warlock-of-firetop-mountain-goblin-scourge-edition-switch&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile ===
On December 5, 2006, it was announced that Jackson and Livingstone were planning to release a new series of handheld games based on ''Fighting Fantasy'' for [[Nintendo DS]] and Sony's [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=21532 |title=Fighting Fantasy gamebooks to come to handhelds // News |publisher=Gamesindustry.biz |date= |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, ''[[Fighting Fantasy: The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'', was released for the DS in the United States on November 25, 2009, and for the [[Apple iPhone]] and [[iPod]] in early January 2010.

On February 10, 2011 an [[Amazon Kindle]] edition of ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' was launched by UK developer [[Worldweaver Ltd]], for the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweaver.com/Gamebooks.aspx |title=Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf gamebooks at Worldweaver Ltd.|publisher=worldweaver.com|date= |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Warlock'' and four other gamebooks were released on iOS by Big Blue Bubble, but were removed from the app store in 2012 when they lost the licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://toucharcade.com/2012/08/07/fighting-fantasy-series-delisting-august-14th-entire-gamebook-adventures-series-currently-on-sale/ | title='Fighting Fantasy' Series Delisting August 14th | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Australian game developers ''Tin Man Games'' have since published several [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] versions of Fighting Fantasy books, including ''Blood of the Zombies'', ''[[House of Hell]]'', ''Forest of Doom'', ''Island of the Lizard King'' and ''Starship Traveller'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fightingfantasyapps.com/books/ | title=Books | publisher=Tin Man Games | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an iOS version of the first part of the Sorcery! series was released by Bright Al Ltd in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowyourmobile.com/games/9245/steve-jacksons-sorcery-shamutanti-hills-goes-live Steve Jackson’s Sorcery! The Shamutanti Hills goes live]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sorcery! (video game)|Inkle's Sorcery! series]] is available on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.

==Reception==
The series sold 20 million copies in the 80s and 90s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/04/fighting-fantasy-game-books-charlie-higson-interview ''Dare YOU face the orcs? 80s game books Fighting Fantasy return'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fighting Fantasy'' was ranked 47th in the 1996 reader poll of ''Arcane'' magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time.  The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: "To say that it is basic would be a huge understatement – ''Fighting Fantasy'' has just a couple of stats from which a character is created, and combat is a simple case of rolling six-sided dice, pitching one creature's slats against another. It's fun, quick and easy, which explains its popularity."&lt;ref name="Arcane14"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Pettengale|first=Paul|date= Christmas 1996 |title=Arcane Presents the Top 50 Roleplaying Games 1996|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=14|pages=25-35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], the '''first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron''' is a [[stellation]] of the [[rhombic dodecahedron]]. This polyhedron is sometimes called ''Escher's solid''; it appears in [[M. C. Escher]]'s works ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'' and in a study for ''[[Stars (M. C. Escher)|Stars]]'' (although ''Stars'' itself features a different shape, the [[compound of three octahedra]]).  
== Geometry==
It has 48 faces, all triangles. It has 26 vertices in total: 6 with degree 8, 8 with degree 6, and 12 with degree 4. It has 72 edges in total, giving an [[Euler characteristic]] of 26 + 48 &amp;minus; 72 = +2. Its vertices are identical to those of the [[cuboctahedron]]. It can be constructed by taking a [[square pyramid]] of base length 2 and height 1, with the base centered at the origin and the apex on the Z-axis, and then rotating it so that the apex lies on each of the 6 half-axes in turn. The union of the six square pyramids gives the stellated rhombic dodecahedron.

== Space-filling==
It can [[Tessellation|tessellate]] space in the [[stellated rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb]]. Six stellated rhombic dodecahedra meet at each vertex. This honeycomb is [[Isohedral figure#Related terms|cell-transitive]], [[edge-transitive]] and [[vertex-transitive]].

'''''Flowers in a Wan-Li Vase''''' is a circa 1620s floral painting by [[Balthasar van der Ast]] in the collection of the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url={{#if: {{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P350}} | https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/{{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P350}} | {{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P973}} }}|title={{wikidata|label|Q30585921}}|publisher={{wikidata|property|linked|Q30585921|P195}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
[[File:Tulips in the Aptekarsky Ogorod 04.JPG|thumb|''Flaming'' variety of tulip in the foreground, today a hardy variety and common enough for public garden planning]]
Balthasar van der Ast was a respected flower painter from [[Middelburg]], active in [[Utrecht]], and considered a member of the ''[[Ambrosius Bosschaert|Bosschaert dynasty]]'' and one of the great flower painters of his time. Little is known about Van der Ast's workshop and whether or not he worked on commission. Even less is known of the early provenance of his paintings. Besides what can be learned from his surviving paintings, archival evidence indicates he was active in Utrecht at the same time as [[Roelant Savery]].

The painting shows flowers of various seasons accompanied by various ''fauna'' in an arranged bouquet on a stone slab, often in an unusual vase, and in this case, a [[Chinese export porcelain]] vessel called a ''Wan-Li vase''. This motief was not his invention and was already quite common among his colleagues, and would remain popular for over a century, with [[Jan van Huysum]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]] still enjoying high prices for their flower bouquets crawling with bugs and reptiles such as this one.

The flaming red and gold tulip at the top is a variety quite common in Dutch gardens today, but is actually suffering from the [[tulip breaking virus]] that gives it that "flaming" striped effect. This painting is symbolic of the popular appreciation of tulips that would reach amazing heights in the so-called [[Tulip Mania]] that was yet to come.

Besides the tulip, the work shows the following flower species: [[Rosa gallica]], [[Anemone hepatica]], [[Aquilegia]], [[Tagetes]], [[Cyclamen]], [[lacerta agilis]], [[Cynthia cardui]], a fly, a dragonfly, and a grasshopper (on the vase).&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/images/70105 Painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later provenance==
This painting was stored for safe-keeping during WWII in the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]], from whence it was found and taken by marauding Ukrainian troops in 1945. Somehow it ended up in the possession of the German Alice Siano who later emigrated to Canada in 1951 (when she married, she became Alice Tittel) with twelve paintings, presumably eight of which were from the Meissen storage depot, and this one appeared on the art market in 1954, where it was purchased by the Dutch art collector [[Sidney J. van den Bergh]] who sold it to a New York collector in 1972. In 1991 it was part of a visiting exhibition "Great Dutch Masters from America" which referred to it as being very similar to the lost Suermondt Museum piece. It has now been purchased back and returned to the museum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parkstadactueel.nl/2017/06/10/nederlandse-museumdirecteur-haalt-roofkunst-terug-naar-aken/ Dutch museum director retrieves looted art in Aachen], article 10 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The museum had earlier recovered ''[[Flowers in a Glass Vase]]'' by Nicolaes Verendael, which had also been sold by Alice Tittel to a New York collector. About 200 paintings from the museum's collection were stolen in 1945. It is unknown how many are still missing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12562">'''Frankfurt cases''' (also known as '''Frankfurt counterexamples''' or '''Frankfurt-style cases''') were presented by [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Harry Frankfurt]] in 1969 as counterexamples to the '''principle of alternate possibilities''' ('''PAP'''), which holds that an agent is [[moral responsibility|morally responsible]] for an action only if that person could have done otherwise.

==Principle of alternate possibilities==
The principle of alternate possibilities (PAP) forms part of an influential argument for the incompatibility of responsibility and causal [[determinism]], often called the ''core argument'' for [[incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name=Copp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timpe/&gt; It was formulated by [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian]] [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]]. This argument is detailed below:

(1) '''PAP''': An agent is responsible for an action only if said agent could have done otherwise.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt;

(2) An agent could have done otherwise only if causal determinism is false.

(3) Therefore, an agent is responsible for an action only if causal determinism is false.

Traditionally, [[compatibilism|compatibilists]] (defenders of the compatibility of [[free will]] and determinism, like [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Walter Terence Stace]], and [[Daniel Dennett]]) reject premise two, arguing that, properly understood, free will is not incompatible with determinism.  According to the traditional compatibilist analysis of free will, an agent is free to do otherwise when he would have done otherwise had he wanted to do otherwise.&lt;ref name=Ayer/&gt; Agents may possess free will, according to the conditional analysis, even if determinism is true.

==Frankfurt's objection==
From the PAP definition "a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise", Frankfurt infers that a person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he could not have done otherwise – a point with which he takes issue: our theoretical ability to do otherwise, he says, does not necessarily make it ''possible'' for us to do otherwise.

Frankfurt's examples are significant because they suggest an alternative way to defend the compatibility of moral responsibility and determinism, in particular by rejecting the first premise of the argument.  According to this view, responsibility is compatible with determinism because responsibility does not require the freedom to do otherwise.

Frankfurt's examples involve agents who are intuitively responsible for their behavior even though they lack the freedom to act otherwise.  Here is a typical case:

:Donald is a Democrat and is likely to vote for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]; in fact, only in one particular circumstance will he not: that is, if he thinks about the prospects of immediate American defeat in [[Iraq]] just prior to voting.  Ms White, a representative of the Democratic Party, wants to ensure that Donald votes Democratic, so she secretly plants a device in Donald's head that, if activated, will force him to vote Democratic.  Not wishing to reveal her presence unnecessarily, Ms White plans to activate the device only if Donald thinks about the [[Iraq War]] prior to voting.  As things happen, Donald does not think about Iraq prior to voting, so Ms White thus sees no reason to activate the device, and Donald votes Democratic of his own accord.  Apparently, Donald is responsible for voting Democratic although, owing to Ms. White's device, he lacks freedom to do otherwise.

If Frankfurt is correct in suggesting both that Donald is morally responsible for voting Democratic and that he is not free to do otherwise, moral responsibility, in general, does not require that an agent have the freedom to do otherwise (that is, the principle of alternate possibilities is false).  Thus, even if causal determinism is true, and even if determinism removes the freedom to do otherwise, there is no reason to doubt that people can still be morally responsible for their behavior.

Having presented his counter argument against the principle of alternate possibilities, Frankfurt suggests that it be revised to take into account the fallacy of the notion that coercion precludes an agent from moral responsibility.  It must be ''only because'' of coercion that the agent acts as he does.  The best definition, by his reckoning, is this: "[A] person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he did it ''only because'' he could not have done otherwise."&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt;

==Criticism==
One of the first objections raised by opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases is the two-horned dilemma. This objection was most notably raised by philosophers such as Widerker, Ginet, and Kane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Significance of Free Will|last=Kane|first=Robert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginet|first=Carl|date=1996|title=In Defense of the Principle of Alternative Possibilities: Why I Don't Find Frankfurt's Argument Convincing|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=10|pages=403-417|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Widerker|first=David|date=1995|title=Libertarianism and Frankfurt's Attack on the Principle of Alternative Possibilities|url=|journal=Philosophical Review|volume=104|pages=247-261|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-horned dilemma focuses on the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision. This connection can be either deterministic or indeterministic.

If the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is deterministic, then proponents of the Frankfurt-style cases are charged with begging the question. A deterministic connection begs the question because proponents of Frankfurt-style cases are assuming the very thing that is being debated, that moral responsibility does not require alternate possibilities or the ability to do otherwise. Suppose the agent's inclination is causally sufficient for bringing about the agent's decision. This would mean that the agent was determined to make that decision prior to any kind of decision-making. Thus, the agent did not freely come to the decision for reasons of her own. Opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases would immediately contend that the agent is not morally responsible. This is because they are operating from the get-go that moral responsibility requires free will. Therefore, if the Frankfurt-style cases are operating within a metaphysically deterministic framework, then proponents of Frankfurt-style cases cannot reasonably expect their opponents to be convinced. Furthermore, Frankfurt-style cases would be begging the question since they are deriving moral responsibility from a completely deterministic scenario. 

On the other hand, if the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is indeterministic, then opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases argue that the agent has the ability to do otherwise. This is problematic for proponents of the Frankfurt-style cases because they are supposed to show a situation where an agent is morally responsible her decision and yet is unable to truly do otherwise. Suppose the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is indeterministic. This means that the agent's inclination is not necessarily indicative of what the agent's decision will be. Thus, it is possible for the agent to show the correct inclination, evade the computer device, but then make the "wrong" decision. Even if the computer device kicks in after the "wrong decision," the agent still encountered the ability to do otherwise. This kind of Frankfurt-style case would fail to present a situation where an agent is morally responsible while lacking alternate possibilities. 

== Responses ==
There have been a number of responses to the two-horned dilemma. One response has been to argue that a deterministic connection does not actually beg the question. Fischer has argued for this response by arguing that the Frankfurt-style case cannot stand alone, but must be taken in conjunction with other arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Martin|date=1999|title=Recent Work on Moral Responsibility|url=|journal=Ethics|volume=110|pages=93-139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These other arguments are supposed to show that causal determinism in and of itself and apart from ruling out alternate possibilities does not threaten moral responsibility. 

A second response is to revise the Frankfurt-style cases. This revision consist in creating a case with an explicit indeterministic connection where the agent is still morally responsible without any alternate possibilities. These kind of Frankfurt-style cases do it by incorporating buffer zones that act to eliminate alternate possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=David|date=2005|title=Moral Responsibility and Buffered Alternatives|url=|journal=Midwest Studies in Philosophy|volume=29|pages=126-145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of these responses are still being debated. It remains to be seen whether the Frankfurt style cases are successfully in showing what Harry Frankfurt intended them to show.

== Legacy ==
[[Michael Otsuka]] provides a more specific answer to proposed problems with Frankfurt's counterexamples.  In his article, Otsuka says,&lt;ref name=Otsuka/&gt;
"my strategy is to propose that the Principle of Alternate Possibilities be rejected in favor of a different incompatibilist principle,"  that is, different from Frankfurt's, "that I call the 'Principle of Avoidable Blame'."

'''Freedom House''' is a nonprofit community-based organization in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], [[Massachusetts]] (a neighborhood of [[Boston]]).  Freedom House is located in an area sometimes referred to as Grove Hall that lies along Blue Hill Ave. at the border between the [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] neighborhoods of [[Boston]].  Although it was historically identified with Roxbury, Freedom House currently refers to itself as being located either in Dorchester or in Grove Hall.&lt;ref name=web&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.com Freedom House] Official Web Site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of Freedom House is to promote economic self-sufficiency and social justice for residents in historically underserved neighborhoods through targeted educational development, increased civic and political engagement and progressive cultural advocacy.&lt;ref name=web/&gt;

==History==
Freedom House was founded in 1949 as a center of civil rights and advocacy for Boston's African American community.  The founders were the social workers (and married couple) [[Otto P. Snowden]] and [[Muriel S. Snowden]]. The initial goal of Freedom House was to centralize community activism in the fight for neighborhood improvement, good schools, and harmony among racial, ethnic, and religious groups in Roxbury (a neighborhood of [[Boston]]), [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="fhoverview"&gt;[http://digitalcollections.lib.neu.edu/Greenstone/cgi-bin/library.exe?e=p-01000-00---off-0freedomh--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-Zz-1---20-about---00-3-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=p&amp;p=overview Freedom House Overview] "Freedom House Photographs: Roxbury People, Places and Events 1950-1975," Northeastern University Libraries, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticized in the 1960s by black militants for taking a "self-help" approach to racial equality, Freedom House re-examined its mission, and went on to play an increasingly critical role in the struggle for civil rights in Boston,&lt;ref&gt;"Muriel Sutherland Snowden" in ''Notable American Women'', Susan Ware, Stacy Lorraine Braukman, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-674-01488-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially during the period of desegregation of Boston's public schools.

Freedom House's original location was at 151 Humboldt Street in Roxbury.  In 1952, it moved to 14 Crawford Street on the Grove Hall section of Roxbury.  On the night of January 31, 1960, a fire destroyed the Crawford Street facility. A rebuilding campaign ensued, and Boston Mayor [[John F. Collins]] was the first to "buy a brick" to help in this effort. The rebuilt facility opened in 1961 and remains the current home of the organization.&lt;ref name="fhfa"&gt;[http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m16findbioghist.htm Finding aid for the records of Freedom House] Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Muriel and Otto Snowden retired as co-directors.  A number of directors have served since then; the Executive Director is currently the Snowden's daughter, Gail Snowden.

In 1996, Freedom House considered merging with other community organizations, although in the end it decided not to do so.&lt;ref name="fhfa" /&gt;

==Activities==

The initial focus of the organization was on urban renewal; neighborhood improvement programs designed to protect Upper Roxbury from urban blight began in 1949 when Freedom House helped to organize neighborhood clean-up projects and playground construction.  Concerned over the escalating number of bars in the neighborhood, Freedom House led the community in an effort to reduce the number of new and renewed applications for liquor licenses.&lt;ref name="fhlegacy"&gt;[http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/freedom_house/Birmingham.htm Freedom House: A Legacy Preserved] Online exhibit. Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Boston, MA. 2003. April Hagins with Michelle Light.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Early programming also focused on strengthening relations between the African American and Jewish residents of Upper Roxbury.  An interracial preschool, one of few in the city, was established&lt;ref name="fhoverview" /&gt; and Freedom House participated in a Black-Jewish Roundtable fostering business ties and friendships between black and Jewish entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Yawu (2000, October 26). "Freedom House joins Black-Jewish Roundtable effort." ''Bay State Banner'', p. 2. ( Retrieved December 17, 2008, from Ethnic NewsWatch (ENW) database (restricted to subscribers). (Document ID: 492164411).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of education, Freedom House administered Project Reach, supported by a private donation, which gave scholarship funds for minority students to go to college.  Freedom House also provided scholarship counseling.  A travel/study program provided scholarships for high school students to study in [[Europe]] for the summer. In the years before court-ordered desegregation, Freedom House also raised money to support Operation Exodus, a voluntary desegregation project that bused predominantly African American students from overcrowded schools in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] to predominantly white, underenrolled schools in other parts of Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Edgar J. Driscoll Jr.|title=Muriel Snowden, 72; Cofounder of Freedom House in Roxbury|publisher=Boston Globe|date=1988-10-01|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8081628.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: Collection of Freedom House, Inc., records |publisher=Northeastern University|url=http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m16findbioghist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Smock, William H. [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=493555 "Operation Exodus: Rebuff to Politicians"] (''Harvard Crimson'', October 18, 1965.) for more information about Operation Exodus.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, Operation Exodus discontinued busing children; the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity ([[METCO]]) began busing Boston children between the city and suburban schools on a voluntary basis. Exodus bused children within the [[City of Boston]] while [[METCO]] was a separate program of urban and suburban exchange.

[[School desegregation]] was court-ordered in Boston in 1974, and in that year, the Freedom House Institute on Schools and Education was established.  The Institute began as a means of information dissemination to African-American families, as well as to ensure the safety of school children being bused to neighborhoods attempting to block the desegregation order.&lt;ref name="fhlegacy" /&gt;  The Institute grew to become a locus of community action, offering tutoring and teacher training, and providing a forum for communication between families and city administrators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/freedom_house/full_text/edu_cover.htm Freedom House Institute on Schools and Education], May 15, 1974(brochure)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of employment, Freedom House held job fairs, including Boston's first job fair for minorities, and promoted affirmative action.  They raised money for college scholarships for black students and for study programs in Africa. They even established a credit union.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar J. Driscoll Jr., Globe Staff (1988, October 1). "Muriel Snowden, 72; Cofounder of Freedom House in Roxbury" (Obituary, third edition) ''Boston Globe'', p. 75.  Retrieved December 17, 2008, from Boston Globe database via Proquest Massachusetts Newspapers (restricted to subscribers).&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom House has often acted as a forum and meeting place for the community, in times of grief as well as in times of celebration.  The Center has held galas, fashion shows and tea parties to raise money for causes that it supported, celebrated the anniversaries and birthdays of notables like [[Edward Brooke]], an African-American U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, and held Christmas and Halloween parties for children. More than 500 residents attended a mass meeting at Freedom House after the murder of 16-year-old Daniela Saunders in 1963.

Currently, Freedom House programs focus on education, technology, and leadership development.  Freedom House provides tutoring for the [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System|MCAS]] (Mass. school achievement tests), access to a computer lab, and technology training.  Freedom House also works with other organizations and the [[City of Boston]] to lower the dropout rate in Boston's high schools.

The terms '''genital modification''' and '''genital mutilation''' can refer to permanent or temporary changes to [[human sex organs]]. Some forms of genital alteration are performed on adults with their informed consent at their own behest, usually for aesthetic reasons or to enhance stimulation. However, other forms are performed on people who do not give informed consent, including infants or children. Any of these procedures may be considered modifications or mutilations in different cultural contexts and by different groups of people.

== Reasons ==
=== Body modification ===
{{main|Body modification}}
Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons. [[Penile subincision]], or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australian]]s. This procedure has taken root in Western [[body modification]] culture, the [[modern primitive]]s. [[Meatotomy]] is a form that involves splitting of the [[glans penis]] alone, while bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.

[[Genital piercing]]s and [[genital tattooing]] may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings have the benefit of increasing [[sexual pleasure]] for the pierced individual or their [[sex partner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neluis T., Armstrong M.

Similarly, [[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]] involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina.

[[Clitoris enlargement]] may be achieved temporarily through the use of a [[clitoral pump]], or it may be achieved permanently through the [[Testosterone (medication)|application or injection of testosterone]]. [[Penis enlargement]] is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

===Voluntary sex reassignment===
{{main|Sex reassignment surgery}}
People who are [[transgender]] or [[intersex]] may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]] in order to modify their bodies to match their [[gender identity]]. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries, but those who do usually see an improvement in their sexual lives as well as their mental and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cuypere G. |author2=T'Sjoen G. |author3=Beerten R. |author4=Selvaggi G. |author5=Sutter P. |author6=Hoebeke P. |author7=Monstrey S. |author8=Vansteenwegen A. |author9=Rubens R. |year=2005 | title = Sexual and physical health after sex reassignment surgery |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 679–690 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5 | pmid=16362252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surgical procedures are [[breast augmentation]] and [[vaginoplasty]] (creation of a vagina) for [[trans women]] and [[mastectomy]] (breast removal), [[metoidioplasty]] (elongation of the clitoris), and [[phalloplasty]] (creation of a penis) for [[trans men]]. Trans women may also benefit from [[hair removal]] and [[facial feminization surgery]], while some trans men may have [[liposuction]] to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.

===Involuntary sex assignment===
{{Main|Sex assignment|Intersex surgery}}
[[Intersex]] children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of their genitalia. These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic reasons. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them [[infertile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/node/97 ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery] [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]], Dated February 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cases involving male children with [[micropenis]], doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.&lt;ref&gt;Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George.

In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to [[genital injury]].

===As treatment===
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed. Females may undergo [[vaginectomy]] or [[vulvectomy]] (to the vagina and vulva, respectively), while males may undergo [[penectomy]] or [[orchiectomy]] (removal of the penis and testicles, respectively). [[Reconstructive surgery]] may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in [[sex reassignment surgery]].

During [[childbirth]], an [[episiotomy]] (cutting part of the tissue between the vagina and the anus) is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge. Advocates of [[natural childbirth]] and [[unassisted birth]] state that this intervention is often performed without medical necessity, with significant damage to the person giving birth.

[[Hymenotomy]] is the surgical perforation of an [[imperforate hymen]]. It may be performed to allow [[menstruation]] to occur. An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate [[sexual penetration]] of her vagina.

The world's first penis reduction surgery was performed in 2015, on a 17-year-old boy who had an [[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|American football]]-shaped penis as a result of recurrent [[priapism]].&lt;ref name="penisreduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2015/02/18/penis-reduction-surgery-grow-up/#7c6365c42fce|title=Penis Reduction Surgery Is No Laughing Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-inflicted===
{{main|Skoptic syndrome|Self-mutilation}}
A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as [[castration]], [[penectomy]], or [[clitoridectomy]]. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due to [[skoptic syndrome]], personal crisis related to [[gender identity]], [[mental illness]], [[self-mutilation]], [[body dysmorphia]], or social reasons.

{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external [[human female genitalia|female genitalia]] or other surgery of the female [[sex organ|genital organs]] whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the procedures used in [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment surgery]] or the [[genital modification]] of [[intersex]] persons. It is practised in several parts of the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in Africa, parts of the Middle East, and some other parts of Asia. Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated.&lt;ref name=125million&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&amp;nbsp;22: "More than 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where FGM/C is concentrated.&lt;p&gt;

In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. FGM is condemned by international human rights instruments.

===Hymenorrhaphy===
[[Hymenorrhaphy]] refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue. This new hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina. This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female [[virginity]] at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not virginal at the time of [[consummate|consummation]] of her marriage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Individuals who are victims of [[rape]], who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

===Labia stretching===
[[Labia stretching]] is the act of elongating the ''[[labia minora]]'' through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights).&lt;ref name=Rwanda&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/97388.php], "Rwandan Women View The Elongation Of Their Labia As Positive", retrieved on 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement&gt;[http://www.sexylabia.com/labia-enlargement1.htm], "Enlarging Your Labia", retrieved on 2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt; It is a familial [[cultural practice]] in Rwanda,&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt; common in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/hrp/progress/67.pdf], "Sexual health--a new focus for WHO", page 6, retrieved on 2008-06-19&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[body modification]] practice elsewhere.&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt; It is performed for sexual enhancement of both partners, aesthetics, symmetry and gratification.&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt;

===Labiaplasty and vaginoplasty===
[[File:Nach der Entfernung der inneren Schamlippen 1.jpg|thumb|Vulva with ''labia minora'' surgically removed]]

[[Cosmetic surgery]] of female genitalia, known as ''elective genitoplasty'', has become pejoratively known as ''″designer vagina″''. In May 2007, an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' strongly criticised this craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bourke |first=Emily | title = Designer vagina craze worries doctors| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date = 2009-11-12| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2741446.htm?site=local| accessdate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liao | first = Lih Mei|author2=Sarah M Creighton| title = Requests for cosmetic genitoplasty: how should healthcare providers respond?| journal = BMJ| volume = 334| issue = 7603 | pages = 1090–1092| publisher = [[British Medical Journal]]| date = 2007-05-26| url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/334/7603/1090| doi = 10.1136/bmj.39206.422269.BE| accessdate = 2007-05-29| pmid = 17525451 | pmc = 1877941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;

Some women undergo [[vaginoplasty]] or [[labiaplasty]] procedures to alter the shape of their [[vulva]]s to meet personal or societal [[aesthetic]] standards.&lt;ref name="The Perfect Vagina Documentary"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/sexuality/the-perfect-vagina/ The Perfect Vagina Documentary] Retrieved {{Nowrap|13 February 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as "designer vagina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Green Fiona | year = 2005 | title = From clitoridectomies to 'designer vaginas': The medical construction of heteronormative female bodies and sexuality through female genital cutting | url = | journal = Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 153–187 | doi=10.1080/14616660500200223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Essen B, Johnsdotter S | year = 2004 | title = Female Genital Mutilation in the West: Traditional Circumcision versus Genital Cosmetic Surgery | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 611–613 | doi=10.1111/j.0001-6349.2004.00590.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Braun Virginia | year = 2005 | title = In search of (better) sexual pleasure: female genital 'cosmetic' surgery | url = | journal = Sexualities | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 407–424 | doi=10.1177/1363460705056625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman's vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their [[labia minora]]. She states that the media, such as pornography, creates an unhealthy view of what a "good looking vagina" is and how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Simone Weil. "Designer Vaginas." Women's Voices, Feminist Visions. Ed. Susan Shaw and Janet Lee. New York: McGraw Hill (2012): 270-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Also leading to a surge of these types of procedures is increased interest in non-surgical genital alterations, such as Brazilian waxing, that make the vagina more visible to judgment. The incentive to participate in labia- and vaginoplasty may also come about in an effort to manage women's physical attributes and their sexual behavior, treating their vagina as something needing to be managed or controlled and ultimately deemed "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rodrigues Sara | year = 2012 | title = From Vaginal Exception to Exceptional Vagina: The Biopolitics of Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery | doi = 10.1177/1363460712454073 | journal = Sexualities | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 778–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clitoral hood reduction ===
[[File:Clitoral hood reduction in adult caucasian female.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Clitoral hood reduction]]]]
[[Clitoral hood reduction]] is a form of hoodplasty. When performed with the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an [[Elective surgery|elective]] [[plastic surgery]] procedure for reducing the size and the area of the [[clitoral hood]] (prepuce) in order to further expose the [[clitoral glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her [[vulva]]. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a [[labiaplasty]] procedure for reducing the [[labia minora]]; and occasionally within a [[vaginoplasty]] procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of [[female genital mutilation]].

==Males==
{{category see also|Male genital modification}}

===Castration===
{{Main|Castration}}
Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context is the removal of the [[testicles]]. Sometimes the term (meaning "cutting") is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common. Castration has been performed in many cultures throughout history, but is now rare. In the 21st century, castration has been reported among slave boys in South Asia. In addition the Czech Republic performs surgical castration on some male sex offenders. It should not be confused with [[chemical castration]].

===Hemi-castration===
The removal of one testicle (sometimes referred to as ''unilateral castration'') is usually done in the modern world only for medical reasons.&lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Ford and Beech refer to an initiation right which includes this --&gt;

===Circumcision===

[[Circumcision]] is the surgical removal of part or all of the [[foreskin]] from the penis. It is usually performed for [[religious male circumcision|religious]], cultural or medical reasons and leaves some or all of the glans permanently exposed. [[Jews]] and many [[Americans]] typically have their infants circumcised during the [[neonatal]] period, while [[Filipinos]], most Muslims and African tribes such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] circumcise in teenage years or childhood as an initiation into adulthood.

In modern medicine, circumcision may be used as treatment for severe [[phimosis]] or recurrent [[balanitis]]. Advocacy is often centered on [[preventive medicine]], while opposition is often centered on [[human rights]] (particularly the [[bodily integrity]] of the infant when circumcision is performed in the neonatal period) and the potentially harmful side effects of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Svoboda2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Svoboda|first=J.

The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that one-third of the world's men are circumcised;the majority of circumcised male population is located in [[Muslim countries]] and in the [[United States]], although there are various explanations for why the infant circumcision rate in the US is different from comparable countries.&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"/&gt;  

In 2012 the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] stated that health benefits of non-therapeutic circumcision aren't great enough to recommend it for every newborn, and that the benefits outweigh the risks, so that the procedure may be done for families who choose it.&lt;ref name="AAP2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blank |first1=Susan |last2=Brady |first2=Michael |last3=Buerk |first3=Ellen |last4=Waldemar |first4=Carlo |last5=Diekema |first5=Douglas |last6=Freedman |first6=Andrew |last7=Maxwell |first7=Lynne |last8=Wegner |first8=Steven |date=31 August 2012 |title=Circumcision Policy Statement |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/585..info |journal=Pediatrics |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages= |publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1989 |issn=1098-4275 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreskin restoration===
{{Main|Foreskin restoration}}
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the [[foreskin]] after its removal by [[circumcision]]. Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the [[scrotum]] onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve [[tissue expansion]] by stretching the penile skin forward over the [[glans penis]] with the aid of [[tension (physics)|tension]]. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
{{Main|Infibulation}}
[[File:Anacreon infibulated.jpg|thumb|The Greek poet [[Anacreon]] (582 BCE – 485 BCE), showing [[kynodesme|''kynodesmē'']]]]
Infibulation literally means to close with a clasp or a pin. The word is used to include [[Surgical suture|suturing]] of the foreskin over the [[glans penis|head of the penis]].

Infibulation is seen in rock art in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rock Art Research in Southern Africa 2000–2004|author=Jean-Loïc Le Quellec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The hunter and his art: A survey of rock art in Southern Africa|author=Jalmar and Ione Rudner|publisher=C. Struick|location=Cape Town|date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Greek infibulation consisted of piercing the foreskin and applying a gold, silver or bronze ring (''annulus''), a metal clasp (''fibula'') or pin. This was done for aesthetic reasons. The Greeks also used a nonsurgical form of infibulation by wearing a [[kynodesme]].&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine|The Bulletin of the History of Medicine]]| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2018-02-06| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}} Hodges draws a strong distinction between the kynodesme and infibulation "Tethering the ''akroposthion'' with the ''kynodesme'' is frequently confused with preputial infibulation, which had different objectives and was achieved by surgically piercing the prepuce and using the holes so created for the insertion of a metal clasp (fibula) in order to fasten the prepuce shut."&lt;/ref&gt; Infibulation in Romano-Greek culture is attested as early as Aulus Cornelius Celcus (25 BC-50 AD) and as late as [[Oribasisus]] (325-405 AD).&lt;ref name=" Schultheiss"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=D. Schultheiss |author2=J.J. Mattelaer |author3=F.M. Hodges |date=2003|title=Preputial infibulation: from ancient medicine to modern genital piercing|journal=BJU International|volume=92|issue=7|pages=758–763|doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04490.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Victorian era, both in the UK and in the United States, routine infibulation was second only to circumcision in the "war on masturbation" and was used in orphanages and mental institutions, supported by leading physicians.&lt;ref name="Schultheiss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Darby"&gt;The masturbation taboo and the rise of routine male circumcision: A review of the historiography RRJL Darby - Journal of Social History, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of [[BDSM]].

===Emasculation===
{{Main|Emasculation}}

Also known as ''total castration'' or ''nullification'', [[emasculation]] is the combination of castration and penectomy.

Due to the high risk of death from bleeding and infection, it was often considered a punishment equivalent to a [[death sentence]]. It was part of the eunuch-making of the [[Chinese court]], and it was widespread in the [[Arab slave trade]]. A castrated slave was worth more, and this offset the losses from death.&lt;ref name="Gordon 1989"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Murray Gordon|title=Slavery in the Arab World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC|date=1989|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-941533-30-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nullo (body modification)|Nullification]] or "nullo" is the term used by the modern body modification community.

In modern day [[South Asia]], some members of [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called ''nirwaan'' and seen as a [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, S. "Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India (in Herdt, G. (1996) Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History. Zone Books.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pearling===
[[File:Ampallang.jpg|thumb|[[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]]]]
{{Main|Pearling (body modification)}}
Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of partners during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===
{{Main|Penectomy|Penis removal}}
[[File:partial penectomy.jpg|thumb|left|Male genital area after partial [[penectomy]]]]
Penectomy involves the partial or total amputation of [[human penis|penis]]. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with [[castration]], or incorrectly referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on [[eunuchs]] and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a [[harem]]. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] of India may remove their penis as an expression of their [[gender identity]]. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of [[gangrene]] or [[cancer]]. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury.

In the [[ulwaluko]] circumcision ceremony, which is performed by spear, accidental penectomy is a serious risk.&lt;ref&gt;Rijken, D.J. (2014). [http://www.ulwaluko.co.za/Problems.html Description of the problems accompanying the ritual of Ulwaluko]. Ulwaluko.co.za. Retrieved 2014-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Penis removal]] for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in [[Thailand]]. [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbit]] infamously removed her husband's penis in 1993. In some circumstances it may be possible to reattach the penis.

===Penile subincision===
{{Main|Penile subincision}}
Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a [[urethrotomy]] and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the [[Urinary meatus|meatus]] towards to the base. It is performed by people of many cultures, such as the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrente]], the [[Luritja]], the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the [[Samoans]], and the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after [[ejaculation]]), and may require a man to sit down while [[urination|urinating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Meatotomy|title=Meatotomy - BME Encyclopedia|website=wiki.bme.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, [[exsanguination]], or permanent damage are major concerns.

=== Penile superincision ===
{{Main|Dorsal slit}}

A dorsal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the [[glans penis]] without removing skin or tissue.

The practice appears to have occurred in Ancient Egypt, though not commonly: 
{{Block quote|A few examples of [[Old Kingdom]] [...] statuary present some adult males — usually priests, functionaries, or low-status workers98—as having undergone a vertical slit on the dorsal aspect of the prepuce, although no flesh has been removed.&lt;ref name="Hodges"/&gt;}}

It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the [[Pacific Islands]] and the [[Philippines]]. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to [[circumcision]] when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14558">The '''Government Security Classifications Policy''' (GSCP) is a new system for classifying [[Classified information in the United Kingdom|sensitive government data]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==GPMS==
Historically, the [[Government Protective Marking Scheme]] was used by government bodies in the UK; it divides data into UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET. This system was designed for paper-based records; it is not easily adapted to modern government work and is not widely understood.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Government Security Classifications. Page 1. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current classifications==
[[File:Government Security Classifications Policy.png|thumb|The criteria for classifications are being adjusted too, so there is not always a perfect map from layer to layer.]]
The GSCP uses three levels of classification: OFFICIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class&gt; {{cite book |title=Government Security Classifications |date=April 2014 |publisher=HMG Cabinet Office |edition=Version 1.0 – October 2013 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251480/Government-Security-Classifications-April-2014.pdf |accessdate=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simpler than the old model and there is no direct relationship between the old and new classifications. "Unclassified" is deliberately omitted from the new model. Government bodies are not expected to automatically remark existing data, so there may be cases where organisations working under the new system still handle some data marked according to the old system.

Information Asset Owners continue to be responsible for information. The new policy does not specify particular IT security requirements - IT systems should be built and used in accordance with existing guidance from [[Communications-Electronics Security Group|CESG]].&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 2: Managing Information Risk at OFFICIAL. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Everybody who works with government - including contractors and suppliers - is responsible for protecting information they work with, regardless of whether it has a protective marking.

Aggregation does not automatically trigger an increase in protective marking. For instance, a database with thousands of records which are individually OFFICIAL should not be relabeled as a SECRET database. Instead, information owners are expected to make decisions about [[Security controls|controls]] based on a [[risk assessment]], and should consider what the aggregated information is, [[Need to know|who needs to access]] it, and how.

===OFFICIAL===
OFFICIAL includes most public-sector data, including a wide range of information on day-to-day government business. It is not subject to any special risks. Personal data would usually be OFFICIAL.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Government Security Classifications, Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The data should be protected by [[Security control|controls]] based on commercial best practice instead of expensive, difficult specialist technology and bureaucracy. There is no requirement to mark every document as "OFFICIAL" - it is understood that this is the default for government documents.&lt;ref name=HMG_Work_Off&gt; {{cite book |title=Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 1: Working with OFFICIAL Information |date=April 2013 |publisher=HMG Cabinet Office |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251475/FAQ1-Working-with-Official-Information-v1.2-Apr-2013.pdf}}Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 1: Working with OFFICIAL Information. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations may add "descriptors" to highlight particular types of official data, for instance commercially sensitive information about contracts, or diplomatic data which should not be seen by locally hired embassy staff. These descriptors do not automatically require special controls. "OFFICIAL" will usually include the kinds of data that were previously UNCLASSIFIED, RESTRICTED, or CONFIDENTIAL; but this may vary.

The threat model for OFFICIAL data is similar to typical large private-sector organisations; it anticipates that individual hackers, pressure groups, criminals, and investigative journalists might attempt to get information. The threat model does not guarantee protection against very persistent and skilled attacks, for instance by organised crime groups or by foreign governments; these are possible, but normal controls would make them more difficult, and much stronger controls would be disproportionate. People with routine access to OFFICIAL information should be subject to [[BPSS]] screening.

OFFICIAL may include data which is subject to separate regulatory requirements, such as the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] (personal data) or [[PCI DSS]] (card payments).

====OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE====
OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE is an additional caveat for OFFICIAL data where it is particularly important to enforce [[need to know]] rules. OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE documents should be marked, but they are not necessarily tracked.

===SECRET===
"Very sensitive information", which might (for example) seriously harm national defense or crime investigations. Data should only be marked as SECRET if the Senior Information Risk Owner (which is a board level position in an organisation) agrees that it is high-impact ''and'' that the data must be protected against very capable attackers. Although some specialist technology might be used to protect the data, there is still strong emphasis on reuse of commercial security tools.

SECRET is a big step up from OFFICIAL; government bodies are warned against being overcautious and applying much stricter rules when OFFICIAL would be sufficient.

People with routine access to SECRET information should usually have [[SC clearance]]. SECRET data may often be exempt from [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|FOIA]] disclosure.

===TOP SECRET===
Data with exceptionally high impact levels; compromise would have very serious impacts - for instance, many deaths. This requires an extremely high level of protection, and controls are expected to be similar to those used on existing "Top Secret" data, including CESG-approved products. Very little risk can be tolerated in TOP SECRET, although no activity is completely risk-free.&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications: Security Controls Framework. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

People with routine access to TOP SECRET information should usually have [[DV clearance]]. TOP SECRET information is assumed to be exempt from [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|FOIA]] disclosure. Disclosure of such information is assumed to be above the threshold for [[Official Secrets Act]] prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications: Security Controls Framework, page 19. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special handling instructions===
Special handling instructions are additional markings which used in conjunction with a classification marking to indicate the nature or source of its content, limit access to designated groups, and / or to signify the need for enhanced handling measures.  In addition to a paragraph near the start of the document special handling instructions include Descriptors, Codewords, Prefixes and national caveats.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Descriptors====
A DESCRIPTOR is used with the security classification to identify certain categories of sensitive information and indicates the need for common sense precautions to limit access.  The normal descriptors are 'COMMERCIAL’, 'LOCSEN’ and 'PERSONAL’.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Codewords====
A Codeword is a single word expressed in CAPITAL letters that follows the security classification to providing security cover for a particular asset or event. They are usually only applied to SECRET and TOP SECRET assets.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Prefixes and national caveats====
The UK prefix is added to the security classification of all assets sent to foreign governments or international organisations.  This prefix designates the UK as the originating country and that the British Government should be consulted before any possible disclosure.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

National caveats follow the security classification. Unless explicitly named, information bearing a national caveat is not sent to foreign governments, overseas contractors, international organisations or released to any foreign nationals.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;  Example
::::‘TOP SECRET – UK / US EYES ONLY’
With the exception of British Embassies and Diplomatic Missions or Service units or establishments, assets bearing the UK EYES ONLY national caveat are not sent overseas.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

==New approach to handling classified information==
As per the previous GPMS model, the choice of classification relates only to the data's confidentiality.
Unlike the old model it replaces however, the GSCP does not consider the consequence of a compromise as the primary factor, but instead is based on the capability and motivation of potential threat actors (attackers) and the acceptability of that risk to the business.

Where a capable and motivated attacker such as a Foreign Intelligence Service, or Serious and Organised Crime are considered to be in scope of the data to be classified, the business must implicitly accept this risk to classify the data as OFFICIAL.
If they do not or cannot accept this risk they must at least initially consider the data to be SECRET, though it may be reduced to OFFICIAL or increased to TOP SECRET later when the consequences of a compromise are also considered.

The implication of this approach and the binary nature of determining if a risk from capable and motivated attackers is acceptable or not, means that data cannot easily progress through the GSCP in a linear fashion as it did through GPMS. 

This is a complexity often lost on Information Asset Owners previously used to the strictly hierarchical tiered rising structure of GPMS  (e.g. UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET).

By contrast GSCP data starts either with an OFFICIAL '''OR''' SECRET classification depending on the nature of threat and its acceptability to the business, and thereafter moves up or down accordingly based on consequence of compromise.

OFFICIAL data may therefore rise to TOP SECRET, but cannot be SECRET unless the risk previously accepted for a capable attacker is revised.

SECRET data may be reduced to OFFICIAL where no serious consequences can be identified from a potential breach, or SECRET can also rise to TOP SECRET if serious consequences could arise. 

Impact levels also consider integrity and availability, but CESG's system of Business Impact Levels (BIL) is under review too and in most practical contexts have now fallen into disuse. 

It is therefore no longer strictly the case that the greater the consequences if the data confidentiality were to be compromised, the higher the classification, since data with a high impact (including material which could result in threat to life) may still be classified as OFFICIAL if the relevant business owner believes it is not necessary to protect this from an attacker who has the capabilities of a Foreign Intelligence Service or Serious and Organised Crime.

Conversely some data with much lower consequences (for example ongoing Police investigations into a criminal group, or intelligence information relating to possible prosecutions) but where the business will not accept compromise from such an attacker could be classified as SECRET.

Guidance issued in April 2014 at the implementation of the GSCP and still available on Gov.UK sources &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications&lt;/ref&gt;suggested that UK Government information systems would continue to be accredited much as before, normally using CESG [[Information Assurance Standard 1 &amp; 2]]. 
This has however been progressively discarded through GDS and NCSC blog statements since May 2014 and the IS1 &amp; 2 standard itself is no longer maintained or mandated.
Accreditation has also been largely replaced by alternative models of assurance aligned to various commercial practices. 

The NAO report "Protecting Information across Government" (Sep 2016) was somewhat critical of the move to this model and the adoption of GSCP overall &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nao.org.uk/report/protecting-information-across-government/&lt;/ref&gt;  

Existing published guidance continues to suggest that storage media which hold UK government data should still be destroyed or purged according to [[HMG IA Policy No. 5]], however terminology in this guidance and other material has not been updated fully to reflect the changes from GPMS protective markings to GSCP classifications and as such its value is now arguably somewhat reduced as a published standard.

Higher classifications still tend to require stricter [[Security vetting in the United Kingdom|personnel vetting]].

==History==
The Government Security Classifications Policy was completed and published in December 2012; additional guidance and supporting processes were developed over time.

Government bodies (and the armed forces) were expected to start using the GSCP in April 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5216">The '''Head Injury Criterion''' (HIC) is a measure of the likelihood of [[head injury]] arising from an impact.  The HIC can be used to assess safety related to vehicles, personal protective gear, and sport equipment. 

Normally the variable is derived from the measurements of an accelerometer mounted at the [[center of mass]] of a [[crash test dummy]]’s head, when the dummy is exposed to crash forces.

It is defined as:
&lt;math&gt;\mathit{H}\mathit{I}\mathit{C} = \bigg\{ \Big[ \frac{1}{t_{2}-t_{1}} \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} a(t) dt\Big]^{2.5}\left ( t_{2}-t_{1}\right ) \bigg\}_{max} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=ATB&gt;[http://www.mchenrysoftware.com/HIC%20and%20the%20ATB.pdf Head Injury Criteria and the ATB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henn&gt;[http://www.health.uottawa.ca/biomech/courses/apa6903/CrashTests%20and%20the%20HIC.pdf Crash Tests and the Head Injury Criterion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
where ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the initial and final times (in seconds) chosen to maximize HIC, and [[acceleration]] ''a'' is measured in ''g''s ([[standard gravity]] acceleration).  The time duration, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is limited to a maximum value of 36&amp;nbsp;ms,&lt;ref name=ATB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henn/&gt; usually 15&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA458677 A Test Methodology for Assessing Demining Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that the HIC includes the effects of head acceleration and the duration of the acceleration.  Large accelerations may be tolerated for very short times.

At a HIC of 1000, there is an 18% probability of a severe head injury, a 55% probability of a serious injury and a 90% probability of a moderate head injury to the average adult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.ac.in/sadhana/Pdf2007Aug/397.PDF The increasing importance of the biomechanics of impact trauma]&lt;/ref&gt;

HIC is used to determine  the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) star [[Automobile safety rating|rating for automobile safety]] and to determine ratings given by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]].&lt;ref name="guidelines09"&gt;[http://www.iihs.org/ratings/protocols/pdf/measures_frontal.pdf Guidelines for Rating Injury Measures, 2009, IIHS]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], head injury risk is evaluated mainly on the basis of head injury criterion.  A value of 700 is the maximum allowed under the provisions of the U.S. advanced airbag regulation (NHTSA, 2000) and is the maximum score for an "acceptable" IIHS rating for a particular vehicle.&lt;ref name="guidelines09"/&gt;   

A HIC-15 (meaning a measure of impact over 15&amp;nbsp;milliseconds) of 700 is estimated to represent a 5 percent risk of a severe injury (Mertz et al., 1997). A "severe" injury is one with a score of 4+ on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) (Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, 1990).&lt;ref name="guidelines09"/&gt; 

Data for specific vehicles can be found on various automotive review websites.  Some sample data is as follows, for comparative purposes:
* The 1998 [[Ford Windstar]], marketed as one of the safest minivans of that year, tested out to a HIC=305 score for driver &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/ford/windstar-minivan/1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A small car, a 1998 [[Dodge Neon]], tested at HIC=265. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/dodge/neon-4-door-sedan/1998&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A common family sedan, a 1998 [[Toyota Camry]], tested at HIC=288.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/toyota/camry-4-door-sedan/1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2007 Camry at HIC=175. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/toyota/camry-4-door-sedan/2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Honne''''' and '''''tatemae''''' are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words that describe the contrast between a person's {{Nihongo|true [[feeling]]s and desires|[[wikt:本音|本音]]|hon'ne|"true sound"}} and {{Nihongo|the behavior and opinions one displays in public|[[wikt:建前|建前]]|tatemae|"built in front", "façade"}}.
The public use of this dyadic concept began in the [[post-war]] era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Takeo Doi]],The anatomy of self,1985,page35&lt;/ref&gt;

''Honne'' may be contrary to what is expected by society or what is required according to one's position and circumstances, and they are often kept hidden, except with one's closest friends. ''Tatemae'' is what is expected by society and required according to one's position and circumstances, and these may or may not match one's ''honne''.

In many cases ''tatemae'' leads to outright telling of lies in order to avoid exposing the true inward feelings.

The ''honne–tatemae'' divide is considered by some to be of paramount importance in [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Takeo | last = Doi | authorlink = Takeo Doi | title = The Anatomy of Dependence: Exploring an area of the Japanese psyche: feelings of indulgence | publisher = Kodansha International | year = 1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Honne'' and ''tatemae'' are similar to the Persian concepts of ''zaher'' (ظاهر) and ''batin'' (باطن). The self in Iranian culture is thought of as having two separate and distinct levels: an inner private core self (batin), and a social self or the "proper public face" (zaher).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Shabnam | last = Ziabakhsh | title = The Relationship Between the "Iranian Self" and the Acculturative Patterns of Iranian Immigrant Women | publisher = Simon Fraser University | year = 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Some analysts{{who | date=May 2012}} see ''honne'' and ''tatemae'' as a cultural necessity resulting from a [[Population density|large number of people living in a comparatively small]] island nation. Close-knit co-operation and the avoidance of [[Group conflict|conflict]] are considered to be of vital importance in everyday life.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The vulnerability of the Japanese to failures and slurs ,which make them feel shame,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page153&lt;/ref&gt; inferiority,&lt;ref&gt;[[Takeo Doi]],The anatomy of dependence,1971,page53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]],War without Mercy,1986,page122,127,133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]],Embracing Defeat,1999,page284&lt;/ref&gt; makes them to feel competitions so keenly to avoid them except necessary ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page153,154,164&lt;/ref&gt; A Japanese worthy of being called sincere never verges on the danger of insulting a person he does not mean to provoke to aggression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page218&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Japanese tend to go to great lengths to avoid conflict, especially within the context of large groups.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The conflict between ''honne'' and ''[[Giri (Japanese)|giri]]'' (social obligations) is one of the main topics of Japanese drama throughout the ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page205-207,315(...conceal his emotions,to give up his desires,..)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the protagonist would have to choose between carrying out his obligations to his family/[[feudal lord]] or pursuing a clandestine love affair.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The same concept in Chinese culture is called inside face and outside face, and they also frequently come into conflict.

==Effect==
Contemporary phenomena such as ''[[hikikomori]]'' and [[parasite single]]s are seen as examples of late Japanese culture's growing problem of the new generation growing up unable to deal with the complexities of ''honne–tatemae''{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and pressure of an increasingly consumerist society.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Debate over whether ''tatemae'' and ''honne'' are a uniquely Japanese phenomenon continues in Japan,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} especially among those Japanese who feel their culture is unique in having the concepts of "private mind" and "public mind". Although there might not be direct single word translations for ''honne'' and ''tatemae'' in some languages,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} they do have two-word descriptions; for example in English "private mind" and "public mind".

Some researchers{{who|date=August 2015}} suggest that the need for explicit words for ''tatemae'' and ''honne'' in Japanese culture is evidence that the concept is relatively new to Japan, whereas the unspoken understanding in many other cultures indicates a deeper internalization of the concepts. In any case, all cultures have conventions that help to determine appropriate communication and behavior in various social contexts which are implicitly understood without an explicit name for the social mores on which the conventions are based.

A similar discord of Japanese true own feeling and the pretension before public is observed in ''yase-gaman'',&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]],War without Mercy,1986,page230&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase means even starving to skeleton,being content or pretending to be so.Nowadays,the phrase is used for two different meanings, expressing archaic samurai virtue of self-discipline,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page218(man who is free of passion),228,63(frugality)&lt;/ref&gt; silent moral heroism,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lafcadio Hearn]],Japan:An Attempt at Interpretation,1904,Dodo Press,page226,246,250,252&lt;/ref&gt; or ridiculing stubbornness, face-savingness.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]],Embracing Defeat,1999,page284&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idam'''([[Tamil language|Tamil]]) ([[Sanskrit]]: इदम् or अयम् or इयम्) is a Tamil/Sanskrit word which denotes location or position or place. In grammar it is used at the beginning or middle of a sentence as a nominative or attributive pronoun, combined with or without ''ya'', adds emphasis to other nouns, propositions etc.; and means - this, here or yonder, present or seen nearby, fit for, or without reference to noun refers to एतद् ('that') or to what precedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman shivraman Apte|publisher=University of Chicago|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=Idam&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (Sloka XVI.13), in the phrase – इदम् अस्तीदम् अपि मे the word, ''idam'', has been used to mean 'this', "this it is, this also mine",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bhagavad Gita|publisher=SUNY Press|page=622|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JoicgCMZ5cC&amp;pg=PA622&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WjTqUvGZGOSo4ASqkYH4Bw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (Stanza I.i.10) in the phrase – पर्याप्तं त्विदम् एतेषां, meaning "sufficient though that of these", ''idam'' used as  एतद् refers to 'that', whereas (in Stanza. II.5.9) in the phrase – अयम् स्तनयित्नुः, meaning "Thunder is Vayu", ''ayam'' refers to 'is'. In the phrase – ब्रह्म इदम् सर्वं, which means - "[[Brahman]] possessing all the qualities is all-pervading", the word ''idam'' is used in the sense of 'it is', the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is identified with ''idam sarvam'' and the same phrase also expresses the whole world because the world springs from the Atman as is indicated in Stanza V.iii.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad |publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=58,223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sIq2gHSxgkC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WjTqUvGZGOSo4ASqkYH4Bw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Vedas]], ''idam'' as ''ayam'' has been used as a subject in nominal sentences as an equivalent of a proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nominal Sentence in Sanskrit and Indo-Aryan|author=Andries Breunis|publisher=BRILL|pages=66|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6-QNYBfzfgQC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WjTqUvGZGOSo4ASqkYH4Bw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connotation==

In Pada 32 of Book II Ch.IV of his [[Ashtadhyayi]] [[Pāṇini]], who states that words apply per object, explains that: 
इदमोऽन्वादेशेऽशनुदात्त तृत्यादौ ||
in the room of ''idam'' 'this', in case of its re-employment in a subsequent member of the same sentence and referring to the same thing (''anvadesha'' i.e. ''[[adesha]]'' after re-employment) there is the substitution of as’ which is a ''anudatta'' i.e. gravely accented, when the third case-affix and the rest follow. That means – अ replaces इदम् in all cases except the nominative and the accusative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadhyati of Panini|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=322|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TbzVy6vqyCkC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;lpg=PA322&amp;dq=idam+panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7x1Xae3Gj5&amp;sig=g3ypbj7NFJH2jxyHzeRHdzYKeOc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MpjrUuPrFYGAhAfJqoGQBA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=idam%20panini&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context Katayayana stipulates that one should specify a pronominal used in subsequently referring to something should be co-referential with a previously used term because replacement by an anaphoric pronoun should not possibly be allowed where there is not co-reference.  And, with regard to ''taddhita'' affixation abstract patterns like ''tasya idam'' ('prescribing a genitive relationship'), ''tad asmin'' ('prescribing a locative relationship') and ''tat karoti'' ('prescribing an action meaning involving an accusative relationship') have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recent Research in Paninian Studies|author=George Cardona|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=225, 124|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5MOEttrZhbcC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=idam+panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cdss01WnlR&amp;sig=W7zNF9X1ngc8hkKiJ0ScjPNwj1Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MpjrUuPrFYGAhAfJqoGQBA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=idam%20panini&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genitive form of ''idams'' is explained as a ''sthaneyoga sasthi'' (Pada I.i.49) and the locative form is explained as ''parasaptami''  when a case ending beginning with the instrumental case endings follows. A substitute which has s’ as an it-letter replaces the whole of the original form which step requires an ''anubandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astadhyayi of Panini|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=51|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ELHsQH9aQsQC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SDLqUujPKsrQ4QTezYCADA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaiyata tells us that words with ''Krta'' and ''Tadditha'' affixes denoting ''bhava'' ('being') extended for ''bhava'' to mean ''dravya'' ('object') would result in ''dravya'', a pronoun, referring to anything not specified i.e. to an individual object or locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy|author=Peter M.Scharf|publisher=American Philosophical Society|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qh4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=etad+panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PvpUTb__e4&amp;sig=RFIEvLaffRWKOMYDz65DPDtntPY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nWjsUvfSOpDd7QaApoHIAw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Patanjali]] the verb as’ means - ''bhava'' or ''kriya''. The term, ''Kriyadharma'' ('the properties of an action'), is also used in contrast with the terms ''dravyadharma'' and ''sattvadharma''; and Helaraja states that which has the latter two is something that can be referred to by demonstratives such as ''idam'' ('this') and ''tad'' ('that').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Process and Language: A study of Mahabhashya|author=Hideyo Ogawa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tc1dP2WB4sC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=etad+panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZdvDx7Ze8h&amp;sig=DQ-XOMyQkQcSss6oCpe4yczpRLI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nWjsUvfSOpDd7QaApoHIAw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=snippet&amp;q=etad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pali]] language, ''Ida'' and ''Idam'' are accusative singular neuters as is the original ''etad'' or ''eghad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Three Gandhari Ekottarikagama-type Sutras|author=Mark Allon|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoV5Dz20oo4C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3TbqUpGPF8rw4QTS_ICgDA&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature ''idam'' refers to land, landscape or place, which word is one of the six forming the three sets of oppositions; ''idam'' pairs in opposition with ''kalam'' ('time') i.e. ''idavakupeyar'' that gives name to a place or to something in or from that place, and ''kalavakupeyar'' which applies the name of a time or season to something that occurs in time and season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tamil Oratory and Dravidian Aesthetics|author=Bernard Bate|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=100, 103, 191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uP7LHS3cDMC&amp;pg=PT127&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3TbqUpGPF8rw4QTS_ICgDA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBTg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minard (according to whose criteria repetition would imply an adverb and a declined form indicates a pronoun) considers ''idam'' in the phrase ''idam sarvam'' as an adverb but ''idam'' of the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] ( Stanza 7.4.1.25) firstly implies the article and thereafter 'the All', the Absolute totality which removes the anti-thesis of ''ayam'' ('this') and ''asau'' ('yonder world').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jaiminiya Brahmana I, 1-65|author=H.W.Bodewitz|author-link=Henk Bodewitz|publisher=BRILL|page=167 Notes St.53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuMUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6jDqUpjYGIHs4wSbtoGABg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madhvacharya]] consistent with [[Samkhya|Samkhya philosophy]] and [[Sayana]] with [[Advaita Vedanta]], take ''idam'' occurring in the first line – न वि जानामि यदिवेदमस्मि निण्यः संनध्दो मनसा चरामि in Mantra I.164.37 of the [[Rig Veda]] to mean 'the Universe' instead of its adverbial meaning "here", where the word ''samnaddho'' means ignorance rather than scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge|author=K.N.Jayatilleke|publisher=Routledge|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pBTAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SDLqUujPKsrQ4QTezYCADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic elucidation==

The [[Bhagavad Gita]]’s and the post-Vedic use of ''idam'' and ''tad'' refers to the Absolute or Brahman or "the All" i.e. to that which the [[Vedic]] sages sought to clarify. The ''idam'' occurring in the beginning of Rig Veda mantra X.135.7 refers to the seat of [[Yama]] where is heard the sound of Yama’s flute which no mortal can resist.  ''Idam'' is the nominative singular neuter demonstrative pronouns, Being and Non-being the singular subject which is one without a second, in which condition it applies to anything falling within the range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mantramanjari|author=Raimundo Panikkar|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=159, 533, 656|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M01LSxaneasC&amp;pg=PA656&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SDLqUujPKsrQ4QTezYCADA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita elucidation==

According to [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]], ''aham'' (I-sense secured in introspection, ''visayi'') and ''idam'' (thou-sense sense secured in extrospection, ''visaya'') are polarly related, they are as opposed as light and darkness. ''Idam Brahman'' refers to ''etadakshara'' - [[Brahman]] as the objective unity and the ''tadakshara'' – Brahman refers to the subject, the Atman i.e. Brahman as Itself, which cannot be an object matter of ''pramana-jnana'' since the Atman is non-dual and does not have the knowing and the known in it. Reality is to be cognized objectively as an ''idam'' as the goal by looking inwards otherwise the ''vidhi-vakyas'' would serve no purpose. Beyond "I" is not any person knower or doer but the transcendental ground of "I", the unspeakable; the indeterminate cannot be spoken about directly. Sankara condemns [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] or [[Adhyasa]], the wrong apprehension of a content where it is not nor can ever be, which the true knowledge of ''idam'' or Brahman alone can eradicate. The ''idam'' aspect of ''[[ahamkara]]'' reflected by the light of the pure self becomes the object of the "I-sense".

==Yoga and Shaivite elucidation==

The [[Yoga]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]] considers the Individual Self inseparable from and identical with the Universal Self. [[Shiva]] represents the supreme consciousness Brahman; the subject (consciousness) which is the positive ''Shiva-tattva'' is called ''aham'' and the object ('power of consciousness') which is the negative ''Shakti-tattva'' is called ''idam''('this'), the former which pervades the thirty-five ''tattvas''  being passive is dependent on Shakti (''idam'') for creation to occur. The three principal modes of Shakti are ''iccha-shakti'' ('will power'), ''jnana-shakti'' ('power of knowledge') and ''kriya-shakti'' ('power of action'). ''Sadashiva-tattva'', which is the first thing with a cause, identified with ''iccha-shakti'' consists of both ''aham'', and ''idam'',  ''Ishvara-tattva'' identified with ''jnana-shakti'' accounts for ''aham'' recognizing ''idam'', and ''Sadvidya-tattva'' identified with ''kriya-shakti'' is the complete "subject-object unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring Chakras: Awaken your untapped energy|author=Susan G.Shumsky|publisher=Career Press|pages=92–95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lr-hnUVcoyQC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8DXqUqioAsrw4QTS_ICgDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Cit-shakti'', ''Ananda-shakti'', ''Iccha-shakti'', ''Jnana-shakti'' and ''Kriya-shakti'' the ''svatantraya'' of Shiva is reflected. ''Shakti-tattva'' too is a reflection of ''Shiva-shakti''. The four ''tattvas'' are not created by the energies of Shiva but are an expression or ''ushma'' ("heat") of His true nature. ''Suddhavidya'' is the real state of Shiva or the state of ''aham aham-idam ida'', [[Ishvara]] which is the state of ''idam-aham'', ''Sadashiva'' is the state of ''aham-idam'' and ''Shakti'' is the state of ''aham''. In the first section of ''aham aham-idam idam'', ''aham aham'' signifies the stable state associated with one’s cognition of the real nature of Self, the truth of this universe, and the second section ''idam idam'' signifies the unstable state when one experiences the universe is false and unreal. The fourth energy called the ''pralayakala pramatri shakti'' makes one reside in the state of ''Suddhavidya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme|author=Swami Lakshman|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=21–23, 53–55|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Dbf8VHcPoGMC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EIPrUozjI5LwhQfg-IHoBg&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]] defines ''sristi'' ("Creation") as the act of the Supreme Lord making ''idam'' ('object') appear through self-manifestation in the back-ground of ''akasha'' (void or space) created by self-limitation or self-negation. Here ''Idam'' signifies the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]] which ''Idamta'' though not different from ''Ahamta'' is not eternal; the self-experience of ''Ahamta'' prevails over the self-experience of indistinct ''Idamta'' which disappears on attaining the ''stithi'' state – ''aham eva idam'' ("I am all this"). ''Idamta'', a self-extension, aids in the realization of ''Paramshiva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sadhana|author=Debabrata Sen Sharma|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=23–27, 36|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yzXDIG-XWHkC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3I7rUuTPNYOThgep8YB4&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression '''immaculate perception''' has been used in various senses by various philosophers.

* It is a [[nickname]] for [[Plato]]'s theory of knowledge.  It is called this because Plato believed that all knowledge came from past lives, and from one's knowledge of [[The Forms]].
* It was used by the English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], who referred to it as the necessity of "keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature and so receiving the images simply as they are."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Francis. (1620). The Great Instauration.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was used by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his text ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.  Nietzsche argued that this kind of perception mere fiction, for it ignores the intimate connection between the perceiver and the external world.  In particular, it denies the important role that the will and desires of the perceiver have on every perception.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, Michael. ''A Dancer’s Virtue: Human Life in Light of Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence''. Concept XXVIII, 2005. [http://www.publications.villanova.edu/Concept/2005/Dancer's%20Virtue.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapper 8Ball released a song in March 2012 titled "immaculate perception" featuring Waka Flocka Flame and Yelawolf.

In [[mathematics]], if  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''inclusion map''' (also '''inclusion function''', '''insertion''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first1 = S. | last1 = Mac Lane | first2 = G. | last2 = Birkhoff | title = Algebra | year = 1967}}, page 5, says "Note that “insertion” is a function &lt;math&gt;S \to U&lt;/math&gt; and "inclusion" a relation &lt;math&gt;S \subset U&lt;/math&gt;; every inclusion relation gives rise to an insertion function."&lt;/ref&gt; or '''canonical injection''') is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; that sends each element, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, treated as an element of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\iota: A\rightarrow B, \qquad \iota(x)=x.&lt;/math&gt;

A "hooked arrow" ({{unichar|21AA|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH HOOK|ulink=Unicode}})&lt;ref name="Unicode Arrows"&gt;{{cite web| title = Arrows – Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes used in place of the function arrow above to denote an inclusion map; thus: &lt;math&gt;\iota: A\hookrightarrow B.&lt;/math&gt; (On the other hand, this notation is sometimes reserved for [[embedding]]s.)

This and other analogous [[injective]] functions&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = C. | last = Chevalley | title = Fundamental Concepts of Algebra | year = 1956}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[substructure (mathematics)|substructures]] are sometimes called '''natural injections'''.

Given any [[morphism]] ''f'' between [[object (category theory)|objects]] ''X'' and ''Y'', if there is an inclusion map into the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] &lt;math&gt;\iota : A\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, then one can form the [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] ''fi'' of ''f''.  In many instances, one can also construct a canonical inclusion into the [[codomain]] ''R''→''Y'' known as the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f''.

== Applications of inclusion maps ==
Inclusion maps tend to be [[homomorphism]]s of [[algebraic structure]]s; thus, such inclusion maps are [[embedding]]s.  More precisely, given a sub-structure closed under some operations, the inclusion map will be an embedding for tautological reasons. For example, for a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;, to require that

:&lt;math&gt;\iota(x\star y)=\iota(x)\star \iota(y)&lt;/math&gt;

is simply to say that &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; is consistently computed in the sub-structure and the large structure. The case of a [[unary operation]] is similar; but one should also look at [[nullary]] operations, which pick out a ''constant'' element. Here the point is that [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] means such constants must already be given in the substructure.

Inclusion maps are seen in algebraic topology where if ''A'' is a [[strong deformation retract]] of ''X'', the inclusion map yields an isomorphism between all homotopy groups (i.e. is a [[Homotopy|homotopy equivalence]]).

Inclusion maps in [[geometry]] come in different kinds: for example [[embedding]]s of [[submanifold]]s. [[Covariance and contravariance of functors|Contravariant]] objects&lt;ref name=pullback&gt;I.e., objects that have [[pullback]]s; these are called [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] in an older and unrelated terminology&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[differential form]]s ''restrict'' to submanifolds, giving a mapping in the ''other direction''. Another example, more sophisticated, is that of [[affine scheme]]s, for which the inclusions

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(R/I) \to \operatorname{Spec}(R)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(R/I^2) \to \operatorname{Spec}(R)&lt;/math&gt;

may be different [[morphism]]s, where ''R'' is a [[commutative ring]] and ''I'' an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].

[[Image:Indicator function illustration.png|right|thumb|A three-dimensional plot of an indicator function, shown over a square two-dimensional domain (set X): the 'raised' portion overlays those two-dimensional points which are members of the 'indicated' subset (A).]]
In [[mathematics]], an '''indicator function''' or a '''characteristic function''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' that indicates membership of an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in a [[subset]] ''A'' of ''X'', having the value 1 for all elements of ''A'' and the value 0 for all elements of ''X'' not in ''A''. It is usually denoted by a symbol 1 or ''I'', sometimes in boldface or  [[blackboard bold]]face, with a subscript specifying the subset.

In other contexts, such as [[computer science]], this would more often be described as a '''boolean [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] function''' (to test set inclusion).

==Definition==
The indicator function of a subset ''A'' of a set ''X'' is a function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A \colon X \to \{ 0,1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A(x) :=
\begin{cases}
1 &amp;\text{if } x \in A, \\
0 &amp;\text{if } x \notin A.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Iverson bracket]] allows the equivalent notation, &lt;math&gt;[x\in A]&lt;/math&gt;, to be used instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi_A&lt;/math&gt;, ''K&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' or even just &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. (The [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; appears because it is the initial letter of the Greek word χαρακτήρ, which is the ultimate origin of the word ''characteristic''.)

The set of all indicator functions on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, both sets are sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt;. This is a special case (&lt;math&gt;Y =\{0,1\}=2&lt;/math&gt;) of the notation &lt;math&gt;Y^X&lt;/math&gt; for the set of all functions &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y &lt;/math&gt;.

==Remark on notation and terminology==
* The notation &lt;math&gt;1_A&lt;/math&gt; is also used to denote the [[identity function]] of ''A''.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}
* The notation &lt;math&gt;\chi_A&lt;/math&gt; is also used to denote the [[Characteristic function (convex analysis)|characteristic function]] in [[convex analysis]].{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

A related concept in [[statistics]] is that of a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. (This must not be confused with "dummy variables" as that term is usually used in mathematics, also called a [[free variables and bound variables|bound variable]].)

The term "[[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]" has an unrelated meaning in [[probability theory|classic probability theory]]. For this reason, [[List of probabilists|traditional probabilists]] use the term '''indicator function''' for the function defined here almost exclusively, while mathematicians in other fields are more likely to use the term ''characteristic function'' to describe the function that indicates membership in a set.

In [[fuzzy logic]] and [[Many-valued logic|modern many-valued logic]], predicates are the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic functions]] of a [[probability distribution]]. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.

==Basic properties==
The ''indicator'' or ''characteristic'' [[function (mathematics)|function]] of a subset ''A'' of some set ''X'', [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] elements of ''X'' to the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] {0,1}.

This mapping is [[surjective]] only when ''A'' is a non-empty [[proper subset]] of ''X''. If ''A'' ≡ ''X'', then
'''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. By a similar argument, if ''A'' ≡ Ø then '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

In the following, the dot represents multiplication, 1·1 = 1, 1·0 = 0 etc. "+" and "−" represent addition and subtraction. "&lt;math&gt;\cap &lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;\cup &lt;/math&gt;" is intersection and union, respectively.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are two subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_{A\cap B} = \min\{\mathbf{1}_A,\mathbf{1}_B\} = \mathbf{1}_A \cdot\mathbf{1}_B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_{A\cup B} = \max\{{\mathbf{1}_A,\mathbf{1}_B}\} = \mathbf{1}_A + \mathbf{1}_B - \mathbf{1}_A \cdot\mathbf{1}_B,&lt;/math&gt;
and the indicator function of the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;A^C&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_{A^\complement} = 1-\mathbf{1}_A&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, suppose &lt;math&gt;A_1, \dotsc, A_n&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of subsets of ''X''.  For any
''x'' ∈ ''X'':

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{k \in I} ( 1 - \mathbf{1}_{A_k}(x))&lt;/math&gt;

is clearly a product of 0s and 1s.  This product has the value 1 at
precisely those ''x'' ∈ ''X'' that belong to none of the sets ''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and
is 0 otherwise. That is

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{k \in I} ( 1 - \mathbf{1}_{A_k}) = \mathbf{1}_{X - \bigcup_{k} A_k} = 1 - \mathbf{1}_{\bigcup_{k} A_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the product on the left hand side,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{1}_{\bigcup_{k} A_k}= 1 - \sum_{F \subseteq \{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}} (-1)^{|F|} \mathbf{1}_{\bigcap_F A_k} = \sum_{\emptyset \neq F \subseteq \{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}} (-1)^{|F|+1} \mathbf{1}_{\bigcap_F A_k} &lt;/math&gt;

where |''F''| is the cardinality of ''F''. This is one form of the principle of [[inclusion-exclusion]].

As suggested by the previous example, the indicator function is a useful notational device in [[combinatorics]].  The notation is used in other places as well, for instance in [[probability theory]]: if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[probability space]] with probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Measure (mathematics)|measurable set]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A&lt;/math&gt; becomes a [[random variable]] whose [[expected value]] is equal to the probability of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(\mathbf{1}_A)= \int_{X} \mathbf{1}_A(x)\,d\mathbb{P} = \int_{A} d\mathbb{P} = \operatorname{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

This identity is used in a simple proof of [[Markov's inequality]].

In many cases, such as [[order theory]], the inverse of the indicator function may be defined. This is commonly called the [[generalized Möbius function]], as a generalization of the inverse of the indicator function in elementary [[number theory]], the [[Möbius function]]. (See paragraph below about the use of the inverse in classical recursion theory.)

==Mean, variance and covariance==
Given a [[probability space]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb P)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;, the indicator random variable &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A \colon \Omega \rightarrow \Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A (\omega) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \omega \in A,&lt;/math&gt; otherwise &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A (\omega) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Mean]]: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(\mathbf{1}_A (\omega)) = \operatorname{P}(A) &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Variance]]: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(\mathbf{1}_A (\omega)) = \operatorname{P}(A)(1 - \operatorname{P}(A)) &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Covariance]]: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Cov}(\mathbf{1}_A (\omega), \mathbf{1}_B (\omega)) = \operatorname{P}(A \cap B) - \operatorname{P}(A)\operatorname{P}(B) &lt;/math&gt;

==Characteristic function in recursion theory, Gödel's and Kleene's ''representing function''==
[[Kurt Gödel]] described the ''representing function'' in his 1934 paper "On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems". (The paper appears on pp.&amp;nbsp;41–74 in [[Martin Davis]] ed. ''The Undecidable''):
:"There shall correspond to each class or relation R a representing function φ(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0 if R(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and φ(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1 if ~R(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)." (p. 42; the "~" indicates logical inversion i.e. "NOT")

[[Stephen Kleene]] (1952) (p.&amp;nbsp;227) offers up the same definition in the context of the [[primitive recursive function]]s as a function φ of a predicate P takes on values 0 if the predicate is true and 1 if the predicate is false.

For example, because the product of characteristic functions φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* . . . *φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 whenever any one of the functions equals 0, it plays the role of logical OR: IF φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 OR φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 OR . . . OR φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 THEN their product is 0. What appears to the modern reader as the representing function's logical inversion, i.e. the representing function is 0 when the function R is "true" or satisfied", plays a useful role in Kleene's definition of the logical  functions OR, AND, and IMPLY (p.&amp;nbsp;228), the bounded- (p.&amp;nbsp;228) and unbounded- (p.&amp;nbsp;279ff) [[mu operator]]s (Kleene (1952)) and the CASE function (p.&amp;nbsp;229).

==Characteristic function in fuzzy set theory==
In classical mathematics, characteristic functions of sets only take values 1 (members) or 0 (non-members). In [[fuzzy set theory]], characteristic functions are generalized to take value in the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1], or more generally, in some [[universal algebra|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (usually required to be at least a [[partially ordered set|poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]). Such generalized characteristic functions are more usually called [[membership function (mathematics)|membership function]]s, and the corresponding "sets" are called ''fuzzy'' sets. Fuzzy sets model the gradual change in the membership [[degree of truth|degree]] seen in many real-world [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]]s like "tall", "warm", etc.

==Derivatives of the indicator function==
A particular indicator function is the [[Heaviside step function]]. The Heaviside step function  ''H''(''x'') is the indicator function of the one-dimensional positive half-line, i.e. the domain [0, ∞). The [[distributional derivative]] of the Heaviside step function is equal to the [[Dirac delta function]], i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta(x)=\tfrac{d H(x)}{dx},
&lt;/math&gt;

with the following property:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \, \delta(x) dx =  f(0).
&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of the Heaviside step function can be seen as the 'inward normal derivative' at the 'boundary' of the domain given by the positive half-line. In higher dimensions, the derivative naturally generalises to the inward normal derivative, while the Heaviside step function naturally generalises to the indicator function of some domain ''D''. The surface of ''D'' will be denoted by ''S''. Proceeding, it can be derived that the [[Laplacian of the indicator#Dirac surface delta function|inward normal derivative of the indicator]] gives rise to a 'surface delta function', which can be indicated by δ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;('''x'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_S(\mathbf{x})=-\mathbf{n}_x\cdot\nabla_x\mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{x}\in D}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the outward [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] of the surface ''S''. This 'surface delta function' has the following property:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lange|first=Rutger-Jan|year=2012|publisher=Springer|title=Potential theory, path integrals and the Laplacian of the indicator|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2012|pages=29–30|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP11(2012)032|issue=11|bibcode=2012JHEP...11..032L|doi=10.1007/JHEP11(2012)032|arxiv = 1302.0864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;

By setting the function ''f'' equal to one, it follows that the [[Laplacian of the indicator#Dirac surface delta function|inward normal derivative of the indicator]] integrates to the numerical value of the [[surface area]] ''S''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6579">The role of '''information commissioner''' differs from nation to nation.  Most commonly it is a title given to a government regulator in the fields of [[freedom of information]] and the [[data protection|protection of personal data]] in the widest sense. The office often functions as a specialist [[ombudsman]] service.

==Australia==
The [[Office of the Australian Information Commissioner]] (OAIC) has functions relating to freedom of information and privacy, as well as information policy.  The [[Office of the Privacy Commissioner]], which was the national privacy regulator, was integrated into the OAIC on 1 November 2010.  There are three independent commissioners in the OAIC: the [[Australian Information Commissioner]], the [[Australian Freedom of Information Commissioner|Freedom of Information Commissioner]], and the [[Australian Privacy Commissioner|Privacy Commissioner]].

==Bangladesh==
The Information Commission of Bangladesh promotes and protects access to information.  It is formed under the Right to Information Act, 2009, whose stated object is to empower the citizens by promoting transparency and accountability in the working of the public and private organizations, with the ultimate aim of decreasing corruption and establishing good governance. The Act creates a regime through which the citizens of the country may have access to information under the control of public and other authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh Right to Information Act (Full Text)|url=http://www.moi.gov.bd/RTI/RTI_English.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The [[Information Commissioner of Canada]] is an independent ombudsman appointed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] who investigates complaints from people who believe they have been denied rights provided under Canada's ''[[Access to Information Act]]''. Similar bodies at provincial level include the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner (Ontario)]].

== Germany ==
The [[Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information]] (FfDF) is the federal commissioner not only for [[data protection]] but also (since commencement of the [[Freedom of information laws by country#Germany|German Freedom of Information Act]] on January 1, 2006) for [[freedom of information]].
  
==Hong Kong==
The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data is charged with education and enforcement of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, which first came into force in 1997.  The commissioner has the power to investigate and impose fines for violations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/about_pcpd/our_role/what_we_do.html The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
The [[Central Information Commission]], and State Information Commissions, receive and inquire into complaints from anyone who has been refused access to any information requested under the [[Right to Information Act]], or whose rights under that Act have otherwise been obstructed, for example by being prevented from submitting a data request or being required to pay an excessive fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cic.gov.in/ Central Information Commission website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
{{See also|Office of the Data Protection Commissioner}}

The [[Office of the Information Commissioner (Ireland)|Office of the Information Commissioner]] ({{lang-ga| Oifig an Choimisinéara Faisnéise}}) was set up under the terms of the [[Freedom of information laws by country#Ireland|Freedom of Information Act]], 1997, which came into effect in April 1998. The Information Commissioner may conduct reviews of the decisions of public bodies in relation to requests for access to information. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the Information Commissioner also holds the position of [[Ombudsman]]. The first holder of the office was [[Kevin Murphy (ombudsman)|Kevin Murphy]]. In March 2003, the [[Government of Ireland]] nominated [[Emily O'Reilly]] to be Information Commissioner (and Ombudsman). In December 2013, [[Peter Tyndall]] was appointed as her replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.gov.ie/en/News/Media-Releases/2013-Media-Releases/President-appoints-Peter-Tyndall-Ombudsman.html President appoints Peter Tyndall as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner] The Office of the Ombudsman, 2013-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Switzerland ==

The [[Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner]] is responsible for the supervision of federal authorities and private bodies with respect to [[data protection]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (status as of 1 January 2014)], [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 21 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[freedom of information legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20022540/index.html Federal Act on Freedom of Information in the Administration of 17 December 2004 (status as of 19 August 2014)], [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 21 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] is responsible for regulating compliance with the [[Data Protection Act 1998]], [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] and the [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]. The [[Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002]] is the responsibility of the [[Scottish Information Commissioner]].

==Other European States==
All other countries of the [[European Union]] and the [[European Economic Area]] have equivalent officials created under their versions of [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|Directive 95/46]]. The Europa website gives links to such bodies around [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm European data protection bodies list]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperation Among Information Commissioners==
The [[Global Privacy Enforcement Network]] is a transnational organization for the coordination of privacy laws among its 23 member states and the European Union.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6089">In [[scientific journal|scientific publishing]], the 1969 '''Ingelfinger rule''' originally stipulated that ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' (''NEJM'') would not publish findings that had been published elsewhere, in other media or in other journals. The rule was subsequently adopted by several other scientific journals, and has shaped scientific publishing ever since.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically it has also helped to ensure that the journal's content is fresh and does not duplicate content previously reported elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ingelfinger rule has been seen as having the aim of preventing authors from performing [[duplicate publication]]s which would unduly inflate their publication record.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite arxiv

 |eprint=0906.4019
 |class=physics.soc-ph
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it has also been stated that the real reason for the Ingelfinger rule is to protect the journals' revenue stream, and with the increase in popularity of [[preprint server]]s such as [[arXiv]], [[figshare]], [[bioRxiv]], and [[PeerJ|PeerJPrePrints]] many journals have loosened their requirements concerning the Ingelfinger rule.&lt;ref&gt;

 |page=99
 |publisher=[[MIT Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-262-02619-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a defense of the policy, the journal said in an editorial that the practice discouraged scientists from talking to the media before their work was peer reviewed.&lt;ref name="editorial"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule is named for [[Franz J. Ingelfinger]], the ''NEJM'' editor-in-chief who enunciated it in 1969. An earlier version of the policy had been expressed in 1960 by [[Samuel Goudsmit]], editor of the ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', but did not become as well known.&lt;ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49506">An '''internet relationship''' is a relationship between people who have met [[online]], and in many cases know each other only via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last3=Crowcroft | first3=Jon | last2= Bodaghi |first2=Mansoureh|last1=Quercia |first1=Daniele|title=Loosing friends on facebook|journal=ACM Web Science Conference|url=http://delcampovillares.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/websci_loosing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online relationships are similar in many ways to [[pen pal]] relationships. This relationship can be romantic, platonic, or even based on business affairs. An internet relationship (or online relationship) is generally sustained for a certain amount of time before being titled a relationship, just as in-person relationships. The major difference here is that an internet relationship is sustained via computer or online service, and the individuals in the relationship may or may not ever meet each other in person. Otherwise, the term is quite broad and can include relationships based upon text, video, audio, or even virtual character. This relationship can be between people in different regions, different countries, different sides of the world, or even people who reside in the same area but do not communicate in person.

== Technological advances ==
According to J. Michael Jaffe, author of ''Gender, Pseudonyms, and CMC: Masking Identities and Baring Souls'', "the Internet was originally established to expedite communication between governmental scientists and defense experts, and was not at all intended to be the popular 'interpersonal mass medium' it has become",&lt;ref name="Jaffe2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fragment.nl/mirror/Jaffe1995/|title=Gender, Pseudonyms, and CMC: Masking Identities and Baring Souls|last=Jaffe|first=J. Michael|publisher=University of Michigan|work=Paper for 45th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association, 1995, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA|accessdate=26 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901232435/http://www.fragment.nl/mirror/Jaffe1995/|archivedate=1 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet new and revolutionary devices enabling the mass public to communicate online are constantly being developed and released.

Rather than having many devices for different uses and ways of interacting, communicating online is more accessible and cheaper by having an Internet function built into one device, such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[Tablet computer|tablets]], [[laptop]]s, and [[smartphone]]s. Other ways of communicating online with these devices are via services and applications such as [[Email]], [[Skype]], [[iChat]], [[instant messaging]] programs, [[social networking service]]s, asynchronous discussion groups, online games, [[virtual worlds]] and the [[World Wide Web]].

Some of these ways of communicating online are asynchronous (meaning not in real time), such as [[YouTube]] and some are synchronous (immediate communication), such as [[Twitter]]. Synchronous communication occurs when two or more participants are interacting in real time via voice or text chat.&lt;ref name="Wood, A and Smith, M.2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Online communication : linking technology, identity and culture|last=Wood|first=Andrew F.|last2=Smith|first2=Matthew J.|publisher=Erlbaum|year=2001|isbn=0-8058-3731-0|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of relationships ==
Many types of internet relationships are possible in today's world of technology.

=== Internet dating ===
Internet dating is very relevant in the lives of many individuals worldwide.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yENNc7Fp3vQC&amp;dq=online+dating+sites+in+the+90s|title=Social networking communities and e-dating services: concepts and implications|last=Romm- Livermore|first=Celia|publisher=Idea Group Inc. (IGI)|year=2009|isbn=9781605661049|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major benefit in the rise of Internet dating is the decrease in prostitution. People no longer need to search on the streets to find casual relationships. They can find them online if that is what they desire.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2" /&gt; Internet dating websites offer matchmaking services for people to find love or whatever else they may be looking for. The creation of the internet and its progressive innovations have opened up doors for people to meet other people who they may very well have never met otherwise.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2" /&gt;

==== Dating website innovations ====
Although the availability of uploading videos to the internet is not a new innovation, it has been made easier since 2008 thanks to [[YouTube]]. YouTube began the surge of video streaming sites in 2005 and within three years, smaller web developers started implementing video sharing on their sites. Internet dating sites have benefitted greatly since the surge in easiness and accessibility of picture and video uploading.&lt;ref name="online videos2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2279/1/Proceedings_amcis-0635-2009-File001.pdf|title=Performing the Discourse of Sexuality Online Foucault, Butler, and Video-sharing on Sexual Social Networking Sites|last=Kreps|first=David G.|publisher=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videos and pictures are equally important for most personal profiles. These profiles can be found on sites used for [[interpersonal relationships]] other than dating as well. "The body, although graphically absent, does not have to be any less present."&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt; Older and less advanced sites usually still allow, and often require, each user to upload a picture. Newer and more advanced sites offer the possibility of [[streaming media]] live via the user's profile for the site. The inclusion of videos and pictures has become almost a necessity for sexual social networking sites to maintain the loyalty of their members.&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt; It is appealing to internet users to be able to view and share videos, especially when forming relationships or friendships.&lt;ref name="Online dating has changed everything, author says2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jason|first=Sharon|date=January 23, 2013|title=Online dating has changed everything, author says|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/23/love-algorithms-online-dating/1856853/|journal=USA Today|issue=Internet Dating}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Who uses online dating sites ====
According to an article in the ''New York Times'', mediated matchmaking has been around since the mid-1800s.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaefer|first=Laura J.|date=14 February 2003|title=Looking for Love, Online or On Paer|url=https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=Looking+for+love%2C+online+or+on+paper.+The+New+York+Times+Shaefer&amp;oq=Looking+for+love%2C+online+or+on+paper.+The+New+York+Times+Shaefer&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;gs_l=hp.3...8030.10040.1.10149.9.9.0.0.0.0.92.585.8.8.0.crf.1.3Rk45Pdpew4&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=fb8265af22147407&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=598|journal=The New York Times|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online dating was made available in the mid-1990s, with the creation of the first dating sites.&lt;ref name="Brooks2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/files/idea-white-paper-final-review-copy-only-updated-1-19.pdf|title=How has Internet dating changed society?  An Insider's Look|last=Brooks|first=Mark|publisher=Courtland Brooks|work=Scholarly Article|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dating sites create a space for liberation of sexuality. According to Sam Yagan of [[OkCupid]], "the period between New Year's Day and Valentine's Day is [our] busiest six weeks of the year".&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt; Changes that online dating companies have created include not only the increase of pickiness in singles, but the rise in interracial marriages and spread the acceptance of homosexual individuals. Dating sites "are a place where sexual minorities, inter-sexed people and gay people are enjoying a newly found freedom".&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt; Several studies have shown the availability of online dating to produce a greater closeness and intimacy between individuals because it circumvents barriers that face-to-face interactions might have.  "Participating in personal relationships online allow for almost full freedom from power relations in the offline/real world."&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt;

A plethora of virtual sexual identities are represented in online profiles. The amount of personal information users are being asked to provide is constantly increasing. More and more online users are starting to explore and experiment with aspects of their sexual identities, whereas before, they may have felt uncomfortable due to social constraints or fear of possible repercussions.&lt;ref name="Electronic Cloak2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=199529|title=Electronic Cloak: Secret Sexual Deviance in Cybersociety|last=DiMarco|first=Heather|publisher=William Publishing|year=2003|location=Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most internet sites containing personal profiles require individuals to fill in "personal information" sections. Often these sections include a series of multiple choice questions. Due to the anonymity of these virtual profiles, individuals are more frequent to 'role'-play at being one of the predefined 'types', although offline, reservations may inhibit the individual from sharing true answers.

There have also been many studies done to observe online daters and their reason for turning to the internet to look for romantic partners. According to Robert J. Brym and Rhonda L. Lenton, users of online games, websites, and other virtual communities are encouraged to conceal their identities and learn things about themselves that they never knew before.&lt;ref name="canada2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bestsoftworks.com/docs/loveonline.pdf|title=Love Online: A Report On Digital Dating in Canada|last=Brym|first=Robert J.|publisher=Msn.ca|year=2001|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a concealed identity, an online user can be whoever they want to be at that exact moment. They have the ability to venture outside of their comfort zone and act as someone completely different.

The ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication'' reports the results of a study conducted by Robert J. Stephure, Susan D. Boon, Stacy L. MacKinnon, and Vicki L. Deveau on types of relationships online participants were seeking. They concluded that "when asked what they were looking for in an online relationship, the considerable majority of participants expressed interest in seeking fun, companionship, and someone to talk to. Most also reported interests in developing casual friendships and dating relationships with online partners. Substantially fewer reported using the Internet for the specific purposes of identifying potential sexual or marital partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Boon|first2=Susan D.|last3=MacKinnon|first3=Stacey L.|last4=Deveau|first4=Vicki L.|year=2009|title=Internet Initiated Relationships: Associations Between Age and Involvement in Online Dating|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=14|issue=3|pages=658–681|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01457.x|last1=Stephure|first1=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2012 looked at about 19,000 married people and those who met their spouse online said their marriage was more satisfying than those who met their spouse offline. Plus, marriages that began online were less likely to end in separation or divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Insider|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/happy-marriage-online-dating-2017-10|accessdate=31 Jul 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faye Mishna, Alan McLuckie, and Michael Saini, co-authors of the Oxford Journal article ''Real-World Dangers in an Online Reality: A Qualitative Study Examining Online Relationships and Cyber Abuse'', reported the results of their research and observation of over 35,000 individuals between the ages of 6 and 24 who have been or currently are a part of an internet relationship. Of the final 346 posts chosen to be included in the study, the average age of online users sharing information about their online relationship(s) was 14 years old.&lt;ref name="Abuse2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mishna|first=Faye|date=June 2009|title=Real- World Dangers in an Online Reality: A Qualitative Study Examining Online Relationships and Cyber Abuse|url=http://swr.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/2/107.full.pdf|journal=The Oxford Journal|volume=33|issue=2|author2=Alan McLuckie|author3=Michael Saini}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming result was that children and youth consider their online relationships to be just as "real" as their offline relationships. The study also showed that the internet plays a crucial role in most sexual and romantic experiences of adolescent users.&lt;ref name="Abuse2" /&gt;

==== Success of dating websites and social networks ====
Canaan Partners have reported that the dating industry brings in an estimate of 3-4 billion dollars yearly from membership fees and advertisements.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt; The range of dating sites has expanded vastly over the past two decades. There are dating websites that focus on the [[matchmaking]] of certain groups of people based on religion, sexual preference, race, etc.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt;

The average life expectancy has been on a rise, leaving many young singles feeling as if they have plenty of time to find a [[life partner]]. This opens up time to travel and experience things without the burden of a relationship. As of 1996, more than 20% of Canadians "were not living in the same census subdivision as they were five years earlier"&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt; and as of 1998, more than half of employed Canadians worried "they [did] not have enough time to spend with their family and friends".&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt; Due to an increase in many businesses requiring their employees to travel, singles, often young professionals, find online dating websites to be the perfect answer to their "problem", states Brym and Lenton.

Erik Shipmon, author of “Why Do People Date Online?", exclaims, "the Internet is the ultimate singles' bar—without the noise, the drunks, and the high cost of all those not-so-happy hours. Nor, thanks to online dating membership sites, do you have to depend on your friends and family to hook you up with people they think would be perfect for you—and who wouldn't be perfect for, well, anyone, which is why they are still unattached”.&lt;ref name="internet like singles bar2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cupidnights.com/dating-advice/article-12.html|title=Why do people date online|last=Shipmon|first=Erik|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cybersex ====
Some people who are in an online relationship also participate in [[cybersex]], which is a virtual sex encounter in which two or more individuals who are connected remotely via computer network send each other sexually explicit messages describing a sexual experience. This can also include individuals communicating sexually via video or audio. Some websites offer a cybersex service, where a patron pays the website owner in exchange for an online sexual experience with another person.

Cybersex sometimes includes real life masturbation. The quality of a cybersex encounter typically depends upon the participants' abilities to evoke a vivid, visceral mental picture in the minds of their partners. Imagination and suspension of disbelief are also critically important. Cybersex can occur either within the context of existing or intimate relationships, e.g. among lovers who are geographically separated, or among individuals who have no prior knowledge of one another and meet in virtual spaces or cyberspaces and may even remain anonymous to one another. In some contexts cybersex is enhanced by the use of a webcam to transmit real-time video of the partners.

=== Social networking relationships ===
Social networking has enabled people to connect with each other via the internet. Sometimes, members of a [[social networking service]] do know all, or many of their "friends" (Facebook) or "connections" (LinkedIn) etc. in person. However, sometimes internet relationships are formed through these services, including but not limited to: [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Google Plus]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Pinterest]], [[DeviantArt]] and [[Xanga]].

"Social networking service" is a very broad term, branching out to websites based on many different aspects. One aspect that is possible on all social networking sites is the possibility of an internet relationship. These sites enable users to search for new connections based on location, education, experiences, hobbies, age, gender, and more. This allows individuals meeting each other to already have some characteristic in common. These sites usually allow for people who do not know each other to "add" each other as a connection or friend and to send each other messages. This connection can lead to more communication between two individuals. An immense amount of information about the individuals can be found directly on their social network profile. Proving those individuals include plentiful and accurate information about themselves, people in online relationships can find out much about each other by viewing profiles and "about me's".  Communication between individuals can become more frequent, thus forming some type of relationship via the internet. This relationship can turn into an acquaintance, a friendship, a romantic relationship, or even a business partnership.

=== Online gaming ===
Online gaming elicits the introduction of many different types of people in one interface. A common type of online game where individuals form relationships is the MMORPG, or a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]. Some examples of MMORPGs are [[World of Warcraft]], [[EverQuest]], [[SecondLife]], [[Final Fantasy XI|Final Fantasy Online]], and [[Minecraft]] (see [[List of massively multiplayer online role-playing games]].) These games enable individuals to create a character that represents them and interact with other characters played by real individuals, while at the same time carrying out the tasks and goals of the actual game.

Online games other than MMORPGs can elicit internet relationships as well. Card games such as [[Online poker|poker]] and board games like [[Pictionary]] have been transformed into virtual interfaces that allow an individual to play against people across the internet, as well as chatting with them. [[Virtual pet site]]s such as [[Webkinz]] and [[Neopets]] are another type of popular online game that allow individuals to socialize with other players.

Games create social spaces for people of various ages, with userbases often crossing age brackets. Most of these games enable individuals to chat with each other, as well as form groups and [[Gaming clan|clans]]. This interaction can lead to further communication, turning into a friendship or romantic relationship.

=== Online forums and chatrooms ===
An [[Internet forum]] is a website that includes conversations in the form of posted messages. Forums can be for general chatting or can be broken down into categories and topics. They can be used to ask questions, post opinions, or debate topics. Forums include their own jargon, for example a conversation is a "thread". Different forums also have different lingo and styles of communicating.

There are religion forums, music forums, car forums, and countless other topics. These forums elicit communication between individuals no matter the location, gender, ethnicity, etc. although some do include age restrictions. Through these forums people may comment on each other's topics or threads, and with further communication form a friendship, partnership, or romantic relationship.

=== Professional relationships ===
Even in work settings, the introduction of the internet has established easier and sometimes more practical forms of communicating. Compared to traditional communication in business, communication through internet can be more efficient in the aspect of time-saving. The internet is often referred to as a vehicle for [[investor relations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hedlin|first=Pontus|date=1 July 1999|title=The Internet as a vehicle for investor relations: the Swedish case|journal=European Accounting Review|volume=8|issue=2|pages=373–381|doi=10.1080/096381899336104}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "electronic highway" for business transactions in the United States.&lt;ref name="Business2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing More Business on the Internet: How the Electronic Highway Is Transforming American Companies|last=Cronin|first=Mary|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1995|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has increased organizational involvement by facilitating the flow of information between face-to-face meetings and allowing for people to arrange meetings at virtually any given time. Socially, it has stimulated positive change in people's lives by creating new forms of online interaction and enhancing offline relationships worldwide, allowing for better and more efficient. In the real world, companies which are considered as leading companies in the world already introduced efficient ways of communication based on internet. (See [[business communication]]&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt;)

== Advantages ==
For more [[intimate relationship]]s, research has shown that personal disclosures create a greater sense of intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurenceau|first=JP|date=May 1998|title=Intimacy as an interpersonal process: the importance of self-disclosure, partner disclosure, and perceived partner responsiveness in interpersonal exchanges|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1238–51|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.5.1238|pmid=9599440|author2=Barrett, LF|author3=Pietromonaco, PR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a sense of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] and equality, which people search for in a relationship, and this is often easier to achieve online than face to face, although not all disclosures are responded to positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pennebaker|first=James W.|year=1989|title=Confession, Inhibition, and Disease|journal=Department of Psychology|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|location=Dallas, TX|publisher=Southern Methodist University|volume=22|pages=211–244|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60309-3|isbn=9780120152223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are able to engage in more self-disclosure than an average interaction, because a person can share their inner thoughts, feelings and beliefs and be met with less disapproval and fewer sanctions online than is the case in face-to-face encounters. Researcher Cooper termed this type of relationship as a "Triple A Engine" implying that internet relationships are accessible, affordable, and anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Sex in America Online: An Exploration of Sex, Marital Status, and Sexual Identity in Internet Sex Seeking and its Impacts|url=|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=45|issue=2|pages=175–86|doi=10.1080/00224490801987481|last1=Albright|first1=Julie M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Katelyn Y. A.|date=1 February 2000|title=Plan 9 From Cyberspace: The Implications of the Internet for Personality and Social Psychology|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=4|issue=1|pages=57–75|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0401_6|author2=Bargh, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online, barriers that might stand in the way of a potential relationship such as [[physical attractiveness]], [[social anxiety]] and [[stuttering]] do not exist. Whereas those could hinder an individual in face-to-face encounters, an Internet interaction negates this and allows the individual freedom. Research has shown that stigmas such as these can make a large impact on first impressions in face-to-face meeting, and this does not apply with an online relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Katelyn Y. A.|date=1 September 1999|title=Causes and Consequences of Social Interaction on the Internet: A Conceptual Framework|journal=Media Psychology|volume=1|issue=3|pages=249–269|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0103_4|author2=Bargh, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as the internet has become a worldwide phenomenon, many people can interact with others around the world, or find someone who fits their radar or their type, if there is no one who they find physically or emotionally attractive in their own area. The internet allows for interaction of many different people so there is greater chance of finding someone more attractive. The Internet "enhances face-to-face and telephone communication as network members become more aware of each others' needs and stimulate their relationships through more frequent contact".&lt;ref name="Wellman2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wellman|first=Barry|date=1 November 2001|title=Does the Internet Increase, Decrease, or Supplement Social Capital? : Social Networks, Participation, and Community Commitment|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/45/3/436.full.pdf+html|journal=[[American Behavioral Scientist]]|volume=45|issue=3|pages=436–455|doi=10.1177/00027640121957286|author2=ANAbel Quan Haase|author3=James Witte|author4=Keith Hampton|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Walter's Social Information Processing Theory, computer-mediated communications can work for people.&lt;ref&gt;http://crx.sagepub.com/content/21/4/460.short&lt;/ref&gt;  While online interactions take roughly four times longer than face-to-face interactions, this gives users the opportunity to evaluate and the time to think, making sure they say the perfect response.  Thus, chronemics is the only verbal clue available to digital communications.  With the focus on conversation and not appearance, digital interactions over time will develop higher levels of intimacy than face-to-face interactions.

In ''The Forms of Capital''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pierre |last=Bourdieu |authorlink=Pierre Bourdieu|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm |title=The Forms of Capital |year=1986 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]] defines social capital as "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition."

Social capital researchers have found&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Bargh|first1=John A.|last2=McKenna|first2=Katelyn Y. A.|title=THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL LIFE|url=http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/psicologia/pei/download/bargh2004.pdf|publisher=The annual review of psychology|date=11 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that “various forms of social capital, including ties with friends and neighbors, are related to indices of psychological well-being, such as self-esteem and satisfaction with life”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Ellison|first1=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|title=The Benefits of Facebook “Friends:” Social Capital and College Students’ Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x/full
|publisher=Journal of computer-mediated communication|date= July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the use of a [[social networking service]] could help to improve the [[social capital]].

More than helping to improve the [[social capital]], the use of a [[social networking service]] could help to retain it. For instance, Cummings, Lee and Kraut have shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Cummings|first1=J.|last2=Lee|first2=J.|last3=Kraut|first3=R.|title=Communication technology and friendship during the transition from high school to college|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; that communication services like [[instant messaging]] “help college students to remain close to their high school friends after they leave home for college”.

== Disadvantages ==
The Internet provides the opportunity for [[misrepresentation]], particularly in the early stages of a relationship when commitment is low, and self-presentation and enhancement agendas are paramount.&lt;ref name="Tice et al.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Butler|first2=J. L.|last3=Muarven|first3=M. B.|last4=Stillwell|first4=A.M.|year=1995|title=When modesty prevails: differential favourability of self-representation to friends and strangers|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=69|issue=|pages=1120–38|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1120|last1=Tice|first1=D. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving many complaints about his social networking site [[Ashley Madison]], founder Noel Biderman responded to accusations that his and other similar [[cyber-dating]] sites are at fault for the "rising divorce rates and growth in casual dating". Biderman argued that the idea for Ashleymadison.com came to him when he realized the growing number of people on "mainstream dating sites" were married or in a relationship but posing as singles in order to start an affair.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt;

In an empirical study of commitment and misrepresentation on the internet Cornwell and Lundgren (2001)&lt;ref name="Cornwell, B. and Lundgren, D. C.(2001).2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lundgren|first2=D. C.|year=2001|title=Love on the Internet: involvement and misrepresentation in romantic relationships in cyberspace vs. real-space|url=|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=17|issue=|pages=197–211|doi=10.1016/s0747-5632(00)00040-6|last1=Cornwell|first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveyed 80 chat-room users. Half about their 'realspace' relationships, and half about their cyberspace relationships.  They found that 'realspace' relationships were considered to be more serious, with greater feelings of commitment, than the cyber-relationship participants.  Both groups, however, reported similar levels of satisfaction and potential for 'emotional growth' with regard to romantic relationships.  Cornwell and Lundgren&lt;ref name="Cornwell, B. and Lundgren, D. C.(2001).2" /&gt; went on to ask about whether the participants had misrepresented themselves to their partner in a number of areas: their interests (e.g. hobbies, musical tastes); their age; their background; their appearance and 'mis-presentation of yourself in any other way' (p.&amp;nbsp;203). Participants responded using either yes or no to each question, and their score was summed into a misrepresentation measure. The results can be found below:&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2"&gt;Joinson, A. 2003. Understanding the Psychology of Internet Behaviour. Palgrave Macmillan. p.3. {{ISBN|0-333-98468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dangers of internet relationships ===
An often forgotten aspect on online interactions is the possible danger present. The option for an individual to conceal their identity may be harmless in many cases, but it can also lead to extremely dangerous situations. Hidden identities are often used in cases of [[Cyber-bullying|cyberbullying]] and [[cyberstalking]]. Concealing person's true identity is also a technique that can be used to manipulate their new online [[friend]] or [[Sexual partner|lover]] into convincing them that they are someone completely different. This is something most [[online predator]]s do in order to prey on victims. Despite the awareness of dangers, Mishna et al. found children and youth to still partake in online relationships with little care or concern for negative effects.&lt;ref name="Abuse2" /&gt; Brym and Lenton also claim that "although [their] true identities are usually concealed, they sometimes decide to meet and interact in real life". From these dangers, people seriously have considered a kind of policy forcing people to use their real name only and open their personal information. By doing this, people are not going to do harmful to others because their information can be checked by others.&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt;

Engaging in internet relationships is also risky because the information placed online about an individual does not have to be accurate. An individual can formulate an entirely different persona and pose as this person as long as they desire. This can be hurtful to individuals who are honest about their identities and believe that they are in a positive relationship or friendship with the individual. This concept has been most recently illustrated on the television show, ''[[Catfish: The TV Show]]''.

=== Internet affairs ===
Internet affairs offer a new perspective on the definition of an [[affair]]. Some people consider internet relationships to be classified as an affair while others claim contact affairs are much more serious. Trent Parker and Karen Wampler conducted a [[qualitative study]] to discover the different perceptions of internet relationships based on gender differences. Through their study they found internet affairs were considered less of an affair than a physical relationship.&lt;ref name="Parker, Trent S. 20032"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wampler|first2=Karen S.|year=2003|title=How Bad Is It? Perceptions Of The Relationship Impact Of Different Types Of Internet Sexual Activities|url=|journal=Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal|volume=25|issue=4|page=415|last1=Parker|first1=Trent S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the results from the same study Parker and Wampler also concluded that women considered sexual internet activities such as [[internet porn]] much more severe than the men did. Internet affairs and physical contact affairs are similar because they both involve another partner. "The primary difference between an internet affair and an affair is that in an affair, the couple meet to engage in the relationship. With internet affairs, on the other hand, the couple rarely meet. This offers a unique advantage to internet affairs."&lt;ref name="Parker, Trent S. 20032" /&gt;

== Effects on face-to-face interactions ==
Since the creation of the [[Internet]], [[communication]] has become one of it is prime uses. It has become a ubiquitous force in people's everyday lives due to the increase in the regularity and quality of [[interaction]]. The internet has also created a new approach to [[human]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], and it has changed the way people connect to one another in their [[social world]]s. Online relationships have also changed which effective strategies we use to perform maintenance on our relationships, depending on the exclusivity of the internet the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Kevin B.|year=2004|title=On-line Relational Maintenance Strategies and Perceptions of Partners Within Exclusively Internet Based and Primarily Internet Based Relationships|journal=Communication Studies|volume=55|issue=2|pages=239–253|doi=10.1080/10510970409388617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, [[Mail|postal services]] made communication possible without the necessity of physical presence, and the invention of the [[telephone]] allowed [[synchronous communication]] between people across long distances. The internet combined the advantages of both mail and telephone, unifying the speed of the telephone with the written character of the mail service. The evolution of communication within the Internet has arguably changed the nature of individuals' relationships with one another.&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; Some see a major negative impact resulting in an increased use of internet communication is of its diversion of true community&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt; because online interaction via computers is often regarded as a more impersonal communication medium than face-to-face communication.&lt;ref name="Comp Face to Face2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebie|first=Linda|date=31 October 1995|title=Interaction Process in Computer-Mediated and Face-to-Face Groups|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q21x4565t3217568/|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work|volume=4|issue=2–3|pages=127–152|doi=10.1007/BF00749744|author2=Jonathan A.

Mcgrath|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider the incorporation of the internet allowing online activities to be "viewed as an extension of offline activities".&lt;ref name="Wellman2" /&gt;  The multiple techniques that humans use to communicate, such as taking turns or nodding in agreement, are absent in these settings.&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; Without the [[body language]] cues present in a face-to-face conversation, such as pauses or gestures, participants in instant messaging may type over one another's messages without necessarily waiting for a cue to talk. Also, with or without the correct grammar, tone and context can be misunderstood. Recently people who already adapted internet-based communication have missed face-to-face interactions because this traditional way of communication is able to offer advancement in our relationships.

=== Early positive view ===
In 1991, Stone argued that when [[virtual communities]] began forming, this process generated a new type of social space where people could still apparently meet [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]], but this required a redefinition of the terms “meet” and “face-to-face.” These virtual communities allowed people to effortlessly access others, and in many ways to feel better connected, feel that they receive greater support from others, and to obtain emotional satisfaction from their [[families]], [[communities]] and [[society]]. However, it does have several obvious problems for people to communicate with others. The representative limitation of this way of communications is that it cannot contain people's diverse emotions completely, so it can cause diverse misunderstanding between people.&lt;ref name="Stone, A. R.2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=114785|title=Cyberspace : first steps|last=Stone|first=Allucquere Rosanne|publisher=MIT Press|year=1991|isbn=0-262-02327-X|edition=4th print.|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=81–118|chapter=Will the real body please stand up?: boundary stories about virtual cultures|editor=Benedikt, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudocommunity theory ===
In 1987, this understanding of social spaces was challenged by scholars such as [[James R. Beniger]]. Beniger questioned whether these virtual communities were “real” or were pseudo communities,&lt;ref name="Beniger, J.2"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1987|title=Personalization of the mass media and the growth of pseudo-community|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=14|issue=|pages=352–371|doi=10.1177/009365087014003005|last1=Beniger|first1=J.|authorlink=James R. Beniger}}&lt;/ref&gt; “a pattern relating that, while looking highly [[interpersonal]] interaction, is essentially impersonal.”&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; He put forward the idea that in a society within the virtual world, participants lack the necessary honesty it would take to create a “real” virtual community.&lt;ref name="Beniger, J.2" /&gt;

=== Weakening of social ties ===
In many cases the introduction of the Internet as a social instigator may cause a repercussion leading to a weakening of social ties. In a study conducted in 1998, Robert Kraut et al. discovered that Internet users were becoming less socially involved. They linked this to an increase in [[loneliness]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in relation to use of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Kraut, R. E., Patterson, M., Lundmark, V., Kiesler, S., Mukhopadhyay, T., &amp; Scherlis, W.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraut|first=R|date=September 1998|title=Internet paradox. A social technology that reduces social involvement and psychological well-being?|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=53|issue=9|pages=1017–31|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.53.9.1017|pmid=9841579|author2=Patterson, M|author3=Lundmark, V|author4=Kiesler, S|author5=Mukopadhyay, T|author6=Scherlis, W|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiesler/publications/1998pdfs/1998Kraut-InternetParadox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these findings may have been sound, in a later study, Kraut et al.&lt;ref name="kraut022"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraut|first=Robert|date=1 January 2002|title=Internet Paradox Revisited|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=58|issue=1|pages=49–74|doi=10.1111/1540-4560.00248|author2=Kiesler, Sara|author3=Boneva, Bonka|author4=Cummings, Jonathon|author5=Helgeson, Vicki|author6=Crawford, Anne|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1100&amp;context=hcii}}&lt;/ref&gt; revisited his original study with the idea of expanding his current initial sample and correlating it with new subsequently collected [[longitudinal data]]. This synthesis produced a different outcome than the one that Kraut had originally presented.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

In this newer paper, Kraut stated that there were fewer negative affects than he had originally found, and in some cases the negative effect had vanished. In the second study he saw that small positive effects began to appear in social [[involvement]] and psychological well-being. Assessing the effect of the Internet over a period of time, he saw people's use of the Internet increase in sophistication.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

During the Kraut et al. study, the researchers asked reclusive people if they use the Internet to counteract the loss of social skills that are needed in face-to-face encounters.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt; They also asked people with strong [[social skills]] whether they use the Internet to amplify their [[Aptitude|abilities]] to [[Social network|network]] amongst people. The study discovered that these people who already possessed strong social skills were the ones who received the most beneficial outcome to using the Internet. The concluding [[analysis]] was, that rather than helping to decrease the difference between those who already had social skills compared with those lacking in social skills, internet use had actually exacerbated the differences in the skill level needed for social interaction.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

=== Assisting reclusive people ===
This theory was later challenged in a study, by McKenna et al.,&lt;ref name="McKenna, K. Y. A., &amp; Bargh, J. A.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bargh|first2=J. A.|year=1998|title=Coming out in the age of the Internet: Identity "demarginalization" through virtual group participation|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=75|issue=|pages=681–694|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.3.681|last1=McKenna|first1=K. Y. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that indicated that people who are more [[socially inept]] use the internet to create an initial contact which allows them to explore their “true self" within these interactions. These social interactions within [[cyberspace]] tend to lead to closer and high quality relationships which influence face-to-face encounters. In essence, these findings meant that although it is not clear whether the internet helps reclusive people develop better social skills, it does allow reclusive people to form relationships that may not have existed otherwise because of their lack of comfort with interpersonal situations in general. When these relationships emerge into face-to-face relationships it is hard to distinguish these relationships from those that started as face-to-face interactions. Future studies on this topic may allow scholars to define whether or not society is becoming too dependent on the Internet as a social tool.&lt;ref name="McKenna, K. Y. A., &amp; Bargh, J. A.2" /&gt; Those relationships are also found for people suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicidal ideation]] and other [[mental health]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=McLean|first2=J. P.|last3=Sheffield|first3=J.|year=2009|title=Examining suicide-risk individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes|url=|journal=Archives of Suicide Research|volume=13|issue=3|pages=264–276|doi=10.1080/13811110903044419|pmid=19591000|last1=Harris|first1=K. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suicidal people were more likely to go online in search of new interpersonal relationships and to seek interpersonal help. Similar findings were found for suicidal [[LGBT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Sexuality and suicidality: Matched-pairs analyses reveal unique characteristics in non-heterosexual suicidal behaviors|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=42|issue=5|pages=729–737|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0112-2|last1=Harris|first1=K. M.|pmid=23657812}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies show that people who have trouble meeting similar others, not only the 'socially inept', are using the internet to create stronger and more extensive interpersonal relationships.

===The danger of the “alone together”===

The meaning of the word “[[friend]]” remains somewhat unclear, especially when it comes to online friendship. Online friends are either relations that people know it the real world or people met once at a conference, or maybe they are friends with someone known on a [[social networking service]].
[[Albert Mehrabian]] showed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehrabian|first=Albert|year=1971|title=Silent Messages|publisher=[[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth]]|edition=1st|isbn=0-534-00910-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 93% of communication is through nonverbal means (including body language) and only 7% down to verbal communication. Thus, it would be difficult to build true friendships on a social network. Moreover, according to [[Sherry Tutkle]], a “face-to-face friendship is risky”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turkle, Sherry |title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other}}&lt;/ref&gt; That can lead people to a virtual confinement.
	
The other issue raised by experts is the race for Facebook friends. If a Facebook user had in 2012 243 friends in average,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/271947/social-network-contacts-average-number-of-friends-in-the-uk-by-gender/|title=social-network-contacts-average-number-of-friends-in-the-uk-by-gender||date=January 11, 2018|website=Statista|publisher=|access-date=Mars 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; this number increased to 338 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Aaron|title=6 new facts about Facebook|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/6-new-facts-about-facebook/|accessdate=10 March 2018|work=Pew research|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Whatever the exact number is, it is safe to assume that it is greater than 150. However, According to evolutionary anthropologist [[Robin Dunbar]], 150 is the largest number of people you can share trust and obligations with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dunbar, Robin I. M. |title=How many friends does one person need?: Dunbar's number and other evolutionary quirks |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-571-25342-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether new technologies such as the [[Internet]] and [[mobile phone]]s exacerbate social isolation (of any origin) is a debated topic among [[sociologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/1369118X.2010.513417 |title=Core Networks, Social Isolation and New Media: How Internet and mobile phone use is related to network size and diversity |year=2011 |last1=Hampton |first1=Keith |last2=Sessions |first2=Lauren |last3=Her |first3=Eun Ja |journal=Information, Communication and Society |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=130–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of online [[social networking]] communities, there are increasing options to become involved with social activities that do not require real-world physical interaction.

A '''philosophical interpretation''' is the assignment of meanings to various concepts, symbols, or [[wikt:object|objects]] under consideration. Two broad types of interpretation can be distinguished: interpretations of physical objects, and interpretations of concepts ([[Conceptual model]]).

== Conceptual interpretations ==

=== Aesthetic interpretation ===
{{Main|Aesthetic interpretation}}

Interpretation is related to perceiving the things. An [[aesthetic]] interpretation is an explanation of the [[meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] of some work of art. An aesthetic interpretation expresses an understanding of a work of art, a poem, performance, or piece of literature. There may be different interpretations to same work by art by different people owing to their different perceptions or aims. All such interpretations are termed as 'aesthetic interpretations'. Some people, instead of interpreting work of art, believe in interpreting artist himself. It pretty much means "how or what do I believe about (subject)"&lt;ref&gt;http://classof1.com/homework_answers/philosophy/aesthetics_interpretation/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial interpretation ===
{{Main|Judicial interpretation|Textualism|Strict constructionism|5=Originalism|6=Prudentialism }}

A judicial interpretation is a conceptual interpretation that explains how the judiciary should interpret the law, particularly [[constitution]]al documents and [[legislation]] (see [[statutory interpretation]]).

=== Logical interpretation ===
{{Main|Logical interpretation}}

In [[logic]], an interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the [[Symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a language. The [[formal languages]] used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called ''formal semantics''.

=== Religious interpretation ===
{{Main|Religious interpretation}}

Religious interpretation and similarly religious self-interpretation define a section of religion-related studies (theology, comparative religion, reason) where attention is given to aspects of perception—where religious symbolism and the self-image of all those who hold religious views have important bearing on how others perceive their particular belief system and its adherents.

== Scientific interpretation ==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}

=== Descriptive interpretation ===
{{Main|Descriptive interpretation}}

An interpretation is a ''descriptive interpretation'' (also called a ''factual interpretation'') if at least one of the undefined symbols of its formal system becomes, in the interpretation, the name of a physical object, or observable property. A descriptive interpretation is a type of interpretation used in science and logic to talk about empirical entities.

=== Scientific model ===
{{Main|Scientific modeling}}

When scientists attempt to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences, they use an interpretation to [[Scientific model|model reality]], in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic. The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system that will serve as a conceptual model of reality. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.

'''Kleshas''' ({{lang-sa|क्लेश|kleśa}}; {{lang-pi|किलेस}} ''kilesa''; {{lang-bo|ཉོན་མོངས།}} ''nyon mongs''), in [[Buddhism]], are mental states that cloud the mind and manifest in unwholesome actions. ''Kleshas'' include states of mind such as anxiety, fear, anger, jealousy, desire, depression, etc. Contemporary translators use a variety of English words to translate the term ''kleshas'', such as: afflictions, defilements, destructive emotions, disturbing emotions, negative emotions, mind poisons, etc.

In the contemporary Mahayana and Theravada Buddhist traditions, the three kleshas of ignorance, attachment, and aversion are identified as the root or source of all other kleshas. These are referred to as the ''[[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]]'' in the Mahayana tradition, or as the three ''unwholesome roots'' in the Theravada tradition.

While the early Buddhist texts of the Pali canon do not specifically enumerate the three root kleshas, over time the ''three poisons'' (and the kleshas generally) came to be seen as the very roots of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsaric existence]].

== Pali literature ==
{{PaliCanon}}
In the [[Pali Canon]]'s discourses (''[[Sūtra|sutta]]''), ''kilesa'' is often associated with the various passions that defile bodily and mental states.  In the Pali Canon's [[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Abhidhamma]] and post-canonical [[Pali literature]], ten defilements are identified, the first three of which – greed, hate, delusion – are considered to be the "roots" of suffering.

=== Sutta Pitaka: Mental hindrances ===
In the Pali Canon's [[Sutta Pitaka]], ''kilesa'' and its correlate ''upakkilesa''&lt;ref&gt;Beyond the etymological relationship between and semantic closeness of ''kilesa'' and ''upakkilesa'' (e.g., see Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921–25, p. 139, entry for ''upakkilesa'' at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:3657.pali), the below-referenced [[Samyutta Nikaya]] collection entitled "''&lt;u&gt;Kilesa&lt;/u&gt;-sa{{IAST|ṃ}}yutta''" (SN 27) does not use ''kilesa'' in its actual suttas but, in fact, ''&lt;u&gt;upakkilesa&lt;/u&gt;''.  Bodhi (2000), pp. 1012–14, 1100 ''n''. 273, specifically makes note of the lexical differences between these two Pali words and chooses to translate ''kilesa'' as "defilement" and ''upakkilesa'' as "corruption."  Similar, in Bodhi (2000), p. 1642, SN 47.12, ''upakkilesa'' is translated as "corruption" whereas, as indicated below, in Bodhi (2005), p. 416, this same Pali word in the same sutta is translated as "defilement."  Consistent with Bodhi (2005), as seen below, Thanissaro (1994) also translates ''upakkilesa'' as "defilement."&lt;p&gt;The related correlate ''sankilesa'' (or ''sa{{IAST|ṅ}}kilesa'') is also translated as "defilement" by Bodhi (e.g., 2000, pp. 903-4; 2005, pp. 55-6), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.026.than.html Thanissaro (2004)] and Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-5, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2756.pali entry for "Sankilesa"]).  In [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 22.60 (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 903-4), ''sankilesa'' is contextualized by: "By being enamoured with [form], [beings] are captivated by it, and by being captivated by it they are defiled."  In this sutta, ''sankilesa'' is juxtaposed with purification (''visuddhi'') which is contextualized by:  "Experiencing revulsion [in the impermanence of form's pleasure], [beings] become dispassionate, and through dispassion they are purified."&lt;/ref&gt; are affective obstacles to the pursuit of direct knowledge (''[[abhijñā]]'') and wisdom (''[[pañña]]'').

For instance, the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] includes a collection of ten discourses ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 27, ''Kilesa-sa{{IAST|ṃ}}yutta'') that state that any association of "desire-passion" (''chanda-rāgo'') with the body or mind&lt;ref&gt;In particular, this ''sa{{IAST|ṃ}}yutta'' contextualizes ''kilesa'' vis-à-vis the six internal and external "sense bases" (''[[ayatana]]'') and their mental concomitants (the six classes of [[vijnana|consciousness]], [[phassa|contact]], [[vedana|feeling]] and [[tanha|craving]], see the section on the [[Ayatana#Sense-base contexts|"six sextets"]]), the six primary "elements" (''dhātu'', cf. ''[[mahābhūta]]''), and the five "aggregates" (''[[khandha]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; is a "defilement of mind" (''cittasse'so upakkileso''):
:"Monks, any desire-passion with regard to the eye is a defilement of the mind. Any desire-passion with regard to the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... the intellect is a defilement of the mind. When, with regard to [[ayatana|these six bases]], the defilements of awareness are abandoned, then the mind is inclined to [[nekkhamma|renunciation]]. The mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the [[abhijna|direct knowing]] of those [[dhamma|qualities]] worth realizing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 27.1 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn27/sn27.001-010.than.html (trans. Thanissaro, 1994).]  Note that the phrase that Thanissaro translates as "defilement of &lt;u&gt;awareness&lt;/u&gt;" here is ''&lt;u&gt;ceta&lt;/u&gt;so upakkileso''; Bodhi (2000), p. 1012, simply translates this as "&lt;u&gt;mental&lt;/u&gt; corruption" (underlining added for clarity).&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the [[five hindrances]] – sensual desire (''kāmacchanda''), anger (''byāpāda''), sloth-torpor (''thīna-middha''), restlessness-worry (''uddhacca-kukkucca''), and doubt (''vicikicchā'') – are frequently associated with ''kilesa'' in the following (or a similar) manner:

{| style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:20pt"

| [A]ll those Blessed Ones had first abandoned the five hindrances,&lt;br /&gt;defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom ...&lt;ref&gt;Translation from Bodhi (2005), p. 416.

Additionally, in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]'s [[Niddesa]], ''kilesa'' is identified as a component of or synonymous with craving (''[[taṇhā|{{IAST|taṇhā}}]]'') and lust (''rāga'').&lt;ref&gt;See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-5), pp. 216-7, entry for "Kilesa," retrieved 2008-02-09 from "University of Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:579.pali.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abhidhamma: Ten defilements and unwholesome roots ===
While the Sutta Pitaka does not offer a list of ''kilesa'', the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]'s [[Dhammasangani]] (Dhs. 1229''ff''.) and [[Vibhanga]] (Vbh. XII) as well as in the post-canonical [[Visuddhimagga]] (Vsm. XXII 49, 65) enumerate ten defilements (''dasa kilesa-vatthūni'') as follows:
# greed (''[[Raga (Buddhism)|lobha]]'')
# hate (''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dosa]]'')
# delusion (''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'')
# conceit (''[[māna]]'')
# wrong views (''[[View (Buddhism)|micchāditthi]]'')
# doubt (''[[vicikicchā]]'')
# torpor (''[[thīna|thīna{{IAST|ṃ}}]]'')
# restlessness (''[[uddhacca|uddhacca{{IAST|ṃ}}]]'')
# shamelessness (''[[ahirika|ahirika{{IAST|ṃ}}]]'')
# recklessness (''[[anottappa|anottappa{{IAST|ṃ}}]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-5), p. 217; and, Nyanatiloka (1988), entry for "kilesa," retrieved 2008-02-09 from "BuddhaSasana" at http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_k.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vibhanga also includes an eightfold list (''a{{IAST|ṭṭ}}ha kilesa-vatthūni'') composed of the first eight of the above ten.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Pali literature, the first three ''kilesa'' in the above tenfold Abhidhamma list (''lobha dosa moha'') are known as the "unwholesome roots" (''akusala-mūla'' or the root of [[Buddhist views on sin|akusala]]); and, their opposites (''alobha adosa amoha'') are the three "wholesome roots" (''kusala-mūla'' or the root of [[Merit (Buddhism)#Puñña, kusala and Nirvana|kusala]]).&lt;ref&gt;In addition to frequent reference in the Abhidhamma and post-canonical Pali literature, references to the unwholesome roots (''akusala-mūla'') are sprinkled throughout the [[Sutta Pitaka]].  For instance, in the [[Digha Nikaya]], it can be found in DN 33 (D iii.215) and DN 34 (D iii.275); in the [[Majjhima Nikaya]], it is the first of several topics discussed by Ven. [[Sariputta]] in the well-known ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta|Sammādi{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hi Sutta]]'' ("Right View Discourse," MN 9); and, in the [[Itivuttaka]], a brief discourse on three unwholesome roots starts off the "Section of the Threes" (Iti. 50).  However, in ''none'' of these Sutta Pitaka texts are the three unwholesome roots referred to as ''kilesa''.  Such an association appears to begin in the Abhidhamma texts.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of such a wholesome or unwholesome root during a mental, verbal or bodily action conditions future states of consciousness and associated mental factors (see [[Karma (Buddhism)|Karma]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nyanatiloka (1988), entry for "mūla," retrieved 2008-02-09 from "BuddhaSasana" at http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_m.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

In the 5th-century CE [[atthakatha|commentarial]] [[Visuddhimagga]], in its discussion of "Dependent Origination" (Pali: ''[[paticca-samuppada]]'') ([[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]]. XVII), it presents different expository methods for understanding this teaching's twelve factors (''[[Twelve Nidanas|nidana]]'').  One method (Vsm. XVII, 298) divides the twelve factors into three "rounds" (''va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a''):
* the "round of defilements" (''kilesa-va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a'')
* the "round of [[Karma in Buddhism|kamma]]" (''kamma-va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a'')
* the "round of results" (''[[vipaka|vipāka]]-va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a'').&lt;ref name="Vsm_xvii_298" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the [[Paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|paracanonical]] [[Nettipakarana|Nettipakara{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]'s "round of suffering, round of action, round of defilements" (''dukkhava{{IAST|ṭṭ}}o kammava{{IAST|ṭṭ}}o kilesava{{IAST|ṭṭ}}o'') (Nett. i.95).{{cite web |url=http://www.bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&amp;record=15231 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719223228/http://www.bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&amp;record=15231 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this framework (see Figure to the right, starting from the bottom of the Figure), ''kilesa'' ([[Avidya (Buddhism)|"ignorance"]]) conditions ''kamma'' ([[sankhara|"formations"]]) which conditions [[vipaka|results]] ([[vinnana|"consciousness"]] through [[vedana|"feelings"]]) which in turn condition ''kilesa'' ([[tanha|"craving"]] and [[upadana|"clinging"]]) which condition ''kamma'' ([[bhava|"becoming"]]) and so on.&lt;ref name="Vsm_xvii_297"&gt;Strictly speaking, in this framework the [[Visuddhimagga]] (Vsm. XVII, 298) does not ''explicitly'' identify "birth" (''[[Jāti (Buddhism)|jāti]]'') and "aging-death" (''[[Jarāmaraṇa|jarāmara{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]'') with results (''[[vipāka]]'').  Nonetheless, in the preceding paragraph (Vsm. XVII, 297), [[Buddhaghosa]] writes: "''And in the future fivefold fruit'': the five beginning with consciousness.  These are expressed by the term 'birth'.  But 'ageing-and-death' is the ageing and the death of these [five] themselves" (Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli, 1991, p. 599, v. 297; square-brackets in original).  Thus, "birth" and "ageing and death" become correlates or expressions of the five-fold "results" sequence.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhaghosa]] (Vsm. XVII, 298) concludes:
:So this [[Wheel of Becoming]], having a triple round with these three rounds, should be understood to spin, revolving again and again, forever; for the conditions are not cut off as long as the round of defilements is not cut off.&lt;ref name="Vsm_xvii_298"&gt;Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli (1991), p. 599, v. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;
As can be seen, in this framework, the round of defilements consists of:
* ignorance (''[[avijjā]]'')
* craving (''[[taṇhā|{{IAST|taṇhā}}]]'')
* clinging (''[[upadana|ūpādānā]]'').&lt;ref name="Vsm_xvii_298" /&gt;

Elsewhere in the Visuddhimagga (Vsm. XXII, 88), in the context of the four noble persons (''ariya-puggala'', see [[Four stages of enlightenment]]), the text refers to a precursor to the attainment of [[nibbana]] as being the complete eradication of "the defilements that are the root of the round" (''va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a-mūla-kilesā'').&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1991), p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sanskrit Sravaka &amp; Mahayana literature ==

=== Three poisons ===
{{Main|Three poisons (Buddhism)}}

The three kleshas of ignorance, attachment and aversion are referred to as the '''''three poisons''''' (Skt. ''triviṣa'')  in the Mahayana tradition and as the '''''three unwholesome roots''''' (Pāli, ''akusala-mūla''; Skt. ''akuśala-mūla'' )  in the Therevada tradition. These three poisons (or unwholesome roots) are considered to be the root of all the other kleshas.

=== Five poisons ===
In the Mahayana tradition, the five main kleshas are referred to as the '''''five poisons''''' (Sanskrit: ''pañca kleśaviṣa''; Tibetan-Wylie: ''dug lnga'').

The five poisons consist of the ''three poisons'' with two additional poisons: pride and jealousy. The five poisons are:&lt;ref name="pr1"&gt;Padmakara (1998), p. 336, 414. (from the glossary)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longchen Yeshe Dorje (Kangyur Rinpoche) (2010). p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Six root kleshas of the Abhidharma ===
The ''[[Abhidharma-kośa]]'' identifies six root kleshas (''mūlakleśa''):
* Attachment ([[Raga (Buddhism)|''raga'']])
* Anger (''[[pratigha]]'')
* Ignorance (''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|avidya]]'')
* Pride/Conceit (''[[māna]]'')
* Doubt (''[[vicikitsa]]'')
* Wrong view/False view/Opinionatedness ([[View (Buddhism)|''dṛiṣṭi'']])&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school of Buddhism, Muller (2004: p.&amp;nbsp;207) states that the Six Klesha arise due to the "...reification of an 'imagined self' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|satkāya-dṛṣṭi}}'')".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acmuller.net/articles/reinterpretations_of_the_hindrances.html Muller (2004).]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mahaparinirvana Sutra ===
The [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] lists approximately 50 kleshas, including those of attachment, aversion, stupidity, jealousy, pride, heedlessness, haughtiness, ill-will, quarrelsomeness, wrong livelihood, deceit, consorting with immoral friends, attachment to pleasure, to sleep, to eating, and to yawning; delighting in excessive talking and uttering lies, as well as thoughts of harm.

=== Two obscurations ===
Mahayana literature often features an enumeration of "two obscurations" (Wylie: ''sgrib gnyis''), the "obscuration of conflicting emotions" (Sanskrit: ''kleśa-avaraṇa'', Wylie: ''nyon-mongs-pa'i sgrib-ma'') and the "obscuration concerning the knowable" (Sanskrit: ''jñeya-avaraṇa'', Wylie: ''shes-bya'i sgrib-ma'').&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe ([[Dudjom Rinpoche]], author), translated and edited: [[Gyurme Dorje]] and [[Matthew Kapstein]] (1991).

== Contemporary glosses ==
Contemporary translators have used many different English words to translate the term ''kleshas'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Epstein|Epstein, Mark]] (2009) http://www.quietspaces.com/kleshas.html&lt;/ref&gt; such as: afflictions, passions, destructive emotions, disturbing emotions, etc.

| Afflictive emotions
| In general, any defilement or emotion which obscures the mind. They are often summarized as three: ignorance, attachment and aversion. All other negative predispositions are produced on the basis of these three.

| Mental afflictions
| In Tibetan a mental affliction is defined as a mental process that has the function of disrupting the equilibrium of the mind. They all have that in common, whether or not there is a strong emotional component to it.

|-
| Destructive emotions
| Fundamentally, a destructive emotion—which is also referred to as an ‘obscuring’ or ‘afflictive’ mental factor—is something that prevents the mind from ascertaining reality as it is. With a destructive emotion, there will always be a gap between the way things appear and the ways things are.

|-
| Defilements
| These are unskilful factors such as greed, hate, delusion, opinionatedness and lack of moral concern. Whereas the term ‘[[Five hindrances|hindrance]]’ refers to five sticking points, ‘defilement’ is often used without any definite list, but to refer to any function of the mind which is led by unskilful factors.

|-
| Kleshas
| The basic idea is that certain powerful reactions have the capacity to take hold of us and drive our behavior. We believe in these reactions more than we believe in anything else, and they become the means by which we both hide from ourselves and attempt to cope with a world of ceaseless change and unpredictability. The three poisons of greed, hatred, and ignorance are the classic Buddhist examples, but others include conceit, skeptical doubt, and so-called "speculative" views ...

|-
| Kleshas
| The emotional obscurations (in contrast to intellectual obscurations), usually translated as "poisons" or "defilements." The three main klesas are ignorance, hatred, and desire. The five klesas include these three along with pride and envy.

|}

== Overcoming the kleshas ==
All Buddhist schools teach that through Tranquility ([[Samatha]]) meditation the kilesas are pacified, though not eradicated, and through Insight ([[Vipassana]]) the true nature of the kilesas and the mind itself is understood.  When the empty nature of the Self and the Mind is fully understood, there is no longer a root for the disturbing emotions to be attached to, and the disturbing emotions lose their power to distract the mind.

{{see also|Character structure|good moral character}}
'''Moral character''' or '''character''' is an evaluation of an individual's stable [[Morality|moral]] qualities. The concept of ''character'' can imply a variety of attributes including the existence or lack of [[virtue]]s such as [[empathy]], [[courage]], [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]], [[honesty]], and [[loyalty]], or of good behaviors or [[habit]]s. Moral character primarily refers to the assemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another—although on a cultural level, the set of moral behaviors to which a social group adheres can be said to unite and define it culturally as distinct from others. Psychologist Lawrence Pervin defines moral character as "a disposition to express behavior in consistent patterns of functions across a range of situations".&lt;ref&gt;Pervin 1994, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the philosopher George refers to moral character as the “sum of one’s moral habits and dispositions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=George |first1=MI |title=What moral character is and is not. |journal=The Linacre quarterly |date=August 2017 |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=261-274 |doi=10.1080/00243639.2017.1338442 |pmid=28912619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The word "character" is derived from the Ancient Greek word "charaktêr", referring to a mark impressed upon a coin. Later it came to mean a point by which one thing was told apart from others.&lt;ref name="Timpe 2007"&gt;Timpe 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There are two approaches when dealing with moral character: [[Normative ethics]] involve moral standards that exhibit right and wrong conduct. It is a test of proper behavior and determining what is right and wrong. [[Applied ethics]] involve specific and [[controversial]] issues along with a moral choice, and tend to involve situations where people are either for or against the issue.&lt;ref name="Timpe 2007"/&gt;

In 1982  [[V. Campbell]] and [[R. Bond]] proposed the following as major sources in influencing character and moral development: [[heredity]], early childhood experience, [[Role model|modeling]] by important adults and older youth, [[peer influence]], the general [[Environment (biophysical)|physical]] and [[social environment]], the [[communications media]], the teachings of [[schools]] and other institutions, and specific situations and roles that elicit corresponding behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, V., &amp; Bond, R. (1982). "Evaluation of a Character Education Curriculum". In D. McClelland (ed.), ''Education For Values''. (New York: Irvington Publishers). As described in Huitt, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of [[business ethics]] examines moral controversies relating to the social responsibilities of [[capitalist]] business practices, the moral status of [[corporate entities]], [[deceptive advertising]], [[insider trading]], [[employee rights]], [[job discrimination]], [[affirmative action]] and [[drug testing]].

In the military field, character is considered particularly relevant in the [[leadership]] development area. Military leaders should not only "know" theoretically the moral values but they must embody these values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milsci.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.mili.d7/files/sitefiles/fm6_22.pdf|title=FM-62: Leader Development|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Department of the Army|accessdate=18 December 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Character analysis ad.jpg|thumb|1915 magazine ad]]
The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' provides a historical account of some important developments in philosophical approaches to moral character. A lot of attention is given to [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Karl Marx]]'s views, since they all follow the idea of moral character after the [[Greeks]]. Marx accepts Aristotle's insight that virtue and good character are based on a sense of [[self-esteem]] and [[self-confidence]].

[[Plato]] believed that the [[soul]] is divided into three parts of desire: [[Rationality|Rational]], [[Appetitive]], or [[Spirited]].&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-character/ |title=Moral Character (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to have moral character, we must understand what contributes to our overall good and have our spirited and appetitive desires educated properly, so that they can agree with the guidance provided by the rational part of the soul.

[[Aristotle]] tells us that there are good people in the world.  These are those who exhibit [[excellence]]s – excellences of [[thought]] and excellences of character. His phrase for excellences of character – ''êthikai aretai'' – we usually translate as moral virtue or moral excellence. When we speak of a moral [[virtue]] or an excellence of character, the emphasis is on the combination of qualities that make an individual the sort of ethically admirable person that he is.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;  Aristotle defines virtuous character at the beginning of Book II in ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'': “Excellence of character, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a [[mean]] relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of [[practical wisdom]] would determine it. Now it is a mean between two [[vices]], that which depends on [[wikt:excess|excess]] and that which depends on [[wikt:Special:Search/defect|defect]]”. In Aristotle's view, good character is based on two naturally occurring psychological responses that most people experience without difficulty: our tendency to take [[pleasure]] from [[self-realizing]] activity and our tendency to form friendly feelings toward others under specific circumstances. Based on his view, virtually everyone is capable of becoming better and they are the ones [[Individual responsibility|responsible]] for actions that express (or could express) their character.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

[[Abraham Lincoln]] once said, "Character is like a [[tree]] and [[reputation]] like its [[shadow]]. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotationspage.com/subjects/character/ |title=Character Quotes |publisher=The Quotations Page |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
[[File:Dublin Christ Church Cathedral Passage to Synod Hall Window Fruit of the Spirit 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|Stained glass window at [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin]], depicting the ''Fruit of the Holy Spirit'' along with role models representing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dia.ie/works/view/57668/building/CO.+DUBLIN%2C+DUBLIN%2C+CHRISTCHURCH+PLACE%2C+CHRIST+CHURCH+CATHEDRAL+%28CI%29 |title=CO. DUBLIN, DUBLIN, CHRISTCHURCH PLACE, CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL (CI) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720–1940 |publisher=Irish Architectural Archive |accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Christian character is also defined as exhibiting the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]": love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.{{Bibleref2c|Galatians|5:22-23|NIV}} Doctrines of [[Grace (Christianity)#Augustine versus Pelagius|grace]] and [[total depravity]] assert that – due to [[original sin]] – mankind, entirely or in part, was incapable of truly being good without God's intervention; otherwise at best, one could only mimic good behavior for selfish reasons.

==Scientific experiments==
The [[Milgram experiment]] was a study done in the early 1960s that helped measure a person's moral character. Subjects from different [[socio-economic group]]s were tested on their willingness to press a [[buzzer]] that caused a participant – posing as a [[Human subject research|subject]] – in another room to express great [[pain]] and distress for giving a wrong answer to a test question. When the subjects raised questions about what they are being asked to do, the [[experiment]]er applied mild pressure in the form of appealing to the need to complete the experiment. The Milgram experiment caused a huge amount of criticism among individuals.  In post-experiment interviews with subjects Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the wrongness of what they were doing. Although the subjects may have had moral values, many were criticized on whether they were a truly moral character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1344 |title=Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame |publisher=Ndpr.nd.edu |date=2003-08-02 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one experiment that was done in the United States in 1985, the moral character of a person was based on whether or not a person had found a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] in a [[public phone booth]]. The findings were that 87% of subjects who found a dime in a phone booth mailed a sealed and addressed envelope that was left at the booth in an apparent mistake by someone else, while only 4% of those who did not find a dime helped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Isen |last2= Levin|first1=Paula F. |first2= Alice M.|title=Further Studies on the Effect of Feeling Good on Helping|jstor=2786238|publisher=American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{Who|date=April 2011}} found it very troubling that people would be influenced by such morally [[trivia]]l factors in their choice whether to provide low-cost [[Aid|assistance]] to others. [[John M. Doris]] raises the issue of [[ecological validity]] – do experimental findings reflect [[phenomena]] found in natural [[Archaeological context|context]]s. He recognizes that these results are [[counterintuitive]] to the way most of us think about morally relevant behavior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1344 |title=Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame |publisher=Ndpr.nd.edu |date=2003-08-02 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment that was done that asked [[college student]]s at [[Cornell]] to predict how they would behave when faced with one of several [[moral dilemma]]s, and to make the same [[prediction]]s for their [[Peer group|peer]]s. Again and again, people predicted that they would be more [[Generosity|generous]] and [[Kindness|kind]] than others. Yet when put into the moral dilemma, the subjects did not behave as generously or as kindly as they had predicted. In [[psychological terms]], the experimental subjects were successfully anticipating the base rate of moral behavior and accurately predicting how often others, in general, would be [[Self sacrifice|self-sacrificing]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of [[philosophers]] and [[social scientists]] began to question the very [[presuppositions]] that theories of moral character and moral character traits are based on. Due to the importance of moral character to issues in [[philosophy]], it is unlikely that the debates over the nature of moral character will disappear anytime soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/moral-ch.htm#H3 |title=Moral Character |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Situationism (psychology)|Situationism]] can be understood as composed of three central claims:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/moral-ch.htm |title=Moral Character |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Non-robustness Claim: moral character traits are not consistent across a wide spectrum of trait-relevant situations. Whatever moral character traits an individual has are situation specific.
*Consistency Claim: while a person’s moral character traits are relatively stable over time, this should be understood as consistency of situation specific traits, rather than robust traits.
*Fragmentation Claim: a person’s moral character traits do not have the [[evaluative]] [[integrity]] suggested by the Integrity Claim. There may be considerable disunity in a person’s moral character among his or her situation-specific character traits.

According to Situationists, the [[empirical]] evidence favors their view of moral character over the Traditional View. [[Hugh Hartshorne]] and [[M. A. May]]’s study of the trait of [[honesty]] among school [[children]] found no cross-situational [[correlation]]. A child may be consistently honest with his [[friendship|friends]], but not with his [[parents]] or [[teachers]]. From this and other studies, Hartshorne and May concluded that character traits are not [[wikt:robust|robust]] but rather “specific functions of life situations”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A second challenge to the traditional view can be found in the idea of moral [[luck]]. This idea is that moral luck occurs when the moral judgment of an [[Moral agency|agent]] depends on factors beyond the agent’s control. Fiery Cushman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2219685|title=A Solution to the Problem of Moral Luck|first=Brynmor|last=Browne|date=1 January 1992|publisher=|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=42|issue=168|pages=345–56|doi=10.2307/2219685}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifies that this is judgement of an outcome comprising both the agent's character and an unanticipated circumstance, rather than an agent's intent. There are number of ways that moral luck can motivate criticisms of moral character. It is similar to “the kind of problems and situations one faces”&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nagel|Nagel, Thomas]] (1993). "Moral Luck," in ''Moral Luck'', ed. Daniel Statman ([[State University of New York Press]]): 57–61&lt;/ref&gt;  If all of an agent’s moral character traits are situation-specific rather than robust, what traits an agent manifests will depend on the situation that she finds herself in. But what situations an agent finds herself in is often beyond her control and thus a matter of situational luck. Whether moral character traits are robust or situation-specific, some have suggested that what character traits one has is itself a matter of luck. If our having certain traits is itself a matter of luck, this would seem to undermine one’s moral responsibility for one’s moral character, and thus the concept of moral character altogether. As [[Owen Flanagan]] and Amélie Oksenberg Rorty write:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
{{quote|It [the morality and meaning of an individual’s life] will depend on luck in an individual’s upbringing, the values she is taught, the [[self-control]]ling and self-constructing capacities her [[social environment]] enables and encourages her to develop, the moral challenges she faces or avoids. If all her character, not just [[temperamental traits]] and [[disposition]]s but also the reflexive capacities for self-control and self-construction, are matters of luck, then the very ideas of character and agency are in danger of [[evaporation]].}}

A moral character trait is a character trait for which the agent is morally responsible. If moral responsibility is impossible, however, then agents cannot be held responsible for their character traits or for the behaviors that they do as a result of those character traits.

A similar argument has also recently been advocated by [[Bruce Waller]]. According to Waller, no one is "morally responsible for her character or deliberative powers, or for the results that flow from them.… Given the fact that she was shaped to have such characteristics by [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] (or [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]]) forces far beyond her control, she deserves no [[blame]] [nor [[praise]]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1922">[[Kurt Lewin]] founded the '''National Training Laboratories Institute for Applied Behavioral Science''', known as  the '''NTL Institute''', an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit]] [[behavioral psychology]] center, in 1947. NTL became a major influence&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Art. "The Age of Heretics: Heroes, Outlaws and the Forerunners of Corporate Change." New York: Doubleday, 1996, pp. 27-60; photos, pp. 190-91.&lt;/ref&gt; in modern corporate [[training]] programs, and in particular developed the [[T-groups]] methodology that remains in place today. Lewin died early on in the project, which was continued by co-founders Ron Lippitt, Lee Bradford, and Ken Benne,&lt;ref&gt;[http://halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/2004/Benne.html Kenneth Benne bio]&lt;/ref&gt; among others. The NTL Institute produced or influenced other notable and influential contributors to the human relations movement in post-World War II management though, notably [[Douglas McGregor]] (who, like Lewin, also died young), [[Chris Argyris]] and [[Warren Bennis]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

NTL began publishing ''[[The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science]]'' in 1965 and it remains a renowned publication contributing a body of knowledge to the field that increases understanding of change processes and outcomes. 

The NTL Institute continues to work in the field of [[organization development]].  The original center in [[Bethel, Maine|Bethel]], [[Maine]] continues to operate, but the organization has moved its headquarters to [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Maryland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="867">An '''open class system''' is the stratification that facilitates [[social mobility]], with individual achievement and personal merit determining [[social rank]].  The hierarchical [[social status]] of a person is achieved through their effort.  Any status that is based on [[family background]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[religion]], which is also known as [[ascribed status]], becomes less important.  There is no distinct line between the classes and there would be more positions within that status.  Core industrial nations seem to have more of an ideal open class system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8772">In [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], a '''potential gradient''' is the local [[derivative|rate of change]] of the [[potential]] with respect to displacement, i.e. spatial derivative, or gradient. This quantity frequently occurs in equations of physical processes because it leads to some form of [[flux]].

==Definition==

===One dimension===

The simplest definition for a potential gradient ''F'' in one dimension is the following:&lt;ref&gt;Essential Principles of Physics, P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson, 2nd Edition, 1978, John Murray, {{ISBN|0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{\phi_2-\phi_1}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ϕ''(''x'')}} is some type of [[scalar potential]] and {{math|''x''}} is [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] (not [[distance]]) in the {{math|''x''}} direction, the subscripts label two different positions {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and potentials at those points, {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''ϕ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''ϕ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''ϕ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. In the limit of [[infinitesimal]] displacements, the ratio of differences becomes a ratio of [[differential of a function|differentials]]:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{{\rm d} \phi}{{\rm d} x}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The direction of the electric potential gradient is from x1 to x2.

===Three dimensions===

In [[three dimensional space|three dimensions]], [[Cartesian coordinates]] make it clear that the resultant potential gradient is the sum of the potential gradients in each direction:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{e}_x\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + \mathbf{e}_y\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} + \mathbf{e}_z\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 

where {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[unit vector]]s in the {{math|''x, y, z''}} directions. This can be compactly written in terms of the [[gradient]] [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] {{math|∇}},

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

although this final form holds in any [[curvilinear coordinate system]], not just Cartesian.

This expression represents a significant feature of any [[conservative vector field]] {{math|'''F'''}}, namely {{math|'''F'''}} has a corresponding potential {{math|''ϕ''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Vector Analysis (2nd Edition), M.R. Spiegel, S. Lipcshutz, D. Spellman, Schaum’s Outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Stokes' theorem]], this is equivalently stated as

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla\times\mathbf{F} = \boldsymbol{0} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

meaning the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]], denoted ∇×, of the vector field vanishes.

==Physics==

===Newtonian gravitation===

In the case of the [[gravitational field#classical mechanics|gravitational field]] {{math|'''g'''}}, which can be shown to be conservative,&lt;ref&gt;Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, A.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is equal to the gradient in [[gravitational potential]] {{math|Φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = - \nabla \Phi. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are opposite signs between gravitational field and potential, because the potential gradient and field are opposite in direction: as the potential increases, the gravitational field strength decreases and vice versa.

===Electromagnetism===
{{main|Maxwell's equations|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field}}
In [[electrostatics]], the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} is independent of time {{math|''t''}}, so there is no induction of a time-dependent [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}} by [[Faraday's law of induction]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \boldsymbol{0} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which implies {{math|'''E'''}} is the gradient of the electric potential {{math|''V''}}, identical to the classical gravitational field:&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;- \mathbf{E} = \nabla V. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In [[electrodynamics]], the {{math|'''E'''}} field is time dependent and induces a time-dependent {{math|'''B'''}} field also (again by Faraday's law), so the curl of {{math|'''E'''}} is not zero like before, which implies the electric field is no longer the gradient of electric potential. A time-dependent term must be added:&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, {{ISBN|81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;- \mathbf{E} = \nabla V + \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''A'''}} is the electromagnetic [[vector potential]]. This last potential expression in fact reduces Faraday's law to an identity.

===Fluid mechanics===

In [[fluid mechanics]], the [[velocity field]] {{math|'''v'''}} describes the fluid motion. An [[irrotational flow]] means the velocity field is conservative, or equivalently the [[vorticity]] [[pseudovector]] field {{math|'''ω'''}} is zero: 

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla\times\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

This allows the [[velocity potential]] to be defined simply as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \nabla\phi&lt;/math&gt;

==Chemistry==

{{main|Electrode potentials}}

In an [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] [[half-cell]], at the interface between the [[electrolyte]] (an [[ion]]ic [[solution]]) and the [[metal]] [[electrode]], the standard [[electric potential difference]] is:&lt;ref&gt;Physical chemistry, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0-19-855148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi_{(M,M^{+z})} = \Delta \phi_{(M,M^{+z})}^{\ominus} + \frac{RT}{zeN_\text{A}}\ln a_{M^{+z}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' = [[gas constant]], ''T'' = [[temperature]] of solution, ''z'' = [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]] of the metal, ''e'' = [[elementary charge]], ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Avogadro constant]], and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;+z&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]] of the ions in solution. Quantities with superscript ⊖ denote the measurement is taken under [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]. The potential gradient is relatively abrupt, since there is an almost definite boundary between the metal and solution, hence the interface term.&lt;!---What is this sentence trying to say!??---&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2013}}

==Biology==

In [[biology]], a potential gradient is the net difference in [[electric charge]] across a [[cell membrane]].

==Non-uniqueness of potentials==

Since gradients in potentials correspond to [[Field (physics)|physical field]]s, it makes no difference if a constant is added on (it is erased by the gradient operator {{math|&amp;nabla;}} which includes [[partial differentiation]]). This means there is no way to tell what the "absolute value" of the potential "is" – the zero value of potential is completely arbitrary and can be chosen anywhere by convenience (even "at infinity"). This idea also applies to vector potentials, and is exploited in [[classical field theory]] and also [[gauge field theory]].

Absolute values of potentials are not physically observable, only gradients and path-dependent potential differences are. However, the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]] is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect which illustrates that non-zero [[electromagnetic potential]]s along a closed loop (even when the {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} fields are zero everywhere in the region) lead to changes in the phase of the [[wave function]] of an electrically [[charged particle]] in the region, so the potentials appear to have measurable significance.

==Potential theory==

[[Field equation]]s, such as Gauss's laws [[Gauss's law|for electricity]], [[Gauss's law for magnetism|for magnetism]], and [[Gauss's law for gravity|for gravity]], can be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}= X \rho&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ρ''}} is the electric [[charge density]], [[magnetic monopole|monopole]] density (should they exist), or [[mass density]] and {{math|''X''}} is a constant (in terms of [[physical constant]]s [[Gravitational constant|{{math|''G''}}]], [[Vacuum permittivity|{{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], [[Vacuum permeability|{{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}]] and other numerical factors).

Scalar potential gradients lead to [[Poisson's equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot (\nabla\phi)= X \rho \quad \Rightarrow \quad \nabla^2 \phi = X \rho&lt;/math&gt;

A general [[potential theory|theory of potentials]] has been developed to solve this equation for the potential. The gradient of that solution gives the physical field, solving the field equation.

'''[[Prisoners' rights]] in [[international law]]''' are found in a number of international treaties. For the most part these treaties came into existence following the [[World Wars|two World Wars]] and the body of law continues to be added to and amended.

==History==
The events of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] had a profound effect on international law due to the widespread denial of [[civil rights]] and [[liberties]] on the basis of racial, religious, and political discrimination. The systematic use of violence, including [[murder]] and ultimately [[genocide]], the use of [[slave labor]], abuse and murder of [[prisoners of war]], [[deportations]], and [[confiscation]] of property forced changes to the [[status quo]]. Over the proceeding decades, large scale changes began to occur in all areas of international law, and prisoners’ rights were no exception. 

Now, there are international instruments 
* the [[European Convention on Human Rights]],
* the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]]

Further there are recommondations which lay down codes by which prisoners should be dealt with. Foremost amongst them are 

* the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], 
* the UN [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]],
* the [[Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment]]
* the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].
* the [[European Prison Rules]].

==Third Geneva Convention==

The [[Third Geneva Convention]] defines humanitarian protections for prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/375?OpenDocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners of war are defined as:

The [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War]] was adopted in 1929 but was significantly revised and replaced by the Third Geneva Convention in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/375?OpenDocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council]] is the final international tribunal for all issues relating to the Geneva Conventions. All signatories to the [[UN Charter]], of which there are 193, are bound by the Geneva Conventions.

==International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights==

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] came into force 23 March 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that any person deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article imposes a requirement of separation of prisoners in pre-trial detention from those already convicted of crimes, as well as a specific obligation to separate accused juvenile prisoners from adults and bring them before trial speedily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a requirement that the focus of prisons should be reform and rehabilitation, not punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These provisions apply to those in prisons, hospitals (particularly psychiatric hospitals), detention facilities, correction facilities or any other facility in which a person is deprived of their liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/3327552b9511fb98c12563ed004cbe59?Opendocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The article complements article 7 of the Covenant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which bans torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, by guaranteeing those deprived of their liberty with the same conditions as that set for free persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/3327552b9511fb98c12563ed004cbe59?Opendocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners==

The [[United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] came into force in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/treatmentprisoners.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504124246/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/treatmentprisoners.htm|archivedate=4 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standards set out by the UN are not legally binding but offer guidelines in international and municipal law with respect to any person held in any form of custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Refugee Agency|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They are generally regarded as being good principle and practice for the management of custodial facilities. The document sets out standards for those in custody which covers registration, personal hygiene, clothing and bedding, food, exercise and sport, medical services, discipline and punishment, instruments of restraint, information to and complaints by prisoners, contact with the outside world, books, religion, retentions of prisoners’ property, notification of death, illness, transfer, removal of prisoners, institutional personnel and inspection of facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Refugee Agency|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It also sets out guidelines for prisoners under sentence which further includes treatment, classification and individualisation, privileges, work, educations and recreations, and social relations and after-care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Refugee Agency|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    There are also special provisions for insane and mentally abnormal prisoners, prisoners under arrest or awaiting trial, civil prisoners and persons arrested or detained without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Refugee Agency|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment==

The [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] entered into force on 1 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Convention establishes the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punt|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Committee is permitted to visit all places of detention, defined by the convention as "any place within its jurisdiction where persons are deprived of their liberty by a public authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Once a state government is notified of the intention of the Committee to carry out a visit it is required to allow access to the territory with the right to free travel without restriction, full information of the facility in question, unlimited access to the facility and free movement within it, the right to interview any person being held within the facility, communicate freely with any person whom it believes can supply relevant information and access to any other information which the Committee feels is necessary to carry out its task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   All information gathered is confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In exceptional circumstances a state may make representations based on grounds of national defence, public safety, serious disorder in custodial facilities against a visit to a certain place or at a certain time.  After each visit a report is drawn up with any possible suggestions to the state in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities==

The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] entered into force on 30 March 2007 and has 154 state parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=150|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention’s purpose is to "promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Persons with disabilities are defined as those "who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Article 13 of the Convention relates to access to justice for persons with disability. It  provides that in order to "ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities, States Parties shall promote appropriate training for those working in the field of administration of justice, including police and prison staff." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breaches of  prisoners' rights in international law==

===United States of America===

'''Guantanamo Bay'''

The American government has been accused of many breaches of prisoners’ rights in international law. The most publicized case is the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|detention facility]] it maintains in [[Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. The American government claimed that the facility was not covered by the Geneva Conventions protecting prisoners of war as the detainees were ‘[[enemy combatants]]’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4879942.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the status accorded to detainees, international law still prohibits torture. It is now clear that the [[CIA]] allowed [[water boarding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7850789.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is not only a breach of international law but also the American Army Field Manual which prohibits cruel, humiliating or degrading treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7850789.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afghanistan'''

In Afghanistan, US soldiers are accused of abusing prisoners in a secret prison in [[Bagram Air Base]]. The prisoners held there were exposed to extreme temperatures, not given adequate food, bedding, or natural light and religious duties were interfered with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2010/10/2010101514217930443.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also claims of abuse in Shebarghan prison in northern Afghanistan for which America is jointly responsible with the Afghan government. Shebarghan prison is claimed to be overcrowded with inadequate bathing and ablution facilities, as well as lack of food and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/02/opinion/forgotten-prisoners-of-war.html#|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iraq'''

In 2003, accusations started to emerge of prisoner abuse in [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. US soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison serving there were accused of beating prisoners, forcing prisoners to strip, forcing prisoners to masturbate, threatening prisoners with dogs, smearing prisoners with faeces, making prisoners simulate sex and form naked piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3701941.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There was also accusations that prisoners were raped, sodomised and beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3701941.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ralfonso Gschwend, Dance with the Wind, Beijing Olympic Park, China.jpg|thumb|right|''Dance with the Wind'', Beijing Olympic Park, China]]

==Life and work==
Ralfonso received his undergraduate education both in Europe ([[Schule Schloss Salem]], Abitur 1979) and in the United States (USC, Los Angeles, California, BS 1983). He continued his formal education at the [[Wharton School| Wharton School of Finance]] (MBA, 1985).

While working in the real estate field in San Francisco, shortly after receiving his MBA, he began a series of kinetic sculpture drawings, which later served as the basis for his large kinetic sculptures in public places.

He is a designer of environmentally interactive, kinetic, light and [[sound sculpture]]s (sculptures that interact with the environment such as wind, water, etc.). Since 1999 he specializes in the design and execution of large to monumental [[kinetic sculpture]]s for public places from his studios in West Palm Beach, Florida, USA and Geneva, Switzerland.

Sculpture designs range in size from 2&amp;nbsp;ft to 180&amp;nbsp;ft. Sculptures have been exhibited or installed in Switzerland, Russia,&lt;ref name=russia1&gt;[http://www.rbi.ru/content/news/default.asp?shmode=14&amp;ida=125 PR release by the Russian Developer]&lt;/ref&gt;

With his passion for Kinetic Art, as president from its inception, he co-founded the Kinetic Art Organization (KAO) www.kinetic-art.org in 2001 with a German and a US fellow Kinetic Artist. Now, with more than 1,000 members in over 60 Countries around the world, KAO has become the largest kinetic art organization in the world. KAO has co-organized Kinetic Art Exhibitions, such as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070808050903/http://www.vijversburg.nl/pages/qt_overzicht.htm ART IN MOTION] in The Netherlands,&lt;ref name="netherlands"/&gt; St. Petersburg, Russia,&lt;ref name="russia1"/&gt; 
&lt;ref name="russia2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="russia3"/&gt; 
&lt;ref name="russia4"/&gt; and the MomentuM exhibition at [[Grounds for Sculpture]] in New Jersey, USA.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt;
In 2006 he established the first kinetic art website in China called [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928145327/http://www.kaochina.org/ KAO CHINA], dedicated to bringing kinetic art to China. Currently he is helping to establish the first Kinetic Art curriculum at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14289">'''Regenerative design''' is a process-oriented [[Systems theory|whole systems]] approach to [[Design thinking|design]]. The term "regenerative" describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials. Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] and equitable systems that integrate the needs of [[society]] with the integrity of nature. 

Designers use [[Systems theory|systems thinking]], applied [[Permaculture|permaculture design]] principles, and [[community development]] processes to design human and [[ecological]] systems. The development of regenerative design has been influenced by approaches found in the [[biomimicry]], [[biophilic design]], [[Ecological economics|ecological economics,]] [[Circular economy|circular economics]]. As well as [[Social movement|social movements]] such as permaculture, [[Transition town|transition]] and the [[new economy]]. Regenerative design can also refer to process of designing systems such as [[restorative justice]], [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] and [[regenerative agriculture]].
[[File:Feedback loop.png|thumb|Feedback loop used in regenerative design]]
A new generation of designers are applying ecologically inspired design to [[agriculture]], architecture, [[community planning]], [[Sustainable urban planning|cities]], [[wikt:enterprise|enterprise]]s, [[economics]] and [[Systems ecology|ecosystem regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/designing-regenerative-cultures|title=Permaculture magazine|date=2016-06-18|work=Permaculture magazine|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many designers use the resilient models observed in [[systems ecology]] in their design process and recognize that [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] are [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] largely because they operate in [[closed ecological system|closed loop systems.]] Using this model regenerative design seeks feedback at every stage of the design process. [[Feedback]] loops are an integral to regenerative systems as understood by processes used in [[Restorative practices|restorative practice]] and [[community development]].

Regenerative design is interconnected with the approaches of systems thinking and with [[New Economy Coalition#New Economy movement|New Economy movement]]. The 'new economy' considers that the current economic system needs to be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diebold|first=William|last2=Alperovitz|first2=Gar|last3=Faux|first3=Jeff|date=1984|title=Rebuilding America: A Blueprint for the New Economy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/20042109|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=63|issue=1|pages=190|doi=10.2307/20042109|issn=0015-7120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on the assumption that people and the planet should come first, and that it is human well-being, not economic growth, which should be prioritized. 

Whereas the highest aim of [[sustainable development]] is to satisfy [[fundamental human needs]] today without compromising the possibility of future generations to satisfy theirs, the goal of regenerative design is to develop restorative systems that are dynamic and emergent, and are beneficial for humans and other species. This regeneration process is participatory, iterative and individual to the community and environment it is applied to. This process intends to revitalize communities, human and natural resources, and for some, society as a whole. 

In recent years regenerative design is made possible on a larger scale using open source socio- technicle platforms and technological systems as used in [[Smart city|SMART cities]]. It is an includes community and city development processes like gathering [[feedback]], [[Participatory democracy|participatory governance]], [[sortition]] and [[participatory budgeting]].

== History ==
During the late 1970s, [[John T. Lyle]] (1934–1998), a [[landscape architecture]] professor, challenged graduate students to envision a community in which daily activities were based on the value of living within the limits of available [[Renewable resource|renewable resources]] without [[environmental degradation]]. Over the next few decades an eclectic group of students, professors and experts from around the world and crossing many disciplines developed designs for an institute to be built at [[Cal Poly Pomona]]. In 1992 the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]] was built over two years and opened in 1994. In that same year Lyle's book ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'' was published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]. In 1995 Lyle worked with [[William McDonough]] at [[Oberlin College]] for the [[Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies]] completed in 2000. In 2002 McDonough's book, the more popular and successful, ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' was published reiterating the concepts developed by Lyle.

Lyle saw the connection between concepts developed by [[Robert Rodale|Bob Rodale]] of the [[Rodale Institute]] for [[regenerative agriculture]] and the opportunity to develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world. While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture, Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems. With regenerative agriculture, the concepts are very straight forward and simple but Lyle understood that when developing for other types of systems, more complicated ideas such as [[entropy]] and [[embodied energy|emergy]] must be taken into consideration.

Swiss architect [[Walter R. Stahel]] developed approaches entirely similar to Lyle's also in the late 1970s but instead coined the term [[cradle-to-cradle design]] made popular by McDonough and [[Michael Braungart]]

Whilst in 1974 [[David Holmgren]] and [[Bill Mollison]] first started working together to develop the theory and practice of [[permaculture]]. They met when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design and began to work together. During their first three years together Mollison worked at applying their ideas, and Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become ''Permaculture One: a perennial agricultural system for human settlements'' as he completed his Environmental Design studies, and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis. He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions, before it was published in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dargavel|first=John|last2=Mulligan|first2=Martin|last3=Hill|first3=Stuart|date=July 2003|title=Ecological Pioneers: A Social History of Australian Ecological Thought and Action|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3986208|journal=Environmental History|volume=8|issue=3|pages=481|doi=10.2307/3986208|issn=1084-5453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn|King|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy. Regenerative design is integral to permaculture design.

== Regenerative versus sustainable ==
[[regeneration (ecology)|Regenerative]] and [[sustainable]] are essentially the same thing except for one key point: in a sustainable system, lost [[ecological system]]s are not returned to existence. In a regenerative system, those lost systems can ultimately begin "regenerating" back into existence. Put more simply regenerative systems work using regenerative feedback loops that allows for [[adaptability]], dynamism and [[emergence]] to create and develop resilient systems than the idea that we need to a sustain the world the way we (humans) found it, now and into the future.

There is also a linguistic problem with the word "sustainable", which in the strict sense is meant to mean "[[self-sustaining]]". Because the word root "sustain" means "last" or "endure," the general public and even many non-experts in the industry define the word only as "able to last" or "the capacity to endure." In popular usage by designers and product manufacturers, "sustainable" has become a relative term referring to any material, process or product (including a building) which is less toxic or environmental harmful than those conventionally used.  A product that contains 75% [[recycled]] material is often considered "sustainable", but is in fact merely MORE sustainable than a comparable product that contains no recycled material.  A truly sustainable material would be one made of 100% recycled material that can, in turn, be completely recycled into a comparable new material or product.  This is rarely the case.

"Regenerative" also suffers from a slightly different linguistic problem, the term is still competing with the biological community in terms of its use for the [[regeneration (biology)|re-growth]] of limbs etc.. However once the word itself gains wide usage, its meaning becomes more general, much like in the case of the term "sustainable". The base meaning of "re-generative" means the "capacity to bring into existence again." So if an item or system is regenerative the item or system has the capacity to bring itself into existence again. Using the example above, a truly regenerative product would not only be 100% recycled and recyclable, but it would also improve the environmental conditions at the factory where it was made, the business where it was used and so on throughout its life-cycle (creating habitat, filtering water, catalyzing [[nitrogen-fixation]] processes in the soil, etc.).

== Preservation versus conservation ==
Regenerative design places more importance on conservation and biodiversity rather than on preservation. It is recognized in regenerative design that humans are a part of natural ecosystems. To exclude people is to create dense areas that destroy pockets of existing ecosystems while preserving pockets of ecosystems without allowing them to change naturally over time. By incorporating people into ecosystems all inputs are pulled from local areas and all outputs are accounted for creating a waste-less system. 

== Food systems and business ==
Regenerative farming or '[[regenerative agriculture]]' calls for the creation of demand on agricultural systems to produce food in a way that is beneficial to the production and the ecology of the environment. It uses the [[science]] of [[systems ecology]], and the design and application through [[permaculture]]. As understanding of its benefits to human biology and ecological systems that sustain us is increased as has the demand for [[organic food]]. Organic food grown using regenerative and permaculture design increases the [[biodiversity]] and is used to develop business models that regenerate communities. Whereas some foods are organic some are not strictly regenerative because it is not clearly seeking to maximize biodiversity and the resilience of the environment and the workforce. Regenerative agriculture grows organic produce through [[Corporate social responsibility|ethical supply chains]], [[zero waste]] policies, [[Living wage|fair wages]], [[staff development]] and [[Wellbeing at Work conference|wellbeing]], and in some cases [[cooperative]] and [[social enterprise]] models. It seeks to benefit the staff along the [[supply chain]], customers, and ecosystems with the outcome of human and [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] and regeneration.

== Size of regenerative systems ==
The size of the regenerative system effects the [[complexity]] of the design process. The smaller a [[system]] is designed the more likely it is to be resilient and regenerative. Multiple small regenerative systems that are put together to create larger regenerative systems help to create supplies for multiple human-inclusive-ecological systems.

'''Revue virtuelle''' (1992-1996) was an exhibition project for early [[new media]], [[virtual art]] technologies, [[computer graphics]], [[virtual reality]], [[hypermedia]] and [[digital art]] projects that was housed in the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], [[Centre Pompidou]] during the years 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Boissier, Jean-Louis: «La question des nouveaux médias numériques», in: «Centre Pompidou: 30 ans d’histoire», ed. by Bernadette Dufrêne, 2007, {{ISBN|978-2-84426-322-3}}, p. 374-391, online at: http://www.arpla.fr/canal20/adnm/?p=253 cf. also Boissier, Jean-Louis, ''La Revue Virtuelle, Notebooks 1-17'' 1992-1996, Paris: Centre Pompidou&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revue virtuelle also created a virtual "magazine" jointly created by the museum and the Centre de Création Industrielle, that addressed the issue of new technologies from the viewpoints of science, [[aesthetics]], [[museography]] and education. These activities were documented in a bilingual [[CD-ROM]] entitled ''L'Actualité du Virtuel/Actualizing the Virtual'', published in 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9219">'''S''' is an [[axiomatic set theory]] set out by [[George Boolos]] in his 1989 article, "Iteration Again". '''S''', a [[first order logic|first-order]] theory, is two-sorted because its [[ontology]] includes “stages” as well as [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. Boolos designed '''S''' to embody his understanding of the “iterative conception of set“ and the associated [[iterative hierarchy]]. '''S''' has the important property that all axioms of [[Zermelo set theory]] ''Z'', except the [[axiom of extensionality]] and the [[axiom of choice]], are theorems of '''S''' or a slight modification thereof.

==Ontology==
Any grouping together of [[mathematical object|mathematical]], [[abstract object|abstract]], or concrete objects, however formed, is a ''collection'', a synonym for what other [[set theory|set theories]] refer to as a [[Class (set theory)|class]]. The things that make up a collection are called [[element (mathematics)|element]]s or members. A common instance of a collection is the [[domain of discourse]] of a [[first-order theory]]. 

All sets are collections, but there are collections that are not sets. A synonym for collections that are not sets is [[proper class]]. An essential task of [[axiomatic set theory]] is to distinguish sets from proper classes, if only because mathematics is grounded in sets, with proper classes relegated to a purely descriptive role.

The [[Von Neumann universe]] implements the “iterative conception of set” by stratifying the universe of sets into a series of "stages", with the sets at a given stage being possible members of the sets formed at all higher stages. The notion of stage goes as follows. Each stage is assigned an [[ordinal number]]. The lowest stage, stage 0, consists of all entities having no members. We assume that the only entity at stage 0 is the [[empty set]], although this stage would include any [[urelement]]s we would choose to admit. Stage ''n'', ''n''&gt;0, consists of all possible sets formed from elements to be found in any stage whose number is less than ''n''. Every set formed at stage ''n'' can also be formed at every stage greater than ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998:88).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence the stages form a nested and [[well-ordered]] sequence, and would form a [[hierarchy (mathematics)|hierarchy]] if set membership were [[transitive relation|transitive]]. The iterative conception has gradually become more accepted, despite an imperfect understanding of its historical origins.

The iterative conception of set steers clear, in a well-motivated way, of the well-known [[paradox]]es of [[Russell's paradox|Russell]], [[Burali-Forti paradox|Burali-Forti]], and [[Cantor's paradox|Cantor]]. These paradoxes all result from the [[unrestricted comprehension|unrestricted use of the principle of comprehension]] of [[naive set theory]]. Collections such as "the class of all sets" or "the class of all [[ordinal number|ordinals]]" include sets from all stages of the iterative hierarchy. Hence such collections cannot be formed at any given stage, and thus cannot be sets.

==Primitive notions==
This section follows Boolos (1998: 91). The variables ''x'' and ''y'' range over sets, while ''r'', ''s'', and ''t'' range over stages. There are three [[primitive notion|primitive]] two-place [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]]:
* Set–set: ''x''∈''y'' denotes, as usual, that set ''x'' is a member of set ''y'';
* Set–stage: ''Fxr'' denotes that set ''x'' “is formed at” stage ''r'';
* Stage–stage: ''r''&lt;''s'' denotes that stage ''r'' “is earlier than” stage ''s''.

The axioms below include a defined two-place set-stage predicate, ''Bxr'', which abbreviates:
:&lt;math&gt;\exist s[s&lt;r \land Fxs].&lt;/math&gt;
''Bxr'' is read as “set ''x'' is formed before stage ''r''.”

[[identity (mathematics)|Identity]], denoted by infix ‘=’, does not play the role in '''S''' it plays in other set theories, and Boolos does not make fully explicit whether the background [[first-order logic|logic]] includes identity. '''S''' has no [[axiom of extensionality]] and identity is absent from the other '''S''' axioms. Identity does appear in the axiom schema distinguishing '''S+''' from '''S''',&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 97).&lt;/ref&gt; and in the derivation in '''S''' of the [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of empty set|null set]], and [[axiom of infinity|infinity]] axioms of '''[[Zermelo set theory|Z]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 103–04).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
The symbolic axioms shown below are from Boolos (1998: 91), and govern how sets and stages behave and interact. The natural language versions of the axioms are intended to aid the intuition.
&lt;!-- The symbolic axioms should not be changed without discussion on the talk page. Altering these axioms would constitute original research. However the English descriptions may be changed.--&gt;

The axioms come in two groups of three. The first group consists of axioms pertaining solely to stages and the stage-stage relation ‘&lt;’.

'''Tra''': &lt;math&gt; \forall r \forall s \forall t[r&lt;s \land s&lt;t \rightarrow r&lt;t] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

“Earlier than” is transitive.

'''Net''': &lt;math&gt; \forall s \forall t \exist r[t&lt;r \land s&lt;r] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

A consequence of ''Net'' is that every stage is earlier than some stage.

'''Inf''': &lt;math&gt; \exist r \exist u [u&lt;r \land \forall t[t&lt;r \rightarrow \exist s[t&lt;s \land s&lt;r]]] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The sole purpose of ''Inf'' is to enable deriving in '''S''' the [[axiom of infinity]] of other set theories.

The second and final group of axioms involve both sets and stages, and the predicates other than '&lt;':

'''All''': &lt;math&gt;  \forall x \exist r Fxr \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Every set is formed at some stage in the hierarchy.

'''When''': &lt;math&gt; \forall r \forall x [Fxr \leftrightarrow [\forall y (y \in x \rightarrow Byr) \land \lnot Bxr] ] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

A set is formed at some stage [[iff]] its members are formed at earlier stages.

Let ''A''(''y'') be a formula of '''S''' where ''y'' is free but ''x'' is not. Then the following axiom schema holds:

'''Spec''': &lt;math&gt; \exist r \forall y[A(y) \rightarrow Byr] \rightarrow \exist x \forall y[y \in x \leftrightarrow A(y)] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If there exists a stage ''r'' such that all sets satisfying ''A''(''y'') are formed at a stage earlier than ''r'', then there exists a set ''x'' whose members are just those sets satisfying ''A''(''y''). The role of ''Spec'' in '''S''' is analogous to that of the [[axiom schema of specification]] of [[Z]].

==Discussion==
Boolos’s name for [[Zermelo set theory]] minus extensionality was ''Z-''. Boolos derived in '''S''' all axioms of ''Z-'' except the [[axiom of choice]].&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 95–96; 103–04).&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this exercise was to show how most of conventional set theory can be derived from the iterative conception of set, assumed embodied in '''S'''. [[Extensionality]] does not follow from the iterative conception, and so is not a theorem of '''S'''. However, '''S''' + Extensionality is free of contradiction if '''S''' is free of contradiction.

Boolos then altered ''Spec'' to obtain a variant of '''S''' he called '''S+''', such that the [[axiom schema of replacement]] is derivable in '''S+'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Extensionality. Hence '''S+''' + Extensionality has the power of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]]. Boolos also argued that the [[axiom of choice]] does not follow from the iterative conception, but did not address whether Choice could be added to '''S''' in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 97).&lt;/ref&gt; Hence '''S+''' + Extensionality cannot prove those theorems of the conventional set theory [[ZFC]] whose proofs require Choice.

'''Inf''' guarantees the existence of stages ω, and of ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' for finite ''n'', but not of stage ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω. Nevertheless, '''S''' yields enough of [[transfinite number|Cantor's paradise]] to ground almost all of contemporary mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;”…the overwhelming majority of 20th century mathematics is straightforwardly representable by sets of fairly low infinite ranks, certainly less than ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;20.” (Potter 2004: 220). The exceptions to Potter's statement presumably include [[category theory]], which requires the weakly [[inaccessible cardinal]]s afforded by [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], and the higher reaches of set theory itself.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boolos compares '''S''' at some length to a variant of the system of [[Frege]]’s ''Grundgesetze'', in which [[Hume's principle]], taken as an axiom, replaces Frege’s Basic Law V, an [[unrestricted comprehension]] axiom which made Frege's system inconsistent; see [[Russell's paradox]].

'''Satyagraha''' ({{lang-sa|सत्याग्रह}}; satya: "''truth''", graha: "''insistence''" or "''holding firmly to''") or holding onto truth''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gandhifoundation.net/about%20gandhi6.htm “Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha” itself or some other equivalent English phrase.”&lt;/ref&gt;'' or truth force – is a particular form of [[nonviolent resistance]] or [[civil resistance]].  Someone who practices satyagraha is a '''satyagrahi'''.

The term ''satyagraha'' was coined and developed by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948).&lt;ref name="Majmudar p38"&gt;{{cite book|author=Uma Majmudar|title=Gandhi's pilgrimage of faith: from darkness to light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xM4paHEq5oQC&amp;pg=PA138|year=2005|publisher=SUNY Press|page=138|isbn=9780791464052}}&lt;/ref&gt; He deployed satyagraha in the [[Indian independence movement]] and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]] for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s and [[James Bevel]]'s campaigns  during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States, and many other social justice and similar movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/525247/satyagraha "Gandhi’s satyagraha became a major tool in the Indian struggle against British imperialism and has since been adopted by protest groups in other countries." Date accessed: 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=9165422 "In this respect Satyagraha or non-violent resistance, as conceived by Gandhiji, has an important lesson for pacifists and war-resisters of the West. Western pacifists have so far proved ineffective because they have thought that war can be resisted by mere propaganda, conscientious objection, and organization for settling disputes." Date accessed: 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and meaning of name ==
[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|250px|Gandhi leading the 1930 [[Salt March]], a notable example of satyagraha.]]

The term originated in a competition in the news-sheet ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' in [[South Africa]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="Majmudar p38" /&gt; Mr. Maganlal Gandhi, grandson of an uncle of Gandhi, came up with the word "Sadagraha" and won the prize. Subsequently, to make it clearer, Gandhi changed it to Satyagraha. "Satyagraha" is a [[tatpuruṣaya]] [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of the Sanskrit words ''[[satya]]'' (meaning "truth") and ''agraha'' ("polite insistence", or "holding firmly to"). Satya is derived from the word “sat”, which means “being”. Nothing is or exists in reality except Truth. In the context of satyagraha, Truth therefore includes a) Truth in speech, as opposed to falsehood, b) what is real, as opposed to nonexistent (asat) and c) good as opposed to evil, or bad.  This was critical to Gandhi’s understanding of and faith in nonviolence: "The world rests upon the bedrock of satya or truth. Asatya, meaning untruth, also means nonexistent, and satya or truth also means that which is. If untruth does not so much as exist, its victory is out of the question. And truth being that which is, can never be destroyed. This is the doctrine of satyagraha in a nutshell." &lt;ref&gt;Nagler, Michael N. The Nonviolence Handbook: A Guide for Practical Action. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere "passive resistance" and became strength in practising non-violent methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his words:
{{quote|Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or non-violence, and gave up the use of the phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha” itself or some other equivalent English phrase.&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Gandhi, ''Satyagraha in South Africa'', Navajivan, Ahmedabad, 1111, pp. 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 1935, a letter to P. K. Rao, Servants of India Society, Gandhi disputed the proposition that his idea of [[Civil Disobedience]] was adapted from the writings of [[Henry David Thoreau]] especially ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' of 1849.
{{quote|The statement that I had derived my idea of civil disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay of Thoreau on civil disobedience. But the movement was then known as passive resistance. As it was incomplete, I had coined the word satyagraha for the Gujarati readers. When I saw the title of Thoreau’s great essay, I began the use of his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. But I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance. Non-violence was always an integral part of our struggle."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], letter to P. Kodanda Rao, 10 September 1935; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 67, p. 400.[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL067.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gandhi described it as follows:

{{quote|I have also called it love-force or soul-force. In the application of satyagraha, I discovered in the earliest stages that pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one’s opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and compassion. For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other. And patience means self-suffering. So the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth, not by infliction of suffering on the opponent, but on oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. ''Statement to Disorders Inquiry Committee'' January 5, 1920 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 19, p. 206)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contrast to "passive resistance" ==

Gandhi distinguished between satyagraha and passive resistance in the following letter:
{{quote|"I have drawn the distinction between passive resistance as understood and practised in the West and satyagraha before I had evolved the doctrine of the latter to its full logical and spiritual extent. I often used “passive resistance” and “satyagraha” as synonymous terms: but as the doctrine of satyagraha developed, the expression “passive resistance” ceases even to be synonymous, as passive resistance has admitted of violence as in the case of the [[suffragette]]s and has been universally acknowledged to be a weapon of the weak. Moreover, passive resistance does not necessarily involve complete adherence to truth under every circumstance. Therefore it is different from satyagraha in three essentials: Satyagraha is a weapon of the strong; it admits of no violence under any circumstance whatsoever; and it ever insists upon truth."&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Letter to Mr.&amp;nbsp;– ” 25 January 1920 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 19, p. 350)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Ahimsa and satyagraha==
It is important to note the intrinsic connection between [[ahinsa]] and satyagraha. Satyagraha is sometimes used to refer to the whole principle of nonviolence, where it is essentially the same as ahimsa, and sometimes used in a “marked” meaning to refer specifically to [[direct action]] that is largely obstructive, for example in the form of civil disobedience.

Gandhi says:
{{quote|It is perhaps clear from the foregoing, that without ahinsa it is not possible to seek and find Truth. Ahimsa and Truth are so intertwined that it is practically impossible to disentangle and separate them. They are like the two sides of a coin, or rather of a smooth unstamped metallic disk. Nevertheless, ahimsa is the means; Truth is the end. Means to be means must always be within our reach, and so ahimsa is our supreme duty.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mahatma. Non-violent Resistance (Satyagraha). Mineola, N.Y.: Dover, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Defining success ===
Assessing the extent to which Gandhi's ideas of satyagraha were or were not successful in the Indian independence struggle is a complex task. Judith Brown has suggested that "this is a political strategy and technique which, for its outcomes, depends of historical specificities."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Judith M., "Gandhi and Civil Resistance in India, 1917–47: Key Issues", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt; The view taken by Gandhi differs from the idea that the goal in any conflict is necessarily to defeat the opponent or frustrate the opponent’s objectives, or to meet one’s own objectives despite the efforts of the opponent to obstruct these. In satyagraha, by contrast, “The Satyagrahi’s object is to convert, not to coerce, the wrong-doer.”&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Requisite Qualifications” ''Harijan'' 25 March 1939&lt;/ref&gt; The opponent must be converted, at least as far as to stop obstructing the just end, for this cooperation to take place. There are cases, to be sure, when an opponent, for e.g. a dictator, has to be unseated and one cannot wait to convert him. The satyagrahi would count this a partial success.

=== Means and ends ===
The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. The means used to obtain an end are wrapped up in and attached to that end. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use unjust means to obtain justice or to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: “They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors; from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap45.htm “The Gospel Of Sarvodaya], of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi used an example to explain this:

{{quote|If I want to deprive you of your watch, I shall certainly have to fight for it; if I want to buy your watch, I shall have to pay for it; and if I want a gift, I shall have to plead for it; and, according to the means I employ, the watch is stolen property, my own property, or a donation.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Brute Force”, Chapter XVI of ''Hind Swaraj'', 1909 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 10, p. 287)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gandhi rejected the idea that injustice should, or even could, be fought against “by any means necessary”&amp;nbsp;– if you use violent, coercive, unjust means, whatever ends you produce will necessarily embed that injustice. To those who preached violence and called nonviolent actionists cowards, he replied: “I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence....I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour....But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment.”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors;  from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap28.htm “Between Cowardice and Violence,”] of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satyagraha versus duragraha ===
The essence of satyagraha is that it seeks to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves, as opposed to violent resistance, which is meant to cause harm to the antagonist. A satyagrahi therefore does not seek to end or destroy the relationship with the antagonist, but instead seeks to transform or “purify” it to a higher level. A euphemism sometimes used for satyagraha is that it is a “silent force” or a “soul force” (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous “[[I Have a Dream]]” speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a “universal force,” as it essentially “makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.”&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Some Rules of Satyagraha” ''Young India (Navajivan)'' 23 February 1930 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 48, p. 340)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi contrasted satyagraha (holding on to truth) with “duragraha” (holding on by force), as in protest meant more to harass than enlighten opponents.  He wrote: “There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors;  from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap34.htm “Power of Satyagraha,”] of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil disobedience and non-cooperation as practised under satyagraha are based on the “law of suffering”,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “The Law of Suffering” ''Young India'' 16 June 1920&lt;/ref&gt; a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, the non-cooperation of satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent that is consistent with truth and justice.

== In large-scale conflict ==

When using satyagraha in a large-scale political conflict involving civil disobedience, Gandhi believed that the satyagrahis must undergo training to ensure discipline.  He wrote that it is “only when people have proved their active loyalty by obeying the many laws of the State that they acquire the right of Civil Disobedience.”&lt;ref name="prereq" /&gt;

He therefore made part of the discipline that satyagrahis:
# Appreciate the other laws of the State and obey them voluntarily
# Tolerate these laws, even when they are inconvenient
# Be willing to undergo suffering, loss of property, and to endure the suffering that might be inflicted on family and friends&lt;ref name="prereq"&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Pre-requisites for Satyagraha” ''Young India'' 1 August 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

This obedience has to be not merely grudging, but extraordinary:
{{quote|...an honest, respectable man will not suddenly take to stealing whether there is a law against stealing or not, but this very man will not feel any remorse for failure to observe the rule about carrying headlights on bicycles after dark.... But he would observe any obligatory rule of this kind, if only to escape the inconvenience of facing a prosecution for a breach of the rule. Such compliance is not, however, the willing and spontaneous obedience that is required of a Satyagrahi.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “A Himalayan Miscalculation” in ''The Story of My Experiments with Truth'' Chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Principles ===
Gandhi envisioned satyagraha as not only a tactic to be used in acute political struggle, but as a universal solvent for injustice and harm.

He founded the [[Sabarmati Ashram]] to teach satyagraha.  He asked satyagrahis to follow the following principles (Yamas described in Yoga Sutra):&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. ''Non-violent Resistance (Satyagraha)'' (1961) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
# Nonviolence ([[ahimsa]])
# Truth – this includes honesty, but goes beyond it to mean living fully in accord with and in devotion to that which is true
# Not stealing
# [[Non-possession]] (not the same as poverty)
# Body-labor or bread-labor
# Control of desires (gluttony)
# Fearlessness
# Equal respect for all religions
# Economic strategy such as boycott of imported goods ([[swadeshi]])
On another occasion, he listed these rules as “essential for every Satyagrahi in India”:
# Must have a living faith in God
# Must be leading a chaste life, and be willing to die or lose all his possessions
# Must be a habitual khadi weaver and spinner
# Must abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants

=== Rules for satyagraha campaigns ===
Gandhi proposed a series of rules for satyagrahis to follow in a resistance campaign:&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt;
# Harbour no anger.
# Suffer the anger of the opponent.
# Never retaliate to assaults or punishment; but do not submit, out of fear of punishment or assault, to an order given in anger.
# Voluntarily submit to arrest or confiscation of your own property.
# If you are a trustee of property, defend that property (non-violently) from confiscation with your life.
# Do not curse or swear.
# Do not insult the opponent.
# Neither salute nor insult the flag of your opponent or your opponent’s leaders.
# If anyone attempts to insult or assault your opponent, defend your opponent (non-violently) with your life.
# As a prisoner, behave courteously and obey prison regulations (except any that are contrary to self-respect).
# As a prisoner, do not ask for special favourable treatment.
# As a prisoner, do not fast in an attempt to gain conveniences whose deprivation does not involve any injury to your self-respect.
# Joyfully obey the orders of the leaders of the civil disobedience action.

== American Civil Rights Movement ==
Satyagraha theory also influenced many other movements of nonviolence and civil resistance. For example, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote in his autobiography about Gandhi's influence on his developing ideas regarding the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States:

{{quote|Like most people, I had heard of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was particularly moved by his [[Salt March]] to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of ''Satyagraha'' (''Satya'' is truth which equals love, and ''agraha'' is force; ''Satyagraha'', therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform. ... It was in this Gandhian emphasis on love and nonviolence that I discovered the method for social reform that I had been seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Martin Luther King, Jr.|last= King, Jr. |first= Martin Luther | title= [[The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.]]| isbn=0-446-52412-3| year=1998 | editor1-first=Clayborne  |editor1-last=Carson | pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Satyagraha in relation to genocide ==
In view of the [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1930s-1940)|Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany]], Gandhi offered satyagraha as a method of combating oppression and genocide, stating:

{{quote|If I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there, I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest Gentile German might, and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment. And for doing this I should not wait for the fellow Jews to join me in civil resistance, but would have confidence that in the end the rest were bound to follow my example. If one Jew or all the Jews were to accept the prescription here offered, he or they cannot be worse off than now. And suffering voluntarily undergone will bring them an inner strength and joy [...] the calculated violence of [[Hitler]] may even result in a general massacre of the Jews by way of his first answer to the declaration of such hostilities. But if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the race even at the hands of the tyrant. For to the God-fearing, death has no terror.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “The Jews” ''Harijan'' 26 November 1938 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 74, p. 240)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Gandhi was criticized for these statements, he responded in another article entitled “Some Questions Answered”:

{{quote|Friends have sent me two newspaper cuttings criticizing my appeal to the Jews. The two critics suggest that in presenting non-violence to the Jews as a remedy against the wrong done to them, I have suggested nothing new... What I have pleaded for is renunciation of violence of the heart and consequent active exercise of the force generated by the great renunciation.”&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Some Questions Answered” ''Harijan'' 17 December 1938 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 74, pp. 297–98)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a similar vein, anticipating a possible attack on India by Japan during [[World War II]], Gandhi recommended satyagraha as a means of national defense (what is now sometimes called "Civilian Based Defense (CBD) or "[[social defence]]"):

{{quote|...there should be unadulterated non-violent non-cooperation, and if the whole of India responded and unanimously offered it, I should show that, without shedding a single drop of blood, Japanese arms – or any combination of arms – can be sterilized. That involves the determination of India not to give quarter on any point whatsoever and to be ready to risk loss of several million lives. But I would consider that cost very cheap and victory won at that cost glorious. That India may not be ready to pay that price may be true. I hope it is not true, but some such price must be paid by any country that wants to retain its independence. After all, the sacrifice made by the Russians and the Chinese is enormous, and they are ready to risk all. The same could be said of the other countries also, whether aggressors or defenders. The cost is enormous. Therefore, in the non-violent technique I am asking India to risk no more than other countries are risking and which India would have to risk even if she offered armed resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Non-violent Non-cooperation” ''Harijan'' 24 May 1942, p. 167 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 82, p. 286; interview conducted 16 May 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13177">In [[journalism]], the '''society page''' of a [[newspaper]] is largely or entirely devoted to the social and cultural events and gossip of the location covered. Other features that frequently appear on the society page are a calendar of [[Charitable organization|charity event]]s and pictures of locally, nationally and internationally famous people.

==History==
The first true society page in the United States was the invention of newspaper owner [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.]], who created it for the ''[[New York Herald]]'' in 1835.&lt;ref name=Ogden1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapman2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Conboy2002 /&gt;  His reportage centred upon the lives and social gatherings of the rich and famous, with names partially deleted by dashes and reports mildly satirical.  Mott et al{{who|date=January 2018}} record that "Society was at first aghast, then amused, then complacent, and finally hungry for the penny-press stories of its own doings."&lt;ref name=Moss2000a /&gt;  Bennett had in fact been reporting such news since 1827, with articles in the ''[[New York Enquirer]]''.  In the period after the [[United States Civil War]], there were many newly rich people in the country, and reportage of their antics, sometimes tasteless and gauche, was of considerable entertainment value.  By 1885, [[Ward McAllister]] had been recruited to report on society news for the ''[[New York World]]'' by [[Joseph Pulitzer]], and it was around that time that society reporting, both on dedicated society pages and in the new [[Sunday supplement]]s, became very popular.&lt;ref name=Moss2000b /&gt;&lt;ref name=Montgomery1998 /&gt;

Society pages and society reporting was prevalent in the New York daily newspapers from the winter of 1880 onward.&lt;ref name=Montgomery1998 /&gt;  The previous year, [[Pearl Rivers]] had transplanted the notion to New Orleans, where she had begun the ''Society Bee'', a local society column, on March 16, 1879.  Again, the initial reaction was shock.  Rivers reported, in the ''Society Bee'' itself of course, the reaction of one woman who was, "opposed to print on principle."  Print applied to persons is her special horror and abomination … poison only fit for politics, Associated Press dispatches, and police reports.  She thought me very wrong to mention any ladies' names in a newspaper.  She said [that] it was 'shabby' and 'shoddy' and 'shameful'.".  But Rivers persevered, and a decade later, on November 2, 1890, the column, now entitled simply ''Society'', was the largest part of the Sunday paper carrying it.&lt;ref name=Dabney2007 /&gt;

By 1900, most daily newspapers had a '''woman's page''' The covered local high society, as well as fashion. The goal in any case was to attract women as readers, and attract subscribers by promising a new audience for consumer advertising.  Women's pages in general covered issues intended to attract the readership of the stereotypical American housewife of the time: society news, fashion, food, relationships, etiquette, health, homemaking, interior decorating, and family issues.&lt;ref name=Whitt2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChambersSteinerFleming2004 /&gt;  One of the most prominent leaders was Marjorie Paxson. She began her career for a wire service during World War I, when male reporters were scarce. When they returned she went to the women's page in Houston, Texas. In the 1950s she moved to women's section of the '[[Miami Herald]],' Which was nationally renowned for its women's page. She became women's page editor at the '[[St. Petersburg Times]]' in 1969. She was elected national president of Theta Sigma Phi, now [[Association for Women in Communications]], in 1963. She went on to become the fourth female publisher in the Gannett newspaper chain.  After 1970, however, gender segregation faded and the term "woman's page" fell out of fashion. Women in journalism then moved from covering teas and bridal veils to abortion, abuse and feminism:.  &lt;ref&gt;Kimberly Wilmot Voss, and Lance Speere, "Marjorie Paxson: From Women’s Editor to Publisher." ''Media History Monographs'' 10#1 (2008) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kimberly_Voss/publication/268424066_Marjorie_Paxson_From_Women's_Editor_to_Publisher/links/5601b73d08aeb30ba7355527.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, society news was at the same time emerging in the British press as part of "women's journalism", again aimed at attracting a female readership.  It was also, in both the U.S. and Britain, largely the province of women journalists, and considered subordinate.&lt;ref name=ChambersSteinerFleming2004 /&gt;  For example: Society news, in the late 19th century, was not sent to the newspapers by reporters via the [[telegraph]], as other news was, because that was considered too expensive for mere society reporting.  Society journalists instead sent their reports by ordinary mail.&lt;ref name=Schneller2005 /&gt;  Dix Harwood, author of the 1927 journalism textbook ''Getting and Writing News'', stated that society reporting rarely enjoyed much dignity.&lt;ref name=ChambersSteinerFleming2004 /&gt;

Despite the growth in popularity in the 1880s, many "serious" newspapers were initially cautious about society reporting.  For example, the ''[[Ottawa Journal]]'' didn't permit Florence Randal, its first society reporter, to do anything but recite simple chronicles of the [[dowager]]s and [[debutante]]s of the city.  The staff at the ''Globe'', whose society column began in 1893, considered society news to be "horrid vulgar stuff", according to the ''Globe''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s editor Melville Hammond, and its publication was not well received by its subjects: "high Society matrons [who were] unused to the publicizing of private life".

Willoughby Cummings ({{nee}} Emily Ann McCausland), worked as a press journalist and the first society editor of the ''[[Toronto Globe]]'' under the pen name of "Sama". Under her stewardship, the ''Toronto Globe'' expanded its society coverage from weekly notes to a daily column in three years.&lt;ref name=McMullen1990 /&gt; In 1900, she became editor of "Woman's Sphere", a department of the ''[[Canadian Magazine]]''. She worked on behalf of the poor and afflicted and served as an official of various societies. In 1902, for example, she became the corresponding secretary for the [[National Council of Women of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Morgan |editor-first=Henry James |editor-link=Henry James Morgan |title=Types of Canadian Women and of Women who are or have been Connected with Canada |location=Toronto |publisher=Williams Briggs |date=1903 |url=https://archive.org/details/typesofcanadianw01morguoft/page/67 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, society reporting was seen as largely the province of female journalists.  The "women's pages" were written by women.  Indeed, in the 19th century in many newspapers, particularly smaller ones, the only women on the paper's staff at all were those who covered society news.&lt;ref name=McMullen1990 /&gt;  Dix Harwood claimed that the society desk, and the woman who ran it, was nonetheless important:&lt;ref name=ChambersSteinerFleming2004 /&gt;
{{quote|[T]he society desk is oftentimes one of the most valuable offices on the paper if the occupant be a woman of high intelligence with a nose for news … and a woman of poise and dignity — a women whom hostesses will be forced to treat as equal.|sign=Dix Harwood|source=''Getting and Writing News'', 1927, pp. 148—149&lt;ref name=ChambersSteinerFleming2004 /&gt;}}
Typical topics were "Miss [[Emily Bissell]] as a Turkish Girl", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Jan 1, 1900 or "Maryland Society Belle Was Fair Senorita at Ball", ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', Feb 7, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Male reporters were unwilling to cover such things.&lt;ref name=McMullen1990 /&gt;  As Morton Sontheimer stated in 1941, "The women's department jobs almost invariably go to women, not because men can't do them but because they won't." (''Newspaperman'', pp.&amp;nbsp;228).&lt;ref name=ChambersSteinerFleming2004 /&gt;  One such reporter who refused to do the job even though it had been handed to him was [[Gordon Sinclair]], of the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.&lt;ref name=Lang1999 /&gt;

Sinclair got the job of woman's page editor after Clifford Wallace, its previous editor, had begged to be relieved of the job.  Wallace, the first male woman's page editor of the ''Star'' and nicknamed "Nellie" because of that, had been given the job as the result of the proprietor's wife, Mrs Atkinson, regarding the women who had previously run the women's desk as "a menace".  In 1922, the managing editor reassigned the position from Wallace to Sinclair.  Sinclair treated the position with utter contempt.&lt;ref name=Lang1999 /&gt;  He later wrote:
{{quote|From the beginning I never took the job seriously, expecting [that] I would either be fired or soon moved to other work.  As a consequence I used to come in at eight in the morning and, except on Saturdays, quit for the day about eleven. I shamelessly clipped most of my material from other newspapers, and stuck to the job for about fourteen months until young Joe Atkinson, who was at that time a proof reader, noticed that all my stuff had previously been published in some other paper.|sign=Gordon Sinclair&lt;ref name=Lang1999 /&gt;}}

'''''Stratum Pier''''' is an [[interactive art|interactive]] [[overlook]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Kendall Buster]]. The functional [[sculpture]] is located at the Indianapolis Museum of Art's [[Indianapolis Museum of Art#100 Acres: Virginia B. Fairbanks Art .26 Nature Park|100 Acres: Virginia B.

==Description==

Based on a section of a [[topographical map]] of 100 Acres the artwork consists of [[emerald green]] layered platforms that are shaped in a flowing organic manner along the south side of the sculpture parks lake. The artwork consists of [[fiberglass]] grids that sit upon a support system made of [[steel]]. The support system sits at varied heights.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; Visitors are welcome to walk on, sit, fish at and explore the structure, which is occasionally non-accessible due to flooding.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheets1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockey"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Indianapolis Museum of Art - Stratum Pier | work=Projects| publisher=Rockey Structures | url=http://www.rockeystructures.com/project20.html | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

''Stratum Pier'' was created to appear as if it is an extension of the [[shoreline]], exhibiting artist Kendall Buster's desire to merge "the natural and the built environment." A visit to the structure allows one to view the cycles of [[erosion]] and growth in the 100 Acres environment, cycles that are represented in ''Stratum Pier''s layered build.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;  Fiberglass was chosen due to its light weight allowing it to easily sit in its present location and its durability which allows for heavy use by visitors to the park. Buster started to design the piece after a visit to the park and inspiration from the topographical maps created to document the parks environment.&lt;ref name="IMATV1"&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=19 July 2010 |title=IMA TV: Kendall Buster's Stratum Pier  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_NZdVDfd04 |format=Web|medium=Digital |trans_title= |publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=6 April 2011 |time=  |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buster expects the work to merge with the landscape as the grass and brush that surrounds the area grows into the work.&lt;ref name="Buster"/&gt;

Buster worked with [[architect]] Jeremy Olsen of Wheeler Kearns and project [[engineer]] Chris Rockey of Rockey Structures to create the piece.&lt;ref name="Rockey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buster"&gt;{{cite web | author=Kendall Buster | year=| title=Stratum Pier, 2010 | work=Projects| publisher=Kendall Buster | url=http://www.kendallbuster.com/projects_text/stratumpiertx.html | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork was commissioned by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] and funded by a grant from [[The Indianapolis Foundation]].&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; In June 2010 Indianapolis based Motus Dance Theatre performed one day, every 45 minutes, on ''Stratum Pier'' in response to the installation and to celebrate the opening of the park.&lt;ref name="Motus"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Past Performances | work=Performances/Events| publisher=Motus Dance Theatre | url=http://motusdance.com/performancesevents/pastperformances/ | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The artist==

Before pursuing fine art, Kendall Buster obtained her degree in [[medical technology]], then moved on to earning her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design]]. After receiving her [[Masters of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[Yale University]] she was involved in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s Independent Study Studio Program. Buster's work is described as "[[biological architecture (sculpture)|biological architecture]]" and resides in the collections of the [[Kreeger Museum]], the [[Kemper Museum]], [[Hirshhorn Museum]], among others. She has been commissioned to create public art for the [[Walter E. Washington Convention Center]], [[Markel Corporation]], the [[BOK Center]], [[Nevada Museum of Art]], and many others. In 2005 Buster was awarded an [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in the Arts]]. Teaching at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], she lives and works in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buster"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Survivability''' is the ability to remain alive or continue to exist.  The term has more specific meaning in certain contexts.
==Ecological==
{{main|Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|Resilience (ecology)|Island ecology|United Nations University}}

Following disruptive forces such as [[flood]], [[fire]], [[disease]], [[war]], or [[climate change]] some species of  [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[Biota (ecology)|local life forms]]  are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical]] conditions.

==Engineering==
In [[engineering]], '''survivability''' is the quantified ability of a [[system]], subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man-made disturbance; for example a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] from the detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]].

For a given application, survivability must be qualified by specifying the range of conditions over which the entity will survive, the minimum acceptable level or post-disturbance functionality, and the maximum acceptable [[downtime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
In the military environment, survivability is defined as the ability to remain [[availability|mission capable]] after a single engagement. Engineers working in survivability are often responsible for improving four main system elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, 2nd Edition | publisher=AIAA Education Series | author=Ball, Robert | year=2003 | pages=2, 445, 603 | isbn=1-56347-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Detectability - the inability to ''avoid'' being aurally and visually detected as well as detected by radar (by an observer).
* Susceptibility - the inability to ''avoid'' being hit (by a weapon).
* [[Vulnerability]] - the inability to ''withstand'' the hit.
* Recoverability - longer-term post-hit effects, damage control, and firefighting, ''capability restoration'', or (in extremis) escape and evacuation.

The European Survivability Workshop introduced the concept of "Mission Survivability" whilst retaining the three core areas above, either pertaining to the "survivability" of a platform through a complete mission, or the "survivability" of the mission itself (i.e. probability of mission success). Recent studies have also introduced the concept of "Force Survivability" which relates to the ability of a force rather than an individual platform to remain "mission capable".

There is no clear prioritisation of the three elements; this will depend on the characteristics and role of the platform. Some platform types, such as submarines and airplanes, minimise their susceptibility and may, to some extent, compromise in the other areas. Main Battle Tanks minimise vulnerability through the use of heavy armours. Present day surface warship designs tend to aim for a balanced combination of all three areas.

=== Naval ===
Survivability denotes the ability of a ship and its on-board systems to remain functional and continue designated mission in a man-made hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Said, M., Theory and Practice of Total Ship Survivability for Ship Design. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 107(1995)4, p. 191–203.&lt;/ref&gt; The naval vessels are designed to operate in a man-made hostile environment, and therefore the survivability is a vital feature required from them. The naval vessel’s survivability is a complicated subject affecting the whole life cycle of the vessel, and should be considered from the initial design phase of every war ship.&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"&gt;Kotiranta, R., The Assessment of Naval Vessel’s Survivability against Explosion in Air based on a 3-D Product Model, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical definition of naval survivability includes three main aspects, which are susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability; although, recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, R. et al., Operationally Oriented Vulnerability Requirements in the Ship Design Process. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 110(1998)1, p. 19–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
Susceptibility consists of all the factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment. These factors in general are the operating conditions, the threat, and the features of the ship itself. The operating conditions, such as sea state, weather and atmospheric conditions, vary considerably, and their influence is difficult to address (hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment). The threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon’s performance, such as the range. The features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures (radar, infrared, acoustic, magnetic), the defensive systems on board, such as surface-to-air missiles, EW and decoys, and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack (aspects such as speed, maneuverability, chosen aspect presented to the threat).&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"/&gt;
Vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short-term effects of the threat weapon. Vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavily
affected by the vessel’s basic characteristics such as size, subdivision, armouring, and other hardening features, and also the design of the ship's systems, in particular the location of equipment, degrees of redundancy and separation, and the presence within a system of single point failures. Recoverability refers to vessel’s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage. Thus, recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage. These actions include firefighting, limiting the extent of flooding, and dewatering. Besides the equipment, the crew also has a vital role in recoverability.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, J., Warship Survivability. Conference Proceedings of International Naval Technology Expo 80, Geneve, Sveitsi 1980, p. 28–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combat vehicle crew ===

The crews of military [[combat vehicle]]s face numerous lethal hazards which are both diverse and constantly evolving. [[Improvised explosive device|Improvised Explosive Devices]] (IEDs), [[Land mine|mines]], and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|enemy fire]] are examples of such persistent and variable threats. Historically, measures taken to mitigate these hazards were concerned with protecting the vehicle itself, but due to this achieving only limited protection, the focus has now shifted to safeguarding the crew within from an ever-broadening range of threats, including [[Improvised explosive device|
Radio Controlled IEDs (RCIEDs)]], blast, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[Hyperthermia|heat stress]], and [[dehydration]].

The expressed goal of "crew survivability" is to ensure vehicle occupants are best protected. It goes beyond simply ensuring crew have the appropriate protective equipment and has expanded to include measuring the overpressure and blunt impact forces experienced by a vehicle from real blast incidents in order to develop medical treatment and improve overall crew survivability. Sustainable crew survivability is dependent on the effective integration of knowledge, training, and equipment:

==== Prevention and training ====
Threat intelligence identifying trends, emerging technologies, and attack tactics used by enemy forces enables crews to implement procedures that will reduce their exposure to unnecessary risks. Such intelligence also allows for more effective pre-deployment training programs where personnel can be taught the most up-to-date developments in IED concealment, for example, or undertake tailored training that will enable them to identify the likely attack strategy of enemy forces. In addition, with expert, current threat intelligence, the most effective equipment can be procured or rapidly developed in support of operations.

==Network==

===Definitions of network survivability===

Survivability is a subset of [[Resilience (network)|resilience]]."&lt;ref&gt;The [http://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/resilinets_wiki/index.php/Definitions#Survivability ResiliNets] Research Initiative definition of '''survivability'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Jabbar Mohammad, David Hutchison, and James P.G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1098">'''Technological escalation''' describes the situation where two parties in competition tend to employ continual technological improvements in their attempt to defeat each other.  Technology is defined here as a creative invention, either in the form of an object or a methodology. An example is the mutual escalation seen between [[e-mail spam]]mers and the programmers of spam filters and other anti-spam techniques. Although [[Conflict escalation|escalation]] is usually meant negatively, if two companies are in an escalating competition to produce the best [[Widget (economics)|widget]], the consumer benefits because they get a choice between better and better widgets.

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Book of the Courtier''''' ({{lang-it|Il Cortegiano}} {{IPA-it|il korteˈdʒaːno|}}) is a [[courtesy book]] or book of manners which dealt with issues of [[etiquette]], behaviour and morals, particularly at [[Court (royal)|princely, or royal  courts]]. Courtesy literature can be traced back to 13th century German and Italian writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution=courtesy literature | title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | year=2008
| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/140802/courtesy-literature}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book of the Courtier'' was written by [[Baldassare Castiglione]] over the course of many years, beginning in 1508, and was ultimately published in 1528 by the [[Aldine Press]] in [[Venice]] just before his death. An English edition was published in 1561. 

''The Book of the Courtier'' addresses the  constitution of a perfect [[courtier]], and in its last installment, a perfect lady. It takes the form of a Renaissance dialogue, a literary form that incorporated elements of drama, conversation, philosophy, and essay.  Considered the definitive account of [[Renaissance]] [[courtier|court life]], it is cited frequently, along with [[Stefano Guazzo]]'s ''The civil conversation''  of 1574 and [[Giovanni Della Casa]]'s ''Galateo '' of 1558, as an important resource on court life during the Italian Renaissance.

==Principles==
The book is organized as a series of fictional conversations that occur between the [[courtier]]s of the [[Duke of Urbino]] in 1507 (when Castiglione was in fact part of the Duke's Court). In the book, the courtier is described as having a cool mind, a good voice (with beautiful, elegant and brave words) along with proper bearing and gestures. At the same time though, the courtier is expected to have a warrior spirit, to be athletic, and have good knowledge of the humanities, [[Classics]] and [[fine art]]s.  
Over the course of four evenings, members of the court try to describe the perfect gentleman of the court.  In the process they debate the nature of nobility, humor, women, and love.

==Reception==
''The Book of the Courtier'' was one of the most widely distributed books of the 16th century, with editions printed in six languages and in twenty European centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-01516-0.html|title=The Fortunes of the Courtier|work=Penn State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1561 English translation by [[Thomas Hoby]] had a great influence on the English upper class's conception of English gentlemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Lawrence Cunningham, John Reich|author2=John J. Reich | title = Culture and Values: A Survey of the Humanities| url = https://books.google.com/?id=l7sj5r7YFwMC| year = 2006| publisher = Thomson Wadsworth| isbn = 0-534-58227-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Courtier enjoyed influence for some generations, not least in Elizabethan England following its first translation by Sir Thomas Hoby in 1561, a time when Italian culture was very much in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, G. [trans.] (1967) ''Book of the Courtier: Baldesar Castiglione'', Penguin books,  Bungay [Suffolk, England], p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==

Of the many qualities Castiglione’s characters attribute to their perfect courtier, oratory and the manner in which the courtier presents himself while speaking is amongst the most highly discussed. Wayne Rebhorn, a Castiglione scholar, states that the courtier’s speech and behavior in general is “designed to make people marvel at him, to transform himself into a beautiful spectacle for others to contemplate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rebhorn|first=Wayne|title=Baldesar Castiglione, Thomas Wilson, and the Courtly Body of Renaissance Rhetoric|journal=Rhetorica|year=1992|volume=11|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1525/rh.1993.11.3.241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As explained by Count Ludovico, the success of the courtier depends greatly on his reception by the audience from the first impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castiglione|first=Baldassare|title=The Book of the Courtier|year=2003|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This partly explains why the group considers the courtier's dress so vital to his success.

Castiglione's characters opine about how their courtier can impress his audience and win its approval. Similar to the Classical Roman rhetoricians [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], Castiglione stresses the importance of delivery while speaking. In Book I, the Count states that when the courtier speaks he must have a “sonorous, clear, sweet and well sounding” voice that is neither too effeminate nor too rough and be “tempered by a calm face and with a play of the eyes that shall give an effect of grace.” (Castiglione 1.33) This grace, or ''grazia'', becomes an important element in the courtier’s appearance to the audience. Edoardo Saccone states in his analysis of Castiglione, “''grazia'' consists of, or rather is obtained through, ''[[sprezzatura]]''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saccone|first=Eduardo|title=The Portrait of the Courtier in Castiglione|journal=Italica|year=1987|volume=64|issue=1|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Count, ''[[sprezzatura]]'' is amongst one of the most important, if not the most important, rhetorical device the courtier needs. Peter Burke describes ''sprezzatura'' in ''The Book of the Courtier'' as “nonchalance”, “careful negligence”, and “effortless and ease.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Burke| first = Peter| title = The Fortunes of the Courtier| year = 1996| publisher = The Pennsylvania State University Press| location = University Park, Pennsylvania| isbn = 0-271-01517-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideal courtier is someone who “conceals art, and presents what is done and said as if it was done without effort and virtually without thought.” (31).

The Count advocates the courtier engage in ''sprezzatura'', or this “certain nonchalance”, in all the activities he participates in, especially speech. In Book I, he states, "Accordingly we may affirm that to be true art which does not appear to be art; nor to anything must we give greater care than to conceal art, for if it is discovered, it quite destroys our credit and brings us into small esteem." (Castiglione 1.26) The Count reasons that by obscuring his knowledge of letters, the courtier gives the appearance that his “orations were composed very simply” as if they sprang up from “nature and truth [rather] than from study and art.” (1.26).  This much more natural appearance, even though it is not natural by any means, is more advantageous to the courtier.

The Count contends that if the courtier wants to attain ''grazia'' and be esteemed excellent, it would be in his best interest to have this appearance of nonchalance. By failing to employ ''sprezzatura'', he destroys his opportunity for grace. By applying ''sprezzatura'' to his speech and everything else he does, the courtier appears to have ''grazia'' and impresses his audience, thereby achieving excellence and perfection. (Saccone 16).

Another feature of rhetoric which Castiglione discusses is the role of written language and style. Castiglione declined to imitate [[Boccaccio]] and write in Tuscan Italian, as was customary at the time; instead he wrote in the Italian used in his native Lombardy (he was born near [[Mantua]]): as the Count says, “certainly it would require a great deal of effort on my part if in these discussions of ours I wished to use those old Tuscan words which the Tuscans of today have discarded; and what’s more I’m sure you would all laugh at me” (Courtier 70). Here, the use of the old and outdated Tuscan language is seen as a form of excess rather than a desirable trait. Castiglione states that had he followed Tuscan usage in his book, his description of sprezzatura would appear hypocritical, in that his effort would be seen as lacking in nonchalance (Courtier 71).

Federico responds to the Count's assessment of the use of spoken language by posing the question as to what is the best language in which to write rhetoric. The Count’s response basically states that the language does not matter, but rather the style, authority, and grace of the work matters most (Courtier 71). Robert J. Graham, a Renaissance literary scholar, notes that “questions of whose language is privileged at any given historical moment are deeply implicated in matters of personal, social and cultural significance”,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Robert J. Composing ourselves in Style: The Aesthetics of Literacty in ‘The Courtier’”. Journal of Aesthetic Education. University of Illinois Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; which he states is the primary reason for Castiglione’s usage of the native vernacular. This also illustrates the Count’s response on the relativity of language in Latin. With the role of language set, Castiglione begins to describe the style and authority in which the courtier must write in order to become successful.

The Count explains, "it is right that greater pains would be taken to make what is written more polished and correct…they should be chosen from the most beautiful of those employed in speech" (Courtier 71). This is where the style of which the courtier writes encourages the persuasiveness or successfulness of a speech. The success of a written speech, in contrast to the spoken speech, hinges on the notion that "we are willing to tolerate a great deal of improper and even careless usage"&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Robert J. ''Composing ourselves in Style: The Aesthetics of Literacty in The Courtier''. Journal of Aesthetic Education. University of Illinois Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; in oral rhetoric than written rhetoric. The Count explains that along with proper word usage, an ideal courtier must have a proper sense of style and flow to their words. These words must be factual yet entertaining as the Count states, “then, it is necessary to arrange what is to be said or written in its logical order, and after that to express it well in words that, if I am not mistaken, should be appropriate, carefully chosen, clear and well formed, but above all that are still in popular use" (Courtier 77). This form of emphasis on language is noted by Graham as; "Although the Count is aware that more traditional aspects of the orator (appearance, gestures, voice, etc.)…all this will be futile and of little consequence if the ideas conveyed by these words themselves are not witty or elegant to the requirements of the situation” (Graham 49).

In [[mathematics]], '''transport of structure''' is the definition of a new structure on an object by reference to another object on which a similar structure already exists. Definitions by transport of structure are regarded as canonical.

Since mathematical structures are often defined in reference to an underlying [[space (mathematics)|space]], many examples of transport of structure involve spaces and mappings between them.  For example, if ''V'' and ''W'' are [[vector space]]s, and if &lt;math&gt;\phi \colon V \to W&lt;/math&gt; is an [[isomorphism]], and if &lt;math&gt;(\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[inner product]] on &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, then we can define an inner product &lt;math&gt;[\cdot, \cdot]&lt;/math&gt; on ''V'' by
:&lt;math&gt;[v_1, v_2] = (\phi(v_1), \phi(v_2))&lt;/math&gt;.
Although the equation makes sense even when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is not an isomorphism, it only defines an inner product on ''V'' when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is, since otherwise it will cause &lt;math&gt;[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt; to be [[degenerate bilinear form|degenerate]].  The idea is that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; allows us to consider ''V'' and ''W'' as "the same" vector space, and if we follow this analogy, we can transport an inner product from one to the other.

A more involved example comes from [[differential topology]], in which we have the notion of a [[smooth manifold]].  If ''M'' is such a manifold, and if ''X'' is any topological space which is [[homeomorphic]] to ''M'', we can consider ''X'' as a smooth manifold as well.  That is, let &lt;math&gt;\phi \colon X \to M&lt;/math&gt; be a homeomorphism; we must define coordinate charts on ''X'', which we will do by "pulling back" coordinate charts on ''M'' through &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  Recall that a coordinate chart on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an open set ''U'' together with an [[injective map]]
:&lt;math&gt;c \colon U \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''n''; to get such a chart on ''X'', we let
:&lt;math&gt;U' = \phi^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c' = c \circ \phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Furthermore, it is required that the charts cover ''M'', we must check that the transported charts cover ''X'', which follows immediately from the fact that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection]].  Finally, since ''M'' is a ''smooth'' manifold, we have that if ''U'' and ''V'', with their maps
:&lt;math&gt;c \colon U \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d \colon V \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;,
are two charts on ''M'', then the composition, the "transition map"
:&lt;math&gt;d \circ c^{-1} \colon c(U \cap V) \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (a self-map of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;)
is smooth.  We must check this for our transported charts on ''X''.  We have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(U) \cap \phi^{-1}(V) = \phi^{-1}(U \cap V)&lt;/math&gt;,
and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;c'(U' \cap V') = (c \circ \phi)(\phi^{-1}(U \cap V)) = c(U \cap V)&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;d' \circ (c')^{-1} = (d \circ \phi) \circ (c \circ \phi)^{-1} = d \circ (\phi \circ \phi^{-1}) \circ c^{-1} = d \circ c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore the transition map for &lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that for ''U'' and ''V'', hence smooth.  Therefore ''X'' is a smooth manifold via transport of structure.

Although the second example involved considerably more checking, the principle was the same, and any experienced mathematician would have no difficulty performing the necessary verifications.  Therefore when such an operation is indicated, it is invoked merely as "transport of structure" and the details left to the reader, if desired.

The second example also illustrates why "transport of structure" is not always desirable.  Namely, we can take ''M'' to be the plane, and we can take ''X'' to be an infinite one-sided cone.  By "flattening" the cone we achieve a homeomorphism of ''X'' and ''M'', and therefore the structure of a smooth manifold on ''X'', but the cone is not "naturally" a smooth manifold.  That is, we can consider ''X'' as a subspace of 3-space, in which context it is not smooth at the cone point.  A more surprising example is that of [[exotic sphere]]s, discovered by [[Milnor]], which states that there are exactly 28 smooth manifolds which are homeomorphic (but by definition ''not'' diffeomorphic) to &lt;math&gt;S^7&lt;/math&gt;, the 7-dimensional sphere in 8-space.  Thus, transport of structure is most productive when there exists a [[canonical form|canonical]] isomorphism between the two objects.
